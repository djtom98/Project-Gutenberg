Alice Madden,\r\naged nineteen, a plain, shy, gentle-mannered girl, short of stature,\r\nand in movement something less than graceful, wore a pleased look as\r\nshe glanced at her father\xe2\x80\x99s face and then turned her eyes across the\r\nblue channel to the Welsh hills. She was flattered by the confidence\r\nreposed in her, for Dr. Madden, reticent by nature, had never been\r\nknown to speak in the domestic circle about his pecuniary affairs. He\r\nseemed to be the kind of man who would inspire his children with\r\naffection: grave but benign, amiably diffident, with a hint of lurking\r\nmirthfulness about his eyes and lips. And to-day he was in the best of\r\nhumours; professional prospects, as he had just explained to Alice,\r\nwere more encouraging than hitherto; for twenty years he had practised\r\nmedicine at Clevedon, but with such trifling emolument that the needs\r\nof his large family left him scarce a margin over expenditure; now, at\r\nthe age of forty-nine\xe2\x80\x94it was 1872\xe2\x80\x94he looked forward with a larger\r\nhope. Might he not reasonably count on ten or fifteen more years of\r\nactivity? Clevedon was growing in repute as a seaside resort; new\r\nhouses were rising; assuredly his practice would continue to extend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think girls ought to be troubled about this kind of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded apologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cLet men grapple with the world; for, as the old\r\nhymn says, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis their nature to.\xe2\x80\x9d I should grieve indeed if I thought\r\nmy girls would ever have to distress themselves about money matters.\r\nBut I find I have got into the habit, Alice, of talking to you very\r\nmuch as I should talk with your dear mother if she were with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Madden, having given birth to six daughters, had fulfilled her\r\nfunction in this wonderful world; for two years she had been resting in\r\nthe old churchyard that looks upon the Severn sea. Father and daughter\r\nsighed as they recalled her memory. A sweet, calm, unpretending woman;\r\nadmirable in the domesticities; in speech and thought distinguished by\r\na native refinement, which in the most fastidious eyes would have\r\nestablished her claim to the title of lady. She had known but little\r\nrepose, and secret anxieties told upon her countenance long before the\r\nfinal collapse of health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the doctor\xe2\x80\x94doctor only by courtesy\xe2\x80\x94when he had\r\nstooped to pluck and examine a flower, \xe2\x80\x9cI made a point of never\r\ndiscussing these matters with her. As no doubt you guess, life has been\r\nrather an uphill journey with us. But the home must be guarded against\r\nsordid cares to the last possible moment; nothing upsets me more than\r\nthe sight of those poor homes where wife and children are obliged to\r\ntalk from morning to night of how the sorry earnings shall be laid out.\r\nNo, no; women, old or young, should never have to think about money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magnificent summer sunshine, and the western breeze that tasted of\r\nocean, heightened his natural cheeriness. Dr. Madden fell into a\r\nfamiliar strain of prescience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will come a day, Alice, when neither man nor woman is troubled\r\nwith such sordid care. Not yet awhile; no, no; but the day will come.\r\nHuman beings are not destined to struggle for ever like beasts of prey.\r\nGive them time; let civilization grow. You know what our poet says:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe quoted the couplet with a subdued fervour which characterized the\r\nman and explained his worldly lot. Elkanah Madden should never have\r\nentered the medical profession; mere humanitarianism had prompted the\r\nchoice in his dreamy youth; he became an empiric, nothing more. \xe2\x80\x9cOur\r\npoet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; Clevedon was chiefly interesting to him for its\r\nliterary associations. Tennyson he worshipped; he never passed\r\nColeridge\xe2\x80\x99s cottage without bowing in spirit. From the contact of\r\ncoarse actualities his nature shrank.\r\n\r\nWhen he and Alice returned from their walk it was the hour of family\r\ntea. A guest was present this afternoon; the eight persons who sat down\r\nto table were as many as the little parlour could comfortably contain.\r\nOf the sisters, next in age to Alice came Virginia, a pretty but\r\ndelicate girl of seventeen. Gertrude, Martha, and Isabel, ranging from\r\nfourteen to ten, had no physical charm but that of youthfulness; Isabel\r\nsurpassed her eldest sister in downright plainness of feature. The\r\nyoungest, Monica, was a bonny little maiden only just five years old,\r\ndark and bright-eyed.\r\n\r\nThe parents had omitted no care in shepherding their fold. Partly at\r\nhome, and partly in local schools, the young ladies had received\r\ninstruction suitable to their breeding, and the elder ones were\r\ndisposed to better this education by private study. The atmosphere of\r\nthe house was intellectual; books, especially the poets, lay in every\r\nroom. But it never occurred to Dr. Madden that his daughters would do\r\nwell to study with a professional object. In hours of melancholy he had\r\nof course dreaded the risks of life, and resolved, always with\r\npostponement, to make some practical provision for his family; in\r\neducating them as well as circumstances allowed, he conceived that he\r\nwas doing the next best thing to saving money, for, if a fatality\r\nbefell, teaching would always be their resource. The thought, however,\r\nof his girls having to work for money was so utterly repulsive to him\r\nthat he could never seriously dwell upon it. A vague piety supported\r\nhis courage. Providence would not deal harshly with him and his dear\r\nones. He enjoyed excellent health; his practice decidedly improved. The\r\none duty clearly before him was to set an example of righteous life,\r\nand to develop the girls\xe2\x80\x99 minds\xe2\x80\x94in every proper direction. For, as to\r\ntraining them for any path save those trodden by English ladies of the\r\nfamiliar type, he could not have dreamt of any such thing. Dr. Madden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhopes for the race were inseparable from a maintenance of morals and\r\nconventions such as the average man assumes in his estimate of women.\r\n\r\nThe guest at table was a young girl named Rhoda Nunn. Tall, thin,\r\neager-looking, but with promise of bodily vigour, she was singled at a\r\nglance as no member of the Madden family. Her immaturity (but fifteen,\r\nshe looked two years older) appeared in nervous restlessness, and in\r\nher manner of speaking, childish at times in the hustling of\r\ninconsequent thoughts, yet striving to imitate the talk of her seniors.\r\nShe had a good head, in both senses of the phrase; might or might not\r\ndevelop a certain beauty, but would assuredly put forth the fruits of\r\nintellect. Her mother, an invalid, was spending the summer months at\r\nClevedon, with Dr. Madden for medical adviser, and in this way the girl\r\nbecame friendly with the Madden household. Its younger members she\r\ntreated rather condescendingly; childish things she had long ago put\r\naway, and her sole pleasure was in intellectual talk. With a frankness\r\npeculiar to her, indicative of pride, Miss Nunn let it be known that\r\nshe would have to earn her living, probably as a school teacher; study\r\nfor examinations occupied most of her day, and her hours of leisure\r\nwere frequently spent either at the Maddens or with a family named\r\nSmithson\xe2\x80\x94people, these latter, for whom she had a profound and\r\nsomewhat mysterious admiration. Mr. Smithson, a widower with a\r\nconsumptive daughter, was a harsh-featured, rough-voiced man of about\r\nfive-and-thirty, secretly much disliked by Dr. Madden because of his\r\naggressive radicalism; if women\xe2\x80\x99s observation could be trusted, Rhoda\r\nNunn had simply fallen in love with him, had made him, perhaps\r\nunconsciously, the object of her earliest passion. Alice and Virginia\r\ncommented on the fact in their private colloquy with a shamefaced\r\namusement; they feared that it spoke ill for the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s breeding.\r\nNone the less they thought Rhoda a remarkable person, and listened to\r\nher utterances respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is your latest paradox, Miss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the doctor, with\r\ngrave facetiousness, when he had looked round the young faces at his\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I forget, doctor. Oh, but I wanted to ask you, Do you think\r\nwomen ought to sit in Parliament?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\xe2\x80\x9d was the response, as if after due consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\r\nare there at all they ought to stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get you to talk seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rhoda, with an air of\r\nvexation, whilst the others were good-naturedly laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Smithson\r\nthinks there ought to be female members of Parliament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he? Have the girls told you that there\xe2\x80\x99s a nightingale in Mr.\r\nWilliams\xe2\x80\x99s orchard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was always thus. Dr. Madden did not care to discuss even playfully\r\nthe radical notions which Rhoda got from her objectionable friend. His\r\ndaughters would not have ventured to express an opinion on such topics\r\nwhen he was present; apart with Miss Nunn, they betrayed a timid\r\ninterest in whatever proposition she advanced, but no gleam of\r\noriginality distinguished their arguments.\r\n\r\nAfter tea the little company fell into groups\xe2\x80\x94some out of doors\r\nbeneath the apple-trees, others near the piano at which Virginia was\r\nplaying Mendelssohn. Monica ran about among them with her five-year-old\r\nprattle, ever watched by her father, who lounged in a canvas chair\r\nagainst the sunny ivied wall, pipe in mouth. Dr. Madden was thinking\r\nhow happy they made him, these kind, gentle girls; how his love for\r\nthem seemed to ripen with every summer; what a delightful old age his\r\nwould be, when some were married and had children of their own, and the\r\nothers tended him\xe2\x80\x94they whom he had tended. Virginia would probably be\r\nsought in marriage; she had good looks, a graceful demeanour, a bright\r\nunderstanding. Gertrude also, perhaps. And little Monica\xe2\x80\x94ah, little\r\nMonica! she would be the beauty of the family. When Monica had grown up\r\nit would be time for him to retire from practice; by then he would\r\ndoubtless have saved money.\r\n\r\nHe must find more society for them; they had always been too much\r\nalone, whence their shyness among strangers. If their mother had but\r\nlived!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRhoda wishes you to read us something, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said his eldest girl,\r\nwho had approached whilst he was lost in dream.\r\n\r\nHe often read aloud to them from the poets; Coleridge and Tennyson by\r\npreference. Little persuasion was needed. Alice brought the volume, and\r\nhe selected \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lotus-Eaters.\xe2\x80\x9d The girls grouped themselves about him,\r\ndelighted to listen. Many an hour of summer evening had they thus\r\nspent, none more peaceful than the present. The reader\xe2\x80\x99s cadenced voice\r\nblended with the song of a thrush.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLet us alone.\r\n     Time driveth onward fast,\r\n     And in a little while our\r\n     lips are dumb.\r\n     Let us alone.\r\n     What is it that will last?\r\n     All things are taken from us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere came an interruption, hurried, peremptory. A farmer over at\r\nKingston Seymour had been seized with alarming illness; the doctor must\r\ncome at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry, girls. Tell James to put the horse in, sharp as he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes Dr. Madden was driving at full speed, alone in his\r\ndog-cart, towards the scene of duty.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Rhoda Nunn took leave, remarking with her usual\r\ndirectness, that before going home she would walk along the sea-front\r\nin the hope of a meeting with Mr. Smithson and his daughter. Mrs. Nunn\r\nwas not well enough to leave the house to-day; but, said Rhoda, the\r\ninvalid preferred being left alone at such times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure she prefers it?\xe2\x80\x9d Alice ventured to ask. The girl gave her\r\na look of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should mother say what she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was uttered with an ingenuousness which threw some light on Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nBy nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the younger trio of sisters had gone to bed; Alice,\r\nVirginia, and Gertrude sat in the parlour, occupied with books, from\r\ntime to time exchanging a quiet remark. A tap at the door scarcely drew\r\ntheir attention, for they supposed it was the maid-servant coming to\r\nlay supper. But when the door opened there was a mysterious silence;\r\nAlice looked up and saw the expected face, wearing, however, so strange\r\nan expression that she rose with sudden fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I speak to you, please, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dialogue out in the passage was brief. A messenger had just arrived\r\nwith the tidings that Dr. Madden, driving back from Kingston Seymour,\r\nhad been thrown from his vehicle and lay insensible at a roadside\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nFor some time the doctor had been intending to buy a new horse; his\r\nfaithful old roadster was very weak in the knees. As in other matters,\r\nso in this, postponement became fatality; the horse stumbled and fell,\r\nand its driver was flung head forward into the road. Some hours later\r\nthey brought him to his home, and for a day or two there were hopes\r\nthat he might rally. But the sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s respite only permitted him to\r\ndictate and sign a brief will; this duty performed, Dr. Madden closed\r\nhis lips for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nADRIFT\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas of 1887, a lady past her twenties, and with a\r\nlook of discouraged weariness on her thin face, knocked at a house-door\r\nin a little street by Lavender Hill. A card in the window gave notice\r\nthat a bedroom was here to let. When the door opened, and a clean,\r\ngrave, elderly woman presented herself, the visitor, regarding her\r\nanxiously, made known that she was in search of a lodging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be for a few weeks only, or it may be for a longer period,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid in a low, tired voice, with an accent of good breeding. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\ndifficulty in finding precisely what I want. One room would be\r\nsufficient, and I ask for very little attendance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had but one room to let, replied the other. It might be inspected.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs. The room was at the back of the house, small, but\r\nneatly furnished. Its appearance seemed to gratify the visitor, for she\r\nsmiled timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rent should you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would depend, mum, on what attendance was required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94of course. I think\xe2\x80\x94will you permit me to sit down? I am really\r\nvery tired. Thank you. I require very little attendance indeed. My ways\r\nare very simple. I should make the bed myself, and\xe2\x80\x94and, do the other\r\nlittle things that are necessary from day to day. Perhaps I might ask\r\nyou to sweep the room out\xe2\x80\x94once a week or so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady grew meditative. Possibly she had had experience of\r\nlodgers who were anxious to give as little trouble as possible. She\r\nglanced furtively at the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d was her question at length, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you be thinking of\r\npaying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I had better explain my position. For several years I have\r\nbeen companion to a lady in Hampshire. Her death has thrown me on my\r\nown resources\xe2\x80\x94I hope only for a short time. I have come to London\r\nbecause a younger sister of mine is employed here in a house of\r\nbusiness; she recommended me to seek for lodgings in this part; I might\r\nas well be near her whilst I am endeavouring to find another post;\r\nperhaps I may be fortunate enough to find one in London. Quietness and\r\neconomy are necessary to me. A house like yours would suit me very\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94very well indeed. Could we not agree upon terms within my\xe2\x80\x94within\r\nmy power?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the landlady pondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you be willing to pay five and sixpence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I would pay five and sixpence\xe2\x80\x94if you are quite sure that you\r\ncould let me live in my own way with satisfaction to yourself. I\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nfact, I am a vegetarian, and as the meals I take are so very simple, I\r\nfeel that I might just as well prepare them myself. Would you object to\r\nmy doing so in this room? A kettle and a saucepan are really\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94absolutely all\xe2\x80\x94that I should need to use. As I shall be much at\r\nhome, it will be of course necessary for me to have a fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the course of half an hour an agreement had been devised which\r\nseemed fairly satisfactory to both parties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not one of the graspin\xe2\x80\x99 ones,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the landlady. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\r\nmay say that of myself. If I make five or six shillings a week out of\r\nmy spare room, I don\xe2\x80\x99t grumble. But the party as takes it must do their\r\nduty on _their_ side. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me your name yet, mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madden. My luggage is at the railway station; it shall be brought\r\nhere this evening. And, as I am quite unknown to you, I shall be glad\r\nto pay my rent in advance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for that; but it\xe2\x80\x99s just as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will pay you five and sixpence at once. Be so kind as to let me\r\nhave a receipt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Miss Madden established herself at Lavender Hill, and dwelt there\r\nalone for three months.\r\n\r\nShe received letters frequently, but only one person called upon her.\r\nThis was her sister Monica, now serving at a draper\xe2\x80\x99s in Walworth Road.\r\nThe young lady came every Sunday, and in bad weather spent the whole\r\nday up in the little bedroom. Lodger and landlady were on remarkably\r\ngood terms; the one paid her dues with exactness, and the other did\r\nmany a little kindness not bargained for in the original contract.\r\n\r\nTime went on to the spring of \xe2\x80\x9988. Then, one afternoon, Miss Madden\r\ndescended to the kitchen and tapped in her usual timid way at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you at leisure, Mrs. Conisbee? Could I have a little conversation\r\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady was alone, and with no more engrossing occupation than the\r\nironing of some linen she had recently washed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have mentioned my elder sister now and then. I am sorry to say she\r\nis leaving her post with the family at Hereford. The children are going\r\nto school, so that her services are no longer needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, mum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. For a shorter or longer time she will be in need of a home. Now\r\nit has occurred to me, Mrs. Conisbee, that\xe2\x80\x94that I would ask you\r\nwhether you would have any objection to her sharing my room with me? Of\r\ncourse there must be an extra payment. The room is small for two\r\npersons, but then the arrangement would only be temporary. My sister is\r\na good and experienced teacher, and I am sure she will have no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining another engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Conisbee reflected, but without a shade of discontent. By this\r\ntime she knew that her lodger was thoroughly to be trusted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s if _you_ can manage, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see as I\r\ncould have any fault to find, if you thought you could both live in\r\nthat little room. And as for the rent, _I_ should be quite satisfied if\r\nwe said seven shillings instead of five and six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mrs. Conisbee; thank you very much indeed. I will write to\r\nmy sister at once; the news will be a great relief to her. We shall\r\nhave quite an enjoyable little holiday together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA week later the eldest of the three Miss Maddens arrived. As it was\r\nquite impossible to find space for her boxes in the bedroom, Mrs.\r\nConisbee allowed them to be deposited in the room occupied by her\r\ndaughter, which was on the same floor. In a day or two the sisters had\r\nbegun a life of orderly tenor. When weather permitted they were out\r\neither in the morning or afternoon. Alice Madden was in London for the\r\nfirst time; she desired to see the sights, but suffered the\r\nrestrictions of poverty and ill-health. After nightfall, neither she\r\nnor Virginia ever left home.\r\n\r\nThere was not much personal likeness between them.\r\n\r\nThe elder (now five-and-thirty) tended to corpulence, the result of\r\nsedentary life; she had round shoulders and very short legs. Her face\r\nwould not have been disagreeable but for its spoilt complexion; the\r\nhomely features, if health had but rounded and coloured them, would\r\nhave expressed pleasantly enough the gentleness and sincerity of her\r\ncharacter. Her cheeks were loose, puffy, and permanently of the hue\r\nwhich is produced by cold; her forehead generally had a few pimples;\r\nher shapeless chin lost itself in two or three fleshy fissures.\r\nScarcely less shy than in girlhood, she walked with a quick, ungainly\r\nmovement as if seeking to escape from some one, her head bent forward.\r\n\r\nVirginia (about thirty-three) had also an unhealthy look, but the\r\npoverty, or vitiation, of her blood manifested itself in less unsightly\r\nforms. One saw that she had been comely, and from certain points of\r\nview her countenance still had a grace, a sweetness, all the more\r\nnoticeable because of its threatened extinction. For she was rapidly\r\nageing; her lax lips grew laxer, with emphasis of a characteristic one\r\nwould rather not have perceived there; her eyes sank into deeper\r\nhollows; wrinkles extended their network; the flesh of her neck wore\r\naway. Her tall meagre body did not seem strong enough to hold itself\r\nupright.\r\n\r\nAlice had brown hair, but very little of it. Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s was inclined to\r\nbe ruddy; it surmounted her small head in coils and plaits not without\r\nbeauty. The voice of the elder sister had contracted an unpleasant\r\nhoarseness, but she spoke with good enunciation; a slight stiffness and\r\npedantry of phrase came, no doubt, of her scholastic habits. Virginia\r\nwas much more natural in manner and fluent in speech, even as she moved\r\nfar more gracefully.\r\n\r\nIt was now sixteen years since the death of Dr. Madden of Clevedon. The\r\nstory of his daughters\xe2\x80\x99 lives in the interval may be told with brevity\r\nsuitable to so unexciting a narrative.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s affairs were set in order, it was found that the\r\npatrimony of his six girls amounted, as nearly as possible, to eight\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nEight hundred pounds is, to be sure, a sum of money; but how, in these\r\ncircumstances, was it to be applied?\r\n\r\nThere came over from Cheltenham a bachelor uncle, aged about sixty.\r\nThis gentleman lived on an annuity of seventy pounds, which would\r\nterminate when _he_ did. It might be reckoned to him for righteousness\r\nthat he spent the railway fare between Cheltenham and Clevedon to\r\nattend his brother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, and to speak a kind word to his nieces.\r\nInfluence he had none; initiative, very little. There was no reckoning\r\nupon him for aid of any kind.\r\n\r\nFrom Richmond in Yorkshire, in reply to a letter from Alice, wrote an\r\nold, old aunt of the late Mrs. Madden, who had occasionally sent the\r\ngirls presents. Her communication was barely legible; it seemed to\r\ncontain fortifying texts of Scripture, but nothing in the way of\r\nworldly counsel. This old lady had no possessions to bequeath. And, as\r\nfar as the girls knew, she was their mother\xe2\x80\x99s only surviving relative.\r\n\r\nThe executor of the will was a Clevedon tradesman, a kind and capable\r\nfriend of the family for many years, a man of parts and attainments\r\nsuperior to his station. In council with certain other well-disposed\r\npersons, who regarded the Maddens\xe2\x80\x99 circumstances with friendly anxiety,\r\nMr. Hungerford (testamentary instruction allowing him much freedom of\r\naction) decided that the three elder girls must forthwith become\r\nself-supporting, and that the three younger should live together in the\r\ncare of a lady of small means, who offered to house and keep them for\r\nthe bare outlay necessitated. A prudent investment of the eight hundred\r\npounds might, by this arrangement, feed, clothe, and in some sort\r\neducate Martha, Isabel, and Monica. To see thus far ahead sufficed for\r\nthe present; fresh circumstances could be dealt with as they arose.\r\n\r\nAlice obtained a situation as nursery-governess at sixteen pounds a\r\nyear. Virginia was fortunate enough to be accepted as companion by a\r\ngentlewoman at Weston-super-Mare; her payment, twelve pounds. Gertrude,\r\nfourteen years old, also went to Weston, where she was offered\r\nemployment in a fancy-goods shop\xe2\x80\x94her payment nothing at all, but\r\nlodging, board, and dress assured to her.\r\n\r\nTen years went by, and saw many changes.\r\n\r\nGertrude and Martha were dead; the former of consumption, the other\r\ndrowned by the overturning of a pleasure-boat. Mr. Hungerford also was\r\ndead, and a new guardian administered the fund which was still a common\r\nproperty of the four surviving daughters. Alice plied her domestic\r\nteaching; Virginia remained a \xe2\x80\x9ccompanion.\xe2\x80\x9d Isabel, now aged twenty,\r\ntaught in a Board School at Bridgewater, and Monica, just fifteen, was\r\non the point of being apprenticed to a draper at Weston, where Virginia\r\nabode. To serve behind a counter would not have been Monica\xe2\x80\x99s choice if\r\nany more liberal employment had seemed within her reach. She had no\r\naptitude whatever for giving instruction; indeed, had no aptitude for\r\nanything but being a pretty, cheerful, engaging girl, much dependent on\r\nthe love and gentleness of those about her. In speech and bearing\r\nMonica greatly resembled her mother; that is to say, she had native\r\nelegance. Certainly it might be deemed a pity that such a girl could\r\nnot be introduced to one of the higher walks of life; but the time had\r\ncome when she must \xe2\x80\x9cdo something,\xe2\x80\x9d and the people to whose guidance she\r\nlooked had but narrow experience of life. Alice and Virginia sighed\r\nover the contrast with bygone hopes, but their own careers made it seem\r\nprobable that Monica would be better off \xe2\x80\x9cin business\xe2\x80\x9d than in a more\r\nstrictly genteel position. And there was every likelihood that, at such\r\na place as Weston, with her sister for occasional chaperon, she would\r\nere long find herself relieved of the necessity of working for a\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nTo the others, no wooer had yet presented himself. Alice, if she had\r\never dreamt of marriage, must by now have resigned herself to spinsterhood.\r\nVirginia could scarce hope that her faded prettiness, her\r\nhealth damaged by attendance upon an exacting invalid and in profitless\r\nstudy when she ought to have been sleeping, would attract any man in\r\nsearch of a wife. Poor Isabel was so extremely plain. Monica, if her\r\npromise were fulfilled, would be by far the best looking, as well as\r\nthe sprightliest, of the family. She must marry; of course she must\r\nmarry! Her sisters gladdened in the thought.\r\n\r\nIsabel was soon worked into illness. Brain trouble came on, resulting\r\nin melancholia. A charitable institution ultimately received her, and\r\nthere, at two-and-twenty, the poor hard-featured girl drowned herself\r\nin a bath.\r\n\r\nTheir numbers had thus been reduced by half. Up to now, the income of\r\ntheir eight hundred pounds had served, impartially, the ends now of\r\nthis, now of that one, doing a little good to all, saving them from\r\nmany an hour of bitterness which must else have been added to their\r\nlot. By a new arrangement, the capital was at length made over to Alice\r\nand Virginia jointly, the youngest sister having a claim upon them to\r\nthe extent of an annual nine pounds. A trifle, but it would buy her\r\nclothing\xe2\x80\x94and then Monica was sure to marry. Thank Heaven, she was sure\r\nto marry!\r\n\r\nWithout notable event, matrimonial or other, time went on to this\r\npresent year of 1888.\r\n\r\nLate in June, Monica would complete her twenty-first year; the elders,\r\nfull of affection for the sister, who so notably surpassed them in\r\nbeauty of person, talked much about her as the time approached,\r\ndevising how to procure her a little pleasure on her birthday. Virginia\r\nthought a suitable present would be a copy of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Christian Year\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has really no time for continuous reading. A verse of Keble\xe2\x80\x94just\r\none verse at bedtime and in the morning might be strength to the poor\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must join to buy it, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with anxious look. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be justifiable to spend more than two or three shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were preparing their midday meal, the substantial repast of the\r\nday. In a little saucepan on an oil cooking-stove was some plain rice,\r\nbubbling as Alice stirred it. Virginia fetched from downstairs (Mrs.\r\nConisbee had assigned to them a shelf in her larder) bread, butter,\r\ncheese, a pot of preserve, and arranged the table (three feet by one\r\nand a half) at which they were accustomed to eat. The rice being ready,\r\nit was turned out in two proportions; made savoury with a little\r\nbutter, pepper, and salt, it invited them to sit down.\r\n\r\nAs they had been out in the morning, the afternoon would be spent in\r\ndomestic occupations. The low cane-chair Virginia had appropriated to\r\nher sister, because of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s headaches and backaches, and other\r\ndisorders; she herself sat on an ordinary chair of the bedside species,\r\nto which by this time she had become used. Their sewing, when they did\r\nany, was strictly indispensable; if nothing demanded the needle, both\r\npreferred a book. Alice, who had never been a student in the proper\r\nsense of the word, read for the twentieth time a few volumes in her\r\npossession\xe2\x80\x94poetry, popular history, and half a dozen novels such as\r\nthe average mother of children would have approved in the governess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. With Virginia the case was somewhat different. Up to about her\r\ntwenty-fourth year she had pursued one subject with a zeal limited only\r\nby her opportunities; study absolutely disinterested, seeing that she\r\nhad never supposed it would increase her value as a \xe2\x80\x9ccompanion,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nenable her to take any better position. Her one intellectual desire was\r\nto know as much as possible about ecclesiastical history. Not in a\r\nspirit of fanaticism; she was devout, but in moderation, and never\r\nspoke bitterly on religious topics. The growth of the Christian Church,\r\nold sects and schisms, the Councils, affairs of Papal policy\xe2\x80\x94these\r\nthings had a very genuine interest for her; circumstances favouring,\r\nshe might have become an erudite woman; But the conditions were so far\r\nfrom favourable that all she succeeded in doing was to undermine her\r\nhealth. Upon a sudden breakdown there followed mental lassitude, from\r\nwhich she never recovered. It being subsequently her duty to read\r\nnovels aloud for the lady whom she \xe2\x80\x9ccompanioned,\xe2\x80\x9d new novels at the\r\nrate of a volume a day, she lost all power of giving her mind to\r\nanything but the feebler fiction. Nowadays she procured such works from\r\na lending library, on a subscription of a shilling a month. Ashamed at\r\nfirst to indulge this taste before Alice, she tried more solid\r\nliterature, but this either sent her to sleep or induced headache. The\r\nfeeble novels reappeared, and as Alice made no adverse comment, they\r\nsoon came and went with the old regularity.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon the sisters were disposed for conversation. The same\r\ngrave thought preoccupied both of them, and they soon made it their\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice began by murmuring, half absently, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon hear\r\nof something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am dreadfully uneasy on my own account,\xe2\x80\x9d her sister replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think the person at Southend won\xe2\x80\x99t write again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not. And she seemed so _very_ unsatisfactory. Positively\r\nilliterate\xe2\x80\x94oh, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear that.\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia gave a shudder as she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had accepted the place at\r\nPlymouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear! Five children and not a penny of salary. It was a\r\nshameless proposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the poor governess. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is so little\r\nchoice for people like myself. Certificates, and even degrees, are\r\nasked for on every hand. With nothing but references to past employers,\r\nwhat can one expect? I know it will end in my taking a place without\r\nsalary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople seem to have still less need of _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d lamented the companion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish now that I had gone to Norwich as lady-help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, your health would _never_ have supported it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Possibly the more active life might do me good. It\r\n_might_, you know, Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other admitted this possibility with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us review our position,\xe2\x80\x9d she then exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIt was a phrase frequently on her lips, and always made her more\r\ncheerful. Virginia also seemed to welcome it as an encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the companion, \xe2\x80\x9cis almost as serious as it could be. I\r\nhave only one pound left, with the exception of the dividend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have rather more than four pounds still. Now, let us think,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice\r\npaused. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing we neither of us obtain employment before the end of\r\nthis year. We have to live, in that case, more than six months\xe2\x80\x94you on\r\nseven pounds, and I on ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see. Put it in another form. We have both to live together on\r\nseventeen pounds. That is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she made a computation on a piece of\r\npaper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat is two pounds, sixteen shillings and eightpence a\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x94let us suppose this month at an end. That represents fourteen\r\nshillings and twopence a week. Yes, we can do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid down her pencil with an air of triumph. Her dull eyes\r\nbrightened as though she had discovered a new source of income.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Virginia in a subdued voice. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven shillings\r\nrent; that leaves only seven and twopence a week for\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x94everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _could_ do it, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the other. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it came to the very\r\nworst, our food need not cost more than sixpence a day\xe2\x80\x94three and\r\nsixpence a week. I do really believe, Virgie, we could support life on\r\nless\xe2\x80\x94say, on fourpence. Yes, we could dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked fixedly at each other, like people about to stake\r\neverything on their courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs such a life worthy of the name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Virginia in tones of awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t be driven to that. Oh, we certainly shall not. But it helps\r\none to know that, strictly speaking, we are _independent_ for another\r\nsix months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat word gave Virginia an obvious thrill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndependent! Oh, Alice, what a blessed thing is independence! Do you\r\nknow, my dear, I am afraid I have not exerted myself as I might have\r\ndone to find a new place. These comfortable lodgings, and the pleasure\r\nof seeing Monica once a week, have tempted me into idleness. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally my wish to be idle; I know the harm it does me; but oh! if one\r\ncould work in a home of one\xe2\x80\x99s own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice had a startled, apprehensive look, as if her sister were touching\r\non a subject hardly proper for discussion, or at least dangerous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s no use thinking of that, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use; no use whatever. I am wrong to indulge in such thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever happens, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice presently, with all the\r\nimpressiveness of tone she could command, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must never entrench upon\r\nour capital\xe2\x80\x94never\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never! If we grow old and useless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf no one will give us even board and lodging for our services\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we haven\xe2\x80\x99t a friend to look to,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice threw in, as though they\r\nwere answering each other in a doleful litany, \xe2\x80\x9cthen indeed we shall be\r\nglad that nothing tempted us to entrench on our capital! It would just\r\nkeep us\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her voice sank\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfrom the workhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this each took up a volume, and until teatime they read quietly.\r\n\r\nFrom six to nine in the evening they again talked and read alternately.\r\nTheir conversation was now retrospective; each revived memories of what\r\nshe had endured in one or the other house of bondage. Never had it been\r\ntheir lot to serve \xe2\x80\x9creally nice\xe2\x80\x9d people\xe2\x80\x94this phrase of theirs was\r\nanything but meaningless. They had lived with more or less well-to-do\r\nfamilies in the lower middle class\xe2\x80\x94people who could not have inherited\r\nrefinement, and had not acquired any, neither proletarians nor\r\ngentlefolk, consumed with a disease of vulgar pretentiousness, inflated\r\nwith the miasma of democracy. It would have been but a natural result\r\nof such a life if the sisters had commented upon it in a spirit\r\nsomewhat akin to that of their employers; but they spoke without\r\nrancour, without scandalmongering. They knew themselves superior to the\r\nwomen who had grudgingly paid them, and often smiled at recollections\r\nwhich would have moved the servile mind to venomous abuse.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock they took a cup of cocoa and a biscuit, and half an\r\nhour later they went to bed. Lamp oil was costly; and indeed they felt\r\nglad to say as early as possible that another day had gone by.\r\n\r\nTheir hour of rising was eight. Mrs. Conisbee provided hot water for\r\ntheir breakfast. On descending to fetch it, Virginia found that the\r\npostman had left a letter for her. The writing on the envelope seemed\r\nto be a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s. She ran upstairs again in excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can this be from, Alice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder sister had one of her headaches this morning; she was clay\r\ncolour, and tottered in moving about. The close atmosphere of the\r\nbedroom would alone have accounted for such a malady. But an unexpected\r\nletter made her for the moment oblivious of suffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPosted in London,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, examining the envelope eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one you have been in correspondence with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s months since I wrote to any one in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor full five minutes they debated the mystery, afraid of dashing their\r\nhopes by breaking the envelope. At length Virginia summoned courage.\r\nStanding at a distance from the other, she took out the sheet of paper\r\nwith tremulous hand, and glanced fearfully at the signature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _do_ you think? It\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Nunn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn! Never! How could she have got the address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the difficulty was discussed whilst its ready solution lay\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo read it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice at length, her throbbing head, made worse by\r\nthe agitation, obliging her to sink down into the chair.\r\n\r\nThe letter ran thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR Miss MADDEN,\xe2\x80\x94This morning I chanced to meet with Mrs. Darby, who\r\nwas passing through London on her way home from the seaside. We had\r\nonly five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 talk (it was at a railway station), but she\r\nmentioned that you were at present in London, and gave me your address.\r\nAfter all these years, how glad I should be to see you! The struggle of\r\nlife has made me selfish; I have neglected my old friends. And yet I am\r\nbound to add that some of _them_ have neglected _me_. Would you rather\r\nthat I came to your lodgings or you to mine? Which you like. I hear\r\nthat your elder sister is with you, and that Monica is also in London\r\nsomewhere. Do let us all see each other once more. Write as soon as you\r\ncan. My kindest regards to all of you.\xe2\x80\x94Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nRHODA NUNN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow like her,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Virginia, when she had read this aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nremember that perhaps we may not care to receive visitors! She was\r\nalways so thoughtful. And it is true that I _ought_ to have written to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall go to her, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, as she gives us the choice. How delightful! I wonder what she\r\nis doing? She writes cheerfully; I am sure she must be in a good\r\nposition. What is the address? Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, Chelsea. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not very far. We can walk there and back easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor several years they had lost sight of Rhoda Nunn. She left Clevedon\r\nshortly after the Maddens were scattered, and they heard she had become\r\na teacher. About the date of Monica\xe2\x80\x99s apprenticeship at Weston, Miss\r\nNunn had a chance meeting with Virginia and the younger girl; she was\r\nstill teaching, but spoke of her work with extreme discontent, and\r\nhinted at vague projects. Whether she succeeded in releasing herself\r\nthe Maddens never heard.\r\n\r\nIt was a morning of doubtful fairness. Before going to bed last night\r\nthey had decided to walk out together this morning and purchase the\r\npresent for Monica\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, which was next Sunday. But Alice felt\r\ntoo unwell to leave the house. Virginia should write a reply to Miss\r\nNunn\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and then go to the bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s alone.\r\n\r\nShe set forth at half-past nine. With extreme care she had preserved an\r\nout-of-doors dress into the third summer; it did not look shabby. Her\r\nmantle was in its second year only; the original fawn colour had gone\r\nto an indeterminate grey. Her hat of brown straw was a possession for\r\never; it underwent new trimming, at an outlay of a few pence, when that\r\nbecame unavoidable. Yet Virginia could not have been judged anything\r\nbut a lady. She wore her garments as only a lady can (the position and\r\nmovement of the arms has much to do with this), and had the step never\r\nto be acquired by a person of vulgar instincts.\r\n\r\nA very long walk was before her. She wished to get as far as the Strand\r\nbookshops, not only for the sake of choice, but because this region\r\npleased her and gave her a sense of holiday. Past Battersea Park, over\r\nChelsea Bridge, then the weary stretch to Victoria Station, and the\r\nupward labour to Charing Cross. Five miles, at least, measured by\r\npavement. But Virginia walked quickly; at half-past eleven she was\r\nwithin sight of her goal.\r\n\r\nA presentable copy of Keble\xe2\x80\x99s work cost less than she had imagined.\r\nThis rejoiced her. But after leaving the shop she had a singular\r\nexpression on her face\xe2\x80\x94something more than weariness, something less\r\nthan anxiety, something other than calculation. In front of Charing\r\nCross Station she stopped, looking vaguely about her. Perhaps she had\r\nit in her mind to return home by omnibus, and was dreading the expense.\r\nYet of a sudden she turned and went up the approach to the railway.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance again she stopped. Her features were now working in the\r\nstrangest way, as though a difficulty of breathing had assailed her. In\r\nher eyes was an eager yet frightened look; her lips stood apart.\r\n\r\nAnother quick movement, and she entered the station. She went straight\r\nto the door of the refreshment room, and looked in through the glass.\r\nTwo or three people were standing inside. She drew back, a tremor\r\npassing through her.\r\n\r\nA lady came out. Then again Virginia approached the door. Two men only\r\nwere within, talking together. With a hurried, nervous movement, she\r\npushed the door open and went up to a part of the counter as far as\r\npossible from the two customers. Bending forward, she said to the\r\nbarmaid in a voice just above a whisper,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly give me a little brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeads of perspiration were on her face, which had turned to a ghastly\r\npallor. The barmaid, concluding that she was ill, served her promptly\r\nand with a sympathetic look.\r\n\r\nVirginia added to the spirit twice its quantity of water, standing, as\r\nshe did so, half turned from the bar. Then she sipped hurriedly two or\r\nthree times, and at length took a draught. Colour flowed to her cheeks;\r\nher eyes lost their frightened glare. Another draught finished the\r\nstimulant. She hastily wiped her lips, and walked away with firm step.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a threatening cloud had passed from the sun; warm rays\r\nfell upon the street and its clamorous life. Virginia felt tired in\r\nbody, but a delightful animation, rarest of boons, gave her new\r\nstrength. She walked into Trafalgar Square and viewed it like a person\r\nwho stands there for the first time, smiling, interested. A quarter of\r\nan hour passed whilst she merely enjoyed the air, the sunshine, and the\r\nscene about her. Such a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x94so calm, contented,\r\nunconsciously hopeful\xe2\x80\x94as she had not known since Alice\xe2\x80\x99s coming to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nShe reached the house by half-past one, bringing in a paper bag\r\nsomething which was to serve for dinner. Alice had a wretched\r\nappearance; her head ached worse than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVirgie,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned, \xe2\x80\x9cwe never took account of illness, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we must keep that off,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, sitting down with a\r\nlook of exhaustion. She smiled, but no longer as in the sunlight of\r\nTrafalgar Square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I must struggle against it. We will have dinner as soon as\r\npossible. I feel faint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf both of them had avowed their faintness as often as they felt it,\r\nthe complaint would have been perpetual. But they generally made a\r\npoint of deceiving each other, and tried to delude themselves;\r\nprofessing that no diet could be better for their particular needs than\r\nthis which poverty imposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign to be hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbetter this afternoon, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice turned over \xe2\x80\x9cThe Christian Year,\xe2\x80\x9d and endeavoured to console\r\nherself out of it, whilst her sister prepared the meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAN INDEPENDENT WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia\xe2\x80\x99s reply to Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s letter brought another note next\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94Saturday. It was to request a call from the sisters that same\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nAlice, unfortunately, would not be able to leave home. Her disorder had\r\nbecome a feverish cold\xe2\x80\x94caught, doubtless, between open window and door\r\nwhilst the bedroom was being aired for breakfast. She lay in bed, and\r\nher sister administered remedies of the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s advising.\r\n\r\nBut she insisted on Virginia leaving her in the afternoon. Miss Nunn\r\nmight have something of importance to tell or to suggest. Mrs.\r\nConisbee, sympathetic in her crude way, would see that the invalid\r\nwanted for nothing.\r\n\r\nSo, after a dinner of mashed potatoes and milk (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Irish peasantry\r\nlive almost entirely on that,\xe2\x80\x9d croaked Alice, \xe2\x80\x9cand they are physically\r\na fine race\xe2\x80\x9d), the younger sister started on her walk to Chelsea. Her\r\ndestination was a plain, low roomy old house in Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, over\r\nagainst the hospital gardens. On asking for Miss Nunn, she was led to a\r\nback room on the ground floor, and there waited for a few moments.\r\nSeveral large bookcases, a well-equipped writing-table, and kindred\r\nobjects, indicated that the occupant of the house was studious; the\r\nnumerous bunches of cut flowers, which agreeably scented the air,\r\nseemed to prove the student was a woman.\r\n\r\nMiss Nunn entered. Younger only by a year or two than Virginia, she was\r\nyet far from presenting any sorrowful image of a person on the way to\r\nold-maidenhood. She had a clear though pale skin, a vigorous frame, a\r\nbrisk movement\xe2\x80\x94all the signs of fairly good health. Whether or not she\r\ncould be called a comely woman might have furnished matter for male\r\ndiscussion; the prevailing voice of her own sex would have denied her\r\ncharm of feature. At first view the countenance seemed masculine, its\r\nexpression somewhat aggressive\xe2\x80\x94eyes shrewdly observant and lips\r\nconsciously impregnable. But the connoisseur delayed his verdict. It\r\nwas a face that invited, that compelled, study. Self-confidence,\r\nintellectual keenness, a bright humour, frank courage, were traits\r\nlegible enough; and when the lips parted to show their warmth, their\r\nfullness, when the eyelids drooped a little in meditation, one became\r\naware of a suggestiveness directed not solely to the intellect, of\r\nsomething like an unfamiliar sexual type, remote indeed from the\r\nvoluptuous, but hinting a possibility of subtle feminine forces that\r\nmight be released by circumstance. She wore a black serge gown, with\r\nwhite collar and cuffs; her thick hair rippled low upon each side of\r\nthe forehead, and behind was gathered into loose vertical coils; in\r\nshadow the hue seemed black, but when illumined it was seen to be the\r\ndarkest, warmest brown.\r\n\r\nOffering a strong, shapely hand, she looked at her visitor with a smile\r\nwhich betrayed some mixture of pain in the hearty welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long have you been in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the tone of a busy, practical person. Her voice had not much\r\nsoftness of timbre, and perhaps on that account she kept it carefully\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as that? How I wish I had known you were so near! I have been\r\nin London myself about two years. And your sisters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia explained Alice\xe2\x80\x99s absence, adding,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for poor Monica, she has only Sunday free\xe2\x80\x94except one evening a\r\nmonth. She is at business till half-past nine, and on Saturday till\r\nhalf-past eleven or twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other rapidly, making a motion\r\nwith her hand as if to brush away something disagreeable. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will\r\nnever do. You must put a stop to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure we ought to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia\xe2\x80\x99s thin, timid voice and weak manner were thrown into painful\r\ncontrast by Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s personality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; we will talk about it presently. Poor little Monica! But do\r\ntell me about yourself and Miss Madden. It is so long since I heard\r\nabout you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I ought to have written. I remember that at the end of our\r\ncorrespondence I remained in your debt. But it was a troublesome and\r\ndepressing time with me. I had nothing but groans and moans to send.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay long, I trust, with that trying Mrs. Carr?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree years!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Virginia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, your patience!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to leave again and again. But at the end she always begged me\r\nnot to desert her\xe2\x80\x94that was how she put it. After all, I never had the\r\nheart to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery kind of you, but\xe2\x80\x94those questions are so difficult to decide.\r\nSelf-sacrifice may be quite wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Virginia anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am sure it is often wrong\xe2\x80\x94all the more so because people\r\nproclaim it a virtue without any reference to circumstances. Then how\r\ndid you get away at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor woman died. Then I had a place scarcely less disagreeable.\r\nNow I have none at all; but I really must find one very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed at this allusion to her poverty, and made nervous motions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you what my own course has been,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nunn, after a\r\nshort reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen my mother died, I determined to have done with\r\nteaching\xe2\x80\x94you know that. I disliked it too much, and partly, of course,\r\nbecause I was incapable. Half my teaching was a sham\xe2\x80\x94a pretence of\r\nknowing what I neither knew nor cared to know. I had gone into it like\r\nmost girls, as a dreary matter of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike poor Alice, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a distressing subject. When my mother left me that little sum\r\nof money I took a bold step. I went to Bristol to learn everything I\r\ncould that would help me out of school life. Shorthand, book-keeping,\r\ncommercial correspondence\xe2\x80\x94I had lessons in them all, and worked\r\ndesperately for a year. It did me good; at the end of the year I was\r\nvastly improved in health, and felt myself worth something in the\r\nworld. I got a place as cashier in a large shop. That soon tired me,\r\nand by dint of advertising I found a place in an office at Bath. It was\r\na move towards London, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest till I had come the whole\r\nway. My first engagement here was as shorthand writer to the secretary\r\nof a company. But he soon wanted some one who could use a typewriter.\r\nThat was a suggestion. I went to learn typewriting, and the lady who\r\ntaught me asked me in the end to stay with her as an assistant. This is\r\nher house, and here I live with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow energetic you have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate, perhaps. I must tell you about this lady\xe2\x80\x94Miss Barfoot.\r\nShe has private means\xe2\x80\x94not large, but sufficient to allow of her\r\ncombining benevolence with business. She makes it her object to train\r\nyoung girls for work in offices, teaching them the things that I learnt\r\nin Bristol, and typewriting as well. Some pay for their lessons, and\r\nsome get them for nothing. Our workrooms are in Great Portland Street,\r\nover a picture-cleaner\xe2\x80\x99s shop. One or two girls have evening lessons,\r\nbut our pupils for the most part are able to come in the day. Miss\r\nBarfoot hasn\xe2\x80\x99t much interest in the lower classes; she wishes to be of\r\nuse to the daughters of educated people. And she is of use. She is\r\ndoing admirable work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am sure she must be! What a wonderful person!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt occurs to me that she might help Monica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do you think she would?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Virginia, with eager attention.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow grateful we should be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Monica employed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt a draper\xe2\x80\x99s in Walworth Road. She is worked to death. Every week I\r\nsee a difference in her, poor child. We hoped to persuade her to go\r\nback to the shop at Weston; but if this you speak of were possible\xe2\x80\x94how\r\n_much_ better! We have never reconciled ourselves to her being in that\r\nposition\xe2\x80\x94never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no harm in the position itself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Nunn in her rather\r\nblunt tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I see a great deal in those outrageous hours. She\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t easily do better in London, without special qualifications; and\r\nprobably she is reluctant to go back to the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is; very reluctant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, with a nod. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you ask her to\r\ncome and see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA servant entered with tea. Miss Nunn caught the expression in her\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and said cheerfully\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no midday meal to-day, and really I feel the omission. Mary,\r\nplease do put tea in the dining-room, and bring up some meat\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nBarfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in explanation to Virginia, \xe2\x80\x9cis out of town, and I\r\nam a shockingly irregular person about meals. I am sure you will sit\r\ndown with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia sported with the subject. Months of miserable eating and\r\ndrinking in her stuffy bedroom made an invitation such as this a\r\nveritable delight to her. Seated in the dining-room, she at first\r\nrefused the offer of meat, alleging her vegetarianism; but Miss Nunn,\r\nconvinced that the poor woman was starving, succeeded in persuading\r\nher. A slice of good beef had much the same effect upon Virginia as her\r\nmore dangerous indulgence at Charing Cross Station. She brightened\r\nwonderfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us go back to the library,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nunn, when their meal\r\nwas over. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon see each other again, I hope, but we might as\r\nwell talk of serious things whilst we have the opportunity. Will you\r\nallow me to be very frank with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other looked startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could you possibly say that would offend me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the old days you told me all about your circumstances. Are they\r\nstill the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely the same. Most happily, we have never needed to entrench\r\nupon our capital. Whatever happens, we must avoid that\xe2\x80\x94whatever\r\nhappens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand you. But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be possible to make a better\r\nuse of that money? It is eight hundred pounds, I think? Have you never\r\nthought of employing it in some practical enterprise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia at first shrank in alarm, then trembled deliciously at her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s bold views.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be possible? Really? You think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only suggest, of course. One mustn\xe2\x80\x99t argue about others from\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own habit of thought. Heaven forbid\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this sounded rather profane\r\nto the listener\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat I should urge you to do anything you would think\r\nrash. But how much better if you could somehow secure independence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if we could! The very thing we were saying the other day! But how?\r\nI have no idea how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nunn seemed to hesitate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t advise. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t give any weight to what I say, except in\r\nso far as your own judgment approves it. But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t one open a\r\npreparatory school, for instance? At Weston, suppose, where already you\r\nknow a good many people. Or even at Clevedon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia drew in her breath, and it was easy for Miss Nunn to perceive\r\nthat the proposal went altogether beyond her friend\xe2\x80\x99s scope.\r\nImpossible, perhaps, to inspire these worn and discouraged women with a\r\nparticle of her own enterprise. Perchance they altogether lacked\r\nability to manage a school for even the youngest children. She did not\r\npress the subject; it might come up on another occasion. Virginia\r\nbegged for time to think it over; then, remembering her invalid sister,\r\nfelt that she must not prolong the visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo take some of these flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nunn, collecting a rich\r\nnosegay from the vases. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them be my message to your sister. And I\r\nshould be so glad to see Monica. Sunday is a good time; I am always at\r\nhome in the afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a fluttering heart Virginia made what haste she could homewards.\r\nThe interview had filled her with a turmoil of strange new thoughts,\r\nwhich she was impatient to pour forth for Alice\xe2\x80\x99s wondering comment. It\r\nwas the first time in her life that she had spoken with a woman daring\r\nenough to think and act for herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMONICA\xe2\x80\x99S MAJORITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the drapery establishment where Monica Madden worked and lived it\r\nwas not (as is sometimes the case) positively forbidden to the resident\r\nemployees to remain at home on Sunday; but they were strongly\r\nrecommended to make the utmost possible use of that weekly vacation.\r\nHerein, no doubt, appeared a laudable regard for their health. Young\r\npeople, especially young women, who are laboriously engaged in a shop\r\nfor thirteen hours and a half every weekday, and on Saturday for an\r\naverage of sixteen, may be supposed to need a Sabbath of open air.\r\nMessrs. Scotcher and Co. acted like conscientious men in driving them\r\nforth immediately after breakfast, and enjoining upon them not to\r\nreturn until bedtime. By way of well-meaning constraint, it was\r\ndirected that only the very scantiest meals (plain bread and cheese, in\r\nfact) should be supplied to those who did not take advantage of the\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Scotcher and Co. were large-minded men. Not only did they\r\ninsist that the Sunday ought to be used for bodily recreation, but they\r\nhad no objection whatever to their young friends taking a stroll after\r\nclosing-time each evening. Nay, so generous and confiding were they,\r\nthat to each young person they allowed a latchkey. The air of Walworth\r\nRoad is pure and invigorating about midnight; why should the reposeful\r\nramble be hurried by consideration for weary domestics?\r\n\r\nMonica always felt too tired to walk after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock; moreover, the\r\nusual conversation in the dormitory which she shared with five other\r\nyoung women was so little to her taste that she wished to be asleep\r\nwhen the talkers came up to bed. But on Sunday she gladly followed the\r\ncounsel of her employers. If the weather were bad, the little room at\r\nLavender Hill offered her a retreat; when the sun shone, she liked to\r\nspend a part of the day in free wandering about London, which even yet\r\nhad not quite disillusioned her.\r\n\r\nAnd to-day it shone brightly. This was her birthday, the completion of\r\nher one-and-twentieth year. Alice and Virginia of course expected her\r\nearly in the morning, and of course they were all to dine together\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthe table measuring three feet by one and a half; but the afternoon and\r\nevening she must have to herself. The afternoon, because a few hours of\r\nher sisters\xe2\x80\x99 talk invariably depressed her; and the evening, because\r\nshe had an appointment to keep. As she left the big ugly\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cestablishment\xe2\x80\x9d her heart beat cheerfully, and a smile fluttered about\r\nher lips. She did not feel very well, but that was a matter of course;\r\nthe ride in an omnibus would perhaps make her head clearer.\r\n\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s face was of a recognized type of prettiness; a pure oval; from\r\nthe smooth forehead to the dimpled little chin all its lines were soft\r\nand graceful. Her lack of colour, by heightening the effect of black\r\neyebrows and darkly lustrous eyes, gave her at present a more spiritual\r\ncast than her character justified; but a thoughtful firmness was native\r\nto her lips, and no possibility of smirk or simper lurked in the\r\nattractive features. The slim figure was well fitted in a costume of\r\npale blue, cheap but becoming; a modest little hat rested on her black\r\nhair; her gloves and her sunshade completed the dainty picture.\r\n\r\nAn omnibus would be met in Kennington Park Road. On her way thither, in\r\na quiet cross-street, she was overtaken by a young man who had left the\r\nhouse of business a moment after her, and had followed at a short\r\ndistance timidly. A young man of unhealthy countenance, with a red\r\npimple on the side of his nose, but not otherwise ill-looking. He was\r\nclad with propriety\xe2\x80\x94stove-pipe hat, diagonal frockcoat, grey trousers,\r\nand he walked with a springy gait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madden\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had ventured, with perturbation in his face, to overtake Monica.\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Mr. Bullivant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone was far from encouraging, but the young man smiled upon her\r\nwith timorous tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beautiful morning! Are you going far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had the Cockney accent, but not in an offensive degree; his manners\r\nwere not flagrantly of the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; some distance.\xe2\x80\x9d Monica walked slowly on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you allow me to walk a little way with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded, bending\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take the omnibus at the end of this street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went forward together. Monica no longer smiled, but neither did\r\nshe look angry. Her expression was one of trouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall _you_ spend the day, Mr. Bullivant?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at length,\r\nwith an effort to seem unconcerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it would be very nice up the river.\xe2\x80\x9d And she added\r\ndiffidently, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Eade is going to Richmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied vaguely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least she wished to go\xe2\x80\x94if she could find a companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she will enjoy herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bullivant, with careful\r\ncivility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of course she won\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy it very much if she has to go alone. As\r\nyou have no particular engagement, Mr. Bullivant, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be kind\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was incomplete, but intelligible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask Miss Eade to let me accompany her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think you could. She would like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica looked rather frightened at her boldness, and quickly added\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must say good-bye. There comes the bus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBullivant turned desperately in that direction. He saw there was as yet\r\nno inside passenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo allow me to go a short way with you?\xe2\x80\x9d burst from his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npositively don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I shall spend the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica had signalled to the driver, and was hurrying forward. Bullivant\r\nfollowed, reckless of consequences. In a minute both were seated within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the young fellow, remarking a look of\r\nserious irritation on his companion\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be with you a few\r\nminutes longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think when I have begged you not to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how bad my behaviour must seem. But, Miss Madden, may I not be\r\non terms of friendship with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you may\xe2\x80\x94but you are not content with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94indeed\xe2\x80\x94I _will_ be content\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s foolish to say so. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you broken the understanding three or\r\nfour times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bus stopped for a passenger, a man, who mounted to the top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Bullivant, as the starting horses jolted them\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cI try not to worry you. Think of my position. You have told\r\nme that there is no one else who\xe2\x80\x94whose rights I ought to respect.\r\nFeeling as I do, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t in human nature to give up hope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will you let me ask you a rude question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me _any_ question, Miss Madden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would it be possible for you to support a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed and smiled. Bullivant, dreadfully discomposed, did not move\r\nhis eyes from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be possible for some time,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered in a thick voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing but my wretched salary. But every one hopes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reasonable hope have you?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica urged, forcing herself to be\r\ncruel, because it seemed the only way of putting an end to this\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there are so many opportunities in our business. I could point to\r\nhalf a dozen successful men who were at the counter a few years ago. I\r\nmay become a walker, and get at least three pounds a week. If I were\r\nlucky enough to be taken on as a buyer, I might make\xe2\x80\x94why, some make\r\nmany hundreds a year\xe2\x80\x94many hundreds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would ask me to wait on and on for one of these wonderful\r\nchances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could move your feelings, Miss Madden,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, with a certain\r\ndolorous dignity; but there his voice broke. He saw too plainly that\r\nthe girl had neither faith in him nor liking for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bullivant, I think you ought to wait until you really have\r\nprospects. If you were encouraged by some person, it would be a\r\ndifferent thing. And indeed you haven\xe2\x80\x99t to look far. But where there\r\nhas never been the slightest encouragement, you are really wrong to act\r\nin this way. A long engagement, where everything remains doubtful for\r\nyears, is so wretched that\xe2\x80\x94oh, if I were a man, I would _never_ try to\r\npersuade a girl into that! I think it wrong and cruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stroke was effectual. Bullivant averted his face, naturally\r\nwoebegone, and sat for some minutes without speaking. The bus again\r\ndrew up; four or five people were about to ascend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say good-morning, Miss Madden,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered hurriedly.\r\n\r\nShe gave her hand, glanced at him with embarrassment, and so let him\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\nTen minutes restored the mood in which she had set out. Once more she\r\nsmiled to herself. Indeed, her head was better for the fresh air and\r\nthe movement. If only the sisters would allow her to get away soon\r\nafter dinner!\r\n\r\nIt was Virginia who opened the door to her, and embraced and kissed her\r\nwith wonted fondness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are nice and early! Poor Alice has been in bed since the day\r\nbefore yesterday; a dreadful cold and one of her very worst headaches.\r\nBut I think she is a little better this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice\xe2\x80\x94a sad spectacle\xe2\x80\x94was propped up on pillows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice barely audible. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t risk getting a sore throat. How well you look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look _well_,\xe2\x80\x9d corrected Virginia; \xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps\r\nshe has a little more colour than of late. Monica, dear, as Alice can\r\nhardly use her voice, I will speak for both of us, and wish you many,\r\nmany happy returns of the day. And we ask you to accept this little\r\nbook from us. It may be a comfort to you from time to time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good, kind dears!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monica, kissing the one on the lips\r\nand the other on her thinly-tressed head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use saying you\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have spent money on me; you _will_ always do it. What a\r\nnice \xe2\x80\x9cChristian Year\xe2\x80\x9d! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to read some of it now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a half-guilty air, Virginia then brought from some corner of the\r\nroom a very small but delicate currant cake. Monica must eat a mouthful\r\nof this; she always had such a wretched breakfast, and the journey from\r\nWalworth Road was enough to give an appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are ruining yourselves, foolish people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others exchanged a look, and smiled with such a strange air that\r\nMonica could not but notice it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s good news. You have found something, and\r\nbetter than usual Virgie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so. Who knows? Eat your slice of cake like a good child, and\r\nthen I shall have something to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObviously the two were excited. Virginia moved about with the recovered\r\nstep of girlhood, held herself upright, and could not steady her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would never guess whom I have seen,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, when Monica was\r\nquite ready to listen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a letter the other morning which did\r\npuzzle us so\xe2\x80\x94I mean the writing before we opened it. And it was\r\nfrom\xe2\x80\x94Miss Nunn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis name did not greatly stir Monica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had quite lost sight of her, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose we should ever hear of her again. But nothing\r\nmore fortunate could have happened. My dear, she is wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt considerable length Virginia detailed all she had learnt of Miss\r\nNunn\xe2\x80\x99s career, and described her present position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be the most valuable friend to us. Oh, her strength, her\r\nresolution! The way in which she discovers the right thing to do! You\r\nare to call upon her as soon as possible. This very after noon you had\r\nbetter go. She will relieve you from all your troubles darling. Her\r\nfriend, Miss Barfoot, will teach you typewriting, and put you in the\r\nway of earning an easy and pleasant livelihood. She will, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how long does it take?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the astonished girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite a short time, I should think. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of details;\r\nthey were postponed. You will hear everything yourself. And she\r\nsuggested all sorts of ways,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Virginia, with quite\r\nunintentional exaggeration, \xe2\x80\x9cin which we could make better use of our\r\ninvested money. She is _full_ of practical expedients. The most\r\nwonderful person! She is quite like a _man_ in energy and resources. I\r\nnever imagined that one of our sex could resolve and plan and act as\r\nshe does!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica inquired anxiously what the projects for improving their income\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is decided yet,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply, given with a confident smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us first of all put _you_ in comfort and security; that is the\r\nimmediate need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listener was interested, but did not show any eagerness for the\r\nchange proposed. Presently she stood at the window and lost herself in\r\nthought. Alice gave signs of an inclination to doze; she had had a\r\nsleepless night, in spite of soporifics. Though no sun entered the\r\nroom, it was very hot, and the presence of a third person made the air\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think we might go out for half an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica whispered,\r\nwhen Virginia had pointed to the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s closed eves. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery unhealthy for us all to be in this little place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to leave her,\xe2\x80\x9d the other whispered back. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I certainly\r\nthink it would be better for you to have fresh air. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like\r\nto go to church, dear? The bells haven\xe2\x80\x99t stopped yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder sisters were not quite regular in their church-going. When\r\nweather or lassitude kept them at home on Sunday morning they read the\r\nservice aloud. Monica found the duty of listening rather grievous.\r\nDuring the months that she was alone in London she had fallen into\r\nneglect of public worship; not from any conscious emancipation, but\r\nbecause her companions at the house of business never dreamt of\r\nentering a church, and their example by degrees affected her with\r\ncarelessness. At present she was glad of the pretext for escaping until\r\ndinner-time.\r\n\r\nShe went forth with the intention of deceiving her sisters, of walking\r\nto Clapham Common, and on her return inventing some sermon at a church\r\nthe others never visited. But before she had gone many yards conscience\r\novercame her. Was she not getting to be a very lax-minded girl? And it\r\nwas shameful to impose upon the two after their loving-kindness to her.\r\nAs usual, her little prayer-book was in her pocket. She walked quickly\r\nto the familiar church, and reached it just as the doors were being\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nOf all the congregation she probably was the one who went through the\r\nservice most mechanically. Not a word reached her understanding.\r\nSitting, standing, or on her knees, she wore the same preoccupied look,\r\nwith ever and again a slight smile or a movement of the lips, as if she\r\nwere recalling some conversation of special interest.\r\n\r\nLast Sunday she had had an adventure, the first of any real moment that\r\nhad befallen her in London. She had arranged to go with Miss Eade on a\r\nsteamboat up the river. They were to meet at the Battersea Park\r\nlanding-stage at half-past two. But Miss Eade did not keep her\r\nappointment, and Monica, unwilling to lose the trip, started alone.\r\n\r\nShe disembarked at Richmond and strayed about for an hour or two, then\r\nhad a cup of tea and a bun. As it was still far too early to return,\r\nshe went down to the riverside and seated herself on one of the\r\nbenches. Many boats were going by, a majority of them containing only\r\ntwo persons\xe2\x80\x94a young man who pulled, and a girl who held the strings of\r\nthe tiller. Some of these couples Monica disregarded; but occasionally\r\nthere passed a skiff from which she could not take her eyes. To lie\r\nback like that on the cushions and converse with a companion who had\r\nnothing of the _shop_ about him!\r\n\r\nIt seemed hard that she must be alone. Poor Mr. Bullivant would gladly\r\nhave taken her on the river; but Mr. Bullivant\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nShe thought of her sisters. Their loneliness was for life, poor things.\r\nAlready they were old; and they would grow older, sadder, perpetually\r\nstruggling to supplement that dividend from the precious capital\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nmerely that they might keep alive. Oh!\xe2\x80\x94her heart ached at the misery\r\nof such a prospect. How much better if the poor girls had never been\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nHer own future was more hopeful than theirs had ever been. She knew\r\nherself good-looking. Men had followed her in the street and tried to\r\nmake her acquaintance. Some of the girls with whom she lived regarded\r\nher enviously, spitefully. But had she really the least chance of\r\nmarrying a man whom she could respect\xe2\x80\x94not to say love?\r\n\r\nOne-and-twenty a week hence. At Weston she had kept tolerable health,\r\nbut certainly her constitution was not strong, and the slavery of\r\nWalworth Road threatened her with premature decay. Her sisters\r\ncounselled wisely. Coming to London was a mistake. She would have had\r\nbetter chances at Weston, notwithstanding the extreme discretion with\r\nwhich she was obliged to conduct herself.\r\n\r\nWhile she mused thus, a profound discouragement settling on her sweet\r\nface, some one took a seat by her\xe2\x80\x94on the same bench, that is to say.\r\nGlancing aside, she saw that it was an oldish man, with grizzled\r\nwhiskers and rather a stern visage. Monica sighed.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that he had heard her? He looked this way, and with\r\ncuriosity. Ashamed of herself, she kept her eyes averted for a long\r\ntime. Presently, following the movement of a boat, her face turned\r\nunconsciously towards the silent companion; again he was looking at\r\nher, and he spoke. The gravity of his appearance and manner, the\r\ngood-natured commonplace that fell from his lips, could not alarm her;\r\na dialogue began, and went on for about half an hour.\r\n\r\nHow old might he be? After all, he was probably not fifty\xe2\x80\x94perchance\r\nnot much more than forty. His utterance fell short of perfect\r\nrefinement, but seemed that of an educated man. And certainly his\r\nclothes were such as a gentleman wears. He had thin, hairy hands,\r\nunmarked by any effect of labour; the nails could not have been better\r\ncared for. Was it a bad sign that he carried neither gloves nor\r\nwalking-stick?\r\n\r\nHis talk aimed at nothing but sober friendliness; it was perfectly\r\ninoffensive\xe2\x80\x94indeed, respectful. Now and then\xe2\x80\x94not too often\xe2\x80\x94he fixed\r\nhis eyes upon her for an instant. After the introductory phrases, he\r\nmentioned that he had had a long drive, alone; his horse was baiting in\r\npreparation for the journey back to London. He often took such drives\r\nin the summer, though generally on a weekday; the magnificent sky had\r\ntempted him out this morning. He lived at Herne Hill.\r\n\r\nAt length he ventured a question. Monica affected no reluctance to tell\r\nhim that she was in a house of business, that she had relatives in\r\nLondon, that only by chance she found herself alone to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry if I never saw you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words he uttered with embarrassment, his eyes on the ground.\r\nMonica could only keep silence. Half an hour ago she would not have\r\nthought it possible for any remark of this man\xe2\x80\x99s seriously to occupy\r\nher mind, yet now she waited for the next sentence in discomposure\r\nwhich was quite free from resentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe meet in this casual way, and talk, and then say good-bye. Why\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you that you interest me very much, and that I am afraid\r\nto trust only to chance for another meeting? If you were a man\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsmiled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI should give you my card, and ask you to my house. The card I\r\nmay at all events offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking, he drew out a little case, and laid a visiting-card on\r\nthe bench within Monica\xe2\x80\x99s reach. Murmuring her \xe2\x80\x9cthank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she took\r\nthe bit of pasteboard, but did not look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are on my side of the river,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, still with scrupulous\r\nmodesty of tone. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I not hope to see you some day, when you are\r\nwalking? All days and times are the same to me; but I am afraid it is\r\nonly on Sunday that you are at leisure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, only on a Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt took a long time, and many circumlocutions, but in the end an\r\nappointment was made. Monica would see her acquaintance next Sunday\r\nevening on the river front of Battersea Park; if it rained, then the\r\nSunday after. She was ashamed and confused. Other girls were constantly\r\ndoing this kind of thing\xe2\x80\x94other girls in business; but it seemed to put\r\nher on the level of a servant. And why had she consented? The man could\r\nnever be anything to her; he was too old, too hard-featured, too grave.\r\nWell, on that very account there would be no harm in meeting him. In\r\ntruth, she had not felt the courage to refuse; in a manner he had\r\noverawed her.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps she would not keep the engagement. Nothing compelled her.\r\nShe had not told him her name, nor the house where she was employed.\r\nThere was a week to think it over.\r\n\r\nAll days and times were the same to him\xe2\x80\x94he said. And he drove about\r\nthe country for his pleasure. A man of means. His name, according to\r\nthe card, was Edmund Widdowson.\r\n\r\nHe was upright in his walk, and strongly built. She noticed this as he\r\nmoved away from her. Fearful lest he should turn round, her eyes\r\nglanced at his figure from moment to moment. But he did not once look\r\nback.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now to God the Father.\xe2\x80\x9d The bustle throughout the church wakened\r\nher from reverie so complete that she knew not a syllable of the\r\nsermon. After all she must deceive her sisters by inventing a text, and\r\nperhaps a comment.\r\n\r\nBy an arrangement with Mrs. Conisbee, dinner was down in the parlour\r\nto-day. A luxurious meal, moreover; for in her excitement Virginia had\r\nresolved to make a feast of Monica\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. There was a tiny piece\r\nof salmon, a dainty cutlet, and a cold blackcurrant tart. Virginia, at\r\nhome a constant vegetarian, took no share of the fish and meat\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas only enough for one person. Alice, alone upstairs, made a dinner of\r\ngruel.\r\n\r\nMonica was to be at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, Chelsea, by three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The\r\nsisters hoped she would return to Lavender Hill with her news, but that\r\nwas left uncertain\xe2\x80\x94by Monica herself purposely. As an amusement, she\r\nhad decided to keep her promise to Mr. Edmund Widdowson. She was\r\ncurious to see him again, and receive a new impression of his\r\npersonality. If he behaved as inoffensively as at Richmond,\r\nacquaintance with him might be continued for the variety it brought\r\ninto her life. If anything unpleasant happened, she had only to walk\r\naway. The slight, very slight, tremor of anticipation was reasonably to\r\nbe prized by a shop-girl at Messrs. Scotcher\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nDrawing near to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road\xe2\x80\x94the wrapped-up Keble in her hand\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nbegan to wonder whether Miss Nunn would have any serious proposal to\r\noffer. Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s report and ecstatic forecasts were, she knew, not\r\ncompletely trustworthy; though more than ten years her sister\xe2\x80\x99s junior,\r\nMonica saw the world with eyes much less disposed to magnify and colour\r\nordinary facts.\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot was still from home. Rhoda Nunn received the visitor in a\r\npleasant, old-fashioned drawing-room, where there was nothing costly,\r\nnothing luxurious; yet to Monica it appeared richly furnished. A sense\r\nof strangeness amid such surroundings had more to do with her\r\nconstrained silence for the first few minutes than the difficulty with\r\nwhich she recognized in this lady before her the Miss Nunn whom she had\r\nknown years ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should never have known you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, equally surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\none thing, you look like a fever patient just recovering. What can be\r\nexpected? Your sister gave me a shocking account of how you live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work is very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreposterous. Why do you stay at such a place, Monica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am getting experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be used in the next world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madden is better to-day, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice? Not much, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me something more about the \xe2\x80\x9cexperience\xe2\x80\x9d you are\r\ngetting? For instance, what time is given you for meals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda Nunn was not the person to manufacture light gossip when a matter\r\nof the gravest interest waited for discussion. With a face that\r\nexpressed thoughtful sympathy, she encouraged the girl to speak and\r\nconfide in her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s twenty minutes for each meal,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica explained; \xe2\x80\x9cbut at\r\ndinner and tea one is very likely to be called into the shop before\r\nfinishing. If you are long away you find the table cleared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming arrangement! No sitting down behind the counter, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course not. We suffer a great deal from that. Some of us get\r\ndiseases. A girl has just gone to the hospital with varicose veins, and\r\ntwo or three others have the same thing in a less troublesome form.\r\nSometimes, on Saturday night, I lose all feeling in my feet; I have to\r\nstamp on the floor to be sure it\xe2\x80\x99s still under me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that Saturday night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough now; but at Christmas! There was a week or more\r\nof Saturday night\xe2\x80\x94going on to one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. A girl by me\r\nwas twice carried out fainting, one night after another. They gave her\r\nbrandy, and she came back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey compelled her to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, it was her own wish. Her \xe2\x80\x9cbook of takings\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very good,\r\npoor thing, and if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up to a certain figure at the end of\r\nthe week she would lose her place. She lost it after all. They told her\r\nshe was too weak. After Christmas she was lucky enough to get a place\r\nas a lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid at twenty-five pounds a year\xe2\x80\x94at Scotcher\xe2\x80\x99s she had\r\nfifteen. But we heard that she burst a blood-vessel, and now she\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthe hospital at Brompton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelightful story! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you an early-closing day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had before I went there; but only for about three months. Then\r\nthe agreement broke down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike the assistants. A pity the establishment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow suit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Miss Nunn, if you knew how terribly hard it\r\nis for many girls to find a place, even now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it perfectly well. And I wish it were harder. I wish girls fell\r\ndown and died of hunger in the streets, instead of creeping to their\r\ngarrets and the hospitals. I should like to see their dead bodies\r\ncollected together in some open place for the crowd to stare at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica gazed at her with wide eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, I suppose, that people would try to reform things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows? Perhaps they might only congratulate each other that a few\r\nof the superfluous females had been struck off. Do they give you any\r\nsummer holiday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA week, with salary continued.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? With salary continued? That takes one\xe2\x80\x99s breath away.\xe2\x80\x94Are many\r\nof the girls ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, at Scotcher\xe2\x80\x99s. They nearly all come from the country. Several\r\nare daughters of small farmers and those are dreadfully ignorant. One\r\nof them asked me the other day in what country Africa was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t find them very pleasant company?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne or two are nice quiet girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda drew a deep sigh, and moved with impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve had about enough of it\xe2\x80\x94experience and\r\nall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might go into a country business: it would be easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for the thought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish now they had brought me up to something different. Alice and\r\nVirginia were afraid of having me trained for a school; you remember\r\nthat one of our sisters who went through it died of overwork. And I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot clever, Miss Nunn. I never did much at school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda regarded her, smiling gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no inclination to study now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, looking away. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I should\r\nlike to be better educated, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could study seriously,\r\nto earn my living by it. The time for that has gone by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so. But there are things you might manage. No doubt your\r\nsister told you how I get my living. There\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal of employment\r\nfor women who learn to use a typewriter. Did you ever have piano\r\nlessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more did I, and I was sorry for it when I went to typewriting. The\r\nfingers have to be light and supple and quick. Come with me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow you one of the machines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to a room downstairs\xe2\x80\x94a bare little room by the library. Here\r\nwere two Remingtons, and Rhoda patiently explained their use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must practise until one can do fifty words a minute at least. I\r\nknow one or two people who have reached almost twice that speed. It\r\ntakes a good six months\xe2\x80\x99 work to learn for any profitable use. Miss\r\nBarfoot takes pupils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica, at first very attentive, was growing absent. Her eyes wandered\r\nabout the room. The other observed her closely, and, it seemed,\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel any impulse to try for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have to live for six months without earning anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is by no means impossible for you, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot really impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica replied with hesitation.\r\n\r\nSomething like dissatisfaction passed over Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s face, though she\r\ndid not allow Monica to see it. Her lips moved in a way that perhaps\r\nsignified disdain for such timidity. Tolerance was not one of the\r\nvirtues expressed in her physiognomy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go back to the drawing-room and have some tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica could not become quite at ease. This energetic woman had little\r\nattraction for her. She saw the characteristics which made Virginia\r\nenthusiastic, but feared rather than admired them. To put herself in\r\nMiss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s hands might possibly result in a worse form of bondage than\r\nshe suffered at the shop; she would never be able to please such a\r\nperson, and failure, she imagined, would result in more or less\r\ncontemptuous dismissal.\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden, as it she had divined these thoughts, Rhoda assumed\r\nan air of gaiety of frank kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is your birthday? I no longer keep count of mine, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell you without a calculation what I am exactly. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\r\nyou see. Thirty-one or fifty-one is much the same for a woman who has\r\nmade up her mind to live alone and work steadily for a definite object.\r\nBut you are still a young girl, Monica. My best wishes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica emboldened herself to ask what the object was for which her\r\nfriend worked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I put it?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cTo make women\r\nhard-hearted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard-hearted? I think I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you like to see them live unmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that almost with resentment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94indeed\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica reddened a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more natural if you have done. At your age, I should have\r\nresented it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the girl hesitated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you approve of any one marrying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not so severe! But do you know that there are half a million\r\nmore women than men in this happy country of ours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a million!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer naive alarm again excited Rhoda to laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething like that, they say. So many _odd_ women\xe2\x80\x94no making a pair\r\nwith them. The pessimists call them useless, lost, futile lives. I,\r\nnaturally\xe2\x80\x94being one of them myself\xe2\x80\x94take another view. I look upon\r\nthem as a great reserve. When one woman vanishes in matrimony, the\r\nreserve offers a substitute for the world\xe2\x80\x99s work. True, they are not\r\nall trained yet\xe2\x80\x94far from it. I want to help in that\xe2\x80\x94to train the\r\nreserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut married woman are not idle,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Monica earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all of them. Some cook and rock cradles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s mood changed. She laughed the subject away, and\r\nabruptly began to talk of old days down in Somerset, of rambles about\r\nCheddar Cliffs, or at Glastonbury, or on the Quantocks. Monica,\r\nhowever, could not listen, and with difficulty commanded her face to a\r\npleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come and see Miss Barfoot?\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda asked, when it had become\r\nclear to her that the girl would gladly get away. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only her\r\nsubordinate, but I know she will wish to be of all the use to you she\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica expressed her thanks, and promised to act as soon as possible on\r\nany invitation that was sent her. She took leave just as the servant\r\nannounced another caller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that corner of Battersea Park which is near Albert Bridge there has\r\nlain for more than twenty years a curious collection of architectural\r\nfragments, chiefly dismembered columns, spread in order upon the\r\nground, and looking like portions of a razed temple. It is the\r\ncolonnade of old Burlington House, conveyed hither from Piccadilly who\r\nknows why, and likely to rest here, the sporting ground for adventurous\r\ninfants, until its origin is lost in the abyss of time.\r\n\r\nIt was at this spot that Monica had agreed to meet with her casual\r\nacquaintance, Edmund Widdowson, and there, from a distance, she saw his\r\nlank, upright, well-dressed figure moving backwards and forwards upon\r\nthe grass. Even at the last moment Monica doubted whether to approach.\r\nEmotional interest in him she had none, and the knowledge of life she\r\nhad gained in London assured her that in thus encouraging a perfect\r\nstranger she was doing a very hazardous thing. But the evening must\r\nsomehow be spent, and if she went off in another direction it would\r\nonly be to wander about with an adventurous mind; for her conversation\r\nwith Miss Nunn had had precisely the opposite effect of that which\r\nRhoda doubtless intended; she felt something of the recklessness which\r\nformerly excited her wonder when she remarked it in the other\r\nshop-girls. She could no longer be without a male companion, and as she\r\nhad given her promise to this man\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe had seen her, and was coming forward. To-day he carried a\r\nwalking-stick, and wore gloves; otherwise his appearance was the same\r\nas at Richmond. At the distance of a few yards he raised his hat, not\r\nvery gracefully. Monica did not offer her hand, nor did Widdowson seem\r\nto expect it. But he gave proof of an intense pleasure in the meeting;\r\nhis sallow cheeks grew warm, and in the many wrinkles about his eyes\r\nplayed a singular smile, good-natured but anxious, apprehensive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad you were able to come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low voice, bending\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been even finer than last Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d was Monica\xe2\x80\x99s rather vague\r\nreply, as she glanced at some people who were passing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a wonderful day. But I only left home an hour ago. Shall we walk\r\nthis way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went along the path by the river. Widdowson exhibited none of the\r\nartifices of gallantry practised by men who are in the habit of picking\r\nup an acquaintance with shop-girls. His smile did not return; an\r\nextreme sobriety characterized his manner and speech; for the most part\r\nhe kept his eyes on the ground, and when silent he had the look of one\r\nwho inwardly debates a grave question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been into the country?\xe2\x80\x9d was one of his first inquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I spent the morning with my sisters, and in the afternoon I had to\r\nsee a lady in Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sisters are older than yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, some years older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it long since you went to live apart from them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have never had a home of our own since I was quite a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, she went on to give a brief account\r\nof her history. Widdowson listened with the closest attention, his lips\r\ntwitching now and then, his eyes half closed. But for cheek-bones that\r\nwere too prominent and nostrils rather too large, he was not\r\nill-featured. No particular force of character declared itself in his\r\ncountenance, and his mode of speech did not suggest a very active\r\nbrain. Speculating again about his age, Monica concluded that he must\r\nbe two or three and forty, in spite of the fact that his grizzled beard\r\nargued for a higher figure. He had brown hair untouched by any sign of\r\nadvanced life, his teeth were white and regular, and something\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ncould not make clear to her mind exactly what\xe2\x80\x94convinced her that he\r\nhad a right to judge himself comparatively young.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI supposed you were not a Londoner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when she came to a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour speech. Not,\xe2\x80\x9d he added quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have any provincial\r\naccent. And even if you had been a Londoner you would not have shown it\r\nin that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be reproving himself for a blunder, and after a short\r\nsilence asked in a tone of kindness,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you prefer the town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some ways\xe2\x80\x94not in all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you have relatives here, and friends. So many young ladies\r\ncome up from the country who are quite alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir progress to familiarity could hardly have been slower. Now and\r\nthen they spoke with a formal coldness which threatened absolute\r\nsilence. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s brain was so actively at work that she lost\r\nconsciousness of the people who were moving about them, and at times\r\nher companion was scarcely more to her than a voice.\r\n\r\nThey had walked along the whole front of the park, and were near\r\nChelsea Bridge. Widdowson gazed at the pleasure-boats lying below on\r\nthe strand, and said diffidently,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you care to go on the river?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposal was so unexpected that Monica looked up with a startled\r\nair. She had not thought of the man as likely to offer any kind of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be pleasant, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tide is still running\r\nup. We might go very quietly for a mile or two, and be back as soon as\r\nyou like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I should like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe brightened up, and moved with a livelier step. In a few minutes they\r\nhad chosen their boat, had pushed off, and were gliding to the middle\r\nof the broad water. Widdowson managed the sculls without awkwardness,\r\nbut by no means like a man well trained in this form of exercise. On\r\nsitting down, he had taken off his hat, stowed it away, and put on a\r\nlittle travelling-cap, which he drew from his pocket. Monica thought\r\nthis became him. After all, he was not a companion to be ashamed of.\r\nShe looked with pleasure at his white hairy hands with their firm grip;\r\nthen at his boots\xe2\x80\x94very good boots indeed. He had gold links in his\r\nwhite shirt-cuffs, and a gold watch-guard chosen with a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your service,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an approach to gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cDirect\r\nme. Shall we go quickly\xe2\x80\x94some distance, or only just a little quicker\r\nthan the tide would float us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you like. To row much would make you too hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to go some distance\xe2\x80\x94I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Do exactly what you like. Of course we must be back in an hour\r\nor two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew out his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s now ten minutes past six, and there is daylight till nine or\r\nafter. When do you wish to be home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much later than nine,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica answered, with the insincerity of\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will just go quietly along. I wish we could have started early\r\nin the afternoon. But that may be for another day, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn her lap Monica had the little brown-paper parcel which contained her\r\npresent. She saw that Widdowson glanced at it from time to time, but\r\nshe could not bring herself to explain what it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was very much afraid that I should not see you to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as\r\nthey glided softly by Chelsea Embankment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I promised to come if it was fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I feared something might prevent you. You are very kind to give\r\nme your company.\xe2\x80\x9d He was looking at the tips of her little boots. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say how I thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch embarrassed, Monica could only gaze at one of the sculls, as it\r\nrose and fell, the water dripping from it in bright beads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast year,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI went on the river two or three times, but\r\nalone. This year I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in a boat till to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou prefer driving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s only chance. I do drive a good deal, however. I wish it were\r\npossible to take you through the splendid country I saw a day or two\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94down in Surrey. Perhaps some day you will let me. I live rather a\r\nlonely life, as you see. I have a housekeeper; no relative lives with\r\nme. My only relative in London is a sister-in-law, and we very seldom\r\nmeet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you employ yourself in any way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very idle. But that\xe2\x80\x99s partly because I have worked very hard and\r\nhopelessly all my life\xe2\x80\x94till a year and a half ago. I began to earn my\r\nown living when I was fourteen, and now I am forty-four\xe2\x80\x94to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is your birthday?\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica, with an odd look the other could\r\nnot understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I only remembered it a few hours ago. Strange that such a treat\r\nshould have been provided for me. Yes, I am very idle. A year and a\r\nhalf ago my only brother died. He had been very successful in life, and\r\nhe left me what I regard as a fortune, though it was only a small part\r\nof what he had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listener\xe2\x80\x99s heart throbbed. Without intending it, she pulled the\r\ntiller so that the boat began to turn towards land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe left hand a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Widdowson, smiling correctly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright. Many days I don\xe2\x80\x99t leave home. I am fond of reading, and now I\r\nmake up for all the time lost in years gone by. Do you care for books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never read very much, and I feel very ignorant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is only for want of opportunity, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the brown-paper parcel. Acting on an impulse which\r\nperturbed her, Monica began to slip off the loosely-tied string, and to\r\nunfold the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was a book!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Widdowson merrily, when she had\r\nrevealed a part of her present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you told me your name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought perhaps to have\r\ntold you mine. It\xe2\x80\x99s written here. My sisters gave me this to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe offered the little volume. He took it as though it were something\r\nfragile, and\xe2\x80\x94the sculls fixed under his elbows\xe2\x80\x94turned to the fly-leaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? It is _your_ birthday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am twenty-one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me shake hands with you?\xe2\x80\x9d His pressure of her fingers was\r\nthe lightest possible. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s rather a strange thing\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nOh, I remember this book very well, though I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it or heard\r\nof it for twenty years. My mother used to read it on Sundays. And it is\r\nreally your birthday? I am more than twice your age, Miss Madden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last remark was uttered anxiously, mournfully. Then, as if to\r\nreassure himself by exerting physical strength, he drove the boat along\r\nwith half a dozen vigorous strokes. Monica was rustling over the pages,\r\nbut without seeing them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion presently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very well\r\ncontented with your life in that house of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard a good deal of the hardships of such a life. Will you\r\ntell me something about yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReadily she gave him a sketch of her existence from Sunday to Sunday,\r\nbut without indignation, and as if the subject had no great interest\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d was Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady I went to see this afternoon told me I looked ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can see the effects of overwork. My wonder is that you\r\nendure it at all. Is that lady an old acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica answered with all necessary detail, and went on to mention the\r\nproposal that had been made to her. The hearer reflected, and put\r\nfurther questions. Unwilling to speak of the little capital she\r\npossessed, Monica told him that her sisters might perhaps help her to\r\nlive whilst she was learning a new occupation. But Widdowson had become\r\nabstracted; he ceased pulling, crossed his arms on the oars, and\r\nwatched other boats that were near. Two deep wrinkles, rippling in\r\ntheir course, had formed across his forehead, and his eyes widened in a\r\ngaze of complete abstraction at the farther shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d fell from him at length, as though in continuation of something\r\nhe had been saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI began to earn my bread when I was fourteen. My\r\nfather was an auctioneer at Brighton. A few years after his marriage he\r\nhad a bad illness, which left him completely deaf. His partnership with\r\nanother man was dissolved, and as things went worse and worse with him,\r\nmy mother started a lodging-house, which somehow supported us for a\r\nlong time. She was a sensible, good, and brave woman. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid my\r\nfather had a good many faults that made her life hard. He was of a\r\nviolent temper, and of course the deafness didn\xe2\x80\x99t improve it. Well, one\r\nday a cab knocked him down in the King\xe2\x80\x99s Road, and from that injury,\r\nthough not until a year after, he died. There were only two children; I\r\nwas the elder. My mother couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep me at school very long, so, at\r\nfourteen, I was sent into the office of the man who had been my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s partner, to serve him and learn the business. I did serve him\r\nfor years, and for next to no payment, but he taught me nothing more\r\nthan he could help. He was one of those heartless, utterly selfish men\r\nthat one meets too often in the business world. I ought never to have\r\nbeen sent there, for my father had always an ill opinion of him; but he\r\npretended a friendly interest in me\xe2\x80\x94just, I am convinced, to make the\r\nuse of me that he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent, and began rowing again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t make out that I was a faultless boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, with the\r\nsmile that graved wrinkles about his eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cquite the opposite. I had a\r\ngood deal of my father\xe2\x80\x99s temper; I often behaved very badly to my\r\nmother; what I needed was some stern but conscientious man to look\r\nafter me and make me work. In my spare time I lay about on the shore,\r\nor got into mischief with other boys. It needed my mother\xe2\x80\x99s death to\r\nmake a more sensible fellow of me, and by that time it was too late. I\r\nmean I was too old to be trained into profitable business habits. Up to\r\nnineteen I had been little more than an errand and office boy, and all\r\nthrough the after years I never got a much better position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand that,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Monica thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to\xe2\x80\x94to be the kind of man that would make your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I?\xe2\x80\x9d The description pleased him; he laughed cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nnever found what my way was to be. I have always hated office work, and\r\nbusiness of every kind; yet I could never see an opening in any other\r\ndirection. I have been all my life a clerk\xe2\x80\x94like so many thousands of\r\nother men. Nowadays, if I happen to be in the City when all the clerks\r\nare coming away from business, I feel an inexpressible pity for them. I\r\nfeel I should like to find two or three of the hardest driven, and just\r\ndivide my superfluous income between. A clerk\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94a life of the\r\noffice without any hope of rising\xe2\x80\x94that is a hideous fate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your brother got on well. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree. We always quarrelled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really so ill-tempered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was asked in Monica\xe2\x80\x99s most naive tone, with a serious air of\r\ninvestigation which at first confused Widdowson, then made him laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince I was a lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never quarrelled with any one\r\nexcept my brother. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s only very unreasonable people that\r\nirritate me. Some men have told me that I was far too easy-going, too\r\ngood-natured. Certainly I _desire_ to be good-natured. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neasily make friends; as a rule I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to strangers. I keep so\r\nmuch to myself that those who know me only a little think me surly and\r\nunsociable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo your brother always refused to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy for him to help me. He got into a stockbroker\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nwent on step by step until he had saved a little money; then he\r\nspeculated in all sorts of ways. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t employ me himself\xe2\x80\x94and if\r\nhe could have done so, we should never have got on together. It was\r\nimpossible for him to recommend me to any one except as a clerk. He was\r\na born money-maker. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you an example of how he grew rich. In\r\nconsequence of some mortgage business he came into possession of a\r\nfield at Clapham. As late as 1875 this field brought him only a rent of\r\nforty pounds; it was freehold property, and he refused many offers of\r\npurchase. Well, in 1885, the year before he died, the ground-rents from\r\nthat field\xe2\x80\x94now covered with houses\xe2\x80\x94were seven hundred and ninety\r\npounds a year. That\xe2\x80\x99s how men get on who have capital and know how to\r\nuse it. If _I_ had had capital, it would never have yielded me more\r\nthan three or four per cent. I was doomed to work for other people who\r\nwere growing rich. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter much now, except that so many\r\nyears of life have been lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad your brother any children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo children. All the same, it astonished me when I heard his will; I\r\nhad expected nothing. In one day\xe2\x80\x94in one hour\xe2\x80\x94I passed from slavery to\r\nfreedom, from poverty to more than comfort. We never _hated_ each\r\nother; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to think that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t it bring you friends as well as comfort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not so rich as to have people pressing for my\r\nacquaintance. I have only about six hundred a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica drew in her breath silently, then gazed at the distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any new friends. The one or two men I care for are\r\nnot much better off than I used to be, and I always feel ashamed to ask\r\nthem to come and see me. Perhaps they think I shun them because of\r\ntheir position, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to justify myself. Life has always\r\nbeen full of worrying problems for me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take things in the\r\nsimple way that comes natural to other men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think we ought to be turning back, Mr. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we will. I am sorry the time goes so quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen a few minutes had passed in silence, he asked,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel that I am no longer quite a stranger to you, Miss Madden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94you have told me so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you to listen so patiently. I wish I had more\r\ninteresting things to tell, but you see what a dull life mine has\r\nbeen.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and let the boat waver on the stream for a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I dared to speak to you last Sunday I had only the faintest hope\r\nthat you would grant me your acquaintance. You can\xe2\x80\x99t, I am sure, repent\r\nof having done me that kindness\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne never knows. I doubted whether I ought to talk with a stranger\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRightly\xe2\x80\x94quite rightly. It was my perseverance\xe2\x80\x94you saw, I hope, that\r\nI could never dream of giving you offence. The rule is necessary, but\r\nyou see there may be exceptional cases.\xe2\x80\x9d He was giving a lazy stroke\r\nnow and then, which, as the tide was still, just moved the boat\r\nonwards. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw something in your face that _compelled_ me to speak to\r\nyou. And now we may really be friends, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I can think of you as a friend, Mr. Widdowson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA large boat was passing with four or five young men and girls who sang\r\nin good time and tune. Only a song of the music-hall or of the nigger\r\nminstrels, but it sounded pleasantly with the plash of the oars. A fine\r\nsunset had begun to glow upon the river; its warmth gave a tone to\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s thin cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will let me see you again before long? Let me drive you to\r\nHampton Court next Sunday\xe2\x80\x94or any other place you would choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely I shall be invited to my friend\xe2\x80\x99s in Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you seriously think of leaving the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I must have time to think about it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes. But if I write a line to you, say on Friday, would you let\r\nme know whether you can come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to let me refuse for next Sunday. The one after, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent his head, looked desperately grave, and drove the boat on.\r\nMonica was disturbed, but held to her resolution, which Widdowson\r\nsilently accepted. The rest of the way they exchanged only brief\r\nsentences, about the beauty of the sky, the scenes on river or bank,\r\nand other impersonal matters. After landing, they walked in silence\r\ntowards Chelsea Bridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must go quickly home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy train\xe2\x80\x94from York Road to Walworth Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson cast a curious glance at her. One would have imagined that he\r\nfound something to disapprove in this ready knowledge of London transit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go with you to the station, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word spoken, they walked the short distance to York Road.\r\nMonica took her ticket, and offered a hand for good-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may write to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Widdowson, his face set in an expression of\r\nanxiety, \xe2\x80\x9cand make an appointment, if possible, for the Sunday after\r\nnext?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to come\xe2\x80\x94if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a very long time to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a faint smile, Monica hurried away to the platform. In the train\r\nshe looked like one whose mind is occupied with grave trouble. Fatigue\r\nhad suddenly overcome her; she leaned back and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nAt a street corner very near to Messrs. Scotcher\xe2\x80\x99s establishment she\r\nwas intercepted by a tall, showily-dressed, rather coarse-featured\r\ngirl, who seemed to have been loitering about. It was Miss Eade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you, Miss Madden. Where did you go with Mr.\r\nBullivant this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice could not have been more distinctive of a London shop-girl;\r\nits tone signified irritation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Mr. Bullivant? I went nowhere with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I _saw_ you both get into the bus in Kennington Park Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica returned coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it if Mr. Bullivant\r\nhappened to be going the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well! I thought you was to be trusted. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou behave very foolishly, Miss Eade,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other, whose\r\nnerves at this moment would not allow her to use patience with the\r\njealous girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only tell you that I have never thought again of\r\nMr. Bullivant since he left the bus somewhere in Clapham Road. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntired of talking about such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, see here, don\xe2\x80\x99t be cross. Come and walk a bit and tell me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too tired. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing whatever to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be narsty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica walked on, but the girl caught her up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so sharp with me, Miss Madden. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say as you wanted him\r\nto go in the bus with you. But you might tell me what he had to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all; except that he wished to know where I was going, which\r\nwas no business of his. I did what I could for you. I told him that if\r\nhe asked you to go up the river with him I felt sure you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrefuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you did!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Eade threw up her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a\r\nvery delicate thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very unreasonable. I myself don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was very delicate,\r\nbut haven\xe2\x80\x99t you worried me to say something of the kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I haven\xe2\x80\x99t! Worried you, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen please never to speak to me on the subject again. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did _he_ say, when you\xe2\x80\x99d said that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you _are_ narsty to-day! Really you are! If it had been the other\r\nway about, I\xe2\x80\x99d never have treated _you_ like this, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were close to the door by which Messrs. Scotcher\xe2\x80\x99s resident\r\nemployees entered at night. Monica had taken out her latchkey. But Miss\r\nEade could not endure the thought of being left in torturing ignorance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything for you I can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe unkind, Miss Madden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica turned back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were you, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so silly. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do more than assure you\r\nand promise you that I shall never listen to Mr. Bullivant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did he say about _me_, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Eade kept a mortified silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had much better not think of him at all. I would have more pride.\r\nI wish I could make you see him as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you did really speak about me? Oh, I do wish you\xe2\x80\x99d find some one\r\nto go out with. Then perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica stood still, hesitated, and at length said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I _have_ found some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have?\xe2\x80\x9d The girl all but danced with joy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94so now don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble me any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time she was allowed to turn back and enter the house.\r\n\r\nNo one else had yet come in. Monica ate a mouthful of bread and cheese,\r\nwhich was in readiness on the long table down in the basement, and at\r\nonce went to bed. But no welcome drowsiness fell upon her. At half-past\r\neleven, when two of the other five girls who slept in the room made\r\ntheir appearance, she was still changing uneasily from side to side.\r\nThey lit the gas (it was not turned off till midnight, after which hour\r\nthe late arrivals had to use a candle of their own procuring), and\r\nbegan a lively conversation on the events of the day. Afraid of being\r\nobliged to talk, Monica feigned sleep.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, just as the gas went out, another pair came to repose. They\r\nhad been quarrelling, and were very gloomy. After a long and\r\nacrimonious discussion in the dark as to which of them should find a\r\ncandle\xe2\x80\x94it ended in one of the girls who was in bed impatiently\r\nsupplying a light\xe2\x80\x94they began sullenly to throw off their garments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Madden awake?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, looking in Monica\xe2\x80\x99s direction.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s picked up some feller to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the speaker, lowering\r\nher voice, and glancing round at her companions with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cOr else\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s had him all along\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeads were put forward eagerly, and inquiries whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s oldish, I should say. I caught sight of them just as they was\r\ngoing off in a boat from Battersea Park, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see his face\r\nvery well. He looked rather like Mr. Thomas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas was a member of the drapery firm, a man of fifty, ugly and\r\naustere. At this description the listeners giggled and uttered\r\nexclamations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he a swell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if he was. You can trust Miss M. to keep her eyes\r\nopen. She\xe2\x80\x99s one of the sly and quiet \xe2\x80\x9cuns.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is she?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured another enviously. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those as\r\ngets made a fool of\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe point was argued for some minutes. It led to talk about Miss Eade,\r\nwho was treated with frank contempt because of her ill-disguised\r\npursuit of a mere counter-man. These other damsels had, at present,\r\nmore exalted views, for they were all younger than Miss Eade.\r\n\r\nJust before one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when silence had reigned for a quarter of an\r\nhour, there entered with much bustle the last occupant of the bedroom.\r\nShe was a young woman with a morally unenviable reputation, though some\r\nof her colleagues certainly envied her. Money came to her with\r\nremarkable readiness whenever she had need of it. As usual, she began\r\nto talk very loud, at first with innocent vulgarity; exciting a little\r\nlaughter, she became anecdotic and very scandalous. It took her a long\r\ntime to disrobe, and when the candle was out, she still had her richest\r\nstory to relate\xe2\x80\x94of point so Rabelaisian that one or two voices made\r\nthemselves heard in serious protest. The gifted anecdotist replied with\r\na long laugh, then cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, young ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d and sank\r\npeacefully to slumber.\r\n\r\nAs for Monica, she saw the white dawn peep at the window, and closed\r\nher tear-stained eyes only when the life of a new week had begun\r\nnoisily in Walworth Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA CAMP OF THE RESERVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of letters exchanged during the week, next Sunday\r\nbrought the three Miss Maddens to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road to lunch with Miss\r\nBarfoot. Alice had recovered from her cold, but was still ailing, and\r\ntook rather a gloomy view of the situation she had lately reviewed with\r\nsuch courage. Virginia maintained her enthusiastic faith in Miss Nunn,\r\nand was prepared to reverence Miss Barfoot with hardly less fervour.\r\nBoth of them found it difficult to understand their young sister, who,\r\nin her letters, had betrayed distaste for the change of career proposed\r\nto her. They were received with the utmost kindness, and all greatly\r\nenjoyed their afternoon, for not even Monica\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice against a\r\nhouse, which in her own mind she had stigmatized as \xe2\x80\x9can old-maid\r\nfactory,\xe2\x80\x9d could resist the charm of the hostess.\r\n\r\nThough Miss Barfoot had something less than a woman\xe2\x80\x99s average stature,\r\nthe note of her presence was personal dignity. She was handsome, and\r\nher carriage occasionally betrayed a consciousness of the fact.\r\nAccording to circumstances, she bore herself as the lady of\r\naristocratic tastes, as a genial woman of the world, or as a fervid\r\nprophetess of female emancipation, and each character was supported\r\nwith a spontaneity, a good-natured confidence, which inspired liking\r\nand respect. A brilliant complexion and eyes that sparkled with\r\nhabitual cheerfulness gave her the benefit of doubt when her age was in\r\nquestion; her style of dress, gracefully ornate, would have led a\r\nstranger to presume her a wedded lady of some distinction. Yet Mary\r\nBarfoot had known many troubles, poverty among them. Her experiences\r\nand struggles bore a close resemblance to those which Rhoda Nunn had\r\ngone through, and the time of trial had lasted longer. Mental and moral\r\nstamina would have assured her against such evils of celibacy as\r\nappeared in the elder Maddens, but it was to a change of worldly\r\nfortune that she owed this revival of youthful spirit and energy in\r\nmiddle life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and I must be friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Monica, holding the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoft little hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are both black but comely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe compliment to herself seemed the most natural thing in the world.\r\nMonica blushed with pleasure, and could not help laughing.\r\n\r\nIt was all but decided that Monica should become a pupil at the school\r\nin Great Portland Street. In a brief private conversation, Miss Barfoot\r\noffered to lend her the money that might be needful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but a business transaction, Miss Madden. You can give me\r\nsecurity; you will repay me at your convenience. If, in the end, this\r\noccupation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t please you, you will at all events have regained\r\nhealth. It is clear to me that you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go on in that dreadful place\r\nyou described to Miss Nunn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitors took their leave at about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor things! Poor things!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Miss Barfoot, when she was alone\r\nwith her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we possibly do for the older ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are excellent creatures,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda; \xe2\x80\x9ckind, innocent women; but\r\nuseful for nothing except what they have done all their lives. The\r\neldest can\xe2\x80\x99t teach seriously, but she can keep young children out of\r\nmischief and give them a nice way of speaking. Her health is breaking\r\ndown, you can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor woman! One of the saddest types.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly. Virginia isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so depressing\xe2\x80\x94but how childish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey all strike me as childish. Monica is a dear little girl; it\r\nseemed a great absurdity to talk to her about business. Of course she\r\nmust find a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s tone of slighting concession amused her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, after all we don\xe2\x80\x99t desire the end of the race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I suppose not,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda admitted with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word of caution. Your zeal is eating you up. At this rate, you will\r\nhinder our purpose. We have no mission to prevent girls from marrying\r\nsuitably\xe2\x80\x94only to see that those who can\xe2\x80\x99t shall have a means of living\r\nwith some satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat chance is there that this girl will marry suitably?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, who knows? At all events, there will be more likelihood of it if\r\nshe comes into our sphere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Do you know any man that would dream of marrying her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not, at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was clear that Miss Barfoot stood in some danger of becoming\r\nsubordinate to her more vehement friend. Her little body, for all its\r\nnatural dignity, put her at a disadvantage in the presence of Rhoda,\r\nwho towered above her with rather imperious stateliness. Her suavity\r\nwas no match for Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous abruptness. But the two were very\r\nfond of each other, and by this time thought themselves able safely to\r\ndispense with the forms at first imposed by their mutual relations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she marry at all,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Miss Nunn, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will marry badly. The\r\nfamily is branded. They belong to the class we know so well\xe2\x80\x94with no\r\nsocial position, and unable to win an individual one. I must find a\r\nname for that ragged regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot regarded her friend thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRhoda, what comfort have you for the poor in spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. My mission is not to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, she added,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have their religious faith, I suppose; and it\xe2\x80\x99s answerable for a\r\ngood deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a terrible responsibility to rob them of it,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the\r\nelder woman gravely.\r\n\r\nRhoda made a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible responsibility to do anything at all. But I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she laughed scornfully\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s not my task to release them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary Barfoot mused, a compassionate shadow on her fine face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can do without the spirit of that religion,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nat length\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe essential human spirit. These poor women\xe2\x80\x94one ought to\r\nbe very tender with them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your \xe2\x80\x9cragged regiment\xe2\x80\x9d phrase.\r\nWhen I grow old and melancholy, I think I shall devote myself to poor\r\nhopeless and purposeless women\xe2\x80\x94try to warm their hearts a little\r\nbefore they go hence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Rhoda, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in the meantime they cumber\r\nus; we have to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw forward her arms, as though with spear and buckler. Miss\r\nBarfoot was smiling at this Palladin attitude when a servant announced\r\ntwo ladies\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Smallbrook and Miss Haven. They were aunt and niece;\r\nthe former a tall, ungainly, sharp-featured widow; the latter a\r\nsweet-faced, gentle, sensible-looking girl of five-and-twenty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad you are back again,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the widow, as she shook\r\nhands with Miss Barfoot, speaking in a hard, unsympathetic voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nso want to ask your advice about an interesting girl who has applied to\r\nme. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid her past won\xe2\x80\x99t bear looking into, but most certainly she\r\nis a reformed character. Winifred is most favourably impressed with\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Haven, the Winifred in question, began to talk apart with Rhoda\r\nNunn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish my aunt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerate so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a subdued\r\nvoice, whilst Mrs. Smallbrook still talked loudly and urgently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever said that I was favourably impressed. The girl protests far too\r\nmuch; she has played on aunt\xe2\x80\x99s weaknesses, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, some one who lost her character long ago, and lives, I should say,\r\non charitable people. Just because I said that she must once have had a\r\nvery nice face, aunt misrepresents me in this way\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she an educated person?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barfoot was heard to ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot precisely well educated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the lower classes, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that term, you know. Of the _poorer_ classes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never was a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Miss Haven quietly but decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I fear I can be of no use,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hostess, betraying some of\r\nher secret satisfaction in being able thus to avoid Mrs. Smallbrook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest. Winifred, a pupil at Great Portland Street, was much liked by\r\nboth her teachers; but the aunt, with her ceaseless philanthropy at\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s expense, could only be considered a bore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t limit your humanity, Miss Barfoot, by the\r\nartificial divisions of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think those divisions are anything but artificial,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nhostess good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the uneducated classes I have no interest\r\nwhatever. You have heard me say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I cannot think\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just a little narrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so. I choose my sphere, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Let those work for the\r\nlower classes (I must call them lower, for they are, in every sense),\r\nlet those work for them who have a call to do so. I have none. I must\r\nkeep to my own class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely, Miss Nunn,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the widow, turning to Rhoda, \xe2\x80\x9cwe work\r\nfor the abolition of all unjust privilege? To us, is not a woman a\r\nwoman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to agree with Miss Barfoot. I think that as soon as we\r\nbegin to meddle with uneducated people, all our schemes and views are\r\nunsettled. We have to learn a new language, for one thing. But your\r\nmissionary enterprise is admirable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Mrs. Smallbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cI aim at the solidarity of\r\nwoman. You, at all events, agree with me, Winifred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t think, aunt, that there can be any solidarity of ladies\r\nwith servant girls,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Miss Haven, encouraged by a look from\r\nRhoda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I grieve that your charity falls so far below the Christian\r\nstandard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot firmly guided the conversation to a more hopeful subject.\r\n\r\nNot many people visited this house. Every Wednesday evening, from\r\nhalf-past eight to eleven, Miss Barfoot was at home to any of her\r\nacquaintances, including her pupils, who chose to call upon her; but\r\nthis was in the nature of an association with recognized objects. Of\r\nsociety in the common sense Miss Barfoot saw very little; she had no\r\ntime to sacrifice in the pursuit of idle ceremonies. By the successive\r\ndeaths of two relatives, a widowed sister and an uncle, she had come\r\ninto possession of a modest fortune; but no thought of a life such as\r\nwould have suggested itself to most women in her place ever tempted\r\nher. Her studies had always been of a very positive nature; her\r\nabilities were of a kind uncommon in women, or at all events very\r\nrarely developed in one of her sex. She could have managed a large and\r\ncomplicated business, could have filled a place on a board of\r\ndirectors, have taken an active part in municipal government\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nperchance in national. And this turn of intellect consisted with many\r\ntraits of character so strongly feminine that people who knew her best\r\nthought of her with as much tenderness as admiration. She did not seek\r\nto become known as the leader of a \xe2\x80\x9cmovement,\xe2\x80\x9d yet her quiet work was\r\nprobably more effectual than the public career of women who\r\npropagandize for female emancipation. Her aim was to draw from the\r\noverstocked profession of teaching as many capable young women as she\r\ncould lay hands on, and to fit them for certain of the pursuits\r\nnowadays thrown open to their sex. She held the conviction that\r\nwhatever man could do, woman could do equally well\xe2\x80\x94those tasks only\r\nexcepted which demand great physical strength. At her instance, and\r\nwith help from her purse, two girls were preparing themselves to be\r\npharmaceutical chemists; two others had been aided by her to open a\r\nbookseller\xe2\x80\x99s shop; and several who had clerkships in view received an\r\nadmirable training at her school in Great Portland Street.\r\n\r\nThither every weekday morning Miss Barfoot and Rhoda repaired; they\r\narrived at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and with an hour\xe2\x80\x99s interval work went on until\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nEntering by the private door of a picture-cleaner\xe2\x80\x99s shop, they ascended\r\nto the second story, where two rooms had been furnished like\r\ncomfortable offices; two smaller on the floor above served for\r\ndressing-rooms. In one of the offices, typewriting and occasionally\r\nother kinds of work that demanded intelligence were carried on by three\r\nor four young women regularly employed. To superintend this department\r\nwas Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s chief duty, together with business correspondence under\r\nthe principal\xe2\x80\x99s direction. In the second room Miss Barfoot instructed\r\nher pupils, never more than three being with her at a time. A bookcase\r\nfull of works on the Woman Question and allied topics served as a\r\ncirculating library; volumes were lent without charge to the members of\r\nthis little society. Once a month Miss Barfoot or Miss Nunn, by turns,\r\ngave a brief address on some set subject; the hour was four o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nand about a dozen hearers generally assembled. Both worked very hard.\r\nMiss Barfoot did not look upon her enterprise as a source of pecuniary\r\nprofit, but she had made the establishment more than self-supporting.\r\nHer pupils increased in number, and the working department promised\r\noccupation for a larger staff than was at present engaged. The young\r\nwomen in general answered their friend\xe2\x80\x99s expectations, but of course\r\nthere were disappointing instances. One of these had caused Miss\r\nBarfoot special distress. A young girl whom she had released from a\r\nlife of much hardship, and who, after a couple of months\xe2\x80\x99 trial, bade\r\nfair to develop noteworthy ability, of a sudden disappeared. She was\r\nwithout relatives in London, and Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s endeavours to find her\r\nproved for several weeks very futile. Then came news of her; she was\r\nliving as the mistress of a married man. Every effort was made to bring\r\nher back, but the girl resisted; presently she again passed out of\r\nsight, and now more than a year had elapsed since Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\ninterview with her.\r\n\r\nThis Monday morning, among letters delivered at the house, was one from\r\nthe strayed girl. Miss Barfoot read it in private, and throughout the\r\nday remained unusually grave. At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when staff and pupils\r\nhad all departed, she sat for a while in meditation, then spoke to\r\nRhoda, who was glancing over a book by the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a letter I should like you to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that has been troubling you since morning, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda took the sheet and quickly ran through its contents. Her face\r\nhardened, and she threw down the letter with a smile of contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you advise?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the elder woman, closely observing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn answer in two lines\xe2\x80\x94with a cheque enclosed, if you see fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that really meet the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than meets it, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot pondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am doubtful. That is a letter of despair, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t close my ears\r\nto it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had an affection for the girl. Help her, by all means, if you feel\r\ncompelled to. But you would hardly dream of taking her back again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the point. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rhoda, looking coldly down upon her friend,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou will never do any good with her. For another, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t a suitable\r\ncompanion for the girls she would meet here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure of either objection. She acted with deplorable\r\nrashness, with infatuation, but I never discovered any sign of evil in\r\nher. Did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvil? Well, what does the word mean? I am not a Puritan, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\njudge her as the ordinary woman would. But I think she has put herself\r\naltogether beyond our sympathy. She was twenty-two years old\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94and she acted with her eyes open. No deceit was practised with\r\nher. She knew the man had a wife, and she was base enough to accept a\r\nshare of his attentions. Do you advocate polygamy? That is an\r\nintelligible position, I admit. It is one way of meeting the social\r\ndifficulty. But not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Rhoda, don\xe2\x80\x99t enrage yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t see the temptation to do so. Come and sit down, and talk\r\nquietly. No, I have no fondness for polygamy. I find it very hard to\r\nunderstand how she could act as she did. But a mistake, however\r\nwretched, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t condemn a woman for life. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way of the\r\nworld, and decidedly it mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn this point I practically agree with the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you do, and it astonishes me. You are going through curious\r\nchanges, in several respects. A year ago you didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of her like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you well enough to speak my mind. Partly\r\nyes, I have changed a good deal, no doubt. But I should never have\r\nproposed to take her by the hand and let bygones be bygones. That is an\r\namiable impulse, but anti-social.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA favourite word on your lips just now, Rhoda. Why is it anti-social?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause one of the supreme social needs of our day is the education of\r\nwomen in self-respect and self-restraint. There are plenty of\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94men chiefly, but a few women also of a certain temperament\xe2\x80\x94who\r\ncry for a reckless individualism in these matters. They would tell you\r\nthat she behaved laudably, that she was _living out herself_\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthings of that kind. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you shared such views.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t, altogether. \xe2\x80\x9cThe education of women in self-respect.\xe2\x80\x9d Very\r\nwell. Here is a poor woman whose self-respect has given way under\r\ngrievous temptation. Circumstances have taught her that she made a wild\r\nmistake. The man gives her up, and bids her live as she can; she is\r\nreduced to beggary. Now, in that position a girl is tempted to sink\r\nstill further. The letter of two lines and an enclosed cheque would as\r\nlikely as not plunge her into depths from which she could never be\r\nrescued. It would assure her that there was no hope. On the other hand,\r\nwe have it in our power to attempt that very education of which you\r\nspeak. She has brains, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to the vulgar. It seems to me\r\nthat you are moved by illogical impulses\xe2\x80\x94and certainly anything but\r\nkind ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda only grew more stubborn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say she yielded to a grievous temptation. What temptation? Will it\r\nbear putting into words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I think it will,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miss Barfoot, with her gentlest\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x9cShe fell in love with the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFell in love!\xe2\x80\x9d Concentration of scorn was in this echo. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, for what\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t that phrase responsible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRhoda, let me ask you a question on which I have never ventured. Do\r\nyou know what it is to be in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s strong features were moved as if by a suppressed laugh; the\r\ncolour of her cheeks grew very slightly warm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a normal human being,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with an impatient gesture.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand perfectly well what the phrase signifies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no answer, my dear. Have you ever been in love with any man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. When I was fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not since,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the other, shaking her head and smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nnot since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are not very well able to judge this case. I, on the other\r\nhand, can judge it with the very largest understanding. Don\xe2\x80\x99t smile so\r\nwitheringly, Rhoda. I shall neglect your advice for once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will bring this girl back, and continue teaching her as before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no one here that knows her, and with prudence she need never\r\nbe talked about by those of our friends who did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, weak\xe2\x80\x94weak\xe2\x80\x94weak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor once I must act independently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and at a stroke change the whole character of your work. You\r\nnever proposed keeping a reformatory. Your aim is to help chosen girls,\r\nwho promise to be of some use in the world. This Miss Royston\r\nrepresents the profitless average\xe2\x80\x94no, she is below the average. Are\r\nyou so blind as to imagine that any good will ever come of such a\r\nperson? If you wish to save her from the streets, do so by all means.\r\nBut to put her among your chosen pupils is to threaten your whole\r\nundertaking. Let it once become known\xe2\x80\x94and it _would_ become\r\nknown\xe2\x80\x94that a girl of that character came here, and your usefulness is\r\nat an end. In a year\xe2\x80\x99s time you will have to choose between giving up\r\nthe school altogether and making it a refuge for outcasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot was silent. She tapped with her fingers on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPersonal feeling is misleading you,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Royston had\r\na certain cleverness, I grant; but do you think I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that she\r\nwould never become what you hoped? All her spare time was given to\r\nnovel-reading. If every novelist could be strangled and thrown into the\r\nsea we should have some chance of reforming women. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s nature\r\nwas corrupted with sentimentality, like that of all but every woman who\r\nis intelligent enough to read what is called the best fiction, but not\r\nintelligent enough to understand its vice. Love\xe2\x80\x94love\xe2\x80\x94love; a\r\nsickening sameness of vulgarity. What is more vulgar than the ideal of\r\nnovelists? They won\xe2\x80\x99t represent the actual world; it would be too dull\r\nfor their readers. In real life, how many men and women _fall in love_?\r\nNot one in every ten thousand, I am convinced. Not one married pair in\r\nten thousand have felt for each other as two or three couples do in\r\nevery novel. There is the sexual instinct, of course, but that is quite\r\na different thing; the novelists daren\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that. The paltry\r\ncreatures daren\xe2\x80\x99t tell the one truth that would be profitable. The\r\nresult is that women imagine themselves noble and glorious when they\r\nare most near the animals. This Miss Royston\xe2\x80\x94when she rushed off to\r\nperdition, ten to one she had in mind some idiot heroine of a book. Oh,\r\nI tell you that you are losing sight of your first duty. There are\r\npeople enough to act the good Samaritan; _you_ have quite another task\r\nin life. It is your work to train and encourage girls in a path as far\r\nas possible from that of the husband-hunter. Let them marry later, if\r\nthey must; but at all events you will have cleared their views on the\r\nsubject of marriage, and put them in a position to judge the man who\r\noffers himself. You will have taught them that marriage is an alliance\r\nof intellects\xe2\x80\x94not a means of support, or something more ignoble still.\r\nBut to do this with effect you must show yourself relentless to female\r\nimbecility. If a girl gets to know that you have received back such a\r\nperson as Miss Royston she will be corrupted by your spirit of\r\ncharity\xe2\x80\x94corrupted, at all events, for our purposes. The endeavour to\r\ngive women a new soul is so difficult that we can\xe2\x80\x99t be cumbered by\r\nside-tasks, such as fishing foolish people out of the mud they have\r\nwalked into. Charity for human weakness is all very well in its place,\r\nbut it is precisely one of the virtues that you must _not_ teach. You\r\nhave to set an example of the sterner qualities\xe2\x80\x94to discourage anything\r\nthat resembles sentimentalism. And think if you illustrate in your own\r\nbehaviour a sympathy for the very vice of character we are trying our\r\nhardest to extirpate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a terrible harangue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot, when the passionate\r\nvoice had been silent for a few ticks of the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite enter into\r\nyour point of view, but I think you go beyond practical zeal. However,\r\nI will help the girl in some other way, if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have offended you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible to take offence at such obvious sincerity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you grant the force of what I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe differ a good deal, Rhoda, on certain points which as a rule would\r\nnever come up to interfere with our working in harmony. You have come\r\nto dislike the very thought of marriage\xe2\x80\x94and everything of that kind. I\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s a danger you ought to have avoided. True, we wish to prevent\r\ngirls from marrying just for the sake of being supported, and from\r\ndegrading themselves as poor Bella Royston has done; but surely between\r\nourselves we can admit that the vast majority of women would lead a\r\nwasted life if they did not marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI maintain that the vast majority of women lead a vain and miserable\r\nlife because they _do_ marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you blame the institution of marriage with what is chargeable to\r\nhuman fate? A vain and miserable life is the lot of nearly all mortals.\r\nMost women, whether they marry or not, will suffer and commit endless\r\nfollies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost women\xe2\x80\x94as life is at present arranged for them. Things are\r\nchanging, and we try to have our part in hastening a new order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, we use words in a different sense. I speak of human nature, not of\r\nthe effect of institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it is you who are unpractical. Those views lead only to pessimism\r\nand paralysis of effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give in to your objection against bringing the girl back to work\r\nhere. I will help her in other ways. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite true that she isn\xe2\x80\x99t to\r\nbe relied upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible to trust her in any detail of life. The pity is that her\r\ndegradation can\xe2\x80\x99t be used as an object lesson for our other girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere again we differ. You are quite mistaken in your ideas of how the\r\nmind is influenced. The misery of Bella Royston would not in the least\r\naffect any other girl\xe2\x80\x99s way of thinking about the destiny of her sex.\r\nWe must avoid exaggeration. If our friends get to think of us as\r\nfanatics, all our usefulness is over. The ideal we set up must be\r\nhuman. Do you think now that we know one single girl who in her heart\r\nbelieves it is better never to love and never to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Rhoda, more cheerful now that she had gained\r\nher point. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we know several who will not dream of marrying unless\r\nreason urges them as strongly as inclination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, who ever distinguished in such a case between reason and\r\ninclination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are most unusually sceptical to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, with an\r\nimpatient laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear. We happen to be going to the root of things, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s as well to do so now and then. Oh, I admire you immensely,\r\nRhoda. You are the ideal adversary of those care-nothing and\r\nbelieve-nothing women who keep the world back. But don\xe2\x80\x99t prepare for\r\nyourself a woeful disillusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the case of Winifred Haven,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Miss Nunn. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a\r\ngood-looking and charming girl, and some one or other will want to\r\nmarry her some day, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive my interrupting you. There is great doubt. She has no money\r\nbut what she can earn, and such girls, unless they are exceptionally\r\nbeautiful, are very likely indeed to remain unsought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted. But let us suppose she has an offer. Should you fear for her\r\nprudence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWinifred has much good sense,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she is in\r\nas little danger as any girl we know. But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t startle me if she\r\nmade the most lamentable mistake. Certainly I don\xe2\x80\x99t fear it. The girls\r\nof our class are not like the uneducated, who, for one reason or\r\nanother, will marry almost any man rather than remain single. They have\r\nat all events personal delicacy. But what I insist upon is, that\r\nWinifred would rather marry than not. And we must carefully bear that\r\nfact in mind. A strained ideal is as bad, practically, as no ideal at\r\nall. Only the most exceptional girl will believe it her duty to remain\r\nsingle as an example and support to what we call the odd women; yet\r\n_that_ is the most human way of urging what you desire. By taking up\r\nthe proud position that a woman must be altogether independent of\r\nsexual things, you damage your cause. Let us be glad if we put a few of\r\nthem in the way of living single with no more discontent than an\r\nunmarried man experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely that\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate comparison,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat man\r\nlives in celibacy? Consider that unmentionable fact, and then say\r\nwhether I am wrong in refusing to forgive Miss Royston. Women\xe2\x80\x99s battle\r\nis not only against themselves. The necessity of the case demands what\r\nyou call a strained ideal. I am seriously convinced that before the\r\nfemale sex can be raised from its low level there will have to be a\r\nwidespread revolt against sexual instinct. Christianity couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spread\r\nover the world without help of the ascetic ideal, and this great\r\nmovement for woman\xe2\x80\x99s emancipation must also have its ascetics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t declare that you are wrong in that. Who knows? But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngood policy to preach it to our young disciples.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall respect your wish; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda paused and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder woman gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve me that the less we\r\ntalk or think about such things the better for the peace of us all. The\r\nodious fault of working-class girls, in town and country alike, is that\r\nthey are absorbed in preoccupation with their animal nature. We, thanks\r\nto our education and the tone of our society, manage to keep that in\r\nthe background. Don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with this satisfactory state of things.\r\nBe content to show our girls that it is their duty to lead a life of\r\neffort\xe2\x80\x94to earn their bread and to cultivate their minds. Simply ignore\r\nmarriage\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the wisest. Behave as if the thing didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. You\r\nwill do positive harm by taking the other course\xe2\x80\x94the aggressive\r\ncourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall obey you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, humble creature!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Miss Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, let us be off to\r\nChelsea. Did Miss Grey finish that copy for Mr. Houghton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it has gone to post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, here\xe2\x80\x99s a big manuscript from our friend the antiquary. Two of\r\nthe girls must get to work on it at once in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuscripts entrusted to them were kept in a fire-proof safe. When this\r\nhad been locked up, the ladies went to their dressing-room and prepared\r\nfor departure. The people who lived on the premises were responsible\r\nfor cleaning the rooms and other care; to them Rhoda delivered the\r\ndoor-keys.\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot was grave and silent on the way home. Rhoda, annoyed at\r\nthe subject that doubtless occupied her friend\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, gave herself\r\nup to reflections of her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA SOCIAL ADVANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nA week\xe2\x80\x99s notice to her employers would release Monica from the\r\nengagement in Walworth Road. Such notice must be given on Monday, so\r\nthat, if she could at once make up her mind to accept Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffer, the coming week would be her last of slavery behind the counter.\r\nOn the way home from Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, Alice and Virginia pressed for\r\nimmediate decision; they were unable to comprehend how Monica could\r\nhesitate for another moment. The question of her place of abode had\r\nalready been discussed. One of Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s young women, who lived at\r\na convenient distance from Great Portland Street, would gladly accept a\r\npartner in her lodging\xe2\x80\x94an arrangement to be recommended for its\r\neconomy. Yet Monica shrank from speaking the final word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it\xe2\x80\x99s worth while,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a long\r\nsilence, as they drew near to York Road Station, whence they were to\r\ntake train for Clapham Junction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot worth while?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be an\r\nimprovement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose it would. I shall see how I feel about it to-morrow\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spent the evening at Lavender Hill, but without change in the mood\r\nthus indicated. A strange inquietude appeared in her behaviour. It was\r\nas though she were being urged to undertake something hard and\r\nrepugnant.\r\n\r\nOn her return to Walworth Road, just as she came within sight of the\r\nshop, she observed a man\xe2\x80\x99s figure some twenty yards distant, which\r\ninstantly held her attention. The dim gaslight occasioned some\r\nuncertainty, but she believed the figure was that of Widdowson. He was\r\nwalking on the other side of the street, and away from her. When the\r\nman was exactly opposite Scotcher\xe2\x80\x99s establishment he gazed in that\r\ndirection, but without stopping. Monica hastened, fearing to be seen\r\nand approached. Already she had reached the door, when Widdowson\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\nhe it was\xe2\x80\x94turned abruptly to walk back again. His eye was at once upon\r\nher; but whether he recognized her or not Monica could not know. At\r\nthat moment she opened the door and passed in.\r\n\r\nA fit of trembling seized her, as if she had barely escaped some peril.\r\nIn the passage she stood motionless, listening with the intensity of\r\ndread. She could hear footsteps on the pavement; she expected a ring at\r\nthe door-bell. If he were so thoughtless as to come to the door, she\r\nwould on no account see him.\r\n\r\nBut there was no ring, and after a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 waiting she recovered\r\nher self-command. She had not made a mistake; even his features had\r\nbeen discernible as he turned towards her. Was this the first time that\r\nhe had come to look at the place where she lived\xe2\x80\x94possibly to spy upon\r\nher? She resented this behaviour, yet the feeling was confused with a\r\ncertain satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the dormitories there was a view of Walworth Road. She ran\r\nupstairs, softly opened the door of that room, and peeped in. The low\r\nburning gas showed her that only one bed had an occupant, who appeared\r\nto be asleep. Softly she went to the window, drew the blind aside, and\r\nlooked down into the street. But Widdowson had disappeared. He might of\r\ncourse be on this side of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly asked a voice from the occupied bed.\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Miss Eade. Monica looked at her, and nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? What are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see if some one was standing outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a beastly headache. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold myself up, and I had to\r\ncome home at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There\xe2\x80\x99s such pains all down my back too. I\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t stay at this beastly place much longer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ill,\r\nlike Miss Radford. Somebody went to see her at the hospital this\r\nafternoon, and she\xe2\x80\x99s awfully bad. Well, have you seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Monica left the room.\r\n\r\nNext day she notified her intention of leaving her employment. No\r\nquestions were asked; she was of no particular importance; fifty, or,\r\nfor the matter of that, five score, young women equally capable could\r\nbe found to fill her place.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning there came a letter from Virginia\xe2\x80\x94a few lines\r\nrequesting her to meet her sisters, as soon as possible after closing\r\ntime that evening, in front of the shop. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have something _very\r\ndelightful_ to tell you. We _do hope_ you gave notice to-day, as things\r\nare getting so bright in every direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to ten she was able to run out, and close at hand were the\r\ntwo eagerly awaiting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Darby has found a place for Alice,\xe2\x80\x9d began Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cWe heard by\r\nthe afternoon post yesterday. A lady at Yatton wants a governess for\r\ntwo young children. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fortunate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo delightfully convenient for what we were thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the\r\neldest, with her croaking voice. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing could have been better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean about the school?\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica dreamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the school,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia replied, with trembling earnestness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYatton is convenient both for Clevedon and Weston. Alice will be able\r\nto run over to both places and make enquiries, and ascertain where the\r\nbest opening would be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, hitherto but timidly discussed, had taken hold\r\nupon their minds as soon as Alice received the practical call to her\r\nnative region. Both were enthusiastic for the undertaking. It afforded\r\nthem a novel subject of conversation, and inspirited them by seeming to\r\nrestore their self-respect. After all, they might have a mission, a\r\ntask in the world. They pictured themselves the heads of a respectable\r\nand thriving establishment, with subordinate teachers, with pleasant\r\nsocial relations; they felt young again, and capable of indefinite\r\nactivity. Why had they not thought of this long ago? and thereupon they\r\nreverted to antistrophic laudation of Rhoda Nunn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a good place?\xe2\x80\x9d their younger sister inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pretty good. Only twelve pounds a year, but nice people, Mrs.\r\nDarby says. They want me at once, and it is very likely that in a few\r\nweeks I shall go with them to the seaside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _could_ have been better?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cHer health will be\r\nestablished, and in half a year, or less, we shall be able to come to a\r\ndecision about the great step. Oh, and have you given notice, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth clapped their hands like children. It was an odd little scene on\r\nthe London pavement at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night; so intimately domestic\r\namid surroundings the very antithesis of domesticity. Only a few yards\r\naway, a girl, to whom the pavement was a place of commerce, stood\r\nlaughing with two men. The sound of her voice hinted to Monica the\r\nadvisability of walking as they conversed, and they moved towards\r\nWalworth Road Station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought at first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginia, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when Alice had gone you\r\nmight like to share my room; but then the distance from Great Portland\r\nStreet would be a decided objection. I might move, but we doubt whether\r\nthat would be worth while. It is so comfortable with Mrs. Conisbee, and\r\nfor the short remaining time\xe2\x80\x94Christmas, I should think, would be a\r\nvery good time for opening. If it were possible to decide upon dear old\r\nClevedon, of course we should prefer it; but perhaps Weston will offer\r\nmore scope. Alice will weigh all the arguments on the spot. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nenvy her, Monica? Think of being _there_ in this summer weather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go as well?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? And take lodgings, you mean? We never thought of that. But we still\r\nhave to consider expenditure very seriously, you know. If possible, I\r\nmust find employment for the rest of the year. Remember how very likely\r\nit is that Miss Nunn will have something to suggest for me. And when I\r\nthink it will be of so much practical use for me to see her frequently\r\nfor a few weeks. Already I have learnt so much from her and from Miss\r\nBarfoot. Their conversation is so encouraging. I feel that it is a\r\ntraining of the mind to be in contact with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I quite share that view,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, with tremulous earnestness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVirginia can reap much profit from intercourse with them. They have\r\nthe new ideas in education, and it would be so good if our school began\r\nwith the advantage of quite a modern system.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica became silent. When her sisters had talked in the same strain\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, she said absently,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to Miss Barfoot last night, so I suppose I shall be able to\r\nmove to those lodgings next Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock before they parted. Having taken leave of her\r\nsisters near the station, Monica turned to walk quickly home. She had\r\ngone about half the way, when her name was spoken just behind her, in\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s voice. She stopped, and there stood the man, offering his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you here at this time?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by chance. I had a hope that I might see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gloomy, and looked at her searchingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to talk now, Mr. Widdowson. It\xe2\x80\x99s very late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery late indeed. It surprised me to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurprised you? Why should it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that it seemed so very unlikely\xe2\x80\x94at this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how could you have hoped to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica walked on, with an air of displeasure, and Widdowson kept beside\r\nher, incessantly eyeing her countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really think of seeing you, Miss Madden. I wished to be\r\nnear the place where you were, that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw me come out I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had done, you would have known that I came to meet two ladies,\r\nmy sisters. I walked with them to the station, and now I am going home.\r\nYou seem to think an explanation necessary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo forgive me! What right have I to ask anything of the kind? But I\r\nhave been very restless since Sunday. I wished so to meet you, if only\r\nfor a few minutes. Only an hour or two ago I posted a letter to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was to ask you to meet me next Sunday, as we arranged. Shall you be\r\nable to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t. At the end of this week I leave my place here, and\r\non Sunday I shall be moving to another part of London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are leaving? You have decided to make the change you spoke of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you tell me where you are going to live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn lodgings near Great Portland Street. I must say good-night, Mr.\r\nWiddowson. I must, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease\xe2\x80\x94do give me one moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for him to detain her. Ungracefully he caught at his\r\nhat, made the salute, and moved away with rapid, uneven strides. In\r\nless than half an hour he was back again at this spot. He walked past\r\nthe shop many times without pausing; his eyes devoured the front of the\r\nbuilding, and noted those windows in which there was a glimmer of\r\nlight. He saw girls enter by the private door, but Monica did not again\r\nshow herself. Some time after midnight, when the house had long been\r\ndark and perfectly quiet, the uneasy man took a last look, and then\r\nsought a cab to convey him home.\r\n\r\nThe letter of which he had spoken reached Monica\xe2\x80\x99s hands next morning.\r\nIt was a very respectful invitation to accompany the writer on a drive\r\nin Surrey. Widdowson proposed to meet her at Herne Hill railway\r\nstation, where his vehicle would be waiting. \xe2\x80\x9cIn passing, I shall be\r\nable to point out to you the house which has been my home for about a\r\nyear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs circumstances were, it would be hardly possible to accept this\r\ninvitation without exciting curiosity in her sisters. The Sunday\r\nmorning would be occupied, probably, in going to the new lodgings and\r\nmaking the acquaintance of her future companion there; in the\r\nafternoon, her sisters were to pay her a visit, as Alice had decided\r\nto start for Somerset on the Monday. She must write a refusal, but it\r\nwas by no means her wish to discourage Widdowson altogether. The note\r\nwhich at length satisfied her ran thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. WIDDOWSON\xe2\x80\x94I am very sorry that it will be impossible for me\r\nto see you next Sunday. All day I shall be occupied. My eldest sister\r\nis leaving London, and Sunday will be my last day with her, perhaps for\r\na long time. Please do not think that I make light of your kindness.\r\nWhen I am settled in my new life, I hope to be able to let you know how\r\nit suits me.\xe2\x80\x94Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nMONICA MADDEN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a postscript she mentioned her new address. It was written in very\r\nsmall characters\xe2\x80\x94perhaps an unpurposed indication of the misgiving\r\nwith which she allowed herself to pen the words.\r\n\r\nTwo days went by, and again a letter from Widdowson was delivered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS MADDEN\xe2\x80\x94My chief purpose in writing again so soon is to\r\napologize sincerely for my behaviour on Tuesday evening. It was quite\r\nunjustifiable. The best way of confessing my fault is to own that I had\r\na foolish dislike of your walking in the streets unaccompanied at so\r\nlate an hour. I believe that any man who had newly made your\r\nacquaintance, and had thought as much about you as I have, would have\r\nexperienced the same feeling. The life which made it impossible for you\r\nto see friends at any other time of the day was so evidently unsuited\r\nto one of your refinement that I was made angry by the thought of it.\r\nHappily it is coming to an end, and I shall be greatly relieved when I\r\nknow that you have left the house of business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember that we are to be friends. I should be much less than\r\nyour friend if I did not desire for you a position very different from\r\nthat which necessity forced upon you. Thank you very much for the\r\npromise to tell me how you like the new employment and your new\r\nfriends. Shall you not henceforth be at leisure on other days besides\r\nSunday? As you will now be near Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, perhaps I may hope to\r\nmeet you there some evening before long. I would go any distance to see\r\nyou and speak with you for only a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo forgive my impertinence, and believe me, dear Miss Madden.\xe2\x80\x94 Ever\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nEDMUND WIDDOWSON.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNow this undoubtedly might be considered a love-letter, and it was the\r\nfirst of its kind that Monica had ever received. No man had ever\r\nwritten to her that he was willing to go \xe2\x80\x9cany distance\xe2\x80\x9d for the reward\r\nof looking on her face. She read the composition many times, and with\r\nmany thoughts. It did not enchant her; presently she felt it to be dull\r\nand prosy\xe2\x80\x94anything but the ideal of a love-letter, even at this early\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThe remarks concerning Widdowson made in the bedroom by the girl who\r\nfancied her asleep had greatly disturbed her conception of him. He was\r\nold, and looked still older to a casual eye. He had a stiff dry way,\r\nand already had begun to show how precise and exacting he could be. A\r\nyear or two ago the image of such a man would have repelled her. She\r\ndid not think it possible to regard him with warm feelings; yet, if he\r\nasked her to marry him\xe2\x80\x94and that seemed likely to happen very\r\nsoon\xe2\x80\x94almost certainly her answer would be yes. Provided, of course,\r\nthat all he had told her about himself could be in some satisfactory\r\nway confirmed.\r\n\r\nHer acquaintance with him was an extraordinary thing. With what\r\namazement and rapture would any one of her shop companions listen to\r\nthe advances of a man who had six hundred a year! Yet Monica did not\r\ndoubt his truthfulness and the honesty of his intentions. His\r\nlife-story sounded credible enough, and the very dryness of his manner\r\ninspired confidence. As things went in the marriage war, she might\r\nesteem herself a most fortunate young woman. It seemed that he had\r\nreally fallen in love with her; he might prove a devoted husband. She\r\nfelt no love in return; but between the prospect of a marriage of\r\nesteem and that of no marriage at all there was little room for\r\nhesitation. The chances were that she might never again receive an\r\noffer from a man whose social standing she could respect.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there had come a civil little note from the girl whose\r\nrooms she was to share. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Barfoot has spoken of you so favourably\r\nthat I did not think it necessary to see you before consenting to what\r\nshe suggested. Perhaps she has told you that I have my own furniture;\r\nit is very plain, but, I think, comfortable. For the two rooms, with\r\nattendance, I pay eight and sixpence a week; my landlady will ask\r\neleven shillings when there are two of us, so that your share would be\r\nfive and six. I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t think this is too much. I am a quiet and\r\nI think a very reasonable person.\xe2\x80\x9d The signature was \xe2\x80\x9cMildred H.\r\nVesper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day of release arrived. As it poured with rain all the morning,\r\nMonica the less regretted that she had been obliged to postpone her\r\nmeeting with Widdowson. At breakfast-time she said good-bye to the\r\nthree or four girls in whom she had any interest. Miss Eade was\r\ndelighted to see her go. This rival finally out of the way, Mr.\r\nBullivant might perchance turn his attention to the faithful admirer\r\nwho remained.\r\n\r\nShe went by train to Great Portland Street, and thence by cab, with her\r\ntwo boxes, to Rutland Street, Hampstead Road\xe2\x80\x94an uphill little street\r\nof small houses. When the cab stopped, the door of the house she sought\r\nat once opened, and on the threshold appeared a short, prim,\r\nplain-featured girl, who smiled a welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Miss Vesper?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica said, approaching her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94very pleased to see you, Miss Madden. As London cabmen have a\r\nnarrow view of their duties, I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you to get the boxes in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica liked the girl at once. Jehu condescending to hand down the\r\nluggage, they transferred it to the foot of the staircase, then, the\r\nfare having been paid, went up to the second floor, which was the top\r\nof the house. Miss Vesper\xe2\x80\x99s two rooms were very humble, but homely. She\r\nlooked at Monica to remark the impression produced by them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very nicely indeed. After my quarters in Walworth Road! But I feel\r\nashamed to intrude upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been trying to find someone to share my rent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other,\r\nwith a simple frankness that was very agreeable. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Barfoot was full\r\nof your praises\xe2\x80\x94and indeed I think we may suit each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall try to be as little disturbance to you as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I to you. The street is a very quiet one. Up above here is\r\nCumberland Market; a hay and straw market. Quite pleasant\r\nodours\xe2\x80\x94country odours\xe2\x80\x94reach us on market day. I am country-bred;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why I speak of such a trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cI come from Somerset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I from Hampshire. Do you know, I have a strong suspicion that all\r\nthe really nice girls in London _are_ country girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica had to look at the speaker to be sure that this was said in\r\npleasantry. Miss Vesper was fond of making dry little jokes in the\r\ngravest tone; only a twinkle of her eyes and a movement of her tight\r\nlittle lips betrayed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I ask the landlady to help me up with the luggage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rather pale, Miss Madden. Better let me see to that. I have to\r\ngo down to remind Mrs. Hocking to put salt into the saucepan with the\r\npotatoes. She cooks for me only on Sunday, and if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t remind her\r\nevery week she would boil the potatoes without salt. Such a state of\r\nmind is curious, but one ends by accepting it as a fact in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey joined in merry laughter. When Miss Vesper gave way to open mirth,\r\nshe enjoyed it so thoroughly that it was a delight to look at her.\r\n\r\nBy the time dinner was over they were on excellent terms, and had\r\nexchanged a great deal of personal information. Mildred Vesper seemed\r\nto be one of the most contented of young women. She had sisters and\r\nbrothers, whom she loved, all scattered about England in pursuit of a\r\nlivelihood; it was rare for any two of them to see each other, but she\r\nspoke of this as quite in the order of things. For Miss Barfoot her\r\nrespect was unbounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had made more of me than any one else could have done. When I\r\nfirst met her, three years ago, I was a simpleton; I thought myself\r\nill-used because I had to work hard for next to no payment and live in\r\nsolitude. Now I should be ashamed to complain of what falls to the lot\r\nof thousands of girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like Miss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so well as Miss Barfoot, but I think very highly of her. Her zeal\r\nmakes her exaggerate a little now and then, but then the zeal is so\r\nsplendid. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t it myself\xe2\x80\x94not in that form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that I feel a shameful delight when I hear of a girl getting\r\nmarried. It\xe2\x80\x99s very weak, no doubt; perhaps I shall improve as I grow\r\nolder. But I have half a suspicion, do you know, that Miss Barfoot is\r\nnot without the same weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica laughed, and spoke of something else. She was in good spirits;\r\nalready her companion\xe2\x80\x99s view of life began to have an effect upon her;\r\nshe thought of people and things in a more lightsome way, and was less\r\ndisposed to commiserate herself.\r\n\r\nThe bedroom which both were to occupy might with advantage have been\r\nlarger, but they knew that many girls of instinct no less delicate than\r\ntheir own had to endure far worse accommodation in London\xe2\x80\x94where\r\npoverty pays for its sheltered breathing-space at so much a square\r\nfoot. It was only of late that Miss Vesper had been able to buy\r\nfurniture (four sovereigns it cost in all), and thus to allow herself\r\nthe luxury of two rooms at the rent she previously paid for one. Miss\r\nBarfoot did not remunerate her workers on a philanthropic scale, but\r\nstrictly in accordance with market prices; common sense dictated this\r\nprinciple. In talking over their arrangements, Monica decided to expend\r\na few shillings on the purchase of a chair-bedstead for her own use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often have nightmares,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cand kick a great deal. It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be nice to give you bruises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA week passed. Alice had written from Yatton, and in a cheerful tone.\r\nVirginia, chronically excited, had made calls at Rutland Street and at\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Road; she talked like one who had suddenly received a great\r\nillumination, and her zeal in the cause of independent womanhood\r\nrivalled Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s. Without enthusiasm, but seemingly contented,\r\nMonica worked at the typewriting machine, and had begun certain studies\r\nwhich her friends judged to be useful. She experienced a growth of\r\nself-respect. It was much to have risen above the status of shop-girl,\r\nand the change of moral atmosphere had a very beneficial effect upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMildred Vesper was a studious little person, after a fashion of her\r\nown. She possessed four volumes of Maunder\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTreasuries,\xe2\x80\x9d and to one\r\nor other of these she applied herself for at least an hour every\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy nature,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when Monica sought an explanation of this study,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy mind is frivolous. What I need is a store of solid information, to\r\nreflect upon. No one could possibly have a worse memory, but by\r\npersevering I manage to learn one or two facts a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica glanced at the books now and then, but had no desire to\r\ncultivate Maunder\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance. Instead of reading, she meditated the\r\nproblems of her own life.\r\n\r\nEdmund Widdowson, of course, wrote to her at the new address. In her\r\nreply she again postponed their meeting. Whenever she went out in the\r\nevening, it was with expectation of seeing him somewhere in the\r\nneighbourhood; she felt assured that he had long ago come to look at\r\nthe house, and more likely than not his eyes had several times been\r\nupon her. That did not matter; her life was innocent, and Widdowson\r\nmight watch her coming and going as much as he would.\r\n\r\nAt length, about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock one evening, she came face to face with\r\nhim. It was in Hampstead Road; she had been buying at a draper\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\ncarried the little parcel. At the moment of recognition, Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface so flushed and brightened that Monica could not help a sympathetic\r\nfeeling of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so cruel to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low voice, as she gave her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time since I saw you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that really true?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with an air more resembling\r\ncoquetry than any he had yet seen in her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince I spoke to you, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree evenings ago. You were walking in Tottenham Court Road with a\r\nyoung lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vesper, the friend I live with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give me a few minutes now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked humbly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it too late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor reply Monica moved slowly on. They turned up one of the ways\r\nparallel with Rutland Street, and so came into the quiet district that\r\nskirts Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, Widdowson talking all the way in a strain of all\r\nbut avowed tenderness, his head bent towards her and his voice so much\r\nsubdued that occasionally she lost a few words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t live without seeing you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you refuse to\r\nmeet me, I have no choice but to come wandering about the places where\r\nyou are. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t think I spy upon you. Indeed, it is only\r\njust to see your face or your form as you walk along. When I have had\r\nmy journey in vain I go back in misery. You are never out of my\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for that, Mr. Widdowson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry? Are you really sorry? Do you think of me with less friendliness\r\nthan when we had our evening on the river?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not with less friendliness. But if I only make you unhappy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn one way unhappy, but as no one else ever had the power to. If you\r\nwould let me meet you at certain times my restlessness would be at an\r\nend. The summer is going so quickly. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come for that drive with\r\nme next Sunday? I will be waiting for you at any place you like to\r\nappoint. If you could imagine what joy it would give me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently Monica assented. If it were fine, she would be by the\r\nsouth-east entrance to Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He thanked her with\r\nwords of the most submissive gratitude, and then they parted.\r\n\r\nThe day proved doubtful, but she kept her appointment. Widdowson was on\r\nthe spot with horse and trap. These were not, as he presently informed\r\nMonica, his own property, but hired from a livery stable, according to\r\nhis custom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t rain,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, gazing at the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _shan\xe2\x80\x99t_ rain!\r\nThese few hours are too precious to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very awkward if it _did_,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica replied, in merry\r\nhumour, as they drove along.\r\n\r\nThe sky threatened till sundown, but Widdowson was able to keep\r\ndeclaring that rain would not come. He took a south-westward course,\r\ncrossed Waterloo Bridge, and thence by the highways made for Herne\r\nHill. Monica observed that he made a short detour to avoid Walworth\r\nRoad. She asked his reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate the road!\xe2\x80\x9d Widdowson answered, with vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hate it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you slaved and suffered there. If I had the power, I would\r\ndestroy it\xe2\x80\x94every house. Many a time,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a lower voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen you were lying asleep, I walked up and down there in horrible\r\nmisery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust because I had to stand at a counter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only that. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fit for you to work in that way\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\npeople about you! I hated every face of man or woman that passed along\r\nthe street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope not. Of course, I know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why did you ever come\r\nto such a place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was severity rather than sympathy in his look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was tired of the dull country life,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica replied frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthen I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the shops and the people were like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you need a life of excitement?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcitement? No, but one must have change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Herne Hill, Widdowson became silent, and presently he\r\nallowed the horse to walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my house, Miss Madden\xe2\x80\x94the right-hand one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica looked, and saw two little villas, built together with stone\r\nfacings, porches at the doors and ornamented gables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wanted to show it you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\npretty or noticeable about it, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all grandly furnished.\r\nMy old housekeeper and one servant manage to keep it in order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey passed, and Monica did not allow herself to look back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my life I have wished to have a house of my own, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare\r\nto hope I ever should. Men in general don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care so long as\r\nthey have lodgings that suit them\xe2\x80\x94I mean unmarried men. But I always\r\nwanted to live alone\xe2\x80\x94without strangers, that is to say. I told you\r\nthat I am not very sociable. When I got my house, I was like a child\r\nwith a toy; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep for satisfaction. I used to walk all over\r\nit, day after day, before it was furnished. There was something that\r\ndelighted me in the sound of my footsteps on the staircases and the\r\nbare floors. Here I shall live and die, I kept saying to myself. Not in\r\nsolitude, I hoped. Perhaps I might meet some one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica interrupted him to ask a question about some object in the\r\nlandscape. He answered her very briefly, and for a long time neither\r\nspoke. Then the girl, glancing at him with a smile of apology, said in\r\na gentle tone\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were telling me how the house pleased you. Have you still the same\r\npleasure in living there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But lately I have been hoping\xe2\x80\x94I daren\xe2\x80\x99t say more. You will\r\ninterrupt me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way are we going now, Mr. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Streatham, then on to Carshalton. At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock we will use our\r\nright as travellers, and get some innkeeper to make tea for us. Look,\r\nthe sun is trying to break through; we shall have a fine evening yet.\r\nMay I, without rudeness, say that you look better since you left that\r\nabominable place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I feel better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter keeping his look fixed for a long time on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s ears,\r\nWiddowson turned gravely to his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you about my sister-in-law. Would you be willing to make her\r\nacquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel able to do that, Mr. Widdowson,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica answered with\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nPrepared for this reply, he began a long and urgent persuasion. It was\r\nuseless; Monica listened quietly, but without sign of yielding. The\r\nsubject dropped, and they talked of indifferent things.\r\n\r\nOn the homeward drive, when the dull sky grew dusk about them, and the\r\nsuburban street-lamps began to show themselves in long glimmering\r\nlines, Widdowson returned with shamefaced courage to the subject which\r\nfor some hours had been in abeyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t part from you this evening without a word of hope to remember.\r\nYou know that I want you to be my wife. Will you tell me if there is\r\nanything I can say or do to make your consent possible? Have you any\r\ndoubt of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt whatever of your sincerity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn one sense, I am still a stranger to you. Will you give me the\r\nopportunity of making things between us more regular? Will you allow me\r\nto meet some friend of yours whom you trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather you didn\xe2\x80\x99t yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to know still more of me, personally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I think I must know you much better before I can consent to any\r\nstep of that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged, \xe2\x80\x9cif we became acquaintances in the ordinary way, and\r\nknew each other\xe2\x80\x99s friends, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be most satisfactory to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be. But you forget that so much would have to be explained. I\r\nhave behaved very strangely. If I told everything to my friends I\r\nshould leave myself no choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why not? You would be absolutely free. I could no more than try to\r\nrecommend myself to you. If I am so unhappy as to fail, how would you\r\nbe anything but quite free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you must understand me. In this position, I must either not\r\nspeak of you at all, or make it known that I am engaged to you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave it taken for granted that I am engaged to you when I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s head drooped; he set his lips in a hard gloomy expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have behaved very imprudently,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the girl. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x94what else I could have done. Things are so badly\r\narranged. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible for us to be introduced by any one who\r\nknew us both, so I had either to break off your acquaintance after that\r\nfirst conversation, or conduct myself as I have been doing. I think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a very hard position. My sisters would call me an immodest girl,\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is true. I may perhaps come to feel you as a girl\r\nought to when she marries, and how else can I tell unless I meet you\r\nand talk with you? And your position is just the same. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nyou for a moment; I think it would be ridiculous to blame you. Yet we\r\nhave gone against the ordinary rule, and people would make us suffer\r\nfor it\xe2\x80\x94or me, at all events.\r\n\r\nHer voice at the close was uncertain. Widdowson looked at her with eyes\r\nof passionate admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for saying that\xe2\x80\x94for putting it so well, and so kindly for\r\nme. Let us disregard people, then. Let us go on seeing each other. I\r\nlove you with all my soul\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he choked a little at this first utterance\r\nof the solemn word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand your rules shall be mine. Give me a chance of\r\nwinning you. Tell me if I offend you in anything\xe2\x80\x94if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything\r\nyou dislike in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you cease coming to look for me when I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you. I will never come again. And you will meet me a little\r\noftener?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see you once every week. But I must still be perfectly free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly! I will only try to win you as any man may who loves a\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tired horse clattered upon the hard highway and clouds gathered for\r\na night of storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCOUSIN EVERARD\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s eye fell on the letters brought to her at\r\nbreakfast-time, she uttered an exclamation, doubtful in its\r\nsignificance. Rhoda Nunn, who rarely had a letter from any one, looked\r\nup inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am greatly mistaken if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t my cousin Everard\xe2\x80\x99s writing. I\r\nthought so. He is in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda made no remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray read it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, handing her friend the epistle after\r\nshe had gone through it.\r\n\r\nThe handwriting was remarkably bold, but careful. Punctuation was\r\nstrictly attended to, and in places a word had been obliterated with a\r\ncircular scrawl which left it still legible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR COUSIN MARY,\xe2\x80\x94I hear that you are still active in an original\r\nway, and that civilization is more and more indebted to you. Since my\r\narrival in London a few weeks ago, I have several times been on the\r\npoint of calling at your house, but scruples withheld me. Our last\r\ninterview was not quite friendly on your side, you will remember, and\r\nperhaps your failure to write to me means continued displeasure; in\r\nthat case I might be rejected at your door, which I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like, for\r\nI am troubled with a foolish sense of personal dignity. I have taken a\r\nflat, and mean to stay in London for at least half a year. Please let\r\nme know whether I may see you. Indeed I should like to. Nature meant us\r\nfor good friends, but prejudice came between us. Just a line, either of\r\nwelcome or \xe2\x80\x9cget thee behind me!\xe2\x80\x9d In spite of your censures, I always\r\nwas, and still am, affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nEVERARD BARFOOT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda perused the sheet very attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn impudent letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cJust like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere does he appear from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJapan, I suppose. \xe2\x80\x9cBut prejudice came between us.\xe2\x80\x9d I like that! Moral\r\nconviction is always prejudice in the eyes of these advanced young men.\r\nOf course he must come. I am anxious to see what time has made of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it really moral censure that kept you from writing to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Rhoda, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of him at all, as I have frequently told\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I gather that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in theories,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be expected. He\r\nis far too stubborn. But in mode of life he may possibly be more\r\ntolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter two or three years in Japan,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rhoda, with a slight\r\nraising of the eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is about three-and-thirty, and before he left England I think he\r\nshowed possibilities of future wisdom. Of course I disapprove of him,\r\nand, if necessary, shall let him understand that quite as plainly as\r\nbefore. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in seeing if he has learnt to behave\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard Barfoot received an invitation to dine. It was promptly\r\naccepted, and on the evening of the appointment he arrived at half-past\r\nseven. His cousin sat alone in the drawing-room. At his entrance she\r\nregarded him with keen but friendly scrutiny.\r\n\r\nHe had a tall, muscular frame, and a head of striking outline, with\r\nlarge nose, full lips, deep-set eyes, and prominent eyebrows. His hair\r\nwas the richest tone of chestnut; his moustache and beard\xe2\x80\x94the latter\r\npeaking slightly forward\xe2\x80\x94inclined to redness. Excellent health\r\nmanifested itself in the warm purity of his skin, in his cheerful\r\naspect, and the lightness of his bearing. The lower half of his\r\nforehead was wrinkled, and when he did not fix his look on anything in\r\nparticular, his eyelids drooped, giving him for the moment an air of\r\nlanguor. On sitting down, he at once abandoned himself to a posture of\r\nthe completest ease, which his admirable proportions made graceful.\r\nFrom his appearance one would have expected him to speak in rather loud\r\nand decided tones; but he had a soft voice, and used it with all the\r\ndiscretion of good breeding, so that at times it seemed to caress the\r\near. To this mode of utterance corresponded his smile, which was\r\nfrequent, but restrained to the expression of a delicate, good-natured\r\nirony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one had told me of your return,\xe2\x80\x9d were Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s first words as\r\nshe shook hands with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy because no one knew. You were the first of my kinsfolk to whom\r\nI wrote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch honour, Everard. You look very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to be able to say the same of you. And yet I hear that you\r\nwork harder than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the source of your information about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had an account of you from Tom, in a letter that caught me at\r\nConstantinople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom? I thought he had forgotten my existence. Who told him about me I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. So you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come straight home from Japan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot was nursing his knee, his head thrown back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I loitered a little in Egypt and Turkey. Are you living quite\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drawled slightly on the last word, its second vowel making quite a\r\nmusical note, of wonderful expressiveness. The clear decision of his\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s reply was a sharp contrast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady lives with me\xe2\x80\x94Miss Nunn. She will join us in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cA partner in your activity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gives me valuable help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hear all about it\xe2\x80\x94if you will kindly tell me some day. It will\r\ninterest me greatly. You always were the most interesting of our\r\nfamily. Brother Tom promised to be a genius, but marriage has blighted\r\nthe hope, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe marriage was a very absurd one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it? I feared so; but Tom seems satisfied. I suppose they will stay\r\nat Madeira.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil his wife is tired of her imaginary phthisis, and amuses herself\r\nwith imagining some other ailment that requires them to go to Siberia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that kind of person, is she?\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled indulgently, and played\r\nfor a moment with the lobe of his right ear. His ears were small, and\r\nof the ideal contour; the hand, too, thus displayed, was a fine example\r\nof blended strength and elegance.\r\n\r\nRhoda came in, so quietly that she was able to observe the guest before\r\nhe had detected her presence. The movement of Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s eyes first\r\ninformed him that another person was in the room. In the quietest\r\npossible way the introduction was performed, and all seated themselves.\r\n\r\nDressed, like the hostess, in black, and without ornaments of any kind\r\nsave a silver buckle at her waist, Rhoda seemed to have endeavoured to\r\nliken herself to the suggestion of her name by the excessive plainness\r\nwith which she had arranged her hair; its tight smoothness was nothing\r\nlike so becoming as the mode she usually adopted, and it made her look\r\nolder. Whether by accident or design, she took an upright chair, and\r\nsat upon it in a stiff attitude. Finding it difficult to suspect Rhoda\r\nof shyness, Miss Barfoot once or twice glanced at her with curiosity.\r\nFor settled conversation there was no time; a servant announced dinner\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere shall be no forms, cousin Everard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease to\r\nfollow us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoing so, Everard examined Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s figure, which in its way was\r\nstrong and shapely as his own. A motion of his lips indicated amused\r\napproval, but at once he commanded himself, and entered the dining-room\r\nwith exemplary gravity. Naturally, he sat opposite Rhoda, and his eyes\r\noften skimmed her face; when she spoke, which was very seldom, he gazed\r\nat her with close attention.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the meal, Miss Barfoot questioned her relative\r\nconcerning his Oriental experiences. Everard spoke of them in a light,\r\nagreeable way, avoiding the tone of instruction, and, in short, giving\r\nevidence of good taste. Rhoda listened with a look of civil interest,\r\nbut asked no question, and smiled only when it was unavoidable.\r\nPresently the talk turned to things of home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard of your friend Mr. Poppleton?\xe2\x80\x9d the hostess asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoppleton? Nothing whatever. I should like to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to tell you he is in a lunatic asylum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Barfoot kept the silence of astonishment, his cousin went on to tell\r\nhim that the unhappy man seemed to have lost his wits among business\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I should have suggested another explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the young\r\nman, in his most discreet tone, \xe2\x80\x9cYou never met Mrs. Poppleton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that Miss Nunn had looked up with interest, he addressed himself\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend Poppleton was one of the most delightful men\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the\r\nbest and kindest I ever knew, and so overflowing with natural wit and\r\nhumour that there was no resisting his cheerful influence. To the\r\namazement of every one who knew him, he married perhaps the dullest\r\nwoman he could have found. Mrs. Poppleton not only never made a joke,\r\nbut couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what joking meant. Only the flattest literalism\r\nwas intelligible to her; she could follow nothing but the very macadam\r\nof conversation\xe2\x80\x94had no palate for anything but the suet-pudding of\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twinkled, and Miss Barfoot laughed. Everard was allowing\r\nhimself a freedom in expression which hitherto he had sedulously\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was by birth a lady\xe2\x80\x94which made the\r\ninfliction harder to bear. Poor old Poppleton! Again and again I have\r\nheard him\xe2\x80\x94what do you think?\xe2\x80\x94laboriously _explaining_ jests to her.\r\nThat was a trial, as you may imagine. There we sat, we three, in the\r\nunbeautiful little parlour\xe2\x80\x94for they were anything but rich. Poppleton\r\nwould say something that convulsed me with laughter\xe2\x80\x94in spite of my\r\nefforts, for I always dreaded the result so much that I strove my\r\nhardest to do no more than smile appreciation. My laugh compelled Mrs.\r\nPoppleton to stare at me\xe2\x80\x94oh, her eyes! Thereupon, her husband began\r\nhis dread performance. The patience, the heroic patience, of that dear,\r\ngood fellow! I have known him explain, and re-explain, for a quarter of\r\nan hour, and invariably without success. It might be a mere pun; Mrs.\r\nPoppleton no more understood the nature of a pun than of the binomial\r\ntheorem. But worse was when the jest involved some allusion. When I\r\nheard Poppleton begin to elucidate, to expound, the perspiration\r\nalready on his forehead, I looked at him with imploring anguish. Why\r\n_would_ he attempt the impossible? But the kind fellow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisregard his wife\xe2\x80\x99s request. Shall I ever forget her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x94when obviously she saw nothing but the wall at which she sat\r\nstaring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known her like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot merrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced his madness didn\xe2\x80\x99t come from business anxiety. It was\r\nthe necessity, ever recurring, ever before him, of expounding jokes to\r\nhis wife. Believe me, it was nothing but that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems very probable,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Rhoda dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there\xe2\x80\x99s another friend of yours whose marriage has been\r\nunfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cThey tell me that Mr. Orchard has\r\nforsaken his wife, and without intelligible reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, too, I can offer an explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Barfoot quietly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough you may doubt whether it justifies him. I met Orchard a few\r\nmonths ago in Alexandria, met him by chance in the street, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrecognize him until he spoke to me. He was worn to skin and bone. I\r\nfound that he had abandoned all his possessions to Mrs. Orchard, and\r\njust kept himself alive on casual work for the magazines, wandering\r\nabout the shores of the Mediterranean like an uneasy spirit. He showed\r\nme the thing he had last written, and I see it is published in this\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x99s _Macmillan_. Do read it. An exquisite description of a night in\r\nAlexandria. One of these days he will starve to death. A pity; he might\r\nhave done fine work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we await your explanation. What business has he to desert his wife\r\nand children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me give an account of a day I spent with him at Tintern, not long\r\nbefore I left England. He and his wife were having a holiday there, and\r\nI called on them. We went to walk about the Abbey. Now, for some two\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x94I will be strictly truthful\xe2\x80\x94whilst we were in the midst of that\r\nlovely scenery, Mrs. Orchard discoursed unceasingly of one subject\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndifficulty she had with her domestic servants. Ten or twelve of these\r\nhandmaidens were marshalled before our imagination; their names, their\r\nages, their antecedents, the wages they received, were carefully\r\nspecified. We listened to a _catalogue raisonne_ of the plates, cups,\r\nand other utensils that they had broken. We heard of the enormities\r\nwhich in each case led to their dismissal. Orchard tried repeatedly to\r\nchange the subject, but only with the effect of irritating his wife.\r\nWhat could he or I do but patiently give ear? Our walk was ruined, but\r\nthere was no help for it. Now, be good enough to extend this kind of\r\nthing over a number of years. Picture Orchard sitting down in his home\r\nto literary work, and liable at any moment to an invasion from Mrs.\r\nOrchard, who comes to tell him, at great length, that the butcher has\r\ncharged for a joint they have not consumed\xe2\x80\x94or something of that kind.\r\nHe assured me that his choice lay between flight and suicide, and I\r\nfirmly believed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he concluded, his eyes met those of Miss Nunn, and the latter\r\nsuddenly spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy will men marry fools?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot was startled. He looked down into his plate, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most sensible question,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hostess, with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nindeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a difficult one to answer,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Everard, with his most\r\nrestrained smile. \xe2\x80\x9cPossibly, Miss Nunn, narrow social opportunity has\r\nsomething to do with it. They must marry some one, and in the case of\r\nmost men choice is seriously restricted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rhoda, elevating her eyebrows, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nto live alone was the less of two evils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. But men like these two we have been speaking of haven\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nvery logical mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot changed the topic.\r\n\r\nWhen, not long after, the ladies left him to meditate over his glass of\r\nwine, Everard curiously surveyed the room. Then his eyelids drooped, he\r\nsmiled absently, and a calm sigh seemed to relieve his chest. The\r\nclaret had no particular quality to recommend it, and in any case he\r\nwould have drunk very little, for as regards the bottle his nature was\r\nabstemious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as I expected,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barfoot was saying to her friend in the\r\ndrawing-room. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has changed very noticeably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barfoot isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite the man your remarks had suggested to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRhoda replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy he is no longer the man I knew. His manners are wonderfully\r\nimproved. He used to assert himself in rather alarming ways. His\r\nletter, to be sure, had the old tone, or something of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to the library for an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, who had not seated\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barfoot won\xe2\x80\x99t leave before ten, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be any private talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, if you will let me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, when Everard appeared, he found his cousin alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of him good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo do? You mean, how do I propose to employ myself? I have nothing\r\nwhatever in view, beyond enjoying life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo young? Or so old? Which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo young, of course. You deliberately intend to waste your life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo enjoy it, I said. I am not prompted to any business or profession;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all over for me; I have learnt all I care to of the active\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you understand by enjoyment?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Barfoot, with\r\nknitted brows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the spectacle of existence quite enough to occupy one through a\r\nlifetime? If a man merely travelled, could he possibly exhaust all the\r\nbeauties and magnificences that are offered to him in every country?\r\nFor ten years and more I worked as hard as any man; I shall never\r\nregret it, for it has given me a feeling of liberty and opportunity\r\nsuch as I should not have known if I had always lived at my ease. It\r\ntaught me a great deal, too; supplemented my so-called education as\r\nnothing else could have done. But to work for ever is to lose half of\r\nlife. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand those people who reconcile themselves to\r\nquitting the world without having seen a millionth part of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite reconciled to that. An infinite picture gallery isn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nidea of enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor mine. But an infinite series of modes of living. A ceaseless\r\nexercise of all one\xe2\x80\x99s faculties of pleasure. That sounds shameless to\r\nyou? I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why it should. Why is the man who toils more\r\nmeritorious than he who enjoys? What is the sanction for this judgment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSocial usefulness, Everard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit the demand for social usefulness, up to a certain point. But,\r\nreally, I have done my share. The mass of men don\xe2\x80\x99t toil with any such\r\nideal, but merely to keep themselves alive, or to get wealth. I think\r\nthere is a vast amount of unnecessary labour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an old proverb about Satan and idle hands. Pardon me; you\r\nalluded to that personage in your letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe proverb is a very true one, but, like other proverbs, it applies\r\nto the multitude. If I get into mischief, it will not be because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t perspire for so many hours every day, but simply because it is\r\nhuman to err. I have no intention whatever of getting into mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker stroked his beard, and smiled with a distant look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour purpose is intensely selfish, and all indulged selfishness reacts\r\non the character,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Barfoot, still in a tone of the\r\nfriendliest criticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin, for anything to be selfish, it must be a deliberate\r\nrefusal of what one believes to be duty. I don\xe2\x80\x99t admit that I am\r\nneglecting any duty to others, and the duty to myself seems very clear\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf _that_ I have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI see that\r\nyou have refined your arguments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot my arguments only, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard modestly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time has\r\nbeen very ill spent if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t in some degree, refined my nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds very well, Everard. But when it comes to degrees of\r\nself-indulgence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused and made a gesture of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes to that, surely, with every man. But we certainly shall not\r\nagree on this subject. You stand at the social point of view; I am an\r\nindividualist. You have the advantage of a tolerably consistent theory;\r\nwhilst I have no theory at all, and am full of contradictions. The only\r\nthing clear to me is that I have a right to make the most of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter at whose expense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite mistaken. My conscience is a tender one. I dread to do\r\nany one an injury. That has always been true of me, in spite of your\r\nsceptical look; and the tendency increases as I grow older. Let us have\r\ndone with so unimportant a matter. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Nunn able to rejoin us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will come presently, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you make this lady\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot explained the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe makes an impression,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Everard. \xe2\x80\x9cA strong character, of\r\ncourse. More decidedly one of the new women than you yourself\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _I_ am a very old-fashioned woman. Women have thought as I do at\r\nany time in history. Miss Nunn has much more zeal for womanhood\r\nmilitant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should delight to talk with her. Really, you know, I am very\r\nstrongly on your side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sophist! You despise women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, the great majority of women\xe2\x80\x94the typical woman. All the more\r\nreason for my admiring the exceptions, and wishing to see them become\r\nmore common. You, undoubtedly, despise the average woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI despise no human being, Everard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in a sense! But Miss Nunn, I feel sure, would agree with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sure Miss Nunn wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t admire the feebler\r\nfemale, but that is very far from being at one with _your_ point of\r\nview, my cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard mused with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must get to understand her line of thought. You permit me to call\r\nupon you now and then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, whenever you like, in the evening. Except,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barfoot added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday evening. Then we are always engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSummer holidays are unknown to you, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot altogether. I had mine a few weeks ago. Miss Nunn will be going\r\naway in a fortnight, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust before ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when Barfoot was talking of some acquaintances\r\nhe had left in Japan, Rhoda entered the room. She seemed little\r\ndisposed for conversation, and Everard did not care to assail her\r\ntaciturnity this evening. He talked on a little longer, observing her\r\nas she listened, and presently took an opportunity to rise for\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday is the forbidden evening, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is devoted to business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had gone, the friends exchanged a look. Each understood\r\nthe other as referring to this point of Wednesday evening, but neither\r\nmade a remark. They were silent for some time. When Rhoda at length\r\nspoke it was in a tone of half-indifferent curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure you haven\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerated Mr. Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s failings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply was delayed for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a little indiscreet to speak of him at all. But no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexaggerate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurious,\xe2\x80\x9d mused the other dispassionately, as she stood with one foot\r\non the fender. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hardly strikes one as that kind of man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he has certainly changed a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot went on to speak of her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s resolve to pursue no\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis means are very modest. I feel rather guilty before him; his father\r\nbequeathed to me much of the money that would in the natural course\r\nhave been Everard\xe2\x80\x99s. But he is quite superior to any feeling of grudge\r\non that score.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPractically, his father disinherited him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt amounted to that. From quite a child, Everard was at odds with his\r\nfather. A strange thing, for in so many respects they resembled each\r\nother very closely. Physically, Everard is his father walking the earth\r\nagain. In character, too, I think they must be very much alike. They\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the simplest thing without disagreeing. My uncle\r\nhad risen from the ranks but he disliked to be reminded of it. He\r\ndisliked the commerce by which he made his fortune. His desire was to\r\nwin social position; if baronetcies could be purchased in our time, he\r\nwould have given a huge sum to acquire one. But he never distinguished\r\nhimself, and one of the reasons was, no doubt, that he married too\r\nsoon. I have heard him speak bitterly, and very indiscreetly, of early\r\nmarriages; his wife was dead then, but every one knew what he meant.\r\nRhoda, when one thinks how often a woman is a clog upon a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nambition, no wonder they regard us as they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, women are always retarding one thing or another. But men\r\nare intensely stupid not to have remedied that long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe determined that his boys should be gentlemen. Tom, the elder,\r\nfollowed his wishes exactly; he was remarkably clever, but idleness\r\nspoilt him, and now he has made that ridiculous marriage\xe2\x80\x94the end of\r\npoor Tom. Everard went to Eton, and the school had a remarkable effect\r\nupon him; it made him a furious Radical. Instead of imitating the young\r\naristocrats he hated and scorned them. There must have been great force\r\nof originality in the boy. Of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether any Etonians\r\nof his time preached Radicalism, but it seems unlikely. I think it was\r\nsheer vigour of character, and the strange desire to oppose his father\r\nin everything. From Eton he was of course to pass to Oxford, but at\r\nthat stage came practical rebellion. No, said the boy; he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nto a university, to fill his head with useless learning; he had made up\r\nhis mind to be an engineer. This was an astonishment to every one;\r\nengineering didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem at all the thing for him; he had very little\r\nability in mathematics, and his bent had always been to liberal\r\nstudies. But nothing could shake his idea. He had got it into his head\r\nthat only some such work as engineering\xe2\x80\x94something of a practical kind,\r\nthat called for strength and craftsmanship\xe2\x80\x94was worthy of a man with\r\nhis opinions. He would rank with the classes that keep the world going\r\nwith their sturdy toil: that was how he spoke. And, after a great\r\nfight, he had his way. He left Eton to study civil engineering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda was listening with an amused smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued her friend, \xe2\x80\x9ccame another display of firmness or\r\nobstinacy, whichever you like to call it. He soon found out that he had\r\nmade a complete mistake. The studies didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit him at all, as others\r\nhad foreseen. But he would have worked himself to death rather than\r\nconfess his error; none of us knew how he was feeling till long after.\r\nEngineering he had chosen, and an engineer he would be, cost him what\r\neffort it might. His father shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t triumph over him. And from the\r\nage of eighteen till nearly thirty he stuck to a profession which I am\r\nsure he loathed. By force of resolve he even got on to it, and reached\r\na good position with the firm he worked for. Of course his father\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t assist him with money after he came of age; he had to make his\r\nway just like any young man who has no influence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this puts him in quite another light,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Rhoda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it would be all very well, if there were no vices to add to the\r\npicture. I never experienced such a revulsion of feeling as the day\r\nwhen I learnt shameful things about Everard. You know, I always\r\nregarded him as a boy, and very much as if he had been my younger\r\nbrother; then came the shock\xe2\x80\x94a shock that had a great part in shaping\r\nmy life thenceforward. Since, I have thought of him as I have spoken of\r\nhim to you\xe2\x80\x94as an illustration of evils we have to combat. A man of the\r\nworld would tell you that I grossly magnified trifles; it is very\r\nlikely that Everard was on a higher moral level than most men. But I\r\nshall never forgive him for destroying my faith in his honour and\r\nnobility of feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda had a puzzled look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps even now you are unintentionally misleading me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave supposed him an outrageous profligate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was vicious and cowardly\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t say any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was the immediate cause of his father\xe2\x80\x99s leaving him poorly\r\nprovided for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had much to do with it, I have no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. I imagined that he was cast out of all decent society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf society were really decent, he would have been. It\xe2\x80\x99s strange how\r\ncompletely his Radicalism has disappeared. I believe he never had a\r\ngenuine sympathy with the labouring classes. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I fancy\r\nhe had a great deal of his father\xe2\x80\x99s desire for command and social\r\ndistinction. If he had seen his way to become a great engineer, a\r\ndirector of vast enterprises, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have abandoned his work. An\r\nincredible stubbornness has possibly spoilt his whole life. In a\r\ncongenial pursuit he might by this time have attained to something\r\nnoteworthy. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late now, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda meditated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he aim at nothing whatever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t admit any ambition. He has no society. His friends are nearly\r\nall obscure people, like those you heard him speak of this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, what ambition should he have?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, with a laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one advantage in being a woman. A woman with brains and will\r\nmay hope to distinguish herself in the greatest movement of our\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94that of emancipating her sex. But what can a man do, unless he\r\nhas genius?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the emancipation of the working classes. That is the great\r\nsphere for men; and Everard cares no more for the working classes than\r\nI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it enough to be free oneself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that he has task enough in striving to be an honourable man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. I hardly know what I meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot mused, and her face lighted up with a glad thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to be a woman, in our day. With us is all\r\nthe joy of advance, the glory of conquering. Men have only material\r\nprogress to think about. But we\xe2\x80\x94we are winning souls, propagating a\r\nnew religion, purifying the earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda nodded thrice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin is a fine specimen of a man, after all, in body and mind.\r\nBut what a poor, ineffectual creature compared with _you_, Rhoda! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t flatter you, dear. I tell you bluntly of your faults and\r\nextravagances. But I am proud of your magnificent independence, proud\r\nof your pride, dear, and of your stainless heart. Thank Heaven we are\r\nwomen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was rare indeed for Miss Barfoot to be moved to rhapsody. Again\r\nRhoda nodded, and then they laughed together, with joyous confidence in\r\nthemselves and in their cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLE FAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nSeated in the reading-room of a club to which he had newly procured\r\nadmission, Everard Barfoot was glancing over the advertisement columns\r\nof a literary paper. His eye fell on an announcement that had a\r\npersonal interest to him, and at once he went to the writing-table to\r\npen a letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MICKLETHWAITE,\xe2\x80\x94I am back in England, and ought before this to\r\nhave written to you. I see you have just published a book with an\r\nalarming title, \xe2\x80\x9cA Treatise on Trilinear Co-ordinates.\xe2\x80\x9d My hearty\r\ncongratulations on the completion of such a labour; were you not the\r\nmost disinterested of mortals, I would add a hope that it may somehow\r\nbenefit you financially. I presume there _are_ people who purchase such\r\nworks. But of course the main point with you is to have delivered your\r\nsoul on Trilinear Co-ordinates. Shall I run down to Sheffield to see\r\nyou, or is there any chance of the holidays bringing you this way? I\r\nhave found a cheap flat, poorly furnished, in Bayswater; the man who\r\nlet it to me happens to be an engineer, and is absent on Italian\r\nrailway work for a year or so. My stay in London won\xe2\x80\x99t, I think, be for\r\nlonger than six months, but we must see each other and talk over old\r\ntimes,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nThis he addressed to a school at Sheffield. The answer, directed to the\r\nclub, reached him in three days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy DEAR BARFOOT,\xe2\x80\x94I also am in London; your letter has been forwarded\r\nfrom the school, which I quitted last Easter. Disinterested or not, I\r\nam happy to tell you that I have got a vastly better appointment. Let\r\nme know when and where to meet you; or if you like, come to these\r\nlodgings of mine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t enter upon duties till end of October, and am\r\nat present revelling in mathematical freedom. There\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to\r\ntell.\xe2\x80\x94Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MICKLETHWAITE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving no occupation for his morning, Barfoot went at once to the\r\nobscure little street by Primrose Hill where his friend was lodging. He\r\nreached the house about noon, and, as he had anticipated, found the\r\nmathematician deep in study. Micklethwaite was a man of forty, bent in\r\nthe shoulders, sallow, but not otherwise of unhealthy appearance; he\r\nhad a merry countenance, a great deal of lank, disorderly hair, and a\r\nbeard that reached to the middle of his waistcoat. Everard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance with him dated from ten years ago, when Micklethwaite had\r\nacted as his private tutor in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe room was a musty little back-parlour on the ground floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet, perfectly quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d declared its occupant, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s all I care\r\nfor. Two other lodgers in the house; but they go to business every\r\nmorning at half-past eight, and are in bed by ten at night. Besides,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s only temporary. I have great things in view\xe2\x80\x94portentous changes!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe insisted, first of all, on hearing a full account of Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory since they both met. They had corresponded about twice a year,\r\nbut Everard was not fond of letter-writing, and on each occasion gave\r\nonly the briefest account of himself. In listening, Micklethwaite\r\nassumed extraordinary positions, the result, presumably, of a need of\r\nphysical exercise after hours spent over his work. Now he stretched\r\nhimself at full length on the edge of his chair, his arms extended\r\nabove him; now he drew up his legs, fixed his feet on the chair, and\r\nlocked his hands round his knees; thus perched, he swayed his body\r\nbackwards and forwards, till it seemed likely that he would pitch head\r\nforemost on to the floor. Barfoot knew these eccentricities of old, and\r\npaid no attention to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the appointment you have got?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at length,\r\ndismissing his own affairs with impatience.\r\n\r\nIt was that of mathematical lecturer at a London college.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have a hundred and fifty a year, and be able to take private\r\npupils. On two hundred, at least, I can count, and there are\r\npossibilities I won\xe2\x80\x99t venture to speak of, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do to be\r\ntoo hopeful. Two hundred a year is a great advance for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite enough, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot\xe2\x80\x94not enough. I must make a little more somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHollo! Why this spirit of avarice all at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mathematician gave a shrill, cackling laugh, and rolled upon his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have more than two hundred. I should be satisfied with _three_\r\nhundred, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take as much more as I can get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy revered tutor, this is shameless. I came to pay my respects to a\r\nphilosopher, and I find a sordid worldling. Look at me! I am a man of\r\nthe largest needs, spiritual and physical, yet I make my pittance of\r\nfour hundred and fifty suffice, and never grumble. Perhaps you aim at\r\nan income equal to my own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do! What\xe2\x80\x99s four hundred and fifty? If you were a man of enterprise\r\nyou would double or treble it. I put a high value on money. I wish to\r\nbe _rich_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are either mad or are going to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMicklethwaite cackled louder than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am planning a new algebra for school use. If I\xe2\x80\x99m not much mistaken,\r\nI can turn out something that will supplant all the present books.\r\nThink! If Micklethwaite\xe2\x80\x99s Algebra got accepted in all the schools, what\r\nwould that mean to Mick? Hundreds a year, my boy\xe2\x80\x94hundreds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew you so indecent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am renewing my youth. Nay, for the first time I am youthful. I never\r\nhad time for it before. At the age of sixteen I began to teach in a\r\nschool, and ever since I have pegged away at it, school and private.\r\nNow luck has come to me, and I feel five-and-twenty. When I was really\r\nfive-and-twenty, I felt forty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what has that to do with money-making?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Mick\xe2\x80\x99s Algebra would follow naturally Mick\xe2\x80\x99s Arithmetic, Mick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nEuclid, Mick\xe2\x80\x99s Trigonometry. Twenty years hence I should have an income\r\nof thousands\xe2\x80\x94thousands! I would then cease to teach (resign my\r\nprofessorship\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, for of course I should be professor),\r\nand devote myself to a great work on Probability. Many a man has begun\r\nthe best of his life at sixty\xe2\x80\x94the most enjoyable part of it, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot was perplexed. He knew his friend\xe2\x80\x99s turn for humorous\r\nexaggeration, but had never once heard him scheme for material\r\nadvancement, and evidently this present talk meant something more than\r\na jest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I right or not? You are going to get married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMicklethwaite glanced at the door, then said in a tone of caution,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to talk about it here. Let us go somewhere and eat\r\ntogether. I invite you to have dinner with me\xe2\x80\x94or lunch, as I suppose\r\nyou would call it, in your aristocratic language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you had better have lunch with me. Come to my club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound your impudence! Am I not your father in mathematics?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to put on a decent pair of trousers, and brush your\r\nhair. Ah, here is your Trilinear production. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look over it whilst\r\nyou make yourself presentable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bad misprint in the Preface. Let me show you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to me, my dear fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Micklethwaite was not content until he had indicated the error, and\r\nhad talked for five minutes about the absurdities that it involved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you suppose I got the thing published?\xe2\x80\x9d he then asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOld\r\nBennet, the Sheffield headmaster, is security for loss if the book\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for itself in two years\xe2\x80\x99 time. Kind of him, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? He\r\npressed the offer upon me, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s prouder of the book than I\r\nam myself. But it\xe2\x80\x99s quite remarkable how kind people are when one is\r\nfortunate. I fancy a great deal of nonsense is talked about the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenviousness. Now as soon as it got known that I was coming to this post\r\nin London, people behaved to me with surprising good nature all round.\r\nOld Bennet talked in quite an affectionate strain. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI have long known that you ought to be in a better place than\r\nthis; your payment is altogether inadequate; if it had depended upon\r\n_me_, I should long ago have increased it. I truly rejoice that you\r\nhave found a more fitting sphere for your remarkable abilities.\xe2\x80\x9d No; I\r\nmaintain that the world is always ready to congratulate you with\r\nsincerity, if you will only give it a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery gracious of you to give it the chance. But, by-the-bye, how did\r\nit come about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I ought to tell you that. Why, about a year ago, I wrote an\r\nanswer to a communication signed by a Big Gun in one of the scientific\r\npapers. It was a question in Probability\xe2\x80\x94you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.\r\nMy answer was printed, and the Big Gun wrote privately to me\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\nflattering letter. That correspondence led to my appointment; the Big\r\nGun exerted himself on my behalf. The fact is, the world is bursting\r\nwith good nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObviously. And how long did it take you to write this little book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, only about seven years\xe2\x80\x94the actual composition. I never had much\r\ntime to myself, you must remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good soul, Thomas. Go and equip yourself for civilized\r\nsociety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the club they repaired on foot. Micklethwaite would talk of anything\r\nbut that which his companion most desired to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are solemnities in life,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered to an impatient question,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthings that can\xe2\x80\x99t be spoken of in the highway. When we have eaten, let\r\nus go to your flat, and there I will tell you everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey lunched joyously. The mathematician drank a bottle of excellent\r\nhock, and did corresponding justice to the dishes. His eyes gleamed\r\nwith happiness; again he enlarged upon the benevolence of mankind, and\r\nthe admirable ordering of the world. From the club they drove to\r\nBayswater, and made themselves comfortable in Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s flat, which was\r\nvery plainly, but sufficiently, furnished. Micklethwaite, cigar in\r\nmouth, threw his legs over the side of the easy-chair in which he was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he began gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you that your conjecture\r\nwas right. I _am_ going to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have reached the age of discretion. I must\r\nsuppose that you know what you are about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I do. The story is unexciting. I am not a romantic\r\nperson, nor is my future wife. Now, you must know that when I was about\r\ntwenty-three years old I fell in love. You never suspected me of that,\r\nI dare say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I did fall in love. The lady was a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter at\r\nHereford, where I had a place in a school; she taught the infants in an\r\nelementary school connected with ours; her age was exactly the same as\r\nmy own. Now, the remarkable thing was that she took a liking for me,\r\nand when I was scoundrel enough to tell her of my feeling, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreject me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoundrel enough? Why scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? But I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a penny in the world. I lived at the school, and\r\nreceived a salary of thirty pounds, half of which had to go towards the\r\nsupport of my mother. What could possibly have been more villainous?\r\nWhat earthly prospect was there of my being able to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, grant the monstrosity of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lady\xe2\x80\x94a very little lower than the angels\xe2\x80\x94declared that she was\r\ncontent to wait an indefinite time. She believed in me, and hoped for\r\nmy future. Her father\xe2\x80\x94the mother was dead\xe2\x80\x94sanctioned our engagement.\r\nShe had three sisters, one of them a governess, another keeping house,\r\nand the third a blind girl. Excellent people, all of them. I was at\r\ntheir house as often as possible, and they made much of me. It was a\r\npity, you know, for in those few leisure hours I ought to have been\r\nworking like a nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlainly you ought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, I left Hereford, and went to a school at Gloucester,\r\nwhere I had thirty-five pounds. How we gloried over that extra five\r\npounds! But it\xe2\x80\x99s no use going on with the story in this way; it would\r\ntake me till to-morrow morning. Seven years went by; we were thirty\r\nyears old, and no prospect whatever of our engagement coming to\r\nanything. I had worked pretty hard; I had taken my London degree; but\r\nnot a penny had I saved, and all I could spare was still needful to my\r\nmother. It struck me all at once that I had no right to continue the\r\nengagement. On my thirtieth birthday I wrote a letter to Fanny\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nher name\xe2\x80\x94and begged her to be free. Now, would you have done the same,\r\nor not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I am not imaginative enough to put myself in such a position.\r\nIt would need a stupendous effort, at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut was there anything gross in the proceeding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady took it ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the sense of being offended. But she said it had caused her\r\nmuch suffering. She begged me to consider _myself_ free. She would\r\nremain faithful, and if, in time to come, I cared to write to her\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94After all these years, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it without huskiness. It\r\nseemed to me that I had behaved more like a scoundrel than ever. I\r\nthought I had better kill myself, and even planned ways of doing it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndid indeed. But after all we decided that our engagement should\r\ncontinue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it natural? Well, the engagement has continued till this\r\nday. A month ago I was forty, so that we have waited for seventeen\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMicklethwaite paused on a note of awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s sisters are dead; they never married. The blind one\r\nFanny has long supported, and she will come to live with us. Long, long\r\nago we had both of us given up thought of marriage. I have never spoken\r\nto any one of the engagement; it was something too absurd, and also too\r\nsacred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smile died from Everard\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he sat in thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, when are _you_ going to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Micklethwaite, with a\r\nrevival of his cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think you will neglect a grave duty. Yes. It is the duty of\r\nevery man, who has sufficient means, to maintain a wife. The life of\r\nunmarried women is a wretched one; every man who is able ought to save\r\none of them from that fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like my cousin Mary and her female friends to hear you talk\r\nin that way. They would overwhelm you with scorn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot sincere scorn, is my belief. Of course I have heard of that kind\r\nof woman. Tell me something about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot was led on to a broad expression of his views.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admire your old-fashioned sentiment, Micklethwaite. It sits well on\r\nyou, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a fine fellow. But I have much more sympathy with the\r\nnew idea that women should think of marriage only as men do\xe2\x80\x94I mean,\r\nnot to grow up in the thought that they must marry or be blighted\r\ncreatures. My own views are rather extreme, perhaps; strictly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve in marriage at all. And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t anything like the respect for\r\nwomen, as women, that you have. You belong to the Ruskin school; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94well, perhaps my experience has been unusual, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nso. You know, by-the-bye, that my relatives consider me a blackguard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat affair you told me about some years ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChiefly that. I have a good mind to tell you the true story; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare to at the time. I accepted the charge of black-guardism; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter much. My cousin will never forgive me, though she has an air of\r\nfriendliness once more. And I suspect she had told her friend Miss Nunn\r\nall about me. Perhaps to put Miss Nunn on her guard\xe2\x80\x94Heaven knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn, I dare say, needs no protection against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had an odd thought whilst I was there.\xe2\x80\x9d Everard leaned his head\r\nback, and half closed his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn, I warrant, considers\r\nherself proof against any kind of wooing. She is one of the grandly\r\nsevere women; a terror, I imagine, to any young girl at their place who\r\nbetrays weak thoughts of matrimony. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather a temptation to a\r\nman of my kind. There would be something piquant in making vigorous\r\nlove to Miss Nunn, just to prove her sincerity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMicklethwaite shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnworthy of you, Barfoot. Of course you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really do such a\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut such women really challenge one. If she were rich, I think I could\r\ndo it without scruple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be taking it for granted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mathematician,\r\nsmiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this lady would\xe2\x80\x94would respond to your love-making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess to you that women have spoilt me. And I am rather resentful\r\nwhen any one cries out against me for lack of respect to womanhood. I\r\nhave been the victim of this groundless veneration for females. Now you\r\nshall hear the story; and bear in mind that you are the only person to\r\nwhom I have ever told it. I never tried to defend myself when I was\r\nvilified on all hands. Probably the attempt would have been useless;\r\nand then it would certainly have increased the odium in which I stood.\r\nI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell cousin Mary the truth some day; it would be good for\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listener looked uneasy, but curious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I was staying in the summer with some friends of ours at a\r\nlittle place called Upchurch, on a branch line from Oxford. The people\r\nwere well-to-do\xe2\x80\x94Goodall their name\xe2\x80\x94and went in for philanthropy. Mrs.\r\nGoodall always had a lot of Upchurch girls about her, educated and not;\r\nher idea was to civilize one class by means of the other, and to give a\r\nnew spirit to both. My cousin Mary was staying at the house whilst I\r\nwas there. She had more reasonable views than Mrs. Goodall, but took a\r\ngreat interest in what was going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow one of the girls in process of spiritualization was called Amy\r\nDrake. In the ordinary course of things I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have met her, but\r\nshe served in a shop where I went two or three times to get a\r\nnewspaper; we talked a little\xe2\x80\x94with absolute propriety on my part, I\r\nassure you\xe2\x80\x94and she knew that I was a friend of the Goodalls. The girl\r\nhad no parents, and she was on the point of going to London to live\r\nwith a married sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happened that by the very train which took me back to London, when\r\nmy visit was over, this girl also travelled, and alone. I saw her at\r\nUpchurch Station, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, and I got into a smoking\r\ncarriage. We had to change at Oxford, and there, as I walked about the\r\nplatform, Amy put herself in my way, so that I was obliged to begin\r\ntalking with her. This behaviour rather surprised me. I wondered what\r\nMrs. Goodall would think of it. But perhaps it was a sign of innocent\r\nfreedom in the intercourse of men and women. At all events, Amy managed\r\nto get me into the same carriage with herself, and on the way to London\r\nwe were alone. You foresee the end of it. At Paddington Station the\r\ngirl and I went off together, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s till\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I take it for granted that you believe my account of the\r\nmatter. Miss Drake was by no means the spiritual young person that Mrs.\r\nGoodall thought her, or hoped to make her; plainly, she was a reprobate\r\nof experience. This, you will say, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter the fact that I also\r\nbehaved like a reprobate. No; from the moralist\xe2\x80\x99s point of view I was\r\nto blame. But I had no moral pretentions, and it was too much to expect\r\nthat I should rebuke the young woman and preach her a sermon. You admit\r\nthat, I dare say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mathematician, frowning uncomfortably, gave a nod of assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmy was not only a reprobate, but a rascal. She betrayed me to the\r\npeople at Upchurch, and, I am quite sure, meant from the first to do\r\nso. Imagine the outcry. I had committed a monstrous crime\xe2\x80\x94had led\r\nastray an innocent maiden, had outraged hospitality\xe2\x80\x94and so on. In\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s case there were awkward results. Of course I must marry the girl\r\nforthwith. But of course I was determined to do no such thing. For the\r\nreasons I have explained, I let the storm break upon me. I had been a\r\nfool, to be sure, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help myself. No one would have believed\r\nmy plea\xe2\x80\x94no one would have allowed that the truth was an excuse. I was\r\nabused on all hands. And when, shortly after, my father made his will\r\nand died, doubtless he cut me off with my small annuity on this very\r\naccount. My cousin Mary got a good deal of the money that would\r\notherwise have been mine. The old man had been on rather better terms\r\nwith me just before that; in a will that he destroyed I believe he had\r\ntreated me handsomely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Micklethwaite, \xe2\x80\x9cevery one knows there are detestable\r\nwomen to be found. But you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to let this affect your view of\r\nwomen in general. What became of the girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made her a small allowance for a year and a half. Then her child\r\ndied, and the allowance ceased. I know nothing more of her. Probably\r\nshe has inveigled some one into marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, rolling about in his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nopinion remains the same. You are in debt to some worthy woman to the\r\nextent of half your income. Be quick and find her. It will be better\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Everard, with a smile of indulgence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nI could marry on four hundred and fifty a year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens! Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite impossible. A wife _might_ be acceptable to me; but marriage\r\nwith poverty\xe2\x80\x94I know myself and the world too well for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoverty!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the mathematician. \xe2\x80\x9cFour hundred and fifty pounds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrinding poverty\xe2\x80\x94for married people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMicklethwaite burst into indignant eloquence, and Everard sat listening\r\nwith the restrained smile on his lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFIRST PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving allowed exactly a week to go by, Everard Barfoot made use of his\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s permission, and called upon her at nine in the evening. Miss\r\nBarfoot\xe2\x80\x99s dinner-hour was seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock; she and Rhoda, when alone,\r\nrarely sat for more than half an hour at table, and in this summer\r\nseason they often went out together at sunset to enjoy a walk along the\r\nriver. This evening they had returned only a few minutes before\r\nEverard\xe2\x80\x99s ring sounded at the door. Miss Barfoot (they were just\r\nentering the library) looked at her friend and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if that is the young man. Very flattering if he has\r\ncome again so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor was in mirthful humour, and met with a reception of\r\ncorresponding tone. He remarked at once that Miss Nunn had a much\r\npleasanter aspect than a week ago; her smile was ready and agreeable;\r\nshe sat in a sociable attitude and answered a jesting triviality with\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my reasons for coming to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to tell you a\r\nremarkable story. It connects\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he addressed his cousin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwith our talk\r\nabout the matrimonial disasters of those two friends of mine. Do you\r\nremember the name of Micklethwaite\xe2\x80\x94a man who used to cram me with\r\nmathematics? I thought you would. He is on the point of marrying, and\r\nhis engagement has lasted just seventeen years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wisest of your friends, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent fellow. He is forty, and the lady the same. An\r\nastonishing case of constancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is it likely to turn out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t predict, as the lady is unknown to me. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with\r\nfacetious gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it likely that they are tolerably well\r\nacquainted with each other. Nothing but sheer poverty has kept them\r\napart. Pathetic, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? I have a theory that when an\r\nengagement has lasted ten years, with constancy on both sides, and\r\npoverty still prevents marriage, the State ought to make provision for\r\na man in some way, according to his social standing. When one thinks of\r\nit, a whole socialistic system lies in that suggestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Rhoda, \xe2\x80\x9cit were first provided that no marriage should\r\ntake place until _after_ a ten years\xe2\x80\x99 engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Barfoot assented, in his smoothest and most graceful tone. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\ncompletes the system. Unless you like to add that no engagement is\r\npermitted except between people who have passed a certain examination;\r\nequivalent, let us say, to that which confers a university degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable. And no marriage, except where both, for the whole\r\ndecennium, have earned their living by work that the State recognizes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would that affect Mr. Micklethwaite\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss\r\nBarfoot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has supported herself all along by teaching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd more likely than\r\nnot, with loathing of her occupation. The usual kind of drudgery, was\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, there must be some one to teach children to read and write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but people who are thoroughly well trained for the task, and who\r\ntake a pleasure in it. This lady may be an exception; but I picture her\r\nas having spent a lifetime of uncongenial toil, longing miserably for\r\nthe day when poor Mr. Micklethwaite was able to offer her a home.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the ordinary teacher-woman, and we must abolish her altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Everard suavely. \xe2\x80\x9cThe average man\r\nlabours that he may be able to marry, and the average woman certainly\r\nhas the same end in view. Are female teachers to be vowed to celibacy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the kind. But girls are to be brought up to a calling in\r\nlife, just as men are. It\xe2\x80\x99s because they have no calling that, when\r\nneed comes, they all offer themselves as teachers. They undertake one\r\nof the most difficult and arduous pursuits as if it were as simple as\r\nwashing up dishes. We can\xe2\x80\x99t earn money in any other way, but we can\r\nteach children! A man only becomes a schoolmaster or tutor when he has\r\ngone through laborious preparation\xe2\x80\x94anything but wise or adequate, of\r\ncourse, but still conscious preparation; and only a very few men,\r\ncomparatively, choose that line of work. Women must have just as wide a\r\nchoice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s plausible, cousin Mary. But remember that when a man chooses\r\nhis calling he chooses it for life. A girl cannot but remember that if\r\nshe marries her calling at once changes. The old business is thrown\r\naside\xe2\x80\x94henceforth profitless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not henceforth profitless! There\xe2\x80\x99s the very point I insist upon.\r\nSo far is it from profitless, that it has made her a wholly different\r\nwoman from what she would otherwise have been. Instead of a moping,\r\nmawkish creature, with\xe2\x80\x94in most instances\xe2\x80\x94a very unhealthy mind, she\r\nis a complete human being. She stands on an equality with the man. He\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t despise her as he now does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Everard, observing Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that view very much. But what about the great number of girls\r\nwho are claimed by domestic duties? Do you abandon them, with a\r\nhelpless sigh, to be moping and mawkish and unhealthy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, there needn\xe2\x80\x99t be a great number of unmarried women\r\nclaimed by such duties. Most of those you are thinking of are not\r\nfulfilling a duty at all; they are only pottering about the house,\r\nbecause they have nothing better to do. And when the whole course of\r\nfemale education is altered; when girls are trained as a matter of\r\ncourse to some definite pursuit; then those who really are obliged to\r\nremain at home will do their duty there in quite a different spirit.\r\nHome work will be their serious business, instead of a disagreeable\r\ndrudgery, or a way of getting through the time till marriage offers. I\r\nwould have no girl, however wealthy her parent, grow up without a\r\nprofession. There should be no such thing as a class of females\r\nvulgarized by the necessity of finding daily amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor of males either, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Everard, stroking his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor of males either, cousin Everard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thoroughly approve all this, Miss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. But I go further. I would have girls taught that marriage is a\r\nthing to be avoided rather than hoped for. I would teach them that for\r\nthe majority of women marriage means disgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Now do let me understand you. Why does it mean disgrace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the majority of men are without sense of honour. To be bound\r\nto them in wedlock is shame and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard\xe2\x80\x99s eyelids drooped, and he did not speak for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you seriously think, Miss Nunn, that by persuading as many women\r\nas possible to abstain from marriage you will improve the character of\r\nmen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no hope of sudden results, Mr. Barfoot. I should like to save\r\nas many as possible of the women now living from a life of dishonour;\r\nbut the spirit of our work looks to the future. When _all_ women, high\r\nand low alike, are trained to self-respect, then men will regard them\r\nin a different light, and marriage may be honourable to both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Everard was silent, and seemingly impressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go on with this discussion another time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot,\r\nwith cheerful interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cEverard, do you know Somerset at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever was in that part of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn is going to take her holiday at Cheddar and we have been\r\nlooking over some photographs of that district taken by her brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the table she reached a scrapbook, and Everard turned it over with\r\ninterest. The views were evidently made by an amateur, but in general\r\nhad no serious faults. Cheddar cliffs were represented in several\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea the scenery was so fine. Cheddar cheese has quite\r\novershadowed the hills in my imagination. This might be a bit of\r\nCumberland, or of the Highlands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my playground when I was a child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were born at Cheddar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; at Axbridge, a little place not far off. But I had an uncle at\r\nCheddar, a farmer, and very often stayed with him. My brother is\r\nfarming there now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAxbridge? Here is a view of the market-place. What a delightful old\r\ntown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the sleepiest spots in England, I should say. The railway goes\r\nthrough it now, but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made the slightest difference. Nobody pulls\r\ndown or builds; nobody opens a new shop; nobody thinks of extending his\r\ntrade. A delicious place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you find no pleasure in that kind of thing, Miss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94at holiday time. I shall doze there for a fortnight, and\r\nforget all about the \xe2\x80\x9cso-called nineteenth century.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly believe it. There will be a disgraceful marriage at this\r\nbeautiful old church, and the sight of it will exasperate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda laughed gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it will be a marriage of the golden age! Perhaps I shall remember\r\nthe bride when she was a little girl; and I shall give her a kiss, and\r\npat her on the rosy cheek, and wish her joy. And the bridegroom will be\r\nsuch a good-hearted simpleton, unable to pronounce _f_ and _s_. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind that sort of marriage a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listeners were both regarding her\xe2\x80\x94Miss Barfoot with an\r\naffectionate smile, Everard with a puzzled, searching look, ending in\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must run down into that country some day,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter.\r\n\r\nHe did not stay much longer, but left only because he feared to burden\r\nthe ladies with too much of his company.\r\n\r\nAgain a week passed, and the same evening found Barfoot approaching the\r\nhouse in Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road. To his great annoyance he learnt that Miss\r\nBarfoot was not at home; she had dined, but afterwards had gone out. He\r\ndid not venture to ask for Miss Nunn, and was moving disappointedly\r\naway, when Rhoda herself, returning from a walk, came up to the door.\r\nShe offered her hand gravely, but with friendliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Barfoot, I am sorry to say, has gone to visit one of our girls\r\nwho is ill. But I think she will very soon be back. Will you come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGladly. I had so counted on an hour\xe2\x80\x99s talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda led him to the drawing-room, excused herself for a few moments,\r\nand came back in her ordinary evening dress. Barfoot noticed that her\r\nhair was much more becomingly arranged than when he first saw her; so\r\nit had been on the last occasion, but for some reason its appearance\r\nattracted his eyes this evening. He scrutinized her, at discreet\r\nintervals, from head to foot. To Everard, nothing female was alien;\r\nwoman, merely as woman, interested him profoundly. And this example of\r\nher sex had excited his curiosity in no common degree. His concern with\r\nher was purely intellectual; she had no sensual attraction for him, but\r\nhe longed to see further into her mind, to probe the sincerity of the\r\nmotives she professed, to understand her mechanism, her process of\r\ngrowth. Hitherto he had enjoyed no opportunity of studying this type.\r\nFor his cousin was a very different person; by habit he regarded her as\r\nold, whereas Miss Nunn, in spite of her thirty years, could not\r\npossibly be considered past youth.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed her air of equality; she sat down with him as a male\r\nacquaintance might have done, and he felt sure that her behaviour would\r\nbe the same under any circumstances. He delighted in the frankness of\r\nher speech; it was doubtful whether she regarded any subject as\r\nimproper for discussion between mature and serious people. Part cause\r\nof this, perhaps, was her calm consciousness that she had not a\r\nbeautiful face. No, it was not beautiful; yet even at the first meeting\r\nit did not repel him. Studying her features, he saw how fine was their\r\nexpression. The prominent forehead, with its little unevenness that\r\nmeant brains; the straight eyebrows, strongly marked, with deep\r\nvertical furrows generally drawn between them; the chestnut-brown eyes,\r\nwith long lashes; the high-bridged nose, thin and delicate; the\r\nintellectual lips, a protrusion of the lower one, though very slight,\r\nmarking itself when he caught her profile; the big, strong chin; the\r\nshapely neck\xe2\x80\x94why, after all, it was a kind of beauty. The head might\r\nhave been sculptured with fine effect. And she had a well-built frame.\r\nHe observed her strong wrists, with exquisite vein-tracings on the pure\r\nwhite. Probably her constitution was very sound; she had good teeth,\r\nand a healthy brownish complexion.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the sick girl whom Miss Barfoot was visiting, Everard\r\nbegan what was practically a resumption of their last talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a formal society, with rules and so on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you of course select the girls whom you instruct or employ?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I should like to see them all!\xe2\x80\x94I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a laugh,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit would be so very interesting. The truth is, my sympathies are\r\nstrongly with you in much of what you said the other day about women\r\nand marriage. We regard the matter from different points of view, but\r\nour ends are the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda moved her eyebrows, and asked calmly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly. You are absorbed in your present work, that of\r\nstrengthening women\xe2\x80\x99s minds and character; for the final issue of this\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t care much. But to me that is the practical interest. In my\r\nmind, you are working for the happiness of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d escaped Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s lips, which had curled in irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me. I am not speaking cynically or trivially. The\r\ngain of women is also the gain of men. You are bitter against the\r\naverage man for his low morality; but that fault, on the whole, is\r\ndirectly traceable to the ignobleness of women. Think, and you will\r\ngrant me this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see what you mean. Men have themselves to thank for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly they have. I say that I am on your side. Our civilization in\r\nthis point has always been absurdly defective. Men have kept women at a\r\nbarbarous stage of development, and then complain that they are\r\nbarbarous. In the same way society does its best to create a criminal\r\nclass, and then rages against the criminals. But, you see, I am one of\r\nthe men, and an impatient one too. The mass of women I see about me are\r\nso contemptible that, in my haste, I use unjust language. Put yourself\r\nin the man\xe2\x80\x99s place. Say that there are a million or so of us very\r\nintelligent and highly educated. Well, the women of corresponding mind\r\nnumber perhaps a few thousands. The vast majority of men must make a\r\nmarriage that is doomed to be a dismal failure. We fall in love it is\r\ntrue; but do we really deceive ourselves about the future? A very young\r\nman may; why, we know of very young men who are so frantic as to marry\r\ngirls of the working class\xe2\x80\x94mere lumps of human flesh. But most of us\r\nknow that our marriage is a _pis aller_. At first we are sad about it;\r\nthen we grow cynical, and snap our fingers at moral obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking a bad case very much worse, instead of bravely bettering it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but human nature is human nature. I am only urging to you the\r\ncase of average intelligent men. As likely as not\xe2\x80\x94so preposterous are\r\nour conventions\xe2\x80\x94you have never heard it put honestly. I tell you the\r\nsimple truth when I say that more than half these men regard their\r\nwives with active disgust. They will do anything to be relieved of the\r\nsight of them for as many hours as possible at a time. If circumstances\r\nallowed, wives would be abandoned very often indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou regret that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer to say that I approve it when it is done without disregard of\r\ncommon humanity. There\xe2\x80\x99s my friend Orchard. With him it was suicide or\r\nfreedom from his hateful wife. Most happily, he was able to make\r\nprovision for her and the children, and had strength to break his\r\nbonds. If he had left them to starve, I should have _understood_ it,\r\nbut couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have approved it. There are men who might follow his\r\nexample, but prefer to put up with a life of torture. Well, they _do_\r\nprefer it, you see. I may think that they are foolishly weak, but I can\r\nonly recognize that they make a choice between two forms of suffering.\r\nThey have tender consciences; the thought of desertion is too painful\r\nto them. And in a great number of cases, mere considerations of money\r\nand the like keep a man bound. But conscience and habit\xe2\x80\x94detestable\r\nhabit\xe2\x80\x94and fear of public opinion generally hold him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this is very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, with grave irony.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye, under the head of detestable habit you would put love of\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a motive I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have left out. Yet I believe, for most\r\nmen, it is represented by conscience. The love of children would not\r\ngenerally, in itself, be strong enough to outweigh matrimonial\r\nwretchedness. Many an intelligent and kind-hearted man has been driven\r\nfrom his wife notwithstanding thought for his children. He provides for\r\nthem as well as he can\xe2\x80\x94but, and even for their sakes, he must save\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression of Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s countenance suddenly changed. An extreme\r\nmobility of facial muscles was one of the things in her that held\r\nEverard\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something in your way of putting it that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, with much frankness; \xe2\x80\x9cbut of course I agree with you in the\r\nfacts. I am convinced that most marriages are hateful, from every point\r\nof view. But there will be no improvement until women have revolted\r\nagainst marriage, from a reasonable conviction of its hatefulness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you all success\xe2\x80\x94most sincerely I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, looked about the room, and stroked his ear. Then, in a grave\r\ntone,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own ideal of marriage involves perfect freedom on both sides. Of\r\ncourse it could only be realized where conditions are favourable;\r\npoverty and other wretched things force us so often to sin against our\r\nbest beliefs. But there are plenty of people who might marry on these\r\nideal terms. Perfect freedom, sanctioned by the sense of intelligent\r\nsociety, would abolish most of the evils we have in mind. But women\r\nmust first be civilized; you are quite right in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Miss Barfoot came in. She glanced from one to the\r\nother, and without speaking gave her hand to Everard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is your patient?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little better, I think. It is nothing dangerous. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a letter\r\nfrom your brother Tom. Perhaps I had better read it at once; there may\r\nbe news you would like to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down and broke the envelope. Whilst she was reading the letter\r\nto herself, Rhoda quietly left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is news,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot presently, \xe2\x80\x9cand of a\r\ndisagreeable kind. A few weeks ago\xe2\x80\x94before writing, that is\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nthrown off a horse and had a rib fractured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh? How is he going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting right again, he says. And they are coming back to England; his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s consumptive symptoms have disappeared, of course, and she is\r\nvery impatient to leave Madeira. It is to be hoped she will allow poor\r\nTom time to get his rib set. Probably that consideration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t weigh\r\nmuch with her. He says that he is writing to you by the same mail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard, with feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he complain about\r\nhis wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never has done till now, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a sentence here that reads\r\ndoubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cMuriel,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9chas been terribly upset about my\r\naccident. I can\xe2\x80\x99t persuade her that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get thrown on purpose; yet\r\nI assure you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf old Tom becomes ironical, he must be hard driven. I have no great\r\nlonging to meet Mrs. Thomas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a silly and a vulgar woman. But I told him that in plain terms\r\nbefore he married. It says much for his good nature that he remains so\r\nfriendly with me. Read the letter, Everard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94very kind things about me. Good old Tom! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I marry? Well,\r\nnow, one would have thought that his own experience\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot began to talk about something else. Before very long Rhoda\r\ncame back, and in the conversation that followed it was mentioned that\r\nshe would leave for her holiday in two days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been reading about Cheddar,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Everard, with animation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a flower grows among the rocks called the Cheddar pink. Do you\r\nknow it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you some specimens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you? That\xe2\x80\x99s very kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring _me_ a genuine pound or two of the cheese, Rhoda,\xe2\x80\x9d requested\r\nMiss Barfoot gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will. What they sell in the shops there is all sham, Mr.\r\nBarfoot\xe2\x80\x94like so much else in this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care nothing about the cheese. That\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for a\r\nmatter-of-fact person like cousin Mary, but _I_ have a strong vein of\r\npoetry; you must have noticed it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they shook hands,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will really bring me the flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d Everard said in a voice\r\nsensibly softened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make a note of it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reassuring answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAT NATURE\xe2\x80\x99S BIDDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sick girl whom Miss Barfoot had been to see was Monica Madden.\r\n\r\nWith strange suddenness, after several weeks of steady application to\r\nher work, in a cheerful spirit which at times rose to gaiety, Monica\r\nbecame dull, remiss, unhappy; then violent headaches attacked her, and\r\none morning she declared herself unable to rise. Mildred Vesper went to\r\nGreat Portland Street at the usual hour, and informed Miss Barfoot of\r\nher companion\xe2\x80\x99s illness. A doctor was summoned; to him it seemed\r\nprobable that the girl was suffering from consequences of overstrain at\r\nher old employment; there was nervous collapse, hysteria, general\r\ndisorder of the system. Had the patient any mental disquietude? Was\r\ntrouble of any kind (the doctor smiled) weighing upon her? Miss\r\nBarfoot, unable to answer these questions, held private colloquy with\r\nMildred; but the latter, though she pondered a good deal with\r\ncorrugated brows, could furnish no information.\r\n\r\nIn a day or two Monica was removed to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings at Lavender\r\nHill. Mrs. Conisbee managed to put a room at her disposal, and Virginia\r\ntended her. Thither Miss Barfoot went on the evening when Everard found\r\nher away; she and Virginia, talking together after being with the\r\ninvalid for a quarter of an hour, agreed that there was considerable\r\nimprovement, but felt a like uneasiness regarding Monica\xe2\x80\x99s state of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the visitor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she regrets the step I\r\npersuaded her to take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ think that! She has been so delighted with her progress\r\neach time I have seen her. No, I feel sure it\xe2\x80\x99s only the results of\r\nwhat she suffered at Walworth Road. In a very short time we shall have\r\nher at work again, and brighter than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot was not convinced. After Everard\xe2\x80\x99s departure that evening\r\nshe talked of the matter with Rhoda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nunn, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Monica is rather a silly girl. She\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know her own mind. If this kind of thing is repeated, we had\r\nbetter send her back to the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo shop work again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the thought of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda had one of her fits of wrathful eloquence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow could one have a better instance than this Madden family of the\r\ncrime that middle-class parents commit when they allow their girls to\r\ngo without rational training? Of course I know that Monica was only a\r\nlittle child when they were left orphans; but her sisters had already\r\ngrown up into uselessness, and their example has been harmful to her\r\nall along. Her guardians dealt with her absurdly; they made her half a\r\nlady and half a shop-girl. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be good for much.\r\nAnd the elder ones will go on just keeping themselves alive; you can\r\nsee that. They\xe2\x80\x99ll never start the school that there\xe2\x80\x99s so much talk of.\r\nThat poor, helpless, foolish Virginia, alone there in her miserable\r\nlodging! How can we hope that any one will take her as a companion? And\r\nyet they are capitalists; eight hundred pounds between them. Think what\r\ncapable women might do with eight hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am really afraid to urge them to meddle with the investments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; so am I. One is afraid to do or propose anything. Virginia\r\nis starving, _must_ be starving. Poor creature! I can never forget how\r\nher eyes shone when I put that joint of meat before her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, do wish,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Miss Barfoot, with a pained smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I knew\r\nsome honest man who would be likely to fall in love with little Monica!\r\nIn spite of you, my dear, I would devote myself to making the match.\r\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I would help,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Rhoda, not unkindly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s fit for nothing\r\nelse, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look for any kind of heroism in Monica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLess than half an hour after Miss Barfoot had left the house at\r\nLavender Hill, Mildred Vesper made a call there. It was about half-past\r\nnine; the invalid, after sitting up since midday, had gone to bed, but\r\ncould not sleep. Summoned to the house-door, Virginia acquainted Miss\r\nVesper with the state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you might see her for a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to, if you please, Miss Madden,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mildred, who\r\nhad a rather uneasy look.\r\n\r\nShe went upstairs and entered the bedroom, where a lamp was burning. At\r\nthe sight of her friend Monica showed much satisfaction; they kissed\r\neach other affectionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood old girl! I had made up my mind to come back to-morrow, or at all\r\nevents the day after. It\xe2\x80\x99s so frightfully dull here. Oh, and I wanted\r\nto know if anything\xe2\x80\x94any letter\xe2\x80\x94had come for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just why I came to see you to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred took a letter from her pocket, and half averted her face as she\r\nhanded it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica, putting it away under her\r\npillow. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut her cheeks had become hot, and she trembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to tell me about\xe2\x80\x94anything? You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would\r\nmake your mind easier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a minute Monica lay back, gazing at the wall, then she looked round\r\nquickly, with a shamefaced laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very silly of me not to have told you long before this. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re so sensible; I was afraid. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you everything. Not now,\r\nbut as soon as I get to Rutland Street. I shall come to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you can? You look dreadfully bad still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t get any better here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the invalid in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nVirgie does depress me so. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to\r\nhear her repeating the kind of things she has heard from Miss Barfoot\r\nand Miss Nunn. She tries so hard to look forward hopefully\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\n_know_ she is miserable, and it makes me more miserable still. I\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have left you; I should have been all right in a day or\r\ntwo, with you to help me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t make-believe, Milly; it\xe2\x80\x99s all real\r\nand natural good spirits. It has done me good only to see your dear old\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a flatterer. And do you really feel better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much better. I shall go to sleep very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor took her leave. When, a few minutes after, Monica had\r\nbidden good-night to her sister (requesting that the lamp might be\r\nleft), she read what Mildred had brought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAREST MONICA,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the missive began\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you not written\r\nbefore this? I have been dreadfully uneasy ever since receiving your\r\nlast letter. Your headache soon went away, I hope? Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you made\r\nanother appointment? It is all I can do to keep from breaking my\r\npromise and coming to ask about you. Write at once, I implore you, my\r\ndearest. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use telling me that I must not use these words of\r\naffection; they come to my lips and to my pen irresistibly. You know so\r\nwell that I love you with all my heart and soul; I can\xe2\x80\x99t address you\r\nlike I did when we first corresponded. My darling! My dear, sweet,\r\nbeautiful little girl\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFour close pages of this, with scarce room at the end for \xe2\x80\x9cE.W.\xe2\x80\x9d When\r\nshe had gone through it, Monica turned her face upon the pillow and lay\r\nso for a long time. A clock in the house struck eleven; this roused\r\nher, and she slipped out of the bed to hide the letter in her\r\ndress-pocket. Not long after she was asleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, on returning from her work and opening the sitting-room\r\ndoor, Mildred Vesper was greeted with a merry laugh. Monica had been\r\nhere since three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and had made tea in readiness for her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. She looked very white, but her eyes gleamed with\r\npleasure, and she moved about the room as actively as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVirgie came with me, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay. She says she has a most\r\nimportant letter to write to Alice\xe2\x80\x94about the school, of course. Oh,\r\nthat school! I do wish they could make up their minds. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told them\r\nthey may have all my money, if they like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you? I should like the sensation of offering hundreds of pounds\r\nto some one. It must give a strange feeling of dignity and importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, only _two_ hundred! A wretched little sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a person of large ideas, as I have often told you. Where did\r\nyou get them, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put on that face! It\xe2\x80\x99s the one I like least of all your many\r\nfaces. It\xe2\x80\x99s suspicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred went to take off her things, and was quickly at the tea-table.\r\nShe had a somewhat graver look than usual, and chose rather to listen\r\nthan talk.\r\n\r\nNot long after tea, when there had been a long and unnatural silence,\r\nMildred making pretence of absorption in a \xe2\x80\x9cTreasury\xe2\x80\x9d and her companion\r\nstanding at the window, whence she threw back furtive glances, the\r\nthunder of a postman\xe2\x80\x99s knock downstairs caused both of them to start,\r\nand look at each other in a conscience-stricken way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica, stepping to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and\r\nlook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer conjecture was right. Another letter from Widdowson, still more\r\nalarmed and vehement than the last. She read it rapidly on the\r\nstaircase, and entered the room with sheet and envelope squeezed\r\ntogether in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you all about this, Milly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other nodded and assumed an attitude of sober attention. In\r\nrelating her story, Monica moved hither and thither; now playing with\r\nobjects on the mantlepiece, now standing in the middle of the floor,\r\nhands locked nervously behind her. Throughout, her manner was that of\r\ndefence; she seemed doubtful of herself, and anxious to represent the\r\ncase as favourably as possible; not for a moment had her voice the ring\r\nof courageous passion, nor the softness of tender feeling. The\r\nnarrative hung together but awkwardly, and in truth gave a very\r\nindistinct notion of how she had comported herself at the various\r\nstages of the irregular courtship. Her behaviour had been marked by far\r\nmore delicacy and scruple than she succeeded in representing. Painfully\r\nconscious of this, she exclaimed at length,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see your opinion of me has suffered. You don\xe2\x80\x99t like this story. You\r\nwonder how I could do such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear, I certainly wonder how you could begin,\xe2\x80\x9d Mildred made\r\nanswer, with her natural directness, but gently. \xe2\x80\x9cAfterwards, of\r\ncourse, it was different. When you had once got to be sure that he was\r\na gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sure of that so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Monica, her cheeks still red.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand it much better when you have seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish me to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to write now, and say that I will marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked long at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are\xe2\x80\x94really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I made up my mind last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Monica\xe2\x80\x94you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind my speaking plainly\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nlove him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I love him well enough to feel that I am doing right in marrying\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat down by the table, and propped her head on her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nloves me; I can\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that. If you could read his letters, you would\r\nsee how strong his feeling is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook with the cold induced by excitement; her voice was at moments\r\nall but choked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, putting love aside,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the other, very gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do\r\nyou really know of Mr. Widdowson? Nothing whatever but what he has told\r\nyou himself. Of course you will let your friends make inquiries for\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I shall tell my sisters, and no doubt they will go to Miss Nunn\r\nat once. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything rash. But it will be all right\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmean, he has told me the truth about everything. You would be sure of\r\nthat if you knew him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred, with hands before her on the table, made the tips of her\r\nfingers meet. Her lips were drawn in; her eyes seemed looking for\r\nsomething minute on the cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cI suspected what was going on. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally I thought it was some one whose acquaintance you had made at\r\nthe shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _could_ I think of marrying any one of that kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been grieved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may believe me, Milly; Mr. Widdowson is a man you will respect and\r\nlike as soon as you know him. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have behaved to me with more\r\ndelicacy. Not a word from him, spoken or written, has ever pained\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94except that he tells me he suffers so dreadfully, and of course I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t hear that without pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo respect, and even to like, a man, isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the same as loving\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said _you_ would respect and like him,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Monica, with\r\nhumorous impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want _you_ to love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred laughed, with constraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never loved any one yet, dear, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very unlikely I ever shall.\r\nBut I think I know the signs of the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica came behind her, and leaned upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe loves me so much that he has made me think I _must_ marry him. And\r\nI am glad of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not like you, Milly; I can\xe2\x80\x99t be contented with\r\nthis life. Miss Barfoot and Miss Nunn are very sensible and good\r\npeople, and I admire them very much, but I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ go their way. It\r\nseems to me that it would be dreadful, dreadful, to live one\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nalone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t turn round and snap at me; I want to tell you the truth\r\nwhilst you can\xe2\x80\x99t see me. Whenever I think of Alice and Virginia, I am\r\nfrightened; I had rather, oh, far rather, kill myself than live such a\r\nlife at their age. You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how miserable they are, really.\r\nAnd I have the same nature as theirs, you know. Compared with you and\r\nMiss Haven I\xe2\x80\x99m very weak and childish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter drumming on the table for a moment, with wrinkled brows, Mildred\r\nmade grave response.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must let _me_ tell the truth as well. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to\r\nmarry with altogether wrong ideas. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll do an injustice to\r\nMr. Widdowson. You will marry him for a comfortable home\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nit amounts to. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll repent it bitterly some day\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll repent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica raised herself and stood apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mildred, with nervous earnestness, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nold. Your habits and his won\xe2\x80\x99t suit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has assured me that I shall live exactly the kind of life I please.\r\nAnd that will be what _he_ pleases. I feel his kindness to me very\r\nmuch, and I shall do my utmost to repay him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice spirit; but I believe married life is no easy thing\r\neven when the people are well matched. I have heard the most dreadful\r\nstories of quarrelling and all sorts of unhappiness between people I\r\nthought safe from any such dangers. You _may_ be fortunate; I only say\r\nthat the chances are very much against it, marrying from such motives\r\nas you confess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica drew herself up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t confessed any motive to be ashamed of, Milly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you have decided to marry now because you are afraid of never\r\nhaving another chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; that\xe2\x80\x99s turning it very unkindly. I only said that _after_ I had\r\ntold you that I did love him. And I do love him. He has made me love\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I have no right to say any more. I can only wish you happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred heaved a sigh, and pretended to give her attention to Maunder.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting irresolutely for some minutes, Monica looked for\r\nnotepaper, and took it, together with her inkstand, into the bedroom.\r\nShe was absent half an hour. On her return there was a stamped letter\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is going, Milly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, dear. I have nothing more to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give me up for lost. We shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was spoken light-heartedly. Again she left the room, put on her\r\nout-of-door things, and went to post the letter. By this time she began\r\nto feel the results of exertion and excitement; headache and tremulous\r\nfailing of her strength obliged her to go to bed almost as soon as she\r\nreturned. Mildred waited upon her with undiminished kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica murmured, as her head sank on the pillow. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel so relieved and so glad\xe2\x80\x94so happy\xe2\x80\x94now I have done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, with a kiss, and went back to\r\nher semblance of reading.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Monica called unexpectedly at Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s. Being\r\ntold by that worthy woman that Miss Madden was at home, she ran\r\nupstairs and tapped at the door. Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s voice inquired hurriedly\r\nwho was there, and on Monica\xe2\x80\x99s announcing herself there followed a\r\nstartled exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a minute, my love! Only a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the door opened Monica was surprised by a disorder in her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance. Virginia had flushed cheeks, curiously vague eyes, and hair\r\nruffled as if she had just risen from a nap. She began to talk in a\r\nhurried, disconnected way, trying to explain that she had not been\r\nquite well, and was not yet properly dressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange smell!\xe2\x80\x9d Monica exclaimed, looking about the room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou notice it? I have\xe2\x80\x94I was obliged to get\xe2\x80\x94to ask Mrs. Conisbee\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to alarm you, dear, but I felt rather faint. Indeed,\r\nI thought I should have a fainting fit. I was obliged to call Mrs.\r\nConisbee\xe2\x80\x94But don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over. The weather\r\nis very trying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed nervously and began to pat Monica\xe2\x80\x99s hand. The girl was not\r\nquite satisfied, and pressed many questions, but in the end she\r\naccepted Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that nothing serious had happened. Then\r\nher own business occupied her; she sat down, and said with a smile,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought you astonishing news. If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t faint before you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe very likely to do so now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sister exhibited fresh agitation, and begged not to be kept in\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves are in a shocking state to-day. It _must_ be the weather.\r\nWhat _can_ you have to tell me, Monica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shan\xe2\x80\x99t need to go on with typewriting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? What are you going to do, child?\xe2\x80\x9d the other asked sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVirgie\xe2\x80\x94I am going to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shock was a severe one. Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s hands fell, her eyes started,\r\nher mouth opened; she became the colour of clay, even her lips losing\r\nfor the moment all their colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried?\xe2\x80\x9d she at length gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one you have never heard of. His name is Mr. Edmund Widdowson. He\r\nis very well off, and has a house at Herne Hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA private gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He used to be in business, but is retired. Now, I am not going to\r\ntell you much more about him until you have made his acquaintance.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask a lot of questions. You are to come with me this afternoon to\r\nhis house. He lives alone, but a relative of his, his sister-in-law, is\r\ngoing to be with him to meet us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so sudden! I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to pay a call like that at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Impossible, darling! What _does_ it all mean? You are\r\ngoing to be married, Monica? I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t realize it.\r\nWho is this gentleman? How long\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you won\xe2\x80\x99t get me to tell you more than I have done, till you have\r\nseen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what _have_ you told me? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp it. I am quite confused.\r\nMr.\xe2\x80\x94what was the name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt took half an hour to familiarize Virginia with the simple fact. When\r\nshe was convinced of its truth, a paroxysm of delight appeared in her.\r\nShe laughed, uttered cries of joy, even clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica to be married! A private gentleman\xe2\x80\x94a large fortune! My\r\ndarling, how shall I ever believe it? Yet I felt so sure that the day\r\nwould come. What _will_ Alice say? And Rhoda Nunn? Have you\xe2\x80\x94have you\r\nventured to tell her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I want you to do that. You shall go and see them\r\nto-morrow, as it\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the delight! Alice won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to contain herself. We always\r\nsaid the day would come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t have any more anxieties, Virgie. You can take the school or\r\nnot, as you like. Mr. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Virginia, with sudden dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall\r\ncertainly open the school. We have made up our minds; that is to be our\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s work. It is far, far more than a mere means of subsistence. But\r\nperhaps we shall not need to hurry. Everything can be matured at our\r\nleisure. If you would only just tell me, darling, when you were first\r\nintroduced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica laughed gaily, and refused to explain. It was time for Virginia\r\nto make herself ready, and here arose a new perturbation; what had she\r\nsuitable for wear under such circumstances? Monica had decked herself a\r\nlittle, and helped the other to make the best of her narrow resources.\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock they set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nWEDDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the house at Herne Hill the sisters were both in a\r\nstate of nervous tremor. Monica had only the vaguest idea of the kind\r\nof person Mrs. Luke Widdowson would prove to be, and Virginia seemed to\r\nherself to be walking in a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been here often?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the latter, as soon as they came\r\nin view of the place. Its aspect delighted her, but the conflict of her\r\nemotions was so disturbing that she had to pause and seek the support\r\nof her sister\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been inside,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica answered indistinctly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome; we shall\r\nbe unpunctual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish you would tell me, dear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t talk, Virgie. Try and keep quiet, and behave as if it were all\r\nquite natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was altogether beyond Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s power. It happened most luckily,\r\nthough greatly to Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance, that the sister-in-law, Mrs.\r\nLuke Widdowson, arrived nearly half an hour later than the time she had\r\nappointed. Led by the servant into a comfortable drawing-room, the\r\nvisitors were received by the master of the house alone; with a grim\r\nsmile, the result of his embarrassment, with profuse apologies and a\r\ncourtesy altogether excessive, Widdowson did his best to put them at\r\ntheir ease\xe2\x80\x94of course with small result. The sisters side by side on a\r\nsettee at one end of the room, and the host seated far away from them,\r\nthey talked with scarcely any understanding of what was said on either\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94the weather and the vastness of London serving as topics\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nof a sudden the door was thrown open, and there appeared a person of\r\nsuch imposing presence that Virginia gave a start and Monica gazed in\r\npainful fascination. Mrs. Luke was a tall and portly woman in the prime\r\nof life, with rather a high colour; her features were handsome, but\r\nwithout much refinement, their expression a condescending good-humour.\r\nHer mourning garb, if mourning it could be called, represented an\r\nextreme of the prevailing fashion; its glint and rustle inspired awe in\r\nthe female observer. A moment ago the drawing-room had seemed empty;\r\nMrs. Luke, in her sole person, filled and illumined it.\r\n\r\nWiddowson addressed this resplendent personage by her Christian name,\r\nhis familiarity exciting in Monica an irrational surprise. He presented\r\nthe sisters to her, and Mrs. Luke, bowing grandly at a distance, drew\r\nfrom her bosom a gold-rimmed _pince-nez_, through which she scrutinized\r\nMonica. The smile which followed might have been interpreted in several\r\nsenses; Widdowson, alone capable of remarking it, answered with a look\r\nof severe dignity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luke had no thought of apologizing for the lateness of her\r\narrival, and it was evident that she did not intend to stay long. Her\r\npurpose seemed to be to make the occasion as informal as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, by chance, know the Hodgson Bulls?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of her relative,\r\ninterrupting him in the nervous commonplaces with which he was\r\nendeavouring to smooth the way to a general conversation. She had the\r\naccent of cultivation, but spoke rather imperiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of them,\xe2\x80\x9d was the cold reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? They live somewhere about here. I have to make a call on them. I\r\nsuppose my coachman will find the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward silence. Widdowson was about to say something to\r\nMonica, when Mrs. Luke, who had again closely observed the girl through\r\nthe glasses, interposed in a gentle tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like this neighbourhood, Miss Madden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica gave the expected answer, her voice sounding very weak and timid\r\nby comparison. And so, for some ten minutes, an appearance of dialogue\r\nwas sustained. Mrs. Luke, though still condescending, evinced a desire\r\nto be agreeable; she smiled and nodded in reply to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s remarks,\r\nand occasionally addressed Virginia with careful civility, conveying\r\nthe impression, perhaps involuntarily, that she commiserated the shy\r\nand shabbily-dressed person. Tea was brought in, and after pretending\r\nto take a cup, she rose for departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you will come and see me some day, Miss Madden,\xe2\x80\x9d fell from her\r\nwith unanticipated graciousness, as she stepped forward to the girl and\r\noffered her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cEdmund must bring you\xe2\x80\x94at some quiet time when we\r\ncan talk. Very glad to have met you\xe2\x80\x94very glad indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the personage was gone; they heard her carriage roll away from\r\nbeneath the window. All three drew a breath of relief, and Widdowson,\r\nsuddenly quite another man, took a place near to Virginia, with whom in\r\na few minutes he was conversing in the friendliest way. Virginia,\r\nexperiencing a like relief, also became herself; she found courage to\r\nask needful questions, which in every case were satisfactorily met. Of\r\nMrs. Luke there was no word, but when they had taken their leave\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nvisit lasted altogether some two hours\xe2\x80\x94Monica and her sister discussed\r\nthat great lady with the utmost freedom. They agreed that she was\r\npersonally detestable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut very rich, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginia in a murmuring voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\nsee that. I have met such people before; they have a manner\xe2\x80\x94oh! Of\r\ncourse Mr. Widdowson will take you to call upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen nobody else is likely to be there; that\xe2\x80\x99s what she meant,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremarked Monica coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, my love. You don\xe2\x80\x99t wish for grand society. I am very glad\r\nto tell you that Edmund impresses me very favourably. He is reserved,\r\nbut that is no fault. Oh, we must write to Alice at once! Her surprise!\r\nHer delight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen, on the next day, Monica met her betrothed in Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nstill lived with Mildred Vesper, but no longer went to Great Portland\r\nStreet\xe2\x80\x94their talk was naturally of Mrs. Luke. Widdowson speedily led\r\nto the topic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had told you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with careful accent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I see very little\r\nof her. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I like her, but she is a very difficult person\r\nto understand, and I fancy she often gives offence when she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t at\r\nall mean it. Still, I hope you were not\xe2\x80\x94displeased?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica avoided a direct answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you take me to see her?\xe2\x80\x9d were her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will go, dear. And I have no doubt she will be present at our\r\nwedding. Unfortunately, she\xe2\x80\x99s my only relative; or the only one I know\r\nanything about. After our marriage I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we shall see much of\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I dare say not,\xe2\x80\x9d was Monica\xe2\x80\x99s remark. And thereupon they turned to\r\npleasanter themes.\r\n\r\nThat morning Widdowson had received from his sister-in-law a scribbled\r\npost-card, asking him to call upon Mrs. Luke early the day that\r\nfollowed. Of course this meant that the lady was desirous of further\r\ntalk concerning Miss Madden. Unwillingly, but as a matter of duty, he\r\nkept the appointment. It was at eleven in the morning, and, when\r\nadmitted to the flat in Victoria Street which was his relative\xe2\x80\x99s abode,\r\nhe had to wait a quarter of an hour for the lady\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\r\n\r\nLuxurious fashion, as might have been expected, distinguished Mrs.\r\nLuke\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room. Costly and beautiful things superabounded; perfume\r\nsoothed the air. Only since her bereavement had Mrs. Widdowson been\r\nable to indulge this taste for modern exuberance in domestic adornment.\r\nThe deceased Luke was a plain man of business, who clung to the\r\nfashions which had been familiar to him in his youth; his second wife\r\nfound a suburban house already furnished, and her influence with him\r\ncould not prevail to banish the horrors amid which he chose to live:\r\nchairs in maroon rep, Brussels carpets of red roses on a green ground,\r\nhorse-hair sofas of the most uncomfortable shape ever designed,\r\nantimacassars everywhere, chimney ornaments of cut glass trembling in\r\nsympathy with the kindred chandeliers. She belonged to an obscure\r\nbranch of a house that culminated in an obscure baronetcy; penniless\r\nand ambitious, she had to thank her imposing physique for rescue at a\r\nperilous age, and though despising Mr. Luke Widdowson for his plebeian\r\ntastes, she shrewdly retained the good-will of a husband who seemed no\r\ncandidate for length of years. The money-maker died much sooner than\r\nshe could reasonably have hoped, and left her an income of four\r\nthousand pounds. Thereupon began for Mrs. Luke a life of feverish\r\naspiration. The baronetcy to which she was akin had inspired her, even\r\nfrom childhood, with an aristocratic ideal; a handsome widow of only\r\neight-and-thirty, she resolved that her wealth should pave the way for\r\nher to a titled alliance. Her acquaintance lay among City people, but\r\nwith the opportunities of freedom it was soon extended to the sphere of\r\nwhat is known as smart society; her flat in Victoria Street attracted a\r\nheterogeneous cluster of pleasure-seekers and fortune-hunters, among\r\nthem one or two vagrant members of the younger aristocracy. She lived\r\nat the utmost pace compatible with technical virtue. When, as shortly\r\nhappened, it became evident that her income was not large enough for\r\nher serious purpose, she took counsel with an old friend great in\r\nfinance, and thenceforth the excitement of the gambler gave a new zest\r\nto her turbid existence. Like most of her female associates, she had\r\nfree recourse to the bottle; but for such stimulus the life of a smart\r\nwoman would be physically impossible. And Mrs. Luke enjoyed life,\r\nenjoyed it vastly. The goal of her ambition, if all went well in the\r\nCity, was quite within reasonable hope. She foretasted the day when a\r\nvulgar prefix would no longer attach to her name, and when the journals\r\nof society would reflect her rising effulgence.\r\n\r\nWiddowson was growing impatient, when his relative at length appeared.\r\nShe threw herself into a deep chair, crossed her legs, and gazed at him\r\nmockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so bad as I feared, Edmund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a decent enough little girl, I can see. But you\xe2\x80\x99re a silly\r\nfellow for all that. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have deceived me, you know. If\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d been anything\xe2\x80\x94you understand?\xe2\x80\x94I should have spotted it at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t relish this kind of talk,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Widdowson acidly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nplain English, you supposed I was going to marry some one about whom I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t confess the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did. Now come; tell me how you got to know her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man moved uneasily, but in the end related the whole story. Mrs.\r\nLuke kept nodding, with an amused air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; she managed it capitally. Clever little witch. Fetching eyes\r\nshe has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you sent for me to make insulting remarks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBosh! I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the wedding gaily. But you\xe2\x80\x99re a silly fellow. Now,\r\nwhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come and ask me to find you a wife? Why, I know two or\r\nthree girls of really good family who would have jumped, simply jumped,\r\nat a man with your money. Pretty girls too. But you always were so\r\nhorribly unpractical. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, my dear boy, that there are heaps\r\nof ladies, real ladies, waiting the first decent man who offers them\r\nfive or six hundred a year? Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you used the opportunities that\r\nyou knew I could put in your way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson rose from his seat and stood stiffly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me in the least. I am going to marry\r\nbecause, for the first time in my life, I have met the woman whom I can\r\nrespect and love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very nice and proper. But why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you respect and love a\r\ngirl who belongs to good society?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madden is a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d hummed the other, letting her head roll back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, bring her here some day when we can lunch quietly together. I\r\nsee it\xe2\x80\x99s no use. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a sharp man, Edmund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you seriously tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Widdowson, with grave curiosity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat there are ladies in good society who would have married me just\r\nbecause I have a few hundreds a year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, I would get together a round dozen in two or three days.\r\nGirls who would make good, faithful wives, in mere gratitude to the man\r\nwho saved them from\xe2\x80\x94horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me if I say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Luke laughed merrily, and the conversation went on in this strain\r\nfor another ten minutes. At the end, Mrs. Luke made herself very\r\nagreeable, praised Monica for her sweet face and gentle manners, and so\r\ndismissed the solemn man with a renewed promise to countenance the\r\nmarriage by her gracious presence.\r\n\r\nWhen Rhoda Nunn returned from her holiday it wanted but a week to\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s wedding, so speedily had everything been determined and\r\narranged. Miss Barfoot, having learnt from Virginia all that was to be\r\nknown concerning Mr. Widdowson, felt able to hope for the best; a grave\r\nhusband, of mature years, and with means more than sufficient, seemed,\r\nto the eye of experience, no unsuitable match for a girl such as\r\nMonica. This view of the situation caused Rhoda to smile with\r\ncontemptuous tolerance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard you speak severely of such\r\nmarriages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the ideal wedlock,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cBut so much in\r\nlife is compromise. After all, she may regard him more affectionally\r\nthan we imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt she has weighed advantages. If the prospects you offered her\r\nhad proved more to her taste she would have dismissed this elderly\r\nadmirer. His fate has been decided during the last few weeks. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprobable that the invitation to your Wednesday evenings gave her a hope\r\nof meeting young men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no harm if it did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Miss Vesper\r\nwould very soon undeceive her on that point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly thought of her as a girl likely to make chance friendships\r\nwith men in highways and by-ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more did I; and that makes all the more content with what has come\r\nabout. She ran a terrible risk, poor child. You see, Rhoda, nature is\r\ntoo strong for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda threw her head back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the delight of her sister! It is really pathetic. The mere fact\r\nthat Monica is to be married blinds the poor woman to every possibility\r\nof misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d In the course of the same conversation, Rhoda remarked\r\nthoughtfully,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me that Mr. Widdowson must be of a confiding nature. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think men in general, at all events those with money, care to\r\npropose marriage to girls they encounter by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he saw that the case was exceptional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was he to see that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are severe. Her shop training accounts for much. The elder sisters\r\ncould never have found a husband in this way. The revelation must have\r\nshocked them at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda dismissed the subject lightly, and henceforth showed only the\r\nfaintest interest in Monica\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.\r\n\r\nMonica meanwhile rejoiced in her liberation from the work and\r\nphilosophic severities of Great Portland Street. She saw Widdowson\r\nsomewhere or other every day, and heard him discourse on the life that\r\nwas before them, herself for the most part keeping silence. Together\r\nthey called upon Mrs. Luke, and had luncheon with her. Monica was not\r\ndispleased with her reception, and began secretly to hope that more\r\nthan a glimpse of that gorgeous world might some day be vouchsafed to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nApart from her future husband, Monica was in a sportive mood, with\r\noccasional fits of exhilaration which seemed rather unnatural. She had\r\ndeclared to Mildred her intention of inviting Miss Nunn to the wedding,\r\nand her mind was evidently set on carrying out this joke, as she\r\nregarded it. When the desire was intimated by letter, Rhoda replied\r\nwith a civil refusal: she would be altogether out of place at such a\r\nceremony, but hoped that Monica would accept her heartiest good wishes.\r\nVirginia was then dispatched to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, and appealed so movingly\r\nthat the prophetess at length yielded. On hearing this Monica danced\r\nwith delight, and her companion in Rutland Street could not help\r\nsharing her merriment.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was performed at a church at Herne Hill. By an odd\r\narrangement\xe2\x80\x94like everything else in the story of this pair, a result\r\nof social and personal embarrassments\xe2\x80\x94Monica\xe2\x80\x99s belongings, including\r\nher apparel for the day, were previously dispatched to the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, whither, in company with Virginia, the bride went early in the\r\nmorning. It was one of the quietest of weddings, but all ordinary\r\nformalities were complied with, Widdowson having no independent views\r\non the subject. Present were Virginia (to give away the bride), Miss\r\nVesper (who looked decidedly odd in a pretty dress given her by\r\nMonica), Rhoda Nunn (who appeared to advantage in a costume of quite\r\nunexpected appropriateness), Mrs. Widdowson (an imposing figure,\r\nevidently feeling that she had got into strange society), and, as\r\nfriend of the bridegroom, one Mr. Newdick, a musty and nervous City\r\nclerk. Depression was manifest on every countenance, not excepting\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s; the man had such a stern, gloomy look, and held himself\r\nwith so much awkwardness, that he might have been imagined to stand\r\nhere on compulsion. For an hour before going to the church, Monica\r\ncried and seemed unutterably doleful; she had not slept for two nights;\r\nher face was ghastly. Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s gladness gave way just before the\r\ncompany assembled, and she too shed many tears.\r\n\r\nThere was a breakfast, more dismal fooling than even this species of\r\nfooling is wont to be. Mr. Newdick, trembling and bloodless, proposed\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s health; Widdowson, stern and dark as ever, gloomily responded;\r\nand then, _that_ was happily over. By one o\xe2\x80\x99clock the gathering began\r\nto disperse. Monica drew Rhoda Nunn aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very kind of you to come,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, with half a sob. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nall seems very silly, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have wished yourself away a\r\nhundred times. I am really, seriously, grateful to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda put a hand on each side of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face, and kissed her, but\r\nwithout saying a word; and thereupon left the house. Mildred Vesper,\r\nafter changing her dress in the room used by Monica, as she had done on\r\narriving, went off by train to her duties in Great Portland Street.\r\nVirginia alone remained to see the married couple start for their\r\nhoneymoon. They were going into Cornwall, and on the return journey\r\nwould manage to see Miss Madden at her Somerset retreat. For the\r\npresent, Virginia was to live on at Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s, but not in the old\r\nway; henceforth she would have proper attendance, and modify her\r\nvegetarian diet\xe2\x80\x94at the express bidding of the doctor, as she explained\r\nto her landlady.\r\n\r\nThough that very evening Everard Barfoot made a call upon his friends\r\nin Chelsea, the first since Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s return from Cheddar, he heard\r\nnothing of the event that marked the day. But Miss Nunn appeared to him\r\nunlike herself; she was absent, had little to say, and looked, what he\r\nhad never yet known her, oppressed by low spirits. For some reason or\r\nother Miss Barfoot left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are thinking with regret of your old home,\xe2\x80\x9d Everard remarked,\r\ntaking a seat nearer to Miss Nunn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Why should you fancy that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly because you seem rather sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to see you with that look. May I remind you that you promised\r\nme some flowers from Cheddar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, so I did,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other in a tone of natural recollection.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought them, scientifically pressed between blotting-paper.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she returned it was together with Miss Barfoot, and the\r\nconversation became livelier.\r\n\r\nA day or two after this Everard left town, and was away for three\r\nweeks, part of the time in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left London for a while,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote from Killarney to his cousin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpartly because I was afraid I had begun to bore you and Miss Nunn.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you regret giving me permission to call upon you? The fact is, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t live without intelligent female society; talking with women, as I\r\ntalk with you two, is one of my chief enjoyments. I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\ntired of my visits; in fact, they are all but a necessity to me, as I\r\nhave discovered since coming away. But it was fair that you should have\r\na rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barfoot replied to this part of his letter. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nare not at all weary of your conversation. The truth is, I like it much\r\nbetter than in the old days. You seem to me to have a healthier mind,\r\nand I am quite sure that the society of intelligent women (we affect no\r\nfoolish self-depreciation, Miss Nunn and I) is a good thing for you.\r\nCome back to us as soon as you like; I shall welcome you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt happened that his return to England was almost simultaneous with the\r\narrival from Madeira of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Barfoot. Everard at once\r\nwent to see his brother, who for the present was staying at Torquay.\r\nIll-health dictated his choice of residence; Thomas was still suffering\r\nfrom the results of his accident; his wife had left him at a hotel, and\r\nwas visiting relatives in different parts of England. The brothers\r\nexhibited much affectionate feeling after their long separation; they\r\nspent a week together, and planned for another meeting when Mrs. Thomas\r\nshould have returned to her husband.\r\n\r\nAn engagement called Everard back to town. He was to be present at the\r\nwedding of his friend Micklethwaite, now actually on the point of\r\ntaking place. The mathematician had found a suitable house, very small\r\nand of very low rental, out at South Tottenham, and thither was\r\ntransferred the furniture which had been in his bride\xe2\x80\x99s possession\r\nsince the death of her parents; Micklethwaite bought only a few new\r\nthings. By discreet inquiry, Barfoot had discovered that \xe2\x80\x9cFanny,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthough musically inclined, would not possess a piano, her old\r\ninstrument being quite worn out and not worth the cost of conveyance;\r\nthus it came to pass that, a day or two before the wedding,\r\nMicklethwaite was astonished by the arrival of an instrument of the\r\nCottage species, mysteriously addressed to a person not yet in\r\nexistence, Mrs. Micklethwaite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, when, on the next day, Barfoot presented\r\nhimself at the house. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is _your_ doing. What the deuce do you\r\nmean? A man who complains of poverty! Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest kindness\r\nI ever received, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Fanny will be devoted to you. With music\r\nin the house, our blind sister will lead quite a different life.\r\nConfound it! I want to begin crying. Why, man, I\xe2\x80\x99m not accustomed to\r\nreceive presents, even as a proxy; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had one since I was a\r\nschoolboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an audacious statement. When you told me that Miss Wheatley\r\nnever allowed your birthday to pass without sending something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Fanny! But I have never thought of Fanny as a separate person.\r\nUpon my word, now I think of it, I never have. Fanny and I have been\r\none for ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening the sisters arrived from their country home. Micklethwaite\r\ngave up the house to them, and went to a lodging.\r\n\r\nIt was with no little curiosity that, on the appointed morning, Barfoot\r\nrepaired to South Tottenham. He had seen a photograph of Miss Wheatley,\r\nbut it dated from seventeen years ago. Standing in her presence, he was\r\nmoved with compassion, and with another feeling more rarely excited in\r\nhim by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face, that of reverential tenderness. Impossible to\r\nrecognize in this countenance the features known to him from the\r\nportrait. At three-and-twenty she had possessed a sweet, simple\r\ncomeliness on which any man\xe2\x80\x99s eye would have rested with pleasure; at\r\nforty she was wrinkled, hollow-cheeked, sallow, indelible weariness\r\nstamped upon her brow and lips. She looked much older than Mary\r\nBarfoot, though they were just of an age. And all this for want of a\r\nlittle money. The life of a pure, gentle, tender-hearted woman worn\r\naway in hopeless longing and in hard struggle for daily bread. As she\r\ntook his hand and thanked him with an exquisite modesty for the present\r\nshe had received, Everard felt a lump rise in his throat. He was\r\nashamed to notice that the years had dealt so unkindly with her; fixing\r\nhis look upon her eyes, he gladdened at the gladness which shone in\r\nthem, at the soft light which they could still shed forth.\r\n\r\nMicklethwaite was probably unconscious of the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s faded\r\nappearance. He had seen her from time to time, and always with the love\r\nwhich idealizes. In his own pathetic phrase, she was simply a part of\r\nhimself; he no more thought of criticizing her features than of\r\nstanding before the glass to mark and comment upon his own. It was\r\nenough to glance at him as he took his place beside her, the proudest\r\nand happiest of men. A miracle had been wrought for him; kind fate, in\r\ngiving her to his arms, had blotted out those long years of sorrow, and\r\nto-day Fanny was the betrothed of his youth, beautiful in his sight as\r\nwhen first he looked upon her.\r\n\r\nHer sister, younger by five years, had more regular lineaments, but she\r\ntoo was worn with suffering, and her sightless eyes made it more\r\ndistressing to contemplate her. She spoke cheerfully, however, and\r\nlaughed with joy in Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s happiness. Barfoot pressed both her hands\r\nwith the friendliest warmth.\r\n\r\nOne vehicle conveyed them all to the church, and in half an hour the\r\nlady to whom the piano was addressed had come into being. The simplest\r\nof transformations; no bridal gown, no veil, no wreath; only the gold\r\nring for symbol of union. And it might have happened nigh a score of\r\nyears ago; nigh a score of years lost from the span of human life\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nfor want of a little money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say good-bye to you here,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Everard to his friend at\r\nthe church door.\r\n\r\nThe married man gripped him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x94Fanny, he wants to be off at\r\nonce!\xe2\x80\x94You won\xe2\x80\x99t go until you have heard my wife play something on that\r\nblessed instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo all entered a cab again and drove back to the house. A servant who\r\nhad come with Fanny from the country, a girl of fifteen, opened the\r\ndoor to them, smiling and curtseying. And all sat together in happy\r\ntalk, the blind woman gayest among them; she wished to have the\r\nclergyman described to her, and the appearance of the church. Then Mrs.\r\nMicklethwaite placed herself at the piano, and played simple,\r\nold-fashioned music, neither well nor badly, but to the infinite\r\ndelight of two of her hearers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sister at length, \xe2\x80\x9cI have known your name for a\r\nlong time, but I little thought to meet you on such a day as this, and\r\nto owe you such endless thanks. So long as I can have music I forget\r\nthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarfoot is the finest fellow on earth,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Micklethwaite. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nleast, he would be if he understood Trilinear Co-ordinates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ strong in mathematics, Mrs. Micklethwaite?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Everard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Oh dear, no! I never got much past the Rule of Three. But Tom has\r\nforgiven me that long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t despair of getting you into plane trigonometry, Fanny. We will\r\ngossip about sines and co-sines before we die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was said half-seriously, and Everard could not but burst into\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nHe sat down with them to their plain midday meal, and early in the\r\nafternoon took his leave. He had no inclination to go home, if the\r\nempty flat could be dignified with such a name. After reading the\r\npapers at his club, he walked aimlessly about the streets until it was\r\ntime to return to the same place for dinner. Then he sat with a cigar,\r\ndreaming, and at half-past eight went to the Royal Oak Station, and\r\njourneyed to Chelsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDISCORD OF LEADERS\r\n\r\n\r\nA disappointment awaited him. Miss Barfoot was not well enough to see\r\nany one. Had she been suffering long? he inquired. No; it was only this\r\nevening; she had not dined, and was gone to her room. Miss Nunn could\r\nnot receive him.\r\n\r\nHe went home, and wrote to his cousin.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he came upon a passage in the newspaper which seemed\r\nto suggest a cause for Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s indisposition. It was the report\r\nof an inquest. A girl named Bella Royston had poisoned herself. She was\r\nliving alone, without occupation, and received visits only from one\r\nlady. This lady, her name Miss Barfoot, had been supplying her with\r\nmoney, and had just found her a situation in a house of business; but\r\nthe girl appeared to have gone through troubles which had so disturbed\r\nher mind that she could not make the effort required of her. She left a\r\nfew lines addressed to her benefactress, just saying that she chose\r\ndeath rather than the struggle to recover her position.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday. He decided to call in the afternoon and see whether\r\nMary had recovered.\r\n\r\nAgain a disappointment. Miss Barfoot was better, and had been away\r\nsince breakfast; Miss Nunn was also absent.\r\n\r\nEverard sauntered about the neighbourhood, and presently found himself\r\nin the gardens of Chelsea Hospital. It was a warm afternoon, and so\r\nstill that he heard the fall of yellow leaves as he walked hither and\r\nthither along the alleys. His failure to obtain an interview with Miss\r\nNunn annoyed him; but for her presence in the house he would not have\r\ngot into this habit of going there. As far as ever from harbouring any\r\nserious thoughts concerning Rhoda, he felt himself impelled along the\r\nway which he had jokingly indicated in talk with Micklethwaite; he was\r\ntempted to make love to her as an interesting pastime, to observe how\r\nso strong-minded a woman would conduct herself under such\r\ncircumstances. Had she or not a vein of sentiment in her character? Was\r\nit impossible to move her as other women are moved? Meditating thus, he\r\nlooked up and saw the subject of his thoughts. She was seated a few\r\nyards away, and seemingly had not yet become aware of him, her eyes\r\nwere on the ground, and troubled reverie appeared in her countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just called at the house, Miss Nunn. How is my cousin to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had looked up only a moment before he spoke, and seemed vexed at\r\nbeing thus discovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe Miss Barfoot is quite well,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered coldly, as they\r\nshook hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yesterday she was not so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA headache, or something of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was astonished. Rhoda spoke with a cold indifference. She had risen,\r\nand showed her wish to move from the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had to attend an inquest yesterday. Perhaps it rather upset her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think it did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnable to adapt himself at once to this singular mood of Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s, but\r\nresolved not to let her go before he had tried to learn the cause of\r\nit, he walked along by her side. In this part of the gardens there were\r\nonly a few nursemaids and children; it would have been a capital place\r\nand time for improving his intimacy with the remarkable woman. But\r\npossibly she was determined to be rid of him. A contest between his\r\nwill and hers would be an amusement decidedly to his taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou also have been disturbed by it, Miss Nunn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the inquest?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, with barely veiled scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I\r\nhave not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know that poor girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is only natural that her miserable fate should sadden you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if with respectful sympathy, ignoring what she had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has no effect whatever upon me,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered, glancing at him\r\nwith surprise and displeasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me if I say that I find it difficult to believe that. Perhaps\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t easily forgive anyone who charges me with falsehood, Mr.\r\nBarfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you take it too seriously. I beg your pardon a thousand times. I\r\nwas going to say that perhaps you won\xe2\x80\x99t allow yourself to acknowledge\r\nany feeling of compassion in such a case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge what I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel. I will bid you good-afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her with all the softness and persuasiveness of which he\r\nwas capable. She had offered her hand with cold dignity, and instead of\r\ntaking it merely for good-bye he retained it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must, you shall forgive me! I shall be too miserable if you\r\ndismiss me in this way. I see that I was altogether wrong. You know all\r\nthe particulars of the case, and I have only read a brief newspaper\r\naccount. I am sure the girl didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve your pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was trying to draw her hand away. Everard felt the strength of her\r\nmuscles, and the sensation was somehow so pleasant that he could not at\r\nonce release her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do pardon me, Miss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish. I will thank you to let my hand go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas it possible? Her cheek had coloured, ever so slightly. But with\r\nindignation, no doubt, for her eyes flashed sternly at him. Very\r\nunwillingly, Everard had no choice but to obey the command.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have the kindness to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said more gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\r\nmy cousin was suffering only from that cause?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d she added after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with Miss\r\nBarfoot for two or three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with genuine astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Barfoot is angry with me. I think we shall be obliged to part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo part? What can possibly have happened? Miss Barfoot angry with\r\n_you_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I _must_ satisfy your curiosity, Mr. Barfoot, I had better tell you\r\nat once that the subject of our difference is the girl you mentioned.\r\nNot very long ago she tried to persuade your cousin to receive her\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94to give her lessons at the place in Great Portland Street, as\r\nbefore she disgraced herself. Miss Barfoot, with too ready good-nature,\r\nwas willing to do this, but I resisted. It seemed to me that it would\r\nbe a very weak and wrong thing to do. At the time she ended by agreeing\r\nwith me. Now that the girl has killed herself, she throws the blame\r\nupon my interference. We had a painful conversation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nwe can continue to live together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot listened with gratification. It was much to have compelled\r\nRhoda to explain herself, and on such a subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor even to work together?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is doubtful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda still moved forward, but very slowly, and without impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will somehow get over this difficulty, I am sure. Such friends as\r\nyou and Mary don\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel like ordinary unreasonable women. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nlet me be of use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rhoda with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall make my cousin see that she is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that she is wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am convinced that _you_ must be right. I respect Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njudgment, but I respect yours still more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda raised her head and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cpleases me less than the one you have\r\nuttered without intending it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must explain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said that by making Miss Barfoot see she was wrong you could alter\r\nher mind towards me. The world\xe2\x80\x99s opinion would hardly support you in\r\nthat, even in the case of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow this is better. Now we are talking in the old way. Surely you know\r\nthat the world\xe2\x80\x99s opinion has no validity for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, after all, _is_ Mary wrong? I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid to ask the question\r\nnow that your face has cleared a little. How angry you were with me!\r\nBut surely I didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it. You would have been much more\r\nforbearing if you had known what delight I felt when I saw you sitting\r\nover there. It is nearly a month since we met, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep away\r\nany longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda swept the distance with indifferent eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary was fond of this girl?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, watching her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen her distress, and even anger, are natural enough. We won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndiscuss the girl\xe2\x80\x99s history; probably I know all that I need to. But\r\nwhatever her misdoing, you certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to drive her to\r\nsuicide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda deigned no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in his gentlest tone, \xe2\x80\x9cit turns out that\r\nyou have practically done so. If Mary had taken the girl back that\r\ndespair would most likely never have come upon her. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it natural\r\nthat Mary should repent of having been guided by you, and perhaps say\r\nrather severe things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatural, no doubt. But it is just as natural for me to resent blame\r\nwhere I have done nothing blameworthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are absolutely sure that this is the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you expressed a conviction that I was in the right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no smile, but Everard believed that he detected its\r\npossibility on the closed lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got into the way of always thinking so\xe2\x80\x94in questions of this\r\nkind. But perhaps you tend to err on the side of severity. Perhaps you\r\nmake too little allowance for human weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuman weakness is a plea that has been much abused, and generally in\r\nan interested spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was something like a personal rebuke. Whether she so meant it,\r\nBarfoot could not determine. He hoped she did, for the more personal\r\ntheir talk became the better he would be pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, for one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cvery seldom urge that plea, whether in my own\r\ndefence or another\xe2\x80\x99s. But it answers to a spirit we can\xe2\x80\x99t altogether\r\ndispense with. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel ever so little regret that your severe\r\nlogic prevailed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the slightest regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard thought this answer magnificent. He had anticipated some\r\nevasion. However inappropriately, he was constrained to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I admire your consistency! We others are poor halting creatures in\r\ncomparison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had enough of this. If your\r\napproval is sincere, I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for it. If you are practising your\r\npowers of irony, I had rather you chose some other person. I will go my\r\nway, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe just bent her head, and left him.\r\n\r\nEnough for the present. Having raised his hat and turned on his heels,\r\nBarfoot strolled away in a mood of peculiar satisfaction. He laughed to\r\nhimself. She was certainly a fine creature\xe2\x80\x94yes, physically as well.\r\nHer out-of-door appearance on the whole pleased him; she could dress\r\nvery plainly without disguising the advantages of figure she possessed.\r\nHe pictured her rambling about the hills, and longed to be her\r\ncompanion on such an expedition; there would be no consulting with\r\nfeebleness, as when one sets forth to walk with the everyday woman.\r\nWhat daring topics might come up in the course of a twenty-mile stretch\r\nacross country! No Grundyism in Rhoda Nunn; no simpering, no mincing of\r\nphrases. Why, a man might do worse than secure her for his comrade\r\nthrough the whole journey of life.\r\n\r\nSuppose he pushed his joke to the very point of asking her to marry\r\nhim? Undoubtedly she would refuse; but how enjoyable to watch the proud\r\nvigour of her freedom asserting itself! Yet would not an offer of\r\nmarriage be too commonplace? Rather propose to her to share his life in\r\na free union, without sanction of forms which neither for her nor him\r\nwere sanction at all. Was it too bold a thought?\r\n\r\nNot if he really meant it. Uttered insincerely, such words would be\r\ninsult; she would see through his pretence of earnestness, and then\r\nfarewell to her for ever. But if his intellectual sympathy became\r\ntinged with passion\xe2\x80\x94and did he discern no possibility of that? An odd\r\nthing were he to fall in love with Rhoda Nunn. Hitherto his ideal had\r\nbeen a widely different type of woman; he had demanded rare beauty of\r\nface, and the charm of a refined voluptuousness. To be sure, it was but\r\nan ideal; no woman that approached it had ever come within his sphere.\r\nThe dream exercised less power over him than a few years ago; perhaps\r\nbecause his youth was behind him. Rhoda might well represent the desire\r\nof a mature man, strengthened by modern culture and with his senses\r\nfairly subordinate to reason. Heaven forbid that he should ever tie\r\nhimself to the tame domestic female; and just as little could he seek\r\nfor a mate among the women of society, the creatures all surface, with\r\nempty pates and vitiated blood. No marriage for him, in the common\r\nunderstanding of the word. He wanted neither offspring nor a \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\nRhoda Nunn, if she thought of such things at all, probably desired a\r\nunion which would permit her to remain an intellectual being; the\r\nkitchen, the cradle, and the work-basket had no power over her\r\nimagination. As likely as not, however, she was perfectly content with\r\nsingle life\xe2\x80\x94even regarded it as essential to her purposes. In her face\r\nhe read chastity; her eye avoided no scrutiny; her palm was cold.\r\n\r\nOne does not break the heart of such a woman. Heartbreak is a very\r\nold-fashioned disorder, associated with poverty of brain. If Rhoda were\r\nwhat he thought her, she enjoyed this opportunity of studying a modern\r\nmale, and cared not how far he proceeded in his own investigations,\r\nsure that at any moment she could bid him fall back. The amusement was\r\nonly just beginning. And if for him it became earnest, why what did he\r\nseek but strong experiences?\r\n\r\nRhoda, in the meantime, had gone home. She shut herself in her bedroom,\r\nand remained there until the bell rang for dinner.\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot entered the dining-room just before her; they sat down in\r\nsilence, and through the meal exchanged but a few sentences, relative\r\nto a topic of the hour which interested neither of them.\r\n\r\nThe elder woman had a very unhappy countenance; she looked worn out;\r\nher eyes never lifted themselves from the table.\r\n\r\nDinner over, Miss Barfoot went to the drawing-room alone. She had sat\r\nthere about half an hour, brooding, unoccupied, when Rhoda came in and\r\nstood before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking it over. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t right for me to remain here.\r\nSuch an arrangement was only possible whilst we were on terms of\r\nperfect understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must do what you think best, Rhoda,\xe2\x80\x9d the other replied gravely,\r\nbut with no accent of displeasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had better take a lodging somewhere. What I wish to know is,\r\nwhether you can still employ me with any satisfaction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t employ you. That is not the word to describe your relations\r\nwith me. If we must use business language, you are simply my partner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly your kindness put me into that position. When you no longer\r\nregard me as a friend, I am only in your employment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t ceased to regard you as a friend. The estrangement between\r\nus is entirely of your making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that Rhoda would not sit down, Miss Barfoot rose and stood by\r\nthe fireplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear reproaches,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former; \xe2\x80\x9cleast of all when they are\r\nirrational and undeserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I reproached you, it was in a tone which should never have given\r\nyou offence. One would think that I had rated you like a disobedient\r\nservant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _that_ had been possible,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rhoda, with a faint smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould never have been here. You said that you bitterly repented having\r\ngiven way to me on a certain occasion. That was unreasonable; in giving\r\nway, you declared yourself convinced. And the reproach I certainly\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve, for I had behaved conscientiously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it allowed me to disapprove of what your conscience dictates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when you have taken the same view, and acted upon it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t lay\r\nclaim to many virtues, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t that of meekness. I could never\r\nendure anger; my nature resents it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did wrong to speak angrily, but indeed I hardly knew what I was\r\nsaying. I had suffered a terrible shock. I loved that poor girl; I\r\nloved her all the more for what I had seen of her since she came to\r\nimplore my help. Your utter coldness\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to me inhuman\xe2\x80\x94I shrank\r\nfrom you. If your face had shown ever so little compassion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _felt_ no compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You have hardened your heart with theory. Guard yourself, Rhoda!\r\nTo work for women one must keep one\xe2\x80\x99s womanhood. You are becoming\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nare wandering as far from the true way\xe2\x80\x94oh, much further than Bella\r\ndid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t answer you. When we argued about our differences in a friendly\r\nspirit, all was permissible; now if I spoke my thought it would be mere\r\nharshness and cause of embitterment. I fear all is at an end between\r\nus. I should perpetually remind you of this sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of some length. Rhoda turned away, and stood in\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us do nothing hastily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have more to think\r\nof than our own feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said that I am quite willing to go on with my work, but it must\r\nbe on a different footing. The relation between us can no longer be\r\nthat of equals. I am content to follow your directions. But your\r\ndislike of me will make this impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDislike? You misunderstand me wretchedly. I think rather it is you who\r\ndislike me, as a weak woman with no command of her emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they ceased from speech. Presently Miss Barfoot stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRhoda, I shall be away all to-morrow; I may not return to London until\r\nMonday morning. Will you think quietly over it all? Believe me, I am\r\nnot angry with you, and as for disliking you\xe2\x80\x94what nonsense are we\r\ntalking! But I can\xe2\x80\x99t regret that I let you see how painfully your\r\nbehaviour impressed me. That hardness is not natural to you. You have\r\nencouraged yourself in it, and you are warping a very noble character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish only to be honest. Where you felt compassion I felt\r\nindignation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; we have gone through all that. The indignation was a forced,\r\nexaggerated sentiment. You can\xe2\x80\x99t see it in that light perhaps. But try\r\nto imagine for a moment that Bella had been your sister\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is confusing the point at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda exclaimed irritably.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I ever denied the force of such feelings? My grief would have\r\nblinded me to all larger considerations, of course. But she was happily\r\n_not_ my sister, and I remained free to speak the simple truth about\r\nher case. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t personal feeling that directs a great movement in\r\ncivilization. If you were right, I also was right. You should have\r\nrecognized the inevitable discord of our opinions at that moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me inevitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have despised myself if I could have affected sympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffected\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr have really felt it. That would have meant that I did not know\r\nmyself. I should never again have dared to speak on any grave subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow young you are! Oh, there is far more than ten years between our\r\nages, Rhoda! In spirit you are a young girl, and I an old woman. No,\r\nno; we _will not_ quarrel. Your companionship is far too precious to\r\nme, and I dare to think that mine is not without value for you. Wait\r\ntill my grief has had its course; then I shall be more reasonable and\r\ndo you more justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda turned towards the door, lingered, but without looking back, and\r\nso left the room.\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot was absent as she had announced, returning only in time\r\nfor her duties in Great Portland Street on Monday morning. She and\r\nRhoda then shook hands, but without a word of personal reference. They\r\nwent through the day\xe2\x80\x99s work as usual.\r\n\r\nThis was the day of the month on which Miss Barfoot would deliver her\r\nfour o\xe2\x80\x99clock address. The subject had been announced a week ago: \xe2\x80\x9cWoman\r\nas an Invader.\xe2\x80\x9d An hour earlier than usual work was put aside, and\r\nseats were rapidly arranged for the small audience; it numbered only\r\nthirteen\xe2\x80\x94the girls already on the premises and a few who came\r\nspecially. All were aware of the tragedy in which Miss Barfoot had\r\nrecently been concerned; her air of sadness, so great a contrast to\r\nthat with which she was wont to address them, they naturally attributed\r\nto this cause.\r\n\r\nAs always, she began in the simplest conversational tone. Not long\r\nsince she had received an anonymous letter, written by some clerk out\r\nof employment, abusing her roundly for her encouragement of female\r\ncompetition in the clerkly world. The taste of this epistle was as bad\r\nas its grammar, but they should hear it; she read it all through. Now,\r\nwhoever the writer might be, it seemed pretty clear that he was not the\r\nkind of person with whom one could profitably argue; no use in replying\r\nto him, even had he given the opportunity. For all that, his uncivil\r\nattack had a meaning, and there were plenty of people ready to urge his\r\nargument in more respectable terms. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will tell you that, in\r\nentering the commercial world, you not only unsex yourselves, but do a\r\ngrievous wrong to the numberless men struggling hard for bare\r\nsustenance. You reduce salaries, you press into an already overcrowded\r\nfield, you injure even your own sex by making it impossible for men to\r\nmarry, who, if they earned enough, would be supporting a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d To-day,\r\ncontinued Miss Barfoot, it was not her purpose to debate the economic\r\naspects of the question. She would consider it from another point of\r\nview, repeating, perhaps, much that she had already said to them on\r\nother occasions, but doing so because these thoughts had just now very\r\nstrong possession of her mind.\r\n\r\nThis abusive correspondent, who declared that he was supplanted by a\r\nyoung woman who did his work for smaller payment, doubtless had a\r\ngrievance. But, in the miserable disorder of our social state, one\r\ngrievance had to be weighed against another, and Miss Barfoot held that\r\nthere was much more to be urged on behalf of women who invaded what had\r\nbeen exclusively the men\xe2\x80\x99s sphere, than on behalf of the men who began\r\nto complain of this invasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey point to half a dozen occupations which are deemed strictly\r\nsuitable for women. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we confine ourselves to this ground? Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t I encourage girls to become governesses, hospital nurses, and so\r\non? You think I ought to reply that already there are too many\r\napplicants for such places. It would be true, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to make\r\nuse of the argument, which at once involves us in a debate with the\r\nout-crowded clerk. No; to put the truth in a few words, I am not\r\nchiefly anxious that you should _earn money_, but that women in general\r\nshall become _rational and responsible human beings_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me carefully. A governess, a nurse, may be the most admirable\r\nof women. I will dissuade no one from following those careers who is\r\ndistinctly fitted for them. But these are only a few out of the vast\r\nnumber of girls who must, if they are not to be despicable persons,\r\nsomehow find serious work. Because I myself have had an education in\r\nclerkship, and have most capacity for such employment, I look about for\r\ngirls of like mind, and do my best to prepare them for work in offices.\r\nAnd (here I must become emphatic once more) I am _glad_ to have entered\r\non this course. I am _glad_ that I can show girls the way to a career\r\nwhich my opponents call unwomanly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow see why. Womanly and womanish are two very different words; but\r\nthe latter, as the world uses it, has become practically synonymous\r\nwith the former. A womanly occupation means, practically, an occupation\r\nthat a man disdains. And here is the root of the matter. I repeat that\r\nI am not first of all anxious to keep you supplied with daily bread. I\r\nam a troublesome, aggressive, revolutionary person. I want to do away\r\nwith that common confusion of the words womanly and womanish, and I see\r\nvery clearly that this can only be effected by an armed movement, an\r\ninvasion by women of the spheres which men have always forbidden us to\r\nenter. I am strenuously opposed to that view of us set forth in such\r\ncharming language by Mr. Ruskin\xe2\x80\x94for it tells on the side of those men\r\nwho think and speak of us in a way the reverse of charming. Were we\r\nliving in an ideal world, I think women would not go to sit all day in\r\noffices. But the fact is that we live in a world as far from ideal as\r\ncan be conceived. We live in a time of warfare, of revolt. If woman is\r\nno longer to be womanish, but a human being of powers and\r\nresponsibilities, she must become militant, defiant. She must push her\r\nclaims to the extremity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent governess, a perfect hospital nurse, do work which is\r\ninvaluable; but for our cause of emancipation they are no good\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nthey are harmful. Men point to them, and say: Imitate these, keep to\r\nyour proper world. Our proper world is the world of intelligence, of\r\nhonest effort, of moral strength. The old types of womanly perfection\r\nare no longer helpful to us. Like the Church service, which to all but\r\none person in a thousand has become meaningless gabble by dint of\r\nrepetition, these types have lost their effect. They are no longer\r\neducational. We have to ask ourselves: What course of training will\r\nwake women up, make them conscious of their souls, startle them into\r\nhealthy activity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be something new, something free from the reproach of\r\nwomanliness. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether we crowd out the men or not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare _what_ results, if only women are made strong and self-reliant and\r\nnobly independent! The world must look to its concerns. Most likely we\r\nshall have a revolution in the social order greater than any that yet\r\nseems possible. Let it come, and let us help its coming. When I think\r\nof the contemptible wretchedness of women enslaved by custom, by their\r\nweakness, by their desires, I am ready to cry, Let the world perish in\r\ntumult rather than things go on in this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment her voice failed. There were tears in her eyes. The\r\nhearers, most of them, understood what made her so passionate; they\r\nexchanged grave looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur abusive correspondent shall do as best he can. He suffers for the\r\nfolly of men in all ages. We can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. It is very far from our\r\nwish to cause hardship to any one, but we ourselves are escaping from a\r\nhardship that has become intolerable. We are educating ourselves. There\r\nmust be a new type of woman, active in every sphere of life: a new\r\nworker out in the world, a new ruler of the home. Of the old ideal\r\nvirtues we can retain many, but we have to add to them those which have\r\nbeen thought appropriate only in men. Let a woman be gentle, but at the\r\nsame time let her be strong; let her be pure of heart, but none the\r\nless wise and instructed. Because we have to set an example to the\r\nsleepy of our sex, we must carry on an active warfare\xe2\x80\x94must be\r\ninvaders. Whether woman is the equal of man I neither know nor care. We\r\nare not his equal in size, in weight, in muscle, and, for all I can\r\nsay, we may have less power of brain. That has nothing to do with it.\r\nEnough for us to know that our natural growth has been stunted. The\r\nmass of women have always been paltry creatures, and their paltriness\r\nhas proved a curse to men. So, if you like to put it in this way, we\r\nare working for the advantage of men as well as for our own. Let the\r\nresponsibility for disorder rest on those who have made us despise our\r\nold selves. At any cost\xe2\x80\x94at any cost\xe2\x80\x94we will free ourselves from the\r\nheritage of weakness and contempt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe assembly was longer than usual in dispersing. When all were gone,\r\nMiss Barfoot listened for a footstep in the other room. As she could\r\ndetect no sound, she went to see if Rhoda was there or not.\r\n\r\nYes; Rhoda was sitting in a thoughtful attitude. She looked up, smiled,\r\nand came a few paces forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot drew nearer, and added,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was addressed to you. It seemed to me that you had forgotten how I\r\nreally thought about these things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been ill-tempered,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda replied. \xe2\x80\x9cObstinacy is one of my\r\nfaults.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rhoda, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I ought to ask your pardon. Right\r\nor wrong, I behaved in an unmannerly way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda smiled, bending her head to the rebuke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s the last of it,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us kiss and be\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMOTIVES MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Barfoot made his next evening call Rhoda did not appear. He sat\r\nfor some time in pleasant talk with his cousin, no reference whatever\r\nbeing made to Miss Nunn; then at length, beginning to fear that he\r\nwould not see her, he inquired after her health. Miss Nunn was very\r\nwell, answered the hostess, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at home this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusy with some kind of study, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlainly, the difference between these women had come to a happy end, as\r\nBarfoot foresaw that it would. He thought it better to make no mention\r\nof his meeting with Rhoda in the gardens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a very unpleasant affair that I saw your name connected with\r\nlast week,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt made me very miserable\xe2\x80\x94ill indeed for a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was why you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in your reply to my note you made no mention of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot kept silence; frowning slightly, she looked at the fire\r\nnear which they were both sitting, for the weather had become very cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Everard, glancing at her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou refrained out of\r\ndelicacy\xe2\x80\x94on my account, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeed we talk of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a moment, please. You are very friendly with me nowadays, but I\r\nsuppose your estimate of my character remains very much the same as\r\nyears ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of such questions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask for a distinct purpose. You can\xe2\x80\x99t regard me with any respect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you the truth, Everard, I know nothing about you. I have no\r\nwish to revive disagreeable memories, and I think it quite possible\r\nthat you may be worthy of respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far so good. Now, in justice, please answer me another question.\r\nHow have you spoken of me to Miss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters a good deal. Have you told her any scandal about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard looked at her with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke to Miss Nunn about you,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I thought of\r\nyour coming here. Frankly, I used you as an illustration of the evils I\r\nabominate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a courageous and plain-spoken woman, cousin Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEverard, laughing a little. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have found some other\r\nexample?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn regards me as a proved scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never told her the story. I made known the general grounds of my\r\ndissatisfaction with you, that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that\xe2\x80\x99s something. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you didn\xe2\x80\x99t amuse her with that\r\nunedifying bit of fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFiction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard bluntly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going into details; the\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s over and done with, and I chose my course at the time. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas well to let you know that my behaviour was grossly misrepresented.\r\nIn using me to point a moral you were grievously astray. I shall say no\r\nmore. If you can believe me, do; if you can\xe2\x80\x99t, dismiss the matter from\r\nyour mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere followed a silence of some moments. Then, with a perfectly calm\r\nmanner, Miss Barfoot began to speak of a new subject. Everard followed\r\nher lead. He did not stay much longer, and on leaving asked to be\r\nremembered to Miss Nunn.\r\n\r\nA week later he again found his cousin alone. He now felt sure that\r\nMiss Nunn was keeping out of his way. Her parting from him in the\r\ngardens had been decidedly abrupt, and possibly it signified more\r\nserious offence than at the time he attributed to her. It was so\r\ndifficult to be sure of anything in regard to Miss Nunn. If another\r\nwoman had acted thus he would have judged it coquetry. But perhaps\r\nRhoda was quite incapable of anything of that kind. Perhaps she took\r\nherself so very seriously that the mere suspicion of banter in his talk\r\nhad moved her to grave resentment. Or again, she might be half ashamed\r\nto meet him after confessing her disagreement with Miss Barfoot; on\r\nrecovery from ill-temper (unmistakable ill-temper it was), she had seen\r\nher behaviour in an embarrassing light. Between these various\r\nconjectures he wavered whilst talking with Mary. But he did not so much\r\nas mention Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nSome ten days went by, and he paid a call at the hour sanctioned by\r\nsociety, five in the afternoon; it being Saturday. One of his reasons\r\nfor coming at this time was the hope that he might meet other callers,\r\nfor he felt curious to see what sort of people visited the house. And\r\nthis wish was gratified. On entering the drawing-room, whither he was\r\nled by the servant straightway, after the manner of the world, he found\r\nnot only his cousin and her friend, but two strangers, ladies. A glance\r\ninformed him that both of these were young and good-looking, one being\r\na type that particularly pleased him\xe2\x80\x94dark, pale, with very bright eyes.\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot received him as any hostess would have done. She was her\r\ncheerful self once more, and in a moment introduced him to the lady\r\nwith whom she had been talking\xe2\x80\x94the dark one, by name Mrs. Widdowson.\r\nRhoda Nunn, sitting apart with the second lady, gave him her hand, but\r\nat once resumed her conversation.\r\n\r\nWith Mrs. Widdowson he was soon chatting in his easy and graceful way,\r\nMiss Barfoot putting in a word now and then. He saw that she had not\r\nlong been married; a pleasant diffidence and the maidenly glance of her\r\nbright eyes indicated this. She was dressed very prettily, and seemed\r\naware of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went to hear the new opera at the Savoy last night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nMiss Barfoot, with a smile of remembered enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you? Miss Nunn and I were there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard gazed at his cousin with humorous incredulity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were at the Savoy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the impossibility? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Nunn and I go to the\r\ntheatre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appeal to Mrs. Widdowson. She also was astonished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed I was, Miss Barfoot!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the younger lady, with a\r\nmerry little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI hesitated before speaking of such a frivolous\r\nentertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLowering her voice, and casting a smile in Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s direction, Miss\r\nBarfoot replied,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to make a concession occasionally on Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s account. It\r\nwould be unkind never to allow her a little recreation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two at a distance were talking earnestly, with grave countenances.\r\nIn a few moments they rose, and the visitor came towards Miss Barfoot\r\nto take her leave. Thereupon Everard crossed to Miss Nunn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything very good in the new Gilbert and Sullivan opera?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany good things. You really haven\xe2\x80\x99t been yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo go this evening, if you can get a seat. Which part of the theatre\r\ndo you prefer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eye rested on her, but he could detect no irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a poor man, you know. I have to be content with the cheap places.\r\nWhich do you like best, the Savoy operas or the burlesques at the\r\nGaiety?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few more such questions and answers, of laboured commonplace or\r\nstrained flippancy, and Everard, after searching his companion\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nbroke off with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have talked in the approved five o\xe2\x80\x99clock way.\r\nPrecisely the dialogue I heard in a drawing-room yesterday. It goes on\r\nday after day, year after year, through the whole of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are on friendly terms with such people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am on friendly terms with people of every kind.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, in an\r\nundertone, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I may include you, Miss Nunn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut to this she paid no attention. She was looking at Monica and Miss\r\nBarfoot, who had just risen from their seats. They approached, and\r\npresently Barfoot found himself alone with the familiar pair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother cup of tea, Everard?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. Who was the young lady you didn\xe2\x80\x99t introduce me to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Haven\xe2\x80\x94one of our pupils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she think of going into business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has just got a place in the publishing department of a weekly\r\npaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut really\xe2\x80\x94from the few words of her talk that fell upon my ear I\r\nshould have thought her a highly educated girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your objection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she aim at some better position?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot and Rhoda exchanged smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut nothing could be better for her. Some day she hopes to start a\r\npaper of her own, and to learn all the details of such business is just\r\nwhat she wants. Oh, you are still very conventional, Everard. You meant\r\nshe ought to take up something graceful and pretty\xe2\x80\x94something ladylike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I thoroughly approve. And when Miss Haven\r\nstarts her paper, Miss Nunn will write for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d assented his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make me feel that I am in touch with the great movements of our\r\ntime. It\xe2\x80\x99s delightful to know you. But come now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there any way in\r\nwhich I could help?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThey also serve who only stand and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Everard had pleased himself he would have visited the house in\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Road every other day. As this might not be, he spent a good\r\ndeal of his time in other society, not caring to read much, or\r\notherwise occupy his solitude. Starting with one or two acquaintances\r\nin London, people of means and position, he easily extended his social\r\nsphere. Had he cared to marry, he might, notwithstanding his poverty,\r\nhave wooed with fair chance in a certain wealthy family, where two\r\ndaughters, the sole children, plain but well-instructed girls, waited\r\nfor the men of brains who should appreciate them. So rare in society,\r\nthese men of brains, and, alas! so frequently deserted by their wisdom\r\nwhen it comes to choosing a wife. It being his principle to reflect on\r\nevery possibility, Barfoot of course asked himself whether it would not\r\nbe reasonable to approach one or other of these young women\xe2\x80\x94the Miss\r\nBrissendens. He needed a larger income; he wanted to travel in a more\r\nsatisfactory way than during his late absence. Agnes Brissenden struck\r\nhim as a very calm and sensible girl; not at all likely to marry any\r\none but the man who would be a suitable companion for her, and probably\r\ndisposed to look on marriage as a permanent friendship, which must not\r\nbe endangered by feminine follies. She had no beauty, but mental powers\r\nabove the average\xe2\x80\x94superior, certainly, to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIt was worth thinking about, but in the meantime he wanted to see much\r\nmore of Rhoda Nunn. Rhoda he was beginning to class with women who are\r\nattractive both physically and mentally. Strange how her face had\r\naltered to his perception since the first meeting. He smiled now when\r\nhe beheld it\xe2\x80\x94smiled as a man does when his senses are pleasantly\r\naffected. He was getting to know it so well, to be prepared for its\r\nconstant changes, to watch for certain movements of brows or lips when\r\nhe had said certain things. That forcible holding of her hand had\r\nmarked a stage in progressive appreciation; since then he felt a desire\r\nto repeat the experiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr if thy mistress some rich anger shows, Imprison her soft hand, and\r\nlet her rave\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lines occurred to his memory, and he understood them better than\r\nheretofore. It would delight him to enrage Rhoda, and then to detain\r\nher by strength, to overcome her senses, to watch her long lashes droop\r\nover the eloquent eyes. But this was something very like being in love,\r\nand he by no means wished to be seriously in love with Miss Nunn.\r\n\r\nIt was another three weeks before he had an opportunity of private talk\r\nwith her. Trying a Sunday afternoon, about four, he found Rhoda alone\r\nin the drawing-room; Miss Barfoot was out of town. Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s greeting had\r\na frank friendliness which she had not bestowed upon him for a long\r\ntime; not, indeed, since they met on her return from Cheddar. She\r\nlooked very well, readily laughed, and seemed altogether in a coming-on\r\ndisposition. Barfoot noticed that the piano was open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you play?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cStrange that I should still have to ask\r\nthe question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, only a hymn on Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered off-hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hymn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I like some of the old tunes very much. They remind me of the\r\ngolden age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your own life, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have once or twice spoken of that time as if you were not quite\r\nhappy in the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am not quite happy. What woman is? I mean, what woman\r\nabove the level of a petted pussy-cat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard was leaning towards her on the head of the couch where he sat.\r\nHe gazed into her face fixedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it were in my power to remove some of your discontents. I\r\nwould, more gladly than I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou abound in good nature, Mr. Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nunfortunately you can\xe2\x80\x99t change the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the world at large. But might I not change your views of it\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nsome respects?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you could. I think I had rather have my own\r\nview than any you might wish to substitute for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this humour she seemed more than ever a challenge to his manhood.\r\nShe was armed at all points. She feared nothing that he might say. No\r\nflush of apprehension; no nervous tremor; no weak self-consciousness.\r\nYet he saw her as a woman, and desirable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy views are not ignoble,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not. But they are the views of a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan and woman ought to see life with much the same eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught they? Perhaps so. I am not sure. But they never will in our\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndividuals may. The man and woman who have thrown away prejudice and\r\nsuperstition. You and I, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those words have such different meanings. In your judgment I\r\nshould seem full of idle prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe liked this conversation; he read pleasure in her face, saw in her\r\neyes a glint of merry defiance. And his pulses throbbed the quicker for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a prejudice against _me_, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, did you go to the Savoy?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Rhoda absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no intention of talking about the Savoy, Miss Nunn. It is\r\nteacup time, but as yet we have the room to ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda went and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe teacups shall come at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed slightly, and looked at her from beneath drooping lids.\r\nRhoda went on with talk of trifles, until the tea was brought and she\r\nhad given a cup. Having emptied it at two draughts, he resumed his\r\nformer leaning position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you were saying that you had a prejudice against me. Of course\r\nmy cousin Mary is accountable for that. Mary has used me rather ill.\r\nBefore ever you saw me, I represented to your mind something very\r\ndisagreeable indeed. That was too bad of my cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda, sipping her tea, had a cold, uninterested expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know of this,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we met that day in the\r\ngardens, and when I made you so angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t disposed to jest about what had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut neither was I. You quite misunderstood me. Will you tell me how\r\nthat unpleasantness came to an end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. I admitted that I had been ill-mannered and obstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful! Obstinate? I have a great deal of that in my\r\ncharacter. All the active part of my life was one long fit of\r\nobstinacy. As a lad I determined on a certain career, and I stuck to it\r\nin spite of conscious unfitness, in spite of a great deal of suffering,\r\nout of sheer obstinacy. I wonder whether Mary ever told you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe mentioned something of the kind once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could hardly believe it, I dare say? I am a far more reasonable\r\nbeing now. I have changed in so many respects that I hardly know my old\r\nself when I look back on it. Above all, in my thoughts about women. If\r\nI had married during my twenties I should have chosen, as the average\r\nman does, some simpleton\xe2\x80\x94with unpleasant results. If I marry now, it\r\nwill be a woman of character and brains. Marry in the legal sense I\r\nnever shall. My companion must be as independent of forms as I am\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda looked into her teacup for a second or two, then said with a\r\nsmile,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou also are a reformer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had difficulty in suppressing signs of nervousness. The bold\r\ndeclaration had come without forethought, and Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s calm acceptance\r\nof it delighted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestions of marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t interest me much;\r\nbut this particular reform doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem very practical. It is trying to\r\nbring about an ideal state of things whilst we are yet struggling with\r\nelementary obstacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t advocate this liberty for all mankind. Only for those who are\r\nworthy of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she laughed a little\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care the sure signs of worthiness? I\r\nthink it would be very needful to know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard kept a grave face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. But a free union presupposes equality of position. No honest man\r\nwould propose it, for instance, to a woman incapable of understanding\r\nall it involved, or incapable of resuming her separate life if that\r\nbecame desirable. I admit all the difficulties. One must consider those\r\nof feeling, as well as the material. If my wife should declare that she\r\nmust be released, I might suffer grievously, but being a man of some\r\nintelligence, I should admit that the suffering couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be helped; the\r\nbrutality of enforced marriage doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me an alternative worth\r\nconsidering. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem so to any woman of the kind I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWould she have the courage to urge one grave difficulty that he left\r\naside? No. He fancied her about to speak, but she ended by offering him\r\nanother cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, that is _not_ your ideal?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t to do with the subject at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered, with perhaps\r\na trace of impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cMy work and thought are for the women who do\r\nnot marry\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9codd women\xe2\x80\x9d I call them. They alone interest me. One\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t undertake too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you resolutely class yourself with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd therefore you have certain views of life which I should like to\r\nchange. You are doing good work, but I had rather see any other woman\r\nin the world devote her life to it. I am selfish enough to wish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the servant announced,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Widdowson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith perfect self-command Miss Nunn rose and stepped forward. Barfoot,\r\nrising more slowly, looked with curiosity at the husband of the pretty,\r\nblack-browed woman whom he had already met. Widdowson surprised and\r\namused him. How had this stiff, stern fellow with the grizzled beard\r\nwon such a wife? Not that Mrs. Widdowson seemed a remarkable person,\r\nbut certainly it was an ill-assorted union.\r\n\r\nShe came and shook hands. As he spoke a few natural words, Everard\r\nchanced to notice that the husband\xe2\x80\x99s eye was upon him, and with what a\r\nlook! If ever a man declared in his countenance the worst species of\r\njealous temper, Mr. Widdowson did so. His fixed smile became sardonic.\r\n\r\nPresently Barfoot and he were introduced. They had nothing to say to\r\neach other, but Everard maintained a brief conversation just to observe\r\nthe man. Turning at length, he began to talk with Mrs. Widdowson, and,\r\nbecause he was conscious of the jealous eye, assumed an especial\r\nsprightliness, an air of familiar pleasantry, to which the lady\r\nresponded, but with a nervous hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of these people was an intense annoyance to him. Another\r\nquarter of an hour and things would have come to an exciting pass\r\nbetween Rhoda and himself; he would have heard how she received a\r\ndeclaration of love. Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s self-possession notwithstanding, he\r\nbelieved that he was not without power over her. She liked to talk with\r\nhim, enjoyed the freedom he allowed himself in choice of subject.\r\nPerhaps no man before had ever shown an appreciation of her qualities\r\nas woman. But she would not yield, was in no real danger from his\r\nlove-making. Nay, the danger was to his own peace. He felt that\r\nresistance would intensify the ardour of his wooing, and possibly end\r\nby making him a victim of genuine passion. Well, let her enjoy that\r\ntriumph, if she were capable of winning it.\r\n\r\nHe had made up his mind to outstay the Widdowsons, who clearly would\r\nnot make a long call. But the fates were against him. Another visitor\r\narrived, a lady named Cosgrove, who settled herself as if for at least\r\nan hour. Worse than that, he heard her say to Rhoda,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then do come and dine with us. Do, I beg!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d was Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s reply. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you wait and take\r\nme with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUseless to stay longer. As soon as the Widdowsons had departed he went\r\nup to Rhoda and silently offered his hand. She scarcely looked at him,\r\nand did not in the least return his pressure.\r\n\r\nRhoda dined at Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s, and was home again at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nWhen the house was locked up, and the servants had gone to bed, she sat\r\nin the library, turning over a book that she had brought from her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s house. It was a volume of essays, one of which dealt with the\r\nrelations between the sexes in a very modern spirit, treating the\r\nsubject as a perfectly open one, and arriving at unorthodox\r\nconclusions. Mrs. Cosgrove had spoken of this dissertation with lively\r\ninterest. Rhoda perused it very carefully, pausing now and then to\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\nIn this reading of her mind, Barfoot came near the truth.\r\n\r\nNo man had ever made love to her; no man, to her knowledge, had ever\r\nbeen tempted to do so. In certain moods she derived satisfaction from\r\nthis thought, using it to strengthen her life\xe2\x80\x99s purpose; having passed\r\nher thirtieth year, she might take it as a settled thing that she would\r\nnever be sought in marriage, and so could shut the doors on every\r\ninstinct tending to trouble her intellectual decisions. But these\r\ninstincts sometimes refused to be thus treated. As Miss Barfoot told\r\nher, she was very young for her years, young in physique, young in\r\nemotion. As a girl she had dreamt passionately, and the fires of her\r\nnature, though hidden beneath aggregations of moral and mental\r\nattainment, were not yet smothered. An hour of lassitude filled her\r\nwith despondency, none the less real because she was ashamed of it. If\r\nonly she had once been loved, like other women\xe2\x80\x94if she had listened to\r\nan offer of devotion, and rejected it\xe2\x80\x94her heart would be more securely\r\nat peace. So she thought. Secretly she deemed it a hard thing never to\r\nhave known that common triumph of her sex. And, moreover, it took away\r\nfrom the merit of her position as a leader and encourager of women\r\nliving independently. There might be some who said, or thought, that\r\nshe made a virtue of necessity.\r\n\r\nEverard Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s advances surprised her not a little. Judging him as a\r\nman wholly without principle, she supposed at first that this was\r\nmerely his way with all women, and resented it as impertinence. But\r\neven then she did not dislike the show of homage; what her mind\r\nregarded with disdain, her heart was all but willing to feed upon,\r\nafter its long hunger. Barfoot interested her, and not the less because\r\nof his evil reputation. Here was one of the men for whom\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94doubtless more than one\xe2\x80\x94had sacrificed themselves; she could\r\nnot but regard him with sexual curiosity. And her interest grew, her\r\ncuriosity was more haunting, as their acquaintance became a sort of\r\nfriendship; she found that her moral disapprobation wavered, or was\r\naltogether forgotten. Perhaps it was to compensate for this that she\r\nwent the length of outraging Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s feelings on the death of\r\nBella Royston.\r\n\r\nCertainly she thought with much frequency of Barfoot, and looked\r\nforward to his coming. Never had she wished so much to see him again as\r\nafter their encounter in Chelsea Gardens, and on that account she\r\nforced herself to hold aloof when he came. It was not love, nor the\r\nbeginning of love; she judged it something less possible to avow. The\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s presence affected her with a perturbation which she had no\r\ndifficulty in concealing at the time, though afterwards it distressed\r\nand shamed her. She took refuge in the undeniable fact that the quality\r\nof his mind made an impression upon her, that his talk was sympathetic.\r\nMiss Barfoot submitted to this influence; she confessed that her\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s talk had always had a charm for her.\r\n\r\nCould it be that this man reciprocated, and more than reciprocated, her\r\ncomplex feeling? To-day only accident had prevented him from making an\r\navowal of love\xe2\x80\x94unless she strangely mistook him. All the evening she\r\nhad dwelt on this thought; it grew more and more astonishing. Was he\r\nworse than she had imagined? Under cover of independent thought, of\r\nserious moral theories, did he conceal mere profligacy and\r\nheartlessness? It was an extraordinary thing to have to ask such\r\nquestions in relation to herself. It made her feel as if she had to\r\nlearn herself anew, to form a fresh conception of her personality. She\r\nthe object of a man\xe2\x80\x99s passion!\r\n\r\nAnd the thought was exultant. Even thus late, then, the satisfaction of\r\nvanity had been granted her\xe2\x80\x94nay, not of vanity alone.\r\n\r\nHe must be sincere. What motive could he possibly have for playing a\r\npart? Might it not be true that he was a changed man in certain\r\nrespects, and that a genuine emotion at length had control of him? If\r\nso, she had only to wait for his next speech with her in private; she\r\ncould not misjudge a lover\xe2\x80\x99s pleading.\r\n\r\nThe interest would only be that of comedy. She did not love Everard\r\nBarfoot, and saw no likelihood of ever doing so; on the whole, a\r\nsubject for thankfulness. Nor could he seriously anticipate an assent\r\nto his proposal for a free union; in declaring that legal marriage was\r\nout of the question for him, he had removed his love-making to the\r\nregion of mere ideal sentiment. But, if he loved her, these theories\r\nwould sooner or later be swept aside; he would plead with her to become\r\nhis legal wife.\r\n\r\nTo that point she desired to bring him. Offer what he might, she would\r\nnot accept it; but the secret chagrin that was upon her would be\r\nremoved. Love would no longer be the privilege of other women. To\r\nreject a lover in so many respects desirable, whom so many women might\r\nenvy her, would fortify her self-esteem, and enable her to go forward\r\nin the chosen path with firmer tread.\r\n\r\nIt was one o\xe2\x80\x99clock; the fire had died out and she began to shiver with\r\ncold. But a trembling of joy at the same time went through her limbs;\r\nagain she had the sense of exultation, of triumph. She would not\r\ndismiss him peremptorily. He should prove the quality of his love, if\r\nlove it were. Coming so late, the experience must yield her all it had\r\nto yield of delight and contentment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE JOYS OF HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nMonica and her husband, on leaving the house in Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, walked\r\nslowly in the eastward direction. Though night had fallen, the air was\r\nnot unpleasant; they had no object before them, and for five minutes\r\nthey occupied themselves with their thoughts. Then Widdowson stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go home again?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, just glancing at Monica, then\r\nletting his eyes stray vaguely in the gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see Milly, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can hardly take you there\r\nto call with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very poor little sitting-room, you know, and she might have\r\nsome friend. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there anywhere you could go, and meet me afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrowning, Widdowson looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdmund, suppose you go home, and let me come back by myself? You\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, for once? I should like so much to have a talk with\r\nMilly. If I got back about nine or half-past, I could have a little\r\nsupper, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I should want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered abruptly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t have you going about alone at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Monica, with a just perceptible note of irritation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid I shall be robbed or murdered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I always use to be alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made an angry gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have begged you not to speak of that. Why do you say what you know\r\nis disagreeable to me? You used to do all sorts of things that you\r\nnever ought to have been obliged to do, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very painful to\r\nremember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica, seeing that people were approaching, walked on, and neither\r\nspoke until they had nearly reached the end of the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better go home,\xe2\x80\x9d Widdowson at length remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish it; but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call on Milly,\r\nnow that we are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you speak of it before we left home? You ought to be more\r\nmethodical, Monica. Each morning I always plan how my day is to be\r\nspent, and it would be much better if you would do the same. Then you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so restless and uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I go to Rutland Street,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica, without heeding this\r\nadmonition, \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you leave me there for an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought you might walk about. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nmore people, Edmund. It would make things so much pleasanter for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end he consented to see her safely as far as Rutland Street,\r\noccupy himself for an hour, and come back for her. They went by cab,\r\nwhich was dismissed in Hampstead Road. Widdowson did not turn away\r\nuntil he had ocular proof of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s admittance to the house where\r\nMiss Vesper lived, and even then he walked no farther than the\r\nneighbouring streets, returning about every ten minutes to watch the\r\nhouse from a short distance, as though he feared Monica might have some\r\nproject of escape. His look was very bilious; trudging mechanically\r\nhither and thither where fewest people were to be met, he kept his eyes\r\non the ground, and clumped to a dismal rhythm with the end of his\r\nwalking-stick. In the three or four months since his marriage, he\r\nseemed to have grown older; he no longer held himself so upright.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment agreed upon he was waiting close by the house. Five\r\nminutes passed; twice he had looked at his watch, and he grew\r\nexcessively impatient, stamping as if it were necessary to keep himself\r\nwarm. Another five minutes, and he uttered a nervous ejaculation. He\r\nhad all but made up his mind to go and knock at the door when Monica\r\ncame forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been waiting here long, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry. We were talking on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but one must always be punctual. I wish I could impress that upon\r\nyou. Life without punctuality is quite impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, Edmund. I will be more careful. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t lecture\r\nme, dear. How shall we go home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better take a cab to Victoria. No knowing how long we may have\r\nto wait for a train when we get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t be so grumpy. Where have you been all the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, walking about. What else was I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the drive they held no conversation. At Victoria they were delayed\r\nabout half an hour before a train started for Herne Hill; Monica sat in\r\na waiting-room, and her husband trudged about the platform, still\r\nclumping rhythmically with his stick.\r\n\r\nTheir Sunday custom was to dine at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and at six to have tea.\r\nWiddowson hated the slightest interference with domestic routine, and\r\nhe had reluctantly indulged Monica\xe2\x80\x99s desire to go to Chelsea this\r\nafternoon. Hunger was now added to his causes of discontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us have something to eat at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on entering the house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis disorder really won\xe2\x80\x99t do: we must manage better somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout replying, Monica rang the dining-room bell, and gave orders.\r\n\r\nLittle change had been made in the interior of the house since its\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. The dressing-room adjoining the principal\r\nbed-chamber was adapted to Monica\xe2\x80\x99s use, and a few ornaments were added\r\nto the drawing-room. Unlike his deceased brother, Widdowson had the\r\nelements of artistic taste; in furnishing his abode he took counsel\r\nwith approved decorators, and at moderate cost had made himself a home\r\nwhich presented no original features, but gave no offence to a\r\ncultivated eye. The first sight of the rooms pleased Monica greatly.\r\nShe declared that all was perfect, nothing need be altered. In those\r\ndays, if she had bidden him spend a hundred pounds on reconstruction,\r\nthe lover would have obeyed, delighted to hear her express a wish.\r\n\r\nThough competence had come to him only after a lifetime of narrow\r\nmeans, Widdowson felt no temptation to parsimony. Secure in his\r\nall-sufficing income, he grudged no expenditure that could bring\r\nhimself or his wife satisfaction. On the wedding-tour in Cornwall,\r\nDevon, and Somerset\xe2\x80\x94it lasted about seven weeks\xe2\x80\x94Monica learnt, among\r\nother things less agreeable, that her husband was generous with money.\r\n\r\nHe was anxious she should dress well, though only, as Monica soon\r\ndiscovered, for his own gratification. Soon after they had settled down\r\nat home she equipped herself for the cold season, and Widdowson cared\r\nlittle about the price so long as the effect of her new costumes was\r\npleasing to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are making a butterfly of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica merrily, when he\r\nexpressed strong approval of a bright morning dress that had just come\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with the nervous gravity which still\r\npossessed him when complimenting her, or saying tender things, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nbeautiful woman ought to be beautifully clad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time he endeavoured to impress her with the gravest sense\r\nof a married woman\xe2\x80\x99s obligations. His raptures, genuine enough, were\r\nsometimes interrupted in the oddest way if Monica chanced to utter a\r\ncareless remark of which he could not strictly approve, and such\r\ninterruptions frequently became the opportunity for a long and solemn\r\nreview of the wifely status. Without much trouble he had brought her\r\ninto a daily routine which satisfied him. During the whole of the\r\nmorning she was to be absorbed in household cares. In the afternoon he\r\nwould take her to walk or drive, and the evening he wished her to spend\r\neither in drawing-room or library, occupied with a book. Monica soon\r\nfound that his idea of wedded happiness was that they should always be\r\ntogether. Most reluctantly he consented to her going any distance\r\nalone, for whatever purpose. Public entertainments he regarded with no\r\ngreat favour, but when he saw how Monica enjoyed herself at concert or\r\ntheatre, he made no objection to indulging her at intervals of a\r\nfortnight or so; his own fondness for music made this compliance\r\neasier. He was jealous of her forming new acquaintances; indifferent to\r\nsociety himself, he thought his wife should be satisfied with her\r\npresent friends, and could not understand why she wished to see them so\r\noften.\r\n\r\nThe girl was docile, and for a time he imagined that there would never\r\nbe conflict between his will and hers. Whilst enjoying their holiday\r\nthey naturally went everywhere together, and were scarce an hour out of\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s presence, day or night. In quiet spots by the seashore,\r\nwhen they sat in solitude, Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s tongue was loosened, and he\r\npoured forth his philosophy of life with the happy assurance that\r\nMonica would listen passively. His devotion to her proved itself in a\r\nthousand ways; week after week he grew, if anything, more kind, more\r\ntender; yet in his view of their relations he was unconsciously the\r\nmost complete despot, a monument of male autocracy. Never had it\r\noccurred to Widdowson that a wife remains an individual, with rights\r\nand obligations independent of her wifely condition. Everything he said\r\npresupposed his own supremacy; he took for granted that it was his to\r\ndirect, hers to be guided. A display of energy, purpose, ambition, on\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s part, which had no reference to domestic pursuits, would have\r\ngravely troubled him; at once he would have set himself to subdue, with\r\nall gentleness, impulses so inimical to his idea of the married state.\r\nIt rejoiced him that she spoke with so little sympathy of the\r\nprinciples supported by Miss Barfoot and Miss Nunn; these persons\r\nseemed to him well-meaning, but grievously mistaken. Miss Nunn he\r\njudged \xe2\x80\x9cunwomanly,\xe2\x80\x9d and hoped in secret that Monica would not long\r\nremain on terms of friendship with her. Of course his wife\xe2\x80\x99s former\r\npursuits were an abomination to him; he could not bear to hear them\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman\xe2\x80\x99s sphere is the home, Monica. Unfortunately girls are often\r\nobliged to go out and earn their living, but this is unnatural, a\r\nnecessity which advanced civilization will altogether abolish. You\r\nshall read John Ruskin; every word he says about women is good and\r\nprecious. If a woman can neither have a home of her own, nor find\r\noccupation in any one else\xe2\x80\x99s she is deeply to be pitied; her life is\r\nbound to be unhappy. I sincerely believe that an educated woman had\r\nbetter become a domestic servant than try to imitate the life of a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica seemed to listen attentively, but before long she accustomed\r\nherself to wear this look whilst in truth she was thinking her own\r\nthoughts. And as often as not they were of a nature little suspected by\r\nher prosing companion.\r\n\r\nHe believed himself the happiest of men. He had taken a daring step,\r\nbut fortune smiled upon him, Monica was all he had imagined in his\r\nlove-fever; knowledge of her had as yet brought to light no single\r\nuntruth, no trait of character that he could condemn. That she\r\nreturned his love he would not and could not doubt. And something she\r\nsaid to him one day, early in their honeymoon, filled up the measure of\r\nhis bliss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a change you have made in my life, Edmund! How much I have to\r\nthank you for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was what he had hoped to hear. He had thought it himself; had\r\nwondered whether Monica saw her position in this light. And when the\r\nwords actually fell from her lips he glowed with joy. This, to his\r\nmind, was the perfect relation of wife to husband. She must look up to\r\nhim as her benefactor, her providence. It would have pleased him still\r\nbetter if she had not possessed a penny of her own, but happily Monica\r\nseemed never to give a thought to the sum at her disposal.\r\n\r\nSurely he was the easiest of men to live with. When he first became\r\naware that Monica suffered an occasional discontent, it caused him\r\ntroublous surprise. As soon as he understood that she desired more\r\nfreedom of movement, he became anxious, suspicious, irritable. Nothing\r\nlike a quarrel had yet taken place between them, but Widdowson began to\r\nperceive that he must exert authority in a way he had imagined would\r\nnever be necessary. All his fears, after all, were not groundless.\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s undomestic life, and perhaps the association with those\r\nChelsea people, had left results upon her mind. By way of mild\r\ndiscipline, he first of all suggested a closer attention to the affairs\r\nof the house. Would it not be well if she spent an hour a day in sewing\r\nor fancy work? Monica so far obeyed as to provide herself with some\r\nplain needlework, but Widdowson, watching with keen eye, soon remarked\r\nthat her use of the needle was only a feint. He lay awake o\xe2\x80\x99 nights, pondering\r\ndarkly.\r\n\r\nOn the present evening he was more decidedly out of temper than ever\r\nhitherto. He satisfied his hunger hurriedly and in silence. Then,\r\nobserving that Monica ate only a few morsels, he took offence at this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you are not well, dear. You have had no appetite for\r\nseveral days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as usual, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied absently.\r\n\r\nThey went into the library, commonly their resort of an evening.\r\nWiddowson possessed several hundred volumes of English literature, most\r\nof them the works which are supposed to be indispensable to a\r\nwell-informed man, though very few men even make a pretence of reading\r\nthem. Self-educated, Widdowson deemed it his duty to make acquaintance\r\nwith the great, the solid authors. Nor was his study of them\r\naffectation. For the poets he had little taste; the novelists he\r\nconsidered only profitable in intervals of graver reading; but history,\r\npolitical economy, even metaphysics, genuinely appealed to him. He had\r\nalways two or three solid books on hand, each with its marker; he\r\nstudied them at stated hours, and always sitting at a table, a notebook\r\nopen beside him. A little work once well-known, Todd\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cStudent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nManual,\xe2\x80\x9d had formed his method and inspired him with zeal.\r\n\r\nTo-night, it being Sunday, he took down a volume of Barrow\xe2\x80\x99s Sermons.\r\nThough not strictly orthodox in religious faith, he conformed to the\r\npractices of the Church of England, and since his marriage had been\r\nmore scrupulous on this point than before. He abhorred unorthodoxy in a\r\nwoman, and would not on any account have suffered Monica to surmise\r\nthat he had his doubts concerning any article of the Christian faith.\r\nLike most men of his kind, he viewed religion as a precious and\r\npowerful instrument for directing the female conscience. Frequently he\r\nread aloud to his wife, but this evening he showed no intention of\r\ndoing so. Monica, however, sat unoccupied. After glancing at her once\r\nor twice, he said reprovingly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you finished your Sunday book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to read just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silence that followed was broken by Monica herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you accepted Mrs. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have declined it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply, carelessly given.\r\n\r\nMonica bit her lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely we needn\xe2\x80\x99t discuss that over again, Monica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes were still on the book, and he stirred impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d urged his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you mean to break with her altogether? If\r\nso, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very unwise, Edmund. What an opinion you must have of\r\nme, if you think I can\xe2\x80\x99t see people\xe2\x80\x99s faults! I know it\xe2\x80\x99s very true,\r\nall you say about her. But she wishes to be kind to us, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nlike to see something of a life so different from our own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson drummed on the floor with his foot. In a few moments,\r\nignoring Monica\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, he stroked his beard, and asked, with a show\r\nof casual interest\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was it you knew that Mr. Barfoot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had met him before\xe2\x80\x94when I went there on the Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fell; his brow was wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s often there, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Perhaps he is. He\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him more than once before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Why do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was only that he seemed to speak as if you were old\r\nacquaintances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his way, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica had already learnt that the jealousy which Widdowson so often\r\nbetrayed before their manage still lurked in his mind. Perceiving why\r\nhe put these questions, she could not look entirely unconcerned, and\r\nthe sense of his eye being upon her caused her some annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talked to him, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, changing her position in the\r\ndeep chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the kind of talk that is possible with a perfect stranger. I\r\nsuppose he is in some profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why, Edmund? Does he interest you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly that one likes to know something about the people that are\r\nintroduced to one\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x9d Widdowson answered rather acridly.\r\n\r\nTheir bedtime was half-past ten. Precisely at that moment Widdowson\r\nclosed his book\xe2\x80\x94glad to be relieved from the pretence of reading\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwalked over the lower part of the house to see that all was right. He\r\nhad a passion for routine. Every night, before going upstairs, he did a\r\nnumber of little things in unvarying sequence\xe2\x80\x94changed the calendar for\r\nnext day, made perfect order on his writing-table, wound up his watch,\r\nand so on. That Monica could not direct her habits with like exactitude\r\nwas frequently a distress to him; if she chanced to forget any most\r\ntrivial detail of daily custom he looked very solemn, and begged her to\r\nbe more vigilant.\r\n\r\nNext morning after breakfast, as Monica stood by the dining-room window\r\nand looked rather cheerlessly at a leaden sky, her husband came towards\r\nher as if he had something to say. She turned, and saw that his face no\r\nlonger wore the austere expression which had made her miserable last\r\nnight, and even during the meal this morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we friends?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the attempt at playfulness which always\r\nmade him look particularly awkward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica answered, smiling, but not regarding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he behave gruffly last night to his little girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what can the old bear do to show that he\xe2\x80\x99s sorry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever be gruff again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old bear is sometimes an old goose as well, and torments himself\r\nin the silliest way. Tell him so, if ever he begins to behave badly.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it account-book morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you at eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if we have a nice, quiet, comfortable week, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to the\r\nCrystal Palace concert next Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica nodded cheerfully, and went off to look after her housekeeping.\r\n\r\nThe week was in all respects what Widdowson desired. Not a soul came to\r\nthe house; Monica went to see no one. Save on two days, it rained,\r\nsleeted, drizzled, fogged; on those two afternoons they had an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalk. Saturday brought no improvement of the atmosphere, but Widdowson\r\nwas in his happiest mood; he cheerfully kept his promise about the\r\nconcert. As they sat together at night, his contentment overflowed in\r\ntenderness like that of the first days of marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, why can\xe2\x80\x99t we always live like this? What have we to do with other\r\npeople? Let us be everything to each other, and forget that any one\r\nelse exists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking that\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica ventured to reply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one thing, if we saw more people, we should have so much more to\r\ntalk about when we are alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better to talk about ourselves. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care if I never again\r\nsaw any living creature but you. You see, the old bear loves his little\r\ngirl better than she loves him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it true? You don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that my company would be enough for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be right if I ceased to care for every one else? There are my\r\nsisters. I ought to have asked Virginia to come to-morrow; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\r\nthinks I neglect her, and it must be dreadful living all alone like she\r\ndoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t they made up their mind yet about the school? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe right thing for them to do. If the venture were to fail, and they\r\nlost money, we would see that they never came to want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re so timid about it. And it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be nice, you know, to feel\r\nthey were going to be dependent upon us for the rest of their lives. I\r\nhad better go and see Virgie to-morrow morning, and bring her back for\r\ndinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like,\xe2\x80\x9d Widdowson assented slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why not send a message,\r\nand ask her to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather go. It makes a change for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a word Widdowson detested. Change, on Monica\xe2\x80\x99s lips, always\r\nseemed to mean a release from his society. But he swallowed his\r\ndissatisfaction, and finally consented to the arrangement.\r\n\r\nVirginia came to dinner, and stayed until nightfall. Thanks to her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s kindness, she was better clad than in former days, but her\r\nface signified no improvement of health. The enthusiasm with which\r\nRhoda Nunn had inspired her appeared only in fitful affectations of\r\ninterest when Monica pressed her concerning the projected undertaking\r\ndown in Somerset. In general she had a dreamy, reticent look, and\r\nbecame uncomfortable when any one gazed at her inquiringly. Her talk\r\nwas of the most insignificant things; this afternoon she spent nearly\r\nhalf an hour in describing a kitten which Mrs. Conisbee had given her;\r\ncare of the little animal appeared to have absorbed her whole attention\r\nfor many days past.\r\n\r\nAnother visitor to-day was Mr. Newdick, the City clerk who had been\r\npresent at Monica\xe2\x80\x99s wedding. He and Mrs. Luke Widdowson were the sole\r\nfriends of her husband that Monica had seen. Mr. Newdick enjoyed coming\r\nto Herne Hill. Always lugubrious to begin with, he gradually cheered\r\nup, and by the time for departure was loquacious. But he had the oddest\r\nideas of talk suitable to a drawing-room. Had he been permitted, he\r\nwould have held forth to Monica by the hour on the history of the\r\nbusiness firm which he had served for a quarter of a century. This\r\nsubject alone could animate him. His anecdotes were as often as not\r\nquite unintelligible, save to people of City experience. For all that\r\nMonica did not dislike the man; he was a good, simple, unselfish\r\nfellow, and to her he behaved with exaggeration of respect.\r\n\r\nA few days later Monica had a sudden fit of illness. Her marriage, and\r\nthe long open-air holiday, had given her a much healthier appearance\r\nthan when she was at the shop; but this present disorder resembled the\r\nattack she had suffered in Rutland Street. Widdowson hoped that it\r\nsignified a condition for which he was anxiously waiting. That,\r\nhowever, did not seem to be the case. The medical man who was called in\r\nasked questions about the patient\xe2\x80\x99s mode of life. Did she take enough\r\nexercise? Had she wholesome variety of occupation? At these inquiries\r\nWiddowson inwardly raged. He was tormented with a suspicion that they\r\nresulted from something Monica had said to the doctor.\r\n\r\nShe kept her bed for three or four days, and on rising could only sit\r\nby the fireside, silent, melancholy. Widdowson indulged his hope,\r\nthough Monica herself laughed it aside, and even showed annoyance if he\r\nreturn to the subject. Her temper was strangely uncertain; some chance\r\nword in a conversation would irritate her beyond endurance, and after\r\nan outburst of petulant displeasure she became obstinately mute. At\r\nother times she behaved with such exquisite docility and sweetness that\r\nWiddowson was beside himself with rapture.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of convalescence, she said one morning,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we go away somewhere? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall ever be quite\r\nwell staying here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wretched weather,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but there are places where it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be like this. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind the expense, do you, Edmund?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExpense? Not I, indeed! But\xe2\x80\x94were you thinking of abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with eyes that had suddenly brightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! would it be possible? People do go out of England in the winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson plucked at his grizzled beard and fingered his watch-chain.\r\nIt was a temptation. Why not take her away to some place where only\r\nforeigners and strangers would be about them? Yet the enterprise\r\nalarmed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been out of England,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with misgiving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the more reason why we should go. I think Miss Barfoot could\r\nadvise us about it. She has been abroad, I know, and she has so many\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any need to consult Miss Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied stiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam not such a helpless man, Monica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet a feeling of inability to grapple with such an undertaking as this\r\ngrew on him the more he thought of it. Naturally, his mind busied\r\nitself with such vague knowledge as he had gathered of those places in\r\nthe South of France, where rich English people go to escape their own\r\nclimate: Nice, Cannes. He could not imagine himself setting forth to\r\nthese regions. Doubtless it was possible to travel thither, and live\r\nthere when one arrived, without a knowledge of French; but he pictured\r\nall sorts of humiliating situations resulting from his ignorance. Above\r\neverything he dreaded humiliation in Monica\xe2\x80\x99s sight; it would be\r\nintolerable to have her comparing him with men who spoke foreign\r\nlanguages, and were at home on the Continent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he wrote to his friend Newdick, and invited him to dine,\r\nsolely for the purpose of talking over this question with him in\r\nprivate. After dinner he broached the subject. To his surprise, Newdick\r\nhad ideas concerning Nice and Cannes and such places. He had heard\r\nabout them from the junior partner of his firm, a young gentleman who\r\ntalked largely of his experiences abroad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn immoral lot there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling and shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cQueer\r\ngoings on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but that\xe2\x80\x99s among the foreigners, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. Newdick revealed his acquaintance with English literature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever read any of Ouida\xe2\x80\x99s novels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you to before you think of taking your wife over there. She\r\nwrites a great deal about those parts. People get mixed up so, it\r\nseems. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live by yourself. You have to eat at public tables,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99d have all sorts of people trying to make acquaintance with\r\nMrs. Widdowson. They\xe2\x80\x99re a queer lot, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe abandoned the thought, at once and utterly. When Monica learnt\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94he gave only vague and unsatisfactory reasons\xe2\x80\x94she fell back into\r\nher despondent mood. For a whole day she scarcely uttered a word.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, in the dreary afternoon, they were surprised by a call\r\nfrom Mrs. Luke. The widow\xe2\x80\x94less than ever a widow in externals\xe2\x80\x94came in\r\nwith a burst of exuberant spirits, and began to scold the moping couple\r\nlike an affectionate parent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you silly young people coming to an end of your honeymoon? Do\r\nyou sit here day after day and call each other pretty names? Really\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very charming in its way. I never knew such an obstinate\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x94Monica, my black-eyed beauty, change your frock, and come with\r\nme to look up the Hodgson Bulls. They\xe2\x80\x99re quite too awful; I can\xe2\x80\x99t face\r\nthem alone; but I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to keep in with them. Be off, and let me\r\npitch into your young man for daring to refuse my dinner. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow, sir, that my invitations are like those of Royalty\xe2\x80\x94polite\r\ncommands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson kept silence, waiting to see what his wife would do. He could\r\nnot with decency object to her accompanying Mrs. Luke, yet hated the\r\nthought of such a step. A grim smile on his face, he sat stiffly,\r\nstaring at the wall. To his inexpressible delight, Monica, after a\r\nshort hesitation, excused herself; she was not well; she did not feel\r\nable\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see! Do just as you like, of\r\ncourse. But if Edmund has any _nous_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this phrase she had learnt from\r\na young gentleman, late of Oxford, now of Tattersall\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nelsewhere\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che won\xe2\x80\x99t let you sit here in the dumps. You _are_ in the\r\ndumps, I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vivacious lady did not stay long. When she had rustled forth again\r\nto her carriage, Widdowson broke into a paean of amorous gratitude.\r\nWhat could he do to show how he appreciated Monica\xe2\x80\x99s self-denial on his\r\nbehalf? For a day or two he was absent rather mysteriously, and in the\r\nmeantime made up his mind, after consultation with Newdick, to take his\r\nwife for a holiday in Guernsey.\r\n\r\nMonica, when she heard of this project, was at first moderately\r\ngrateful, but in a day or two showed by reviving strength and spirits\r\nthat she looked forward eagerly to the departure. Her husband\r\nadvertised for lodgings in St. Peter Port; he would not face the\r\ndisagreeable chances of a hotel. In a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s time all their\r\npreparations were made. During their absence, which might extend over a\r\nmonth, Virginia was to live at Herne Hill, in supervision of the two\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nOn the last Sunday Monica went to see her friends in Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road.\r\nWiddowson was ashamed to offer an objection; he much disliked her going\r\nthere alone, but disliked equally the thought of accompanying her, for\r\nat Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s he could not pretend to sit, stand, or converse with\r\nease.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Mrs. Cosgrove was again calling. On the first occasion\r\nof meeting with Monica this lady paid her no particular attention;\r\nto-day she addressed her in a friendly manner, and their conversation\r\nled to the discovery that both of them were about to spend the ensuing\r\nmonth in the same place. Mrs. Cosgrove hoped they might occasionally\r\nsee each other.\r\n\r\nOf this coincidence Monica thought better to say nothing on her return\r\nhome. She could not be sure that her husband might not, at the last\r\nmoment, decide to stay at Herne Hill rather than incur the risk of her\r\nmeeting an acquaintance in Guernsey. On this point he could not be\r\ntrusted to exercise common sense. For the first time Monica had a\r\nsecret she desired to keep from him, and the necessity was one which\r\ncould not but have an unfavourable effect on her manner of regarding\r\nWiddowson. They were to start on Monday evening. Through the day her\r\nmind was divided between joy in the thought of seeing a new part of the\r\nworld and a sense of weary dislike for her home. She had not understood\r\nuntil now how terrible would be the prospect of living here for a long\r\ntime with no companionship but her husband\xe2\x80\x99s. On the return that\r\nprospect would lie before her. But no; their way of life must somehow\r\nbe modified; on that she was resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nHEALTH FROM THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Herne Hill to St. Peter Port was a change which made of Monica a\r\nnew creature. The weather could not have been more propitious; day\r\nafter day of still air and magnificent sky, with temperature which made\r\na brisk walk at any hour thoroughly enjoyable, yet allowed one to sit\r\nat ease in the midday sunshine. Their lodgings were in the best part of\r\nthe town, high up, looking forth over blue sea to the cliffs of Sark.\r\nWiddowson congratulated himself on having taken this step; it was like\r\na revival of his honeymoon; never since their settling down at home had\r\nMonica been so grateful, so affectionate. Why, his wife was what he had\r\nthought her from the first, perfect in every wifely attribute. How\r\nlovely she looked as she sat down to the breakfast-table, after\r\nbreathing sea air at the open windows, in her charming dress, her black\r\nhair arranged in some new fashion just to please him! Or when she\r\nwalked with him about the quays, obviously admired by men who passed\r\nthem. Or when she seated herself in the open carriage for a drive which\r\nwould warm her cheeks and make her lips redder and sweeter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdmund,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him one evening, as they talked by the fireside,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you think you take life rather too gravely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGravely? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I seem to enjoy myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; just now. But\xe2\x80\x94still in a rather serious way. One would think\r\nyou always had cares on your mind, and were struggling to get rid of\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a care in the world. I am the most blessed of mortals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you ought to think yourself. But when we get back again, how will\r\nit be? You won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me? I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can live\r\nagain as we were doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot live as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis brow darkened; he looked at her in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to have more enjoyment,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued courageously. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of\r\nthe numbers of people who live a dull, monotonous life just because\r\nthey can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. How they would envy us, with so much money to\r\nspend, free to do just what we like! Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem a pity to sit\r\nthere day after day alone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, my darling!\xe2\x80\x9d he implored. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! That makes me think you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! I want you to see what I mean. I am not one of the silly\r\npeople who care for nothing but amusement, but I do think we might\r\nenjoy our lives more when we are in London. We shan\xe2\x80\x99t live for ever,\r\nyou know. Is it right to spend day after day sitting there in the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut come, come; we have our occupations. Surely it ought to be a\r\npleasure to you to see that the house is kept in order. There are\r\nduties\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know. But these duties I could perform in an hour or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot thoroughly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite thoroughly enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, Monica, a woman ought never to be so happy as when she\r\nis looking after her home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the old pedantic tone. His figure, in sympathy with it,\r\nabandoned an easy attitude and became awkward. But Monica would not\r\nallow herself to be alarmed. During the past week she had conducted\r\nherself so as to smooth the way for this very discussion. Unsuspecting\r\nhusband!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to do my duty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a firm tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s right to make dull work for oneself, when one might be living. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think it _is_ living to go on week after week like that. If we\r\nwere poor, and I had a lot of children to look after as well as all the\r\nhousework to do, I believe I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t grumble\xe2\x80\x94at least, I hope I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I should know that I ought to do what there was no one else\r\nto do, and make the best of it. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake the best of it!\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an expression\r\nto use! It would not only be your duty, dear, but your privilege!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, Edmund. If you were a shopman earning fifteen shillings\r\na week, and working from early morning to late at night, should you\r\nthink it not only your duty but your privilege?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a wrathful gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat comparison is there? I should be earning a hard livelihood by\r\nslaving for other people. But a married woman who works in her own\r\nhome, for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork is work, and when a woman is overburdened with it she must find\r\nit difficult not to weary of home and husband and children all\r\ntogether. But of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that my work is too hard.\r\nAll I mean is, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why any one should _make_ work, and why\r\nlife shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be as full of enjoyment as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica, you have got these ideas from those people at Chelsea. That is\r\nexactly why I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for you to see much of them. I utterly\r\ndisapprove of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are mistaken. Miss Barfoot and Miss Nunn are all for work.\r\nThey take life as seriously as you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork? What kind of work? They want to make women unwomanly, to make\r\nthem unfit for the only duties women ought to perform. You know very\r\nwell my opinions about that kind of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was trembling with the endeavour to control himself, to speak\r\nindulgently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think, Edmund, there\xe2\x80\x99s much real difference between men and\r\nwomen. That is, there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, if women had fair treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much difference? Oh, come; you are talking nonsense. There\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nmuch difference between their minds as between their bodies. They are\r\nmade for entirely different duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that word Duty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPained unutterably, Widdowson bent forward and took her hand. He spoke\r\nin a tone of the gravest but softest rebuke. She was giving\r\nentertainment to thoughts that would lead her who knew whither, that\r\nwould undermine her happiness, would end by making both of them\r\nmiserable. He besought her to put all such monstrous speculations out\r\nof her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, good little wife! Do be guided by your husband. He is older than\r\nyou, darling, and has seen so much more of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t said anything dreadful, dear. My thoughts don\xe2\x80\x99t come from\r\nother people; they rise naturally in my own head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what do you really want? You say you can\xe2\x80\x99t live as we were doing.\r\nWhat change would you make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to make more friends, and to see them often. I want to\r\nhear people talk, and know what is going on round about me. And to read\r\na different kind of books; books that would really amuse me, and give\r\nme something I could think about with pleasure. Life will be a burden\r\nto me before long if I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any harm in saying that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom?\xe2\x80\x9d He glared at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall begin to think that you wish you\r\nhad never married me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should only wish that if I were made to feel that you shut me up in\r\na house and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust me to go where I chose. Suppose the thought\r\ntook you that you would go and walk about the City some afternoon, and\r\nyou wished to go alone, just to be more at ease, should I have a right\r\nto forbid you, or grumble at you? And yet you are very dissatisfied if\r\nI wish to go anywhere alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the old confusion. I am a man; you are a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see that that makes any difference. A woman ought to go about\r\njust as freely as a man. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s just. When I have done my\r\nwork at home I think I ought to be every bit as free as you are\xe2\x80\x94every\r\nbit as free. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Edmund, that love needs freedom if it is to\r\nremain love in truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her keenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful thing for you to say. So, if I disapprove of your\r\nbecoming the kind of woman that acknowledges no law, you will cease to\r\nlove me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat law do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the natural law that points out a woman\xe2\x80\x99s place, and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he added,\r\nwith shaken voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccommands her to follow her husband\xe2\x80\x99s guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you are angry. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it any more just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose and poured out a glass of water. Her hand trembled as she\r\ndrank. Widdowson fell into gloomy abstraction. Later, as they lay side\r\nby side, he wished to renew the theme, but Monica would not talk; she\r\ndeclared herself too sleepy, turned her back to him, and soon slept\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThat night the weather became stormy; a roaring wind swept the Channel,\r\nand when day broke nothing could be seen but cloud and rain. Widdowson,\r\nwho had rested little, was in a heavy, taciturn mood; Monica, on the\r\nother hand, talked gaily, seeming not to observe her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nirresponsiveness. She was glad of the wild sky; now they would see\r\nanother aspect of island life\xe2\x80\x94the fierce and perilous surges beating\r\nabout these granite shores.\r\n\r\nThey had brought with them a few books, and Widdowson, after breakfast,\r\nsat down by the fire to read. Monica first of all wrote a letter to her\r\nsister; then, as it was still impossible to go out, she took up one of\r\nthe volumes that lay on a side-table in their sitting-room, novels left\r\nby former lodgers. Her choice was something or other with yellow back.\r\nWiddowson, watching all her movements furtively, became aware of the\r\npictured cover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll get much good out of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, after\r\none or two efforts to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo harm, at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure. Why should you waste your time? Take \xe2\x80\x9cGuy Mannering,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nif you want a novel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see how I like this first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt himself powerless, and suffered acutely from the thought that\r\nMonica was in rebellion against him. He could not understand what had\r\nbrought about this sudden change. Fear of losing his wife\xe2\x80\x99s love\r\nrestrained him from practical despotism, yet he was very near to\r\nuttering a definite command.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon it no longer rained, and the wind had less violence.\r\nThey went out to look at the sea. Many people were gathered about the\r\nharbour, whence was a fine view of the great waves that broke into\r\nleaping foam and spray against the crags of Sark. As they stood thus\r\noccupied, Monica heard her name spoken in a friendly voice\xe2\x80\x94that of\r\nMrs. Cosgrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been expecting to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWe arrived three\r\ndays ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson, starting with surprise, turned to examine the speaker. He\r\nsaw a woman of something less than middle age, unfashionably attired,\r\ngood-looking, with an air of high spirits; only when she offered her\r\nhand to him did he remember having met her at Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s. To be\r\ngraceful in a high wind is difficult for any man; the ungainliness with\r\nwhich he returned Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s greeting could not have been\r\nsurpassed, and probably would have been much the same even had he not,\r\nof necessity, stood clutching at his felt hat.\r\n\r\nThe three talked for a few minutes. With Mrs. Cosgrove were two\r\npersons, a younger woman and a man of about thirty\xe2\x80\x94the latter a comely\r\nand vivacious fellow, with rather long hair of the orange-tawny hue.\r\nThese looked at Monica, but Mrs. Cosgrove made no introduction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and see me, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, mentioning her address. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get out much in the evenings; I shall be nearly always at home after\r\ndinner, and we have music\xe2\x80\x94of a kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica boldly accepted the invitation, said she would be glad to come.\r\nThen Mrs. Cosgrove took leave of them, and walked landwards with her\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nWiddowson stood gazing at the sea. There was no misreading his\r\ncountenance. When Monica had remarked it, she pressed her lips\r\ntogether, and waited for what he would say or do. He said nothing, but\r\npresently turned his back upon the waves and began to walk on. Neither\r\nspoke until they were in the shelter of the streets; then Widdowson\r\nasked suddenly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho _is_ that person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only know her name, and that she goes to Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a most extraordinary thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in high irritation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no getting out of the way of those people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica also was angry; her cheeks, reddened by the wind, grew hotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still more extraordinary that you should object so to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether or no\xe2\x80\x94I _do_ object, and I had rather you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to see\r\nthat woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica answered sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I shall go\r\nand see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you to do so! If you go, it will be in defiance of my wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am obliged to defy your wish. I shall certainly go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face was frightfully distorted. Had they been in a lonely spot,\r\nMonica would have felt afraid of him. She moved hurriedly away in the\r\ndirection of their lodgings, and for a few paces he followed; then he\r\nchecked himself, turned round about, took an opposite way.\r\n\r\nWith strides of rage he went along by the quay, past the hotels and the\r\nsmaller houses that follow, on to St. Sampson. The wind, again\r\npreparing for a tempestuous night, beat and shook and at moments all\r\nbut stopped him; he set his teeth like a madman, and raged on. Past the\r\ngranite quarries at Bordeaux Harbour, then towards the wild north\r\nextremity of the island, the sandy waste of L\xe2\x80\x99Ancresse. When darkness\r\nbegan to fall, no human being was in his range of sight. He stood on\r\none spot for nearly a quarter of an hour, watching, or appearing to\r\nwatch, the black, low-flying scud.\r\n\r\nTheir time for dining was seven. Shortly before this Widdowson entered\r\nthe house and went to the sitting-room; Monica was not there. He found\r\nher in the bed-chamber, before the looking-glass. At the sight of his\r\nreflected face she turned instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica!\xe2\x80\x9d He put his hands on her shoulders, whispering hoarsely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica! don\xe2\x80\x99t you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked away, not replying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd of a sudden he fell on his knees before her, clasped her about the\r\nwaist, burst into choking sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no love for me? My darling! My dear, beautiful wife! Have you\r\nbegun to hate me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears came to her eyes. She implored him to rise and command himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so violent, so brutal with you. I spoke without thinking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _why_ should you speak like that? Why are you so unreasonable? If\r\nyou forbid me to do simple things, with not the least harm in them, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to take it like a child. I shall resist; I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had risen and was crushing her in his arms, his hot breath on her\r\nneck, when he began to whisper,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to keep you all to myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like these people\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nthink so differently\xe2\x80\x94they put such hateful ideas into your mind\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nare not the right kind of friends for you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou misunderstand them, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least understand me. Oh,\r\nyou hurt me, Edmund!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe released her body, and took her head between his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather you were dead than that you should cease to love me! You\r\nshall go to see her; I won\xe2\x80\x99t say a word against it. But, Monica, be\r\nfaithful, be faithful to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaithful to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I said or\r\ndone to put you in such a state? Because I wish to make a few friends\r\nas all women do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because I have lived so much alone. I have never had more than\r\none or two friends, and I am absurdly jealous when you want to get away\r\nfrom me and amuse yourself with strangers. I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to such people.\r\nI am not suited for society. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t met you in that strange way,\r\nby miracle, I should never have been able to marry. If I allow you to\r\nhave these friends\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear that word. Why should you say _allow_? Do you\r\nthink of me as your servant, Edmund?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how I think of you. It is I who am your servant, your slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that!\xe2\x80\x9d She pressed her handkerchief to her cheeks,\r\nand laughed unnaturally. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch words don\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything. It is you who\r\nforbid and allow and command, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never again use such words. Only convince me that you love me\r\nas much as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so miserable to begin quarrelling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever again! Say you love me! Put your arms round my neck\xe2\x80\x94press\r\ncloser to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kissed his cheek, but did not utter a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t say that you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I am always showing it. Do get ready for dinner now; it\xe2\x80\x99s past\r\nseven. Oh, how foolish you have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course their talk lasted half through the night. Monica held with\r\nremarkable firmness to the position she had taken; a much older woman\r\nmight have envied her steadfast yet quite rational assertion of the\r\nright to live a life of her own apart from that imposed upon her by the\r\nduties of wedlock. A great deal of this spirit and the utterance it\r\nfound was traceable to her association with the women whom Widdowson so\r\ndeeply suspected; prior to her sojourn in Rutland Street she could not\r\neven have made clear to herself the demands which she now very clearly\r\nformulated. Believing that she had learnt nothing from them, and till\r\nof late instinctively opposing the doctrines held by Miss Barfoot and\r\nRhoda Nunn, Monica in truth owed the sole bit of real education she had\r\never received to those few weeks of attendance in Great Portland\r\nStreet. Circumstances were now proving how apt a pupil she had been,\r\neven against her will. Marriage, as is always the case with women\r\ncapable of development, made for her a new heaven and a new earth;\r\nperhaps on no single subject did she now think as on the morning of her\r\nwedding-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must either trust me completely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cor not at all. If you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t trust me, how can I possibly love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I never to advise?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her husband, baffled, and even awed, by\r\nthis extraordinary revelation of a woman he had supposed himself to\r\nknow thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing from forbidding and commanding!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was that novel this morning. Of course I know as well\r\nas you do that \xe2\x80\x9cGuy Mannering\xe2\x80\x9d is better; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say I am not\r\nto form my opinion of other books. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to leave me\r\nthe same freedom you have yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe result of it all was that Widdowson felt his passionate love glow\r\nwith new fire. For a moment he thought himself capable of accepting\r\nthis change in their relations. The marvellous thought of equality\r\nbetween man and wife, that gospel which in far-off days will refashion\r\nthe world, for an instant smote his imagination and exalted him above\r\nhis native level.\r\n\r\nMonica paid for the energy she had put forth by a day of suffering. Her\r\nhead ached intolerably; she had feverish symptoms, and could hardly\r\nraise herself from the bed. It passed, and she was once more eager to\r\ngo forth under the blue sky that followed the tempest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go with me to Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nHe consented, and after dinner they sought the hotel where their\r\nacquaintance was staying. Widdowson was in extreme discomfort, partly\r\ndue to the fact that he had no dress clothes to put on; for far from\r\nanticipating or desiring any such intercourse in Guernsey, he had never\r\nthought of packing an evening suit. Had he known Mrs. Cosgrove this\r\nuneasiness would have been spared him. That lady was in revolt against\r\nfar graver institutions than the swallow-tail; she cared not a button\r\nin what garb her visitors came to her. On their arrival, they found, to\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s horror, a room full of women. With the hostess was that\r\nyounger lady they had seen on the quay, Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s unmarried\r\nsister; Miss Knott\xe2\x80\x99s health had demanded this retreat from the London\r\nwinter. The guests were four\xe2\x80\x94a Mrs. Bevis and her three daughters\xe2\x80\x94all\r\ninvalidish persons, the mother somewhat lackadaisical, the girls with a\r\nlook of unwilling spinsterhood.\r\n\r\nMonica, noteworthy among the gathering for her sweet, bright\r\nprettiness, and the finish of her dress, soon made herself at home; she\r\nchatted gaily with the girls\xe2\x80\x94wondering indeed at her own air of\r\nmaturity, which came to her for the first time. Mrs. Cosgrove, an easy\r\nwoman of the world when circumstances required it, did her best to get\r\nsomething out of Widdowson who presently thawed a little.\r\n\r\nThen Miss Knott sat down to the piano, and played more than tolerably\r\nwell; and the youngest Miss Bevis sang a song of Schubert, with\r\npassable voice but in very distressing German\xe2\x80\x94the sole person\r\ndistressed by it being the hostess.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Monica had been captured by Mrs. Bevis, who discoursed to her\r\non a subject painfully familiar to all the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know my son, Mrs. Widdowson? Oh, I thought you had perhaps met\r\nhim. You will do so this evening, I hope. He is over here on a\r\nfortnight\xe2\x80\x99s holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you live in Guernsey?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ practically live here, and one of my daughters is always with me.\r\nThe other two live with their brother in a flat in Bayswater. Do you\r\ncare for flats, Mrs. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica could only say that she had no experience of that institution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think them such a boon,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs. Bevis. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are expensive\r\nbut the advantages and comforts are so many. My son wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t on any\r\nconsideration give up his flat. As I was saying, he always has two of\r\nhis sisters to keep house for him. He is quite a young man, not yet\r\nthirty, but\xe2\x80\x94would you believe it?\xe2\x80\x94we are all dependent upon him! My\r\nson has supported the _whole_ of the family for the last six or seven\r\nyears, and that by his own work. It sounds incredible, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But\r\nfor him we should be quite unable to live. The dear girls have very\r\ndelicate health; simply impossible for them to exert themselves in any\r\nway. My son has made extraordinary sacrifices on our account. His\r\ndesire was to be a professional musician, and every one thinks he would\r\nhave become eminent; myself, I am convinced of it\xe2\x80\x94perhaps that is only\r\nnatural. But when our circumstances began to grow very doubtful, and we\r\nreally didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was before us, my son consented to follow a\r\nbusiness career\xe2\x80\x94that of wine merchant, with which his father was\r\nconnected. And he exerted himself so nobly, and gave proof of such\r\nability, that very soon all our fears were at an end; and now, before\r\nhe is thirty, his position is quite assured. We have no longer a care.\r\nI live here very economically\xe2\x80\x94really sweet lodgings on the road to St.\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s; I _do_ hope you will come and see me. And the girls go\r\nbackwards and forwards. You see we are _all_ here at present. When my\r\nson returns to London he will take the eldest and the youngest with\r\nhim. The middle girl, dear Grace\xe2\x80\x94she is thought very clever in\r\nwater-colours, and I am quite sure, if it were necessary, she could\r\npursue the arts in a professional spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bevis entered the room, and Monica recognized the sprightly young\r\nman whom she had seen on the quay. The hostess presented him to her new\r\nfriends, and he got into talk with Widdowson. Requested to make music\r\nfor the company, he sang a gay little piece, which, to Monica at all\r\nevents, seemed one of the most delightful things she had ever heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis own composition,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Miss Grace Bevis, then sitting by Mrs.\r\nWiddowson.\r\n\r\nThat increased her delight. Foolish as Mrs. Bevis undoubtedly was, she\r\nperchance had not praised her son beyond his merits. He looked the best\r\nof good fellows; so kind and merry and spirited; such a capable man,\r\ntoo. It struck Monica as a very hard fate that he should have this\r\nfamily on his hands. What they must cost him! Probably he could not\r\nthink of marrying, just on their account.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevis came and took a place by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you so very much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that charming song. Is it\r\npublished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed and shook his thick hair about. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of\r\ntwo or three that I somehow struck out when I was studying in Germany,\r\nages ago. You play, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica gave a sad negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what does it matter? There are hosts of people who will always be\r\noverjoyed to play when you ask them. It would be a capital thing if\r\nonly those children were allowed to learn an instrument who showed\r\ngenuine talent for music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica, \xe2\x80\x9cthere certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hosts of\r\npeople ready to play for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d His merry laugh was repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind when I contradict\r\nmyself; it\xe2\x80\x99s one of my habits. Are you here for the whole winter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a few weeks, unfortunately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you dread the voyage back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell the truth, I do. I had a very unpleasant time coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for myself, how I ever undertake the thing I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know. One\r\nof these times I shall die; there\xe2\x80\x99s not a shadow of doubt of that. The\r\ngirls always have to carry me ashore, one holding me by the hair and\r\none by the boots. Happily, I am so emaciated that my weight doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndistress them. I pick up flesh in a day or two, and then my health is\r\nstupendous\xe2\x80\x94as at present. You see how marvellously _fit_ I look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you look very well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monica, glancing at the fair, comely\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive. All our family have wretched constitutions. If I go to\r\nwork regularly for a couple of months without a holiday, I sink into\r\nabsolute decrepitude. An office-chair has been specially made for me,\r\nto hold me up at the desk.\xe2\x80\x94I beg your pardon for this clowning, Mrs.\r\nWiddowson,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly added in another voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe air puts me in\r\nsuch spirits. What air it is! Speaking quite seriously, my mother was\r\nsaved by coming to live here. We believed her to be dying, and now I\r\nhave hopes that she will live ever so many years longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke of his mother with evident affection, glancing kindly towards\r\nher with his blue eyes.\r\n\r\nOnly once or twice had Monica ventured to exchange a glance with her\r\nhusband. It satisfied her that he managed to converse; what his mood\r\nreally was could not be determined until afterwards. When they were\r\nabout to leave she saw him, to her surprise, speaking quite pleasantly\r\nwith Mr. Bevis. A carriage was procured to convey them home, and as\r\nsoon as they had started, Monica asked her husband, with a merry look,\r\nhow he had enjoyed himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not much harm in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarm? How like you, Edmund, to put it that way! Now confess you will\r\nbe glad to go again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go if you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnsatisfactory man! You can\xe2\x80\x99t bring yourself to admit that it was\r\npleasant to be among new people. I believe, in your heart, you think\r\nall enjoyment is wrong. The music was nice, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s singing, but that fellow Bevis\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica examined him as he spoke, and seemed to suppress a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all bad. I saw you talking with Mrs. Bevis. Did she\r\ntell you anything about her wonderful son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then I must tell you the whole story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she did so, in a tone half of jest, half of serious approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that he has done anything more than his duty,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nWiddowson at the end. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor private reasons, Monica contrasted this attitude towards Bevis with\r\nthe disfavour her husband had shown to Mr. Barfoot, and was secretly\r\nmuch amused.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days after they went to spend the morning at Petit Bot\r\nBay, and there encountered with Bevis and his three sisters. The result\r\nwas an invitation to go back and have lunch at Mrs. Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings;\r\nthey accepted it, and remained with their acquaintances till dusk. The\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s holiday was at an end; next morning he would face the\r\nvoyage which he had depicted so grotesquely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd alone!\xe2\x80\x9d he lamented to Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly think of it. The girls are\r\nall rather below par just now; they had better stay here for the\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in London you will be alone too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It\xe2\x80\x99s very sad. I must bear up under it. The worst of it is, I am\r\nnaturally subject to depression. In solitude I sink, sink. But the\r\nsubject is too painful. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let us darken the last hours with such\r\nreflections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson retained his indulgent opinion of the facetious young wine\r\nmerchant. He even laughed now and then in recalling some phrase or\r\nother that Bevis had used to him.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Monica had several long conversations with the old lady.\r\nImpelled to gossipy frankness about all her affairs, Mrs. Bevis allowed\r\nit to be understood that the chief reason for two of the girls always\r\nbeing with their brother was the possibility thus afforded of their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmeeting people\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, of their having a chance of marriage.\r\nMrs. Cosgrove and one or two other ladies did them social service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey never _will_ marry!\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica to her husband, rather\r\nthoughtfully than with commiseration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? They are nice enough girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but they have no money; and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she smiled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpeople see that they\r\nwant to find husbands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that the first matters; and the second is only natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica attempted no rejoinder, but said presently\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow they are just the kind of women who ought to find something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething to do? Why, they attend to their mother and their brother.\r\nWhat could be more proper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery proper, perhaps. But they are miserable, and always will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they have no _right_ to be miserable. They are doing their duty,\r\nand that ought to keep them cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica could have said many things, but she overcame the desire, and\r\nlaughed the subject aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH\r\n\r\n\r\nNor till mid-winter did Barfoot again see his friends the\r\nMicklethwaites. By invitation he went to South Tottenham on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nEve, and dined with them at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He was the first guest that\r\nhad entered the house since their marriage.\r\n\r\nFrom the very doorstep Everard became conscious of a domestic\r\natmosphere that told soothingly upon his nerves. The little servant who\r\nopened to him exhibited a gentle, noiseless demeanour which was no\r\ndoubt the result of careful discipline. Micklethwaite himself, who at\r\nonce came out into the passage, gave proof of a like influence; his\r\nhearty greeting was spoken in soft tones; a placid happiness beamed\r\nfrom his face. In the sitting-room (Micklethwaite\xe2\x80\x99s study, used for\r\nreception because the other had to serve as dining-room) tempered\r\nlamplight and the glow of a hospitable fire showed the hostess and her\r\nblind sister standing in expectation; to Everard\xe2\x80\x99s eyes both of them\r\nlooked far better in health than a few months ago. Mrs. Micklethwaite\r\nwas no longer so distressingly old; an expression that resembled\r\ngirlish pleasure lit up her countenance as she stepped forward; nay, if\r\nhe mistook not, there came a gentle warmth to her cheek, and the\r\nmomentary downward glance was as graceful and modest as in a youthful\r\nbride. Never had Barfoot approached a woman with more finished\r\ncourtesy, the sincere expression of his feeling. The blind sister he\r\nregarded in like spirit; his voice touched its softest note as he held\r\nher hand for a moment and replied to her pleasant words.\r\n\r\nNo undue indication of poverty disturbed him. He saw that the house had\r\nbeen improved in many ways since Mrs. Micklethwaite had taken\r\npossession of it; pictures, ornaments, pieces of furniture were added,\r\nall in simple taste, but serving to heighten the effect of refined\r\ncomfort. Where the average woman would have displayed pretentious\r\nemptiness, Mrs. Micklethwaite had made a home which in its way was\r\nbeautiful. The dinner, which she herself had cooked, and which she\r\nassisted in serving, aimed at being no more than a simple, decorous\r\nmeal, but the guest unfeignedly enjoyed it; even the vegetables and the\r\nbread seemed to him to have a daintier flavour than at many a rich\r\ntable. He could not help noticing and admiring the skill with which\r\nMiss Wheatley ate without seeing what was before her; had he not known\r\nher misfortune, he would hardly have become aware of it by any\r\npeculiarity as she sat opposite to him.\r\n\r\nThe mathematician had learnt to sit upon a chair like ordinary mortals.\r\nFor the first week or two it must have cost him severe restraint; now\r\nhe betrayed no temptation to roll and jerk and twist himself. When the\r\nladies retired, he reached from the sideboard a box which Barfoot\r\nviewed with uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you smoke here\xe2\x80\x94in this room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard glanced at the pretty curtains before the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy, you do _not_ smoke here. And, in fact, I like your claret;\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the flavour of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please; but I think Fanny will be distressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall say that I have abandoned the weed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmotions were at conflict in Micklethwaite\xe2\x80\x99s mind, but finally he\r\nbeamed with gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarfoot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he bent forward and touched his friend\xe2\x80\x99s arm\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere are\r\nangels walking the earth in this our day. Science hasn\xe2\x80\x99t abolished\r\nthem, my dear fellow, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it ever will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt falls to the lot of but few men to encounter them, and of fewer\r\nstill to entertain them permanently in a cottage at South Tottenham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right.\xe2\x80\x9d Micklethwaite laughed in a new way, with scarcely any\r\nsound; a change Everard had already noticed. \xe2\x80\x9cThese two sisters\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nhad better not speak about them. In my old age I have become a\r\nworshipper, a mystic, a man of dream and vision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about worship in a parochial sense?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Barfoot, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny difficulty of that point?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conform, in moderation. Nothing would be asked of me. There is no\r\nfanaticism, no intolerance. It would be brutal if I declined to go to\r\nchurch on a Sunday morning. You see, my strictly scientific attitude\r\nhelps in avoiding offence. Fanny can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, but my lack of\r\ndogmatism vastly relieves her. I have been trying to explain to her\r\nthat the scientific mind can have nothing to do with materialism. The\r\nnew order of ideas is of course very difficult for her to grasp; but in\r\ntime, in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt conversion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn no account whatever. But I _should_ like her to see what is meant\r\nby perception and conception, by the relativity of time and space\xe2\x80\x94and\r\na few simple things of that kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shifting to safer ground, \xe2\x80\x9cmy brother Tom is in\r\nLondon, and in wretched health. _His_ angel is from the wrong quarter,\r\nfrom the nethermost pit. I seriously believe that she has a plan for\r\nkilling her husband. You remember my mentioning in a letter his\r\nhorse-accident? He has never recovered from that, and as likely as not\r\nnever will. His wife brought him away from Madeira just when he ought\r\nto have stopped there to get well. He settled himself at Torquay,\r\nwhilst that woman ran about to pay visits. It was understood that she\r\nshould go back to him at Torquay, but this she at length refused to do.\r\nThe place was too dull; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit her extremely delicate health;\r\nshe must live in London, her pure native air. If Tom had taken any\r\nadvice, he would have let her live just where she pleased, thanking\r\nHeaven that she was at a distance from him. But the poor fellow can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe away from her. He has come up, and here I feel convinced he will\r\ndie. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very monstrous thing, but uncommonly like women in general\r\nwho have got a man into their power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMicklethwaite shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too hard upon them. You have been unlucky. You know my view of\r\nyour duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think that marriage isn\xe2\x80\x99t impossible for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barfoot,\r\nwith a grave smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! Capital!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as likely as not it will be marriage without forms\xe2\x80\x94simply a free\r\nunion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mathematician was downcast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do. We must conform. Besides, in that\r\ncase the person decidedly isn\xe2\x80\x99t suitable to you. You of all men must\r\nmarry a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should never think of any one that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs emancipation getting as far as that? Do ladies enter into that kind\r\nof union?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any example. That\xe2\x80\x99s just why the idea tempts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBarfoot would go no further in explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about your new algebra?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! My dear boy, the temptation is so frightful\xe2\x80\x94when I get back\r\nhome. Remember that I have never known what it was to sit and talk\r\nthrough the evening with ordinary friends, let alone\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s too much for\r\nme just yet. And, you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t venture to work on Sundays. That\r\nwill come; all in good time. I must grant myself half a year of luxury\r\nafter such a life as mine has been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you must. Let algebra wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it over, of course, at odd moments. Church on Sunday morning\r\nis a good opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot could not stay to see the old year out, but good wishes were\r\nnone the less heartily exchanged before he went. Micklethwaite walked\r\nwith him to the railway station; at a few paces\xe2\x80\x99 distance from his\r\nhouse he stood and pointed back to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat little place, Barfoot, is one of the sacred spots of the earth.\r\nStrange to think that the house has been waiting for me there through\r\nall the years of my hopelessness. I feel that a mysterious light ought\r\nto shine about it. It oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to look just like common houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn his way home Everard thought over what he had seen and heard,\r\nsmiling good-naturedly. Well, that was one ideal of marriage. Not _his_\r\nideal; but very beautiful amid the vulgarities and vileness of ordinary\r\nexperience. It was the old fashion in its purest presentment; the\r\nconsecrated form of domestic happiness, removed beyond reach of satire,\r\nonly to be touched, if touched at all, with the very gentlest irony.\r\n\r\nA life by no means for him. If he tried it, even with a woman so\r\nperfect, he would perish of _ennui_. For him marriage must not mean\r\nrepose, inevitably tending to drowsiness, but the mutual incitement of\r\nvigorous minds. Passion\xe2\x80\x94yes, there must be passion, at all events to\r\nbegin with; passion not impossible of revival in days subsequent to its\r\nfirst indulgence. Beauty in the academic sense he no longer demanded;\r\nenough that the face spoke eloquently, that the limbs were vigorous.\r\nLet beauty perish if it cannot ally itself with mind; be a woman what\r\nelse she may, let her have brains and the power of using them! In that\r\ndemand the maturity of his manhood expressed itself. For casual amour\r\nthe odalisque could still prevail with him; but for the life of\r\nwedlock, the durable companionship of man and woman, intellect was his\r\nfirst requirement.\r\n\r\nA woman with man\xe2\x80\x99s capability of understanding and reasoning; free from\r\nsuperstition, religious or social; far above the ignoble weaknesses\r\nwhich men have been base enough to idealize in her sex. A woman who\r\nwould scorn the vulgarism of jealousy, and yet know what it is to love.\r\nThis was asking much of nature and civilization; did he grossly deceive\r\nhimself in thinking he had found the paragon?\r\n\r\nFor thus far had he advanced in his thoughts of Rhoda Nunn. If the\r\nphrase had any meaning, he was in love with her; yet, strange complex\r\nof emotions, he was still only half serious in his desire to take her\r\nfor a wife, wishing rather to amuse and flatter himself by merely\r\ninspiring her with passion. Therefore he refused to entertain a thought\r\nof formal marriage. To obtain her consent to marriage would mean\r\nnothing at all; it would afford him no satisfaction. But so to play\r\nupon her emotions that the proud, intellectual, earnest woman was\r\nwilling to defy society for his sake\xe2\x80\x94ah! that would be an end worth\r\nachieving.\r\n\r\nEver since the dialogue in which he frankly explained his position, and\r\nall but declared love, he had not once seen Rhoda in private. She\r\nshunned him purposely beyond a doubt, and did not that denote a fear of\r\nhim justified by her inclination? The postponement of what must\r\nnecessarily come to pass between them began to try his patience, as\r\nassuredly it inflamed his ardour. If no other resource offered, he\r\nwould be obliged to make his cousin an accomplice by requesting her\r\nbeforehand to leave him alone with Rhoda some evening when he had\r\ncalled upon them.\r\n\r\nBut it was time that chance favoured him, and his interview with Miss\r\nNunn came about in a way he could not have foreseen.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first week of January he was invited to dine at Miss\r\nBarfoot\xe2\x80\x99s. The afternoon had been foggy, and when he set forth there\r\nseemed to be some likelihood of a plague of choking darkness such as\r\nwould obstruct traffic. As usual, he went by train to Sloane Square,\r\npurposing (for it was dry under foot, and he could not disregard small\r\neconomies) to walk the short distance from there to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road. On\r\ncoming out from the station he found the fog so dense that it was\r\ndoubtful whether he could reach his journey\xe2\x80\x99s end. Cabs were not to be\r\nhad; he must either explore the gloom, with risk of getting nowhere at\r\nall, or give it up and take a train back. But he longed too ardently\r\nfor the sight of Rhoda to abandon his evening without an effort. Having\r\nwith difficulty made his way into King\xe2\x80\x99s Road, he found progress easier\r\non account of the shop illuminations; the fog, however, was growing\r\nevery moment more fearsome, and when he had to turn out of the highway\r\nhis case appeared desperate. Literally he groped along, feeling the\r\nfronts of the houses. As under ordinary circumstances he would have had\r\nonly just time enough to reach his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s punctually, he must be very\r\nlate: perhaps they would conclude that he had not ventured out on such\r\na night, and were already dining without him. No matter; as well go one\r\nway as another now. After abandoning hope several times, and all but\r\nasphyxiated, he found by inquiry of a man with whom he collided that he\r\nwas actually within a few doors of his destination. Another effort and\r\nhe rang a joyous peal at the bell.\r\n\r\nA mistake. It was the wrong house, and he had to go two doors farther\r\non.\r\n\r\nThis time he procured admittance to the familiar little hall. The\r\nservant smiled at him, but said nothing. He was led to the\r\ndrawing-room, and there found Rhoda Nunn alone. This fact did not so\r\nmuch surprise him as Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. For the first time since he\r\nhad known her, her dress was not uniform black; she wore a red silk\r\nblouse with a black skirt, and so admirable was the effect of this\r\ncostume that he scarcely refrained from a delighted exclamation.\r\n\r\nSome concern was visible in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say,\xe2\x80\x9d were her first words, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Miss Barfoot will not\r\nbe here in time for dinner. She went to Faversham this morning, and\r\nought to have been back about half-past seven. But a telegram came some\r\ntime ago. A thick fog caused her to miss the train, and the next\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t reach Victoria till ten minutes past ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now half-past eight; dinner had been appointed for the hour.\r\nBarfoot explained his lateness in arriving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so bad as that? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe situation embarrassed both of them. Barfoot suspected a hope on\r\nMiss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s part that he would relieve her of his company, but, even\r\nhad there been no external hindrance, he could not have relinquished\r\nthe happy occasion. To use frankness was best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the question for me to leave the house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, meeting her\r\neyes and smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be hard upon a starving man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt once Rhoda made a pretence of having felt no hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course we will dine immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d She rang the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nBarfoot took it for granted that I would represent her. Look, the fog\r\nis penetrating even to our fireside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheerful, very. What is Mary doing at Faversham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one she has been corresponding with for some time begged her to\r\ngo down and give an address to a number of ladies on\xe2\x80\x94a certain\r\nsubject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mary is on the way to become a celebrity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite against her will, as you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to dinner, and Barfoot, thoroughly enjoying the abnormal\r\nstate of things, continued to talk of his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that she can\xe2\x80\x99t logically refuse to put herself forward.\r\nWork of her kind can\xe2\x80\x99t be done in a corner. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a case of \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nteach the orphan girl to sew.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have used the same argument to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda.\r\n\r\nHer place at the head of the table had its full effect upon Everard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination. Why should he hold by a resolve of which he did not\r\nabsolutely approve the motive? Why not ask her simply to be his wife,\r\nand so remove one element of difficulty from his pursuit? True, he was\r\nwretchedly poor. Marrying on such an income, he would at once find his\r\nfreedom restricted in every direction. But then, more likely than not,\r\nRhoda had determined against marriage, and of him, especially, never\r\nthought for a moment as a possible husband. Well, that was what he\r\nwanted to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThey conversed naturally enough till the meal was over. Then their\r\nembarrassment revived, but this time it was Rhoda who took the\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I leave you to your meditations?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, moving a few inches\r\nfrom the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should much prefer your society, if you will grant it me for a\r\nlittle longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout speaking, she rose and led the way to the drawing-room. There,\r\nsitting at a formal distance from each other, they talked\xe2\x80\x94of the fog.\r\nWould Miss Barfoot be able to get back at all?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_A propos_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you ever read \xe2\x80\x9cThe City of Dreadful\r\nNight\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout sympathy, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d? Do I seem to you a shallow optimist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. A vigorous and rational optimist\xe2\x80\x94such as I myself aim at being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you? But optimism of that kind must be proved by some effort on\r\nbehalf of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely the effort I am making. If a man works at developing and\r\nfortifying the best things in his own character, he is surely doing\r\nsociety a service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled sceptically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, no doubt. But how do you develop and fortify yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was meeting him half-way, thought Everard. Foreseeing the\r\ninevitable, she wished to have it over and done with. Or else\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live very quietly,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply, \xe2\x80\x9cthinking of grave problems most\r\nof my time. You know I am a great deal alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; anything but naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda said nothing. He waited a moment, then moved to a seat much\r\nnearer hers. Her face hardened, and he saw her fingers lock together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere a man is in love, solitude seems to him the most unnatural of\r\nconditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t make me your confidante, Mr. Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda with\r\nwell-assumed pleasantry. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no taste for that kind of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help doing so. It is you that I am in love with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry to hear it. Happily, the sentiment will not long\r\ntrouble you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read in her eyes and on her lips a profound agitation. She glanced\r\nabout the room, and, before he could again speak, had risen to ring the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always take coffee, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout troubling to give any assent, he moved apart and turned over\r\nsome books on the table. For full five minutes there was silence. The\r\ncoffee was brought; he tasted it and put his cup down. Seeing that\r\nRhoda had, as it were, entrenched herself behind the beverage, and\r\nwould continue to sip at it as long as might be necessary, he went and\r\nstood in front of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn, I am more serious than you will give me credit for being.\r\nThe sentiment, as you call it, has troubled me for some time, and will\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer refuge failed her. The cup she was holding began to shake a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease let me put it aside for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda allowed him to do so, and then locked her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so much in love with you that I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep away from this house\r\nmore than a few days at a time. Of course you have known it; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntried to disguise why I came here so often. It\xe2\x80\x99s so seldom that I see\r\nyou alone; and now that fortune is kind to me I must speak as best I\r\ncan. I won\xe2\x80\x99t make myself ridiculous in your eyes\xe2\x80\x94if I can help it. You\r\ndespise the love-making of ballrooms and garden parties; so do I, most\r\nheartily. Let me speak like a man who has few illusions to overcome. I\r\nwant you for the companion of my life; I don\xe2\x80\x99t see very well how I am\r\nto do without you. You know, I think, that I have only a moderate\r\ncompetence; it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to live upon without miseries, that\xe2\x80\x99s all one\r\ncan say. Probably I shall never be richer, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise to exert\r\nmyself to earn money; I wish to live for other things. You can picture\r\nthe kind of life I want you to share. You know me well enough to\r\nunderstand that my wife\xe2\x80\x94if we use the old word\xe2\x80\x94would be as free to\r\nlive in her own way as I to live in mine. All the same, it is love that\r\nI am asking for. Think how you may about man and woman, you know that\r\nthere is such a thing as love between them, and that the love of a man\r\nand a woman who can think intelligently may be the best thing life has\r\nto offer them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not see her eyes, but she was smiling in a forced way, with\r\nher lips close set.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you insisted on speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cI had no choice but\r\nto listen. It is usual, I think\xe2\x80\x94if one may trust the novels\xe2\x80\x94for a\r\nwoman to return thanks when an offer of this kind has been made to her.\r\nSo\xe2\x80\x94thank you very much, Mr. Barfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard seized a little chair that was close by, planted it beside\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s, there seated himself and took possession of one of her hands.\r\nIt was done so rapidly and vehemently that Rhoda started back, her\r\nexpression changing from sportive mockery to all but alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will have no such thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered in a low voice, much moved, a\r\nsmile making him look strangely stern. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall understand what it\r\nmeans when a man says that he loves you. I have come to think your face\r\nso beautiful that I am in torment with the desire to press my lips upon\r\nyours. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid that I shall be brutal enough to do it without\r\nyour consent; my respect for you is stronger even than my passion. When\r\nI first saw you, I thought you interesting because of your evident\r\nintelligence\xe2\x80\x94nothing more; indeed you were not a woman to me. Now you\r\nare the one woman in the world; no other can draw my eyes from you.\r\nTouch me with your fingers and I shall tremble\xe2\x80\x94that is what my love\r\nmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was colourless; her lips, just parted, quivered as the breath\r\npanted between them. She did not try to withdraw her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you love me in return?\xe2\x80\x9d Everard went on, his face still nearer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I anything like this to _you_? Have the courage you boast of. Speak\r\nto me as one human being to another, plain, honest words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t love you in the least. And if I did I would never share your\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice was very unlike her familiar tones. It seemed to hurt her to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason.\xe2\x80\x94Because you have no faith in me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether I have or not. I know absolutely nothing of your\r\nlife. But I have my work, and no one shall ever persuade me to abandon\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour work? How do you understand it? What is its importance to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, and you pretend to know me so well that you wish me to be your\r\ncompanion at every moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed mockingly, and tried to draw away her hand, for it was\r\nburnt by the heat of his. Barfoot held her firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ your work? Copying with a type-machine, and teaching others\r\nto do the same\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work by which I earn money, yes. But if it were no more than\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPassion was overmastering him as he watched the fine scorn in her eyes.\r\nHe raised her hand to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda exclaimed with sudden wrath. \xe2\x80\x9cYour respect\xe2\x80\x94oh, I\r\nappreciate your respect!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrenched herself from his grasp, and went apart. Barfoot rose,\r\ngazing at her with admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better I should be at a distance from you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to\r\nknow your mind, and not to be made insensate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better still if you left me?\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda suggested, mistress\r\nof herself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d He remembered the circumstances and spoke\r\nsubmissively. \xe2\x80\x9cYet the fog gives me such a good excuse for begging your\r\nindulgence. The chances are I should only lose myself in an inferno.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it strike you that you take an advantage of me, as you did\r\nonce before? I make no pretence of equalling you in muscular strength,\r\nyet you try to hold me by force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe divined in her pleasure akin to his own, the delight of conflict.\r\nOtherwise, she would never have spoken thus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is true. Love revives the barbarian; it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mean much if\r\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t. In this one respect I suppose no man, however civilized,\r\nwould wish the woman he loves to be his equal. Marriage by capture\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t quite be done away with. You say you have not the least love for\r\nme; if you had, should I like you to confess it instantly? A man must\r\nplead and woo; but there are different ways. I can\xe2\x80\x99t kneel before you\r\nand exclaim about my miserable unworthiness\xe2\x80\x94for I am not unworthy of\r\nyou. I shall never call you queen and goddess\xe2\x80\x94unless in delirium, and\r\nI think I should soon weary of the woman who put her head under my\r\nfoot. Just because I am stronger than you, and have stronger passions,\r\nI take that advantage\xe2\x80\x94try to overcome, as I may, the womanly\r\nresistance which is one of your charms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow useless, then, for us to talk. If you are determined to remind me\r\nagain and again that your strength puts me at your mercy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not that! I will come no nearer to you. Sit down, and tell me what\r\nI asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda hesitated, but at length took the chair by which she was standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are resolved never to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never shall,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda replied firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose marriage in no way interfered with your work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would interfere hopelessly with the best part of my life. I thought\r\nyou understood this. What would become of the encouragement I am able\r\nto offer our girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEncouragement to refuse marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo scorn the old idea that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life is wasted if she does not\r\nmarry. My work is to help those women who, by sheer necessity, must\r\nlive alone\xe2\x80\x94women whom vulgar opinion ridicules. How can I help them so\r\neffectually as by living among them, one of them, and showing that my\r\nlife is anything but weariness and lamentation? I am fitted for this.\r\nIt gives me a sense of power and usefulness which I enjoy. Your cousin\r\nis doing the same work admirably. If I deserted I should despise\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent! If I could bear the thought of living without you, I\r\nshould bid you persevere and be great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need no such bidding to persevere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for that very reason, because you are capable of such things, I\r\nlove you only the more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was triumph in her look, though she endeavoured to disguise it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, for your own peace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must hope that you will avoid\r\nme. It is so easily done. We have nothing in common, Mr. Barfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that. For one thing, there are perhaps not half a\r\ndozen women living with whom I could talk as I have talked with you. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t likely that I shall ever meet one. Am I to make my bow, and\r\nabandon in resignation the one chance of perfecting my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know me. We differ profoundly on a thousand essential\r\npoints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so because you have a very wrong idea of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a changed voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will forgive me if I\r\nremind you that it is past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sighed and rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fog certainly cannot be so thick now. Shall I ask them to try and\r\nget you a cab?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall walk to the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one more word.\xe2\x80\x9d She assumed a quiet dignity which he could not\r\ndisregard. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have spoken in this way for the last time. You will not\r\noblige me to take all sorts of trouble merely to avoid useless and\r\npainful conversations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t abandon hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I _must_ take that trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d Her face darkened, and she stood in\r\nexpectation of his departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t offer to shake hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard, drawing a step nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you can remember that I had no choice but to be your hostess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe face and tone affected him with a brief shame. Bending his head, he\r\napproached her, and held her offered hand, without pressure, only for\r\nan instant.\r\n\r\nThen he left the room.\r\n\r\nThere was a little improvement in the night; he could make his way\r\nalong the pavement without actual groping, and no unpleasant adventure\r\nchecked him before he reached the station. Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure went\r\nbefore him. He was not downcast; for all that she had said, this woman,\r\nsoon or late, would yield herself; he had a strange, unreasoning\r\nassurance of it. Perhaps the obstinacy of his temper supplied him with\r\nthat confident expectation. He no longer cared on what terms he\r\nobtained her\xe2\x80\x94legal marriage or free union\xe2\x80\x94it was indifferent to him.\r\nBut her life should be linked with his if fierce energy of will meant\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot arrived at half-past eleven, after many delays on her\r\njourney. She was pierced with cold, choked with the poisonous air, and\r\nhad derived very little satisfaction from her visit to Faversham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened?\xe2\x80\x9d was her first question, as Rhoda came out into the\r\nhall with sympathy and solicitude. \xe2\x80\x9cDid the fog keep our guest away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he dined here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just as well. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t been lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey spoke no more on the subject until Miss Barfoot recovered from her\r\ndiscomfort, and was enjoying a much needed supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he offer to go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was really impossible. It took him more than half an hour to get\r\nhere from Sloane Square.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish fellow! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he take a train back at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar brightness in Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, and Miss\r\nBarfoot had observed it from the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you quarrel much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more than was to be expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of staying for my return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe left about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. Quite late enough, under the circumstances. It was very\r\nunfortunate, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose Everard cared much. He would enjoy the\r\nopportunity of teasing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA glance told her that Everard was not alone in his enjoyment of the\r\nevening. Rhoda led the talk into other channels, but Miss Barfoot\r\ncontinued to reflect on what she had perceived.\r\n\r\nA few evenings after, when Miss Barfoot had been sitting alone for an\r\nhour or two, Rhoda came to the library and took a place near her. The\r\nelder woman glanced up from her book, and saw that her friend had\r\nsomething special to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to tax your good-nature, to ask you about unpleasant\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot knew immediately what this meant. She professed readiness\r\nto answer, but had an uneasy look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me in plain terms what it was that your cousin did when\r\nhe disgraced himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you really know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Miss Barfoot kept her eyes on the page open before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall take the liberty of an old friend, Rhoda. Why do you wish\r\nto know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other dryly, \xe2\x80\x9chas been good enough to say\r\nthat he is in love with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspected it. I felt sure it was coming. He asked you to marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rhoda in purposely ambiguous phrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow him to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to that. I should be glad if you would\r\nlet me know what I asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot deliberated, but finally told the story of Amy Drake. Her\r\nhands supporting one knee, her head bent, Rhoda listened without\r\ncomment, and, to judge from her features, without any emotion of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said her friend at the close, \xe2\x80\x9cis the story as it was\r\nunderstood at the time\xe2\x80\x94disgraceful to him in every particular. He knew\r\nwhat was said of him, and offered not a word of contradiction. But not\r\nvery long ago he asked me one evening if you had been informed of this\r\nscandal. I told him that you knew he had done something which I thought\r\nvery base. Everard was hurt, and thereupon he declared that neither I\r\nnor any other of his acquaintances knew the truth\xe2\x80\x94that he had been\r\nmaligned. He refused to say more, and what am I to believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda was listening with livelier attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe declared that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to blame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he meant that. But it is difficult to see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course the truth can never be known,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, with sudden\r\nindifference. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Thank you for satisfying my\r\ncuriosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot waited a moment, then laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome day, Rhoda, you shall satisfy mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94if we live long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat degree of blame might have attached to Barfoot, Rhoda did not care\r\nto ask herself; she thought no more of the story. Of course there must\r\nhave been other such incidents in his career; morally he was neither\r\nbetter nor worse than men in general. She viewed with contempt the\r\nwomen who furnished such opportunities; in her judgment of the male\r\noffenders she was more lenient, more philosophical, than formerly.\r\n\r\nShe had gained her wish, had enjoyed her triumph. A raising of the\r\nfinger and Everard Barfoot would marry her. Assured of that, she felt a\r\nnew contentment in life; at times when she was occupied with things as\r\nfar as possible from this experience, a rush of joy would suddenly fill\r\nher heart, and make her cheek glow. She moved among people with a\r\nconscious dignity quite unlike that which had only satisfied her need\r\nof distinction. She spoke more softly, exercised more patience, smiled\r\nwhere she had been wont to scoff. Miss Nunn was altogether a more\r\namiable person.\r\n\r\nYet, she convinced herself, essentially quite unchanged. She pursued\r\nthe aim of her life with less bitterness, in a larger spirit, that was\r\nall. But pursued it, and without fear of being diverted from the\r\ngenerous path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA REINFORCEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout January, Barfoot was endeavouring to persuade his brother\r\nTom to leave London, where the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s health perceptibly grew worse.\r\nDoctors were urgent to the same end, but ineffectually; for Mrs.\r\nThomas, though she professed to be amazed at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s folly in\r\nremaining where he could not hope for recovery, herself refused to\r\naccompany him any whither. This pair had no children. The lady always\r\nspoke of herself as a sad sufferer from mysterious infirmities, and\r\nhad, in fact, a tendency to hysteria, which confused itself\r\ninextricably with the results of evil nurture and the impulses of a\r\ndisposition originally base; nevertheless she made a figure in a\r\ncertain sphere of vulgar wealth, and even gave opportunity to\r\nscandalous tongues. Her husband, whatever his secret thought, would\r\nhear nothing against her; his temper, like Everard\xe2\x80\x99s, was marked with\r\nstubbornness, and after a good deal of wrangling he forbade his brother\r\nto address him again on the subject of their disagreement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom is dying,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Everard, early in February, to his cousin in\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Road. \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Swain assures me that unless he be removed he cannot\r\nlast more than a month or two. This morning I saw the woman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nthus he always referred to his sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand talked to her in\r\nwhat was probably the plainest language she ever had the privilege of\r\nhearing. It was a tremendous scene, brought to a close only by her\r\nflinging herself on the sofa with shrieks which terrified the whole\r\nhousehold. My idea is that we must carry the poor fellow away by force.\r\nHis infatuation makes me rage and curse, but I am bent on trying to\r\nsave his life. Will you come and give your help?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA week later they succeeded in carrying the invalid back to Torquay.\r\nMrs. Barfoot had abandoned him to his doctors, nurses, and angry\r\nrelatives; she declared herself driven out of the house, and went to\r\nlive at a fashionable hotel. Everard remained in Devon for more than a\r\nmonth, devoting himself with affection, which the trial of his temper\r\nseemed only to increase, to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s welfare. Thomas improved a\r\nlittle; once more there was hope. Then on a sudden frantic impulse,\r\nafter writing fifty letters which elicited no reply, he travelled in\r\npursuit of his wife; and three days after his arrival in London he was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nBy a will, executed at Torquay, he bequeathed to Everard about a\r\nquarter of his wealth. All the rest went to Mrs. Barfoot, who had\r\ndeclared herself too ill to attend the funeral, but in a fortnight was\r\nsufficiently recovered to visit one of her friends in the country.\r\n\r\nEverard could now count upon an income of not much less than fifteen\r\nhundred a year. That his brother\xe2\x80\x99s death would enrich him he had always\r\nforeseen, but no man could have exerted himself with more ardent energy\r\nto postpone that advantage. The widow charged him, wherever she\r\nhappened to be, with deliberate fratricide; she vilified his\r\nreputation, by word of mouth or by letter, to all who knew him, and\r\nprotested that his furious wrath at not having profited more largely by\r\nthe will put her in fear of her life. This last remarkable statement\r\nwas made in a long and violent epistle to Miss Barfoot, which the\r\nrecipient showed to her cousin on the first opportunity. Everard had\r\ncalled one Sunday morning\xe2\x80\x94it was the end of March\xe2\x80\x94to say good-bye on\r\nhis departure for a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 travel. Having read the letter, he\r\nlaughed with a peculiar fierceness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis kind of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barfoot, \xe2\x80\x9cmay necessitate your\r\nprosecuting her. There is a limit, you know, even to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s licence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am far more likely,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto purchase a very nice little\r\ncane, and give her an exemplary thrashing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, I see no reason against it! That\xe2\x80\x99s how I should deal\r\nwith a man who talked about me in this way, and none the less if he\r\nwere a puny creature quite unable to protect himself. In that furious\r\nscene before we got Tom away I felt most terribly tempted to beat her.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to be said for woman-beating. I am quite sure that\r\nmany a labouring man who pommels his wife is doing exactly the right\r\nthing; no other measure would have the least result. You see what comes\r\nof impunity. If this woman saw the possibility that I should give her a\r\npublic caning she would be far more careful how she behaved herself.\r\nLet us ask Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda had that moment entered the room. She offered her hand frankly,\r\nand asked what the subject was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlance over this letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you have seen it. I\r\npropose to get a light, supple, dandyish cane, and to give Mrs. Thomas\r\nBarfoot half a dozen smart cuts across the back in her own\r\ndrawing-room, some afternoon when people were present. What have you to\r\nsay to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with such show of angry seriousness that Rhoda paused before\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sympathized with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\r\nwould go to that extremity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard repeated the argument he had used to his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda assented. \xe2\x80\x9cI think many women deserve to\r\nbe beaten, and ought to be beaten. But public opinion would be so much\r\nagainst _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care? So is public opinion against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Do as you like. Miss Barfoot and I will come to the police\r\ncourt and give strong evidence in your favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Everard, not all in jest, for Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance had made his nerves thrill and his pulse beat. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at her,\r\nMary. Do you wonder that I would walk the diameter of the globe to win\r\nher love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda flushed scarlet, and Miss Barfoot was much embarrassed. Neither\r\ncould have anticipated such an utterance as this. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the simple\r\ntruth,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Everard recklessly, \xe2\x80\x9cand she knows it, and yet won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlisten to me. Well, good-bye to you both! Now that I have so grossly\r\nmisbehaved myself, she has a good excuse for refusing even to enter the\r\nroom when I am here. But do speak a word for me whilst I am away, Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with them, scarcely looking at their faces, and abruptly\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nThe women stood for a moments at a distance from each other. Then Miss\r\nBarfoot glanced at her friend and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally my poor cousin is not very discreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything but,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered, resting on the back of a chair, her\r\neyes cast down. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he will really cane his sister-in-law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask such a question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be amusing. I should think better of him for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, make it a condition. We know the story of the lady and her\r\nglove. I can see you sympathize with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda laughed and went away, leaving Miss Barfoot with the impression\r\nthat she had revealed a genuine impulse. It seemed not impossible that\r\nRhoda might wish to say to her lover: \xe2\x80\x9cFace this monstrous scandal and\r\nI am yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA week passed and there arrived a letter, with a foreign stamp,\r\naddressed to Miss Nunn. Happening to receive it before Miss Barfoot had\r\ncome down to breakfast, she put it away in a drawer till evening\r\nleisure, and made no mention of its arrival. Exhilaration appeared in\r\nher behaviour through the day. After dinner she disappeared, shutting\r\nherself up to read the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS NUNN,\xe2\x80\x94I am sitting at a little marble table outside a caf\xc3\xa9\r\non the Cannibiere. Does that name convey anything to you? The\r\nCannibiere is the principal street of Marseilles, street of gorgeous\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9s and restaurants, just now blazing with electric light. You, no\r\ndoubt, are shivering by the fireside; here it is like an evening of\r\nsummer. I have dined luxuriously, and I am taking my coffee whilst I\r\nwrite. At a table near to me sit two girls, engaged in the liveliest\r\npossible conversation, of which I catch a few words now and then,\r\npretty French phrases that caress the ear. One of them is so strikingly\r\nbeautiful that I cannot take my eyes from her when they have been\r\ntempted to that quarter. She speaks with indescribable grace and\r\nanimation, has the sweetest eyes and lips\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all the time I am thinking of some one else. Ah, if _you_ were\r\nhere! How we would enjoy ourselves among these southern scenes! Alone,\r\nit is delightful; but with you for a companion, with you to talk about\r\neverything in your splendidly frank way! This French girl\xe2\x80\x99s talk is of\r\ncourse only silly chatter; it makes me long to hear a few words from\r\nyour lips\xe2\x80\x94strong, brave, intelligent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dream of the ideal possibility. Suppose I were to look up and see\r\nyou standing just in front of me, there on the pavement. You have come\r\nin a few hours straight from London. Your eyes glow with delight.\r\nTo-morrow we shall travel on to Genoa, you and I, more than friends,\r\nand infinitely more than the common husband and wife! We have bidden\r\nthe world go round for _our_ amusement; henceforth it is our occupation\r\nto observe and discuss and make merry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it all in vain? Rhoda, if you never love me, my life will be poor\r\nto what it might have been; and you, you also, will lose something. In\r\nimagination I kiss your hands and your lips.\r\n\r\nEVERARD BARFOOT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an address at the head of this letter, but certainly Barfoot\r\nexpected no reply, and Rhoda had no thought of sending one. Every\r\nnight, however, she unfolded the sheet of thin foreign paper, and read,\r\nmore than once, what was written upon it. Read it with external calm,\r\nwith a brow of meditation, and afterwards sat for some time in absent\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nWould he write again? Her daily question was answered in rather more\r\nthan a fortnight. This time the letter came from Italy; it was lying on\r\nthe hall table when Rhoda returned from Great Portland Street, and Miss\r\nBarfoot was the first to read the address. They exchanged no remark. On\r\nbreaking the envelope\xe2\x80\x94she did so at once\xe2\x80\x94Rhoda found a little bunch\r\nof violets crushed but fragrant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese in return for your Cheddar pinks,\xe2\x80\x9d began the informal note\r\naccompanying the flowers. \xe2\x80\x9cI had them an hour ago from a pretty girl in\r\nthe streets of Parma. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to buy, and walked on, but the\r\npretty girl ran by me, and with gentle force fixed the flowers in my\r\nbutton-hole, so that I had no choice but to stroke her velvety cheek\r\nand give her a lira. How hungry I am for the sight of your face! Think\r\nof me sometimes, dear friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and laid the letter and its violets away with the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must depend on you, it seems, for news of Everard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nBarfoot after dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered lightly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has travelled\r\nfrom the south of France to the north of Italy, with much observation\r\nof female countenances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe informs you of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery naturally. It is his chief interest. One likes people to tell the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nBarfoot was away until the end of April, but after that note from Parma\r\nhe did not write. One bright afternoon in May, a Saturday, he presented\r\nhimself at his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s house, and found two or three callers in the\r\ndrawing-room, ladies as usual; one of them was Miss Winifred Haven,\r\nanother was Mrs. Widdowson. Mary received him without effusiveness, and\r\nafter a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 talk with her he took a place by Mrs. Widdowson,\r\nwho, it struck him, looked by no means in such good spirits as during\r\nthe early days of her marriage. As soon as she began to converse, his\r\nimpression of a change in her was confirmed; the girlishness so\r\npleasantly noticeable when first he knew her had disappeared, and the\r\ngravity substituted for it was suggestive of disillusion, of trouble.\r\n\r\nShe asked him if he knew some people named Bevis, who occupied a flat\r\njust above his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBevis? I have seen the name on the index at the foot of the stairs;\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them personally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was how I came to know that _you_ live there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nhusband took me to call upon the Bevises, and there we saw your name.\r\nAt least, we supposed it was you, and Miss Barfoot tells me we were\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; I live there all alone, a gloomy bachelor. How delightful if\r\nyou knocked at my door some day, when you and Mr. Widdowson are again\r\ncalling on your friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica smiled, and her eyes wandered restlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been away\xe2\x80\x94out of England?\xe2\x80\x9d she next said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; in Italy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI envy you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have never been there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe talked a little of the agreeables and disagreeables of life in that\r\ncountry. But Mrs. Widdowson had become irresponsive; he doubted at\r\nlength whether she was listening to him, so, as Miss Haven stepped this\r\nway, he took an opportunity of a word aside with his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn not at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Won\xe2\x80\x99t be till dinner-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever was better. Would you care to come back and dine with us at\r\nhalf-past seven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this pleasant prospect he took his leave. The afternoon being\r\nsunny, instead of walking straight to the station, to return home, he\r\nwent out on to the Embankment, and sauntered round by Chelsea Bridge\r\nRoad. As he entered Sloane Square he saw Mrs. Widdowson, who was coming\r\ntowards the railway; she walked rather wearily, with her eyes on the\r\nground, and did not become aware of him until he addressed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we travelling the same way?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWestward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am going all the way round to Portland Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered the station, Barfoot chatting humorously. And, so intent\r\nwas he on the expression of his companion\xe2\x80\x99s downcast face, that he\r\nallowed an acquaintance to pass close by him unobserved. It was Rhoda\r\nNunn, returning sooner than Miss Barfoot had expected. She saw the\r\npair, regarded them with a moment\xe2\x80\x99s keen attentiveness, and went on,\r\nout into the street.\r\n\r\nIn the first-class carriage which they entered there was no other\r\npassenger as far as Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s station. He could not resist the\r\ntemptation to use rather an intimate tone, though one that was quite\r\nconventional, in the hope that he might discover something of Mrs.\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He began by asking whether she thought it a good\r\nAcademy this year. She had not yet visited it, but hoped to do so on\r\nMonday. Did she herself do any kind of artistic work? Oh, nothing\r\nwhatever; she was a very useless and idle person. He believed she had\r\nbeen a pupil of Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s at one time? Yes, for a very short time\r\nindeed, just before her marriage. Was she not an intimate friend of\r\nMiss Nunn? Hardly intimate. They knew each other a few years ago, but\r\nMiss Nunn did not care much about her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably because I married,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Nunn really such a determined enemy of marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks it pardonable in very weak people. In my case she was\r\nindulgent enough to come to the wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis piece of news surprised Barfoot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came to your wedding? And wore a wedding garment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. And looked very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo describe it to me. Can you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that no woman ever forgot the details of another\xe2\x80\x99s dress, on\r\nhowever trivial an occasion, and at whatever distance of time, Monica\r\nwas of course able to satisfy the inquirer. Her curiosity excited, she\r\nventured in turn upon one or two insidious questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine Miss Nunn in such a costume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should very much like to have seen her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a very striking face\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. A wonderful face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. Barfoot bent forward from his place opposite Monica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me the most interesting of all faces,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly.\r\n\r\nHis companion blushed with surprise and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it seem strange to you, Mrs. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94why? Not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll at once she had brightened astonishingly. This subject was not\r\npursued, but for the rest of the time they talked with a new appearance\r\nof mutual confidence and interest, Monica retaining her pretty,\r\nhalf-bashful smile. And when Barfoot alighted at Bayswater they shook\r\nhands with an especial friendliness, both seeming to suggest a wish\r\nthat they might soon meet again.\r\n\r\nThey did so not later than the following Monday. Remembering what Mrs.\r\nWiddowson had said of her intention to visit Burlington House, Barfoot\r\nwent there in the afternoon. If he chanced to encounter the pretty\r\nlittle woman it would not be disagreeable. Perhaps her husband might be\r\nwith her, and in that case he could judge of the terms on which they\r\nstood. A surly fellow, Widdowson; very likely to play the tyrant, he\r\nthought. If he were not mistaken, she had wearied of him and regretted\r\nher bondage\xe2\x80\x94the old story. Thinking thus, and strolling through the\r\nrooms with casual glances at a picture, he discovered his acquaintance,\r\ncatalogue in hand, alone for the present. Her pensive face again\r\nanswered to his smile. They drew back from the pictures and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dined with our friends at Chelsea on Saturday evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barfoot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Saturday? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you were going back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of it just at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica hinted an amused surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI expected nothing, and happy for me that it\r\nwas so. Miss Nunn was in her severest mood; I think she didn\xe2\x80\x99t smile\r\nonce through the evening. I will confess to you I wrote her a letter\r\nwhilst I was abroad, and it offended her, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can always judge of her thoughts by her face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. But I have studied her face so often and so closely. For\r\nall that, she is more a mystery to me than any woman I have ever known.\r\nThat, of course, is partly the reason of her power over me. I feel that\r\nif ever\xe2\x80\x94if ever she should disclose herself to me, it would be the\r\nstrangest revelation. Every woman wears a mask, except to one man; but\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94is, I fancy, a far completer disguise than I ever\r\ntried to pierce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica had a sense of something perilous in this conversation. It arose\r\nfrom a secret trouble in her own heart, which she might, involuntarily,\r\nbe led to betray. She had never talked thus confidentially with any\r\nman; not, in truth, with her husband. There was no fear whatever of her\r\nconceiving an undue interest in Barfoot; certain reasons assured her of\r\nthat; but talk that was at all sentimental gravely threatened her\r\npeace\xe2\x80\x94what little remained to her. It would have been better to\r\ndiscourage this man\xe2\x80\x99s confidences; yet they flattered her so\r\npleasantly, and afforded such a fruitful subject for speculation, that\r\nshe could not obey the prompting of prudence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Miss Nunn seems to disguise her\r\nfeelings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is supposed to be wrong\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x94for a man to ask one woman her\r\nopinion of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be treacherous if I wished,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\nthat I understand her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot wondered how much intelligence he might attribute to Mrs.\r\nWiddowson. Obviously her level was much below that of Rhoda. Yet she\r\nseemed to possess delicate sensibilities, and a refinement of thought\r\nnot often met with in women of her position. Seriously desiring her\r\naid, he looked at her with a grave smile, and asked,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe her capable of falling in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica showed a painful confusion. She overcame it, however, and soon\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would perhaps try not\xe2\x80\x94not to acknowledge it to herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen, in fact, it had happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks it so much nobler to disregard such feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. She is to be an inspiring example to the women who cannot hope\r\nto marry.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed silently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I suppose it is quite possible\r\nthat mere shame would withhold her from taking the opposite course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is very strong. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked eagerly into her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know her. A woman may be as much a\r\nmystery to another woman as she is to a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole, I am glad to hear you say that. I believe it. It is only\r\nthe vulgar that hold a different opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we look at the pictures, Mr. Barfoot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am so sorry. I have been wasting your time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNervously disclaiming any such thought, Monica rose and drew near to\r\nthe canvases. They walked on together for some ten minutes, until\r\nBarfoot, who had turned to look at a passing figure, said in his\r\nordinary voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that is Mr. Widdowson on the other side of the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica looked quickly round, and saw her husband, as if occupied with\r\nthe pictures, glancing in her direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE CLANK OF THE CHAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Saturday evening Monica and her husband had not been on speaking\r\nterms. A visit she paid to Mildred Vesper, after her call at Miss\r\nBarfoot\xe2\x80\x99s, prolonged itself so that she did not reach home until the\r\ndinner-hour was long past. On arriving, she was met with an outburst of\r\ntremendous wrath, to which she opposed a resolute and haughty silence;\r\nand since then the two had kept as much apart as possible.\r\n\r\nWiddowson knew that Monica was going to the Academy. He allowed her to\r\nset forth alone, and even tried to persuade himself that he was\r\nindifferent as to the hour of her return; but she had not long been\r\ngone before he followed. Insufferable misery possessed him. His married\r\nlife threatened to terminate in utter wreck, and he had the anguish of\r\nrecognizing that to a great extent this catastrophe would be his own\r\nfault. Resolve as he might, he found it impossible to repress the\r\nimpulses of jealousy which, as soon as peace had been declared between\r\nthem, brought about a new misunderstanding. Terrible thoughts\r\nsmouldered in his mind; he felt himself to be one of those men who are\r\ndriven by passion into crime. Deliberately he had brooded over a tragic\r\nclose to the wretchedness of his existence; he would kill himself, and\r\nMonica should perish with him. But an hour of contentment sufficed to\r\nbanish such visions as sheer frenzy. He saw once more how harmless, how\r\nnatural, were Monica\xe2\x80\x99s demands, and how peacefully he might live with\r\nher but for the curse of suspicion from which he could not free\r\nhimself. Any other man would deem her a model of wifely virtue. Her care\r\nof the house was all that reason could desire. In her behaviour he had\r\nnever detected the slightest impropriety. He believed her chaste as any\r\nwoman living She asked only to be trusted, and that, in spite of all,\r\nwas beyond his power.\r\n\r\nIn no woman on earth could he have put perfect confidence. He regarded\r\nthem as born to perpetual pupilage. Not that their inclinations were\r\nnecessarily wanton; they were simply incapable of attaining maturity,\r\nremained throughout their life imperfect beings, at the mercy of craft,\r\never liable to be misled by childish misconceptions. Of course he was\r\nright; he himself represented the guardian male, the wife-proprietor,\r\nwho from the dawn of civilization has taken abundant care that woman\r\nshall not outgrow her nonage. The bitterness of his situation lay in\r\nthe fact that he had wedded a woman who irresistibly proved to him her\r\nclaims as a human being. Reason and tradition contended in him, to his\r\nceaseless torment.\r\n\r\nAnd again, he feared that Monica did not love him. Had she ever loved\r\nhim? There was too much ground for suspecting that she had only yielded\r\nto the persistence of his entreaties, with just liking enough to permit\r\na semblance of tenderness, and glad to exchange her prospect of\r\ndistasteful work for a comfortable married life. Her liking he might\r\nhave fostered; during those first happy weeks, assuredly he had done\r\nso, for no woman could be insensible to the passionate worship manifest\r\nin his every look, his every word. Later, he took the wrong path,\r\nseeking to oppose her instincts, to reform her mind, eventually to\r\nbecome her lord and master. Could he not even now retrace his steps?\r\nSupposing her incapable of bowing before him, of kissing his feet,\r\ncould he not be content to make of her a loyal friend, a delightful\r\ncompanion?\r\n\r\nIn that mood he hastened towards Burlington House. Seeking Monica\r\nthrough the galleries, he saw her at length\xe2\x80\x94sitting side by side with\r\nthat man Barfoot. They were in closest colloquy. Barfoot bent towards\r\nher as if speaking in an undertone, a smile on his face. Monica looked\r\nat once pleased and troubled.\r\n\r\nThe blood boiled in his veins. His first impulse was to walk straight\r\nup to Monica and bid her follow him. But the ecstasy of jealous\r\nsuffering kept him an observer. He watched the pair until he was\r\ndescried.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. Though his brain whirled, and his flesh was\r\nstabbed, he had no choice but to take the hand Barfoot offered him.\r\nSmile he could not, nor speak a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have come after all?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica was saying to him.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. On her countenance there was obvious embarrassment, but this\r\nneeded no explanation save the history of the last day or two. Looking\r\ninto her eyes, he knew not whether consciousness of wrong might be read\r\nthere. How to get at the secrets of this woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart?\r\n\r\nBarfoot was talking, pointing at this picture and that, doing his best\r\nto smooth what he saw was an awkward situation. The gloomy husband,\r\nmore like a tyrant than ever, muttered incoherent phrases. In a minute\r\nor two Everard freed himself and moved out of sight.\r\n\r\nMonica turned from her husband and affected interest in the pictures.\r\nThey reached the end of the room before Widdowson spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long do you want to stay here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go whenever you like,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to spoil your pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I have very little pleasure in anything. Did you come to keep\r\nme in sight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we will go home now, and you can come another day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica assented by closing her catalogue and walking on.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, they made the journey back to Herne Hill. Widdowson\r\nshut himself in the library, and did not appear till dinner-time. The\r\nmeal was a pretence for both of them, and as soon as they could rise\r\nfrom the table they again parted.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Monica was joined by her husband in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have almost made up my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, standing near her, \xe2\x80\x9cto take a\r\nserious step. As you have always spoken with pleasure of your old home,\r\nClevedon, suppose we give up this house and go and live there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for you to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know whether you would have any objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do as you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. The plan I have in mind is this. I should take\r\na good large house\xe2\x80\x94no doubt rents are low in the neighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nask your sisters to come and live with us. I think it would be a good\r\nthing both for them and for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure that they would agree to it. You see that Virginia\r\nprefers her lodgings to living here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOddly enough, this was the case. On their return from Guernsey they had\r\ninvited Virginia to make a permanent home with them, and she refused.\r\nHer reasons Monica could not understand; those which she alleged\xe2\x80\x94vague\r\narguments as to its being better for a wife\xe2\x80\x99s relatives not to burden\r\nthe husband\xe2\x80\x94hardly seemed genuine. It was possible that Virginia had a\r\ndistaste for Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they both would be glad to live at Clevedon,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cjudging from your sisters\xe2\x80\x99 talk. It\xe2\x80\x99s plain that they have quite given\r\nup the idea of the school, and Alice, you tell me, is getting\r\ndissatisfied with her work at Yatton. But I must know whether you will\r\nenter seriously into this scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica kept silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease answer me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you thought of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need explain. We have had too many unpleasant\r\nconversations, and I wish to act for the best without saying things you\r\nwould misunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no fear of my misunderstanding. You have no confidence in me,\r\nand you want to get me away into a quiet country place where I shall be\r\nunder your eyes every moment. It\xe2\x80\x99s much better to say that plainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means you would consider it going to prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I help? What other motive have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was prompted to make brutal declaration of authority, and so cut the\r\nknot. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s unanswerable argument merely angered him. But he made an\r\neffort over himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it best that we should take some step before our\r\nhappiness is irretrievably ruined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no need for its ruin. As I have told you before, in talking like\r\nthat you degrade yourself and insult me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my faults; I know them only too well. One of them is that I\r\ncannot bear you to make friends with people who are not of my kind. I\r\nshall never be able to endure that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you are speaking of Mr. Barfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he avowed sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very unfortunate thing that I\r\nhappened to come up just as he was in your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so very unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Monica tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat possible\r\nharm is there in Mr. Barfoot, when he meets me by chance in a public\r\nplace, having a conversation with me? I wish I knew twenty such men.\r\nSuch conversation gives me a new interest in life. I have every reason\r\nto think well of Mr. Barfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson was in anguish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, in a voice shaken with angry feeling, \xe2\x80\x9cfeel that I\r\nhave every reason to dislike and suspect him. He is not an honest man;\r\nhis face tells me that. I know his life wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear inspection. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be as good a judge as I am in such a case. Contrast him\r\nwith Bevis. No, Bevis is a man one can trust; one talk with him\r\nproduces a lasting favourable impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica, silent for a brief space, looked fixedly before her, her\r\nfeatures all but expressionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet even with Mr. Bevis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t make friends.\r\nThat is the fault in you which causes all this trouble. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nsociable spirit. Your dislike of Mr. Barfoot only means that you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow him, and don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to. And you are completely wrong in your\r\njudgment of him. I have every reason for being sure that you are wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you think so. In your ignorance of the world\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you think very proper in a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed caustically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do! That kind of knowledge is harmful to a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, please, how is she to judge her acquaintances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA married woman must accept her husband\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, at all events about\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d He plunged on into the ancient quagmire. \xe2\x80\x9cA man may know with\r\nimpunity what is injurious if it enters a woman\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that. I can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe differ hopelessly. It was all very well to discuss these things\r\nwhen you could do so in a friendly spirit. Now you say whatever you\r\nknow will irritate me, and you say it on purpose to irritate me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; indeed I do not. But you are quite right that I find it hard to be\r\nfriendly with you. Most earnestly I wish to be your friend\xe2\x80\x94your true\r\nand faithful friend. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman who has become my wife ought\r\nto be something more than a friend, I should think. You have lost all\r\nlove for me\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s the misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica could not reply. That word \xe2\x80\x9clove\xe2\x80\x9d had grown a weariness to her\r\nupon his lips. She did not love him; could not pretend to love him.\r\nEvery day the distance between them widened, and when he took her in\r\nhis arms she had to struggle with a sense of shrinking, of disgust. The\r\nunion was unnatural; she felt herself constrained by a hateful force\r\nwhen he called upon her for the show of wifely tenderness. Yet how was\r\nshe to utter this? The moment such a truth had passed her lips she must\r\nleave him. To declare that no trace of love remained in her heart, and\r\nstill to live with him\xe2\x80\x94that was impossible! The dark foresight of a\r\nnecessity of parting from him corresponded in her to those lurid\r\nvisions which at times shook Widdowson with a horrible temptation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t love me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in harsh, choking tones. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to\r\nbe my _friend_. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you try to compensate me for the loss of\r\nyour love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed with bitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica answered, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you ever ask yourself whether\r\nyou try to make me love you? Scenes like this are ruining my health. I\r\nhave come to dread your talk. I have almost forgotten the sound of your\r\nvoice when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t either angry or complaining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson walked about the room, and a deep moan escaped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why I have asked you to go away from here, Monica. We must\r\nhave a new home if our life is to begin anew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no faith in mere change of place. You would be the same man. If\r\nyou cannot command your senseless jealousy here, you never would\r\nanywhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made an effort to say something; seemed to abandon it; again tried,\r\nand spoke in a thick, unnatural voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you honestly repeat to me what Barfoot was saying to-day, when you\r\nwere on the seat together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could; every word. But I shall not try to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I beseech you to, Monica? To put my mind at rest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. When I tell you that you might have heard every syllable, I have\r\nsaid all that I shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt mortified him profoundly that he should have been driven to make so\r\nhumiliating a request. He threw himself into a chair and hid his face,\r\nsitting thus for a long time in the hope that Monica would be moved to\r\ncompassion. But when she rose it was only to retire for the night. And\r\nwith wretchedness in her heart, because she must needs go to the same\r\nchamber in which her husband would sleep. She wished so to be alone.\r\nThe poorest bed in a servant\xe2\x80\x99s garret would have been thrice welcome to\r\nher; liberty to lie awake, to think without a disturbing presence, to\r\nshed tears if need be\xe2\x80\x94that seemed to her a precious boon. She thought\r\nwith envy of the shop-girls in Walworth Road; wished herself back\r\nthere. What unspeakable folly she had committed! And how true was\r\neverything she had heard from Rhoda Nunn on the subject of marriage!\r\nThe next day Widdowson resorted to an expedient which he had once\r\nbefore tried in like circumstances. He wrote his wife a long letter,\r\neight close pages, reviewing the cause of their troubles, confessing\r\nhis own errors, insisting gently on those chargeable to her, and\r\nfinally imploring her to cooperate with him in a sincere endeavour to\r\nrestore their happiness. This he laid on the table after lunch, and\r\nthen left Monica alone that she might read it. Knowing beforehand all\r\nthat the letter contained, Monica glanced over it carelessly. An answer\r\nwas expected, and she wrote one as briefly as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour behaviour seems to me very weak, very unmanly. You make us both\r\nmiserable, and quite without cause. I can only say as I have said\r\nbefore, that things will never be better until you come to think of me\r\nas your free companion, not as your bond-woman. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t do this,\r\nyou will make me wish that I had never met you, and in the end I am\r\nsure it won\xe2\x80\x99t be possible for us to go on living together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left this note, in a blank envelope, on the hall table, and went\r\nout to walk for an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of one more acute stage in their progressive discord. By\r\nkeeping at home for a fortnight, Monica soothed her husband and\r\nobtained some repose for her own nerves. But she could no longer affect\r\na cordial reconciliation; caresses left her cold, and Widdowson saw\r\nthat his company was never so agreeable to her as solitude. When they\r\nsat together, both were reading. Monica found more attraction in books\r\nas her life grew more unhappy. Though with reluctance Widdowson had\r\nconsented to a subscription at Mudie\xe2\x80\x99s, and from the new catalogues she\r\neither chose for herself, necessarily at random, or by the advice of\r\nbetter-read people, such as she met at Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s. What modern\r\nteaching was to be got from these volumes her mind readily absorbed.\r\nShe sought for opinions and arguments which were congenial to her mood\r\nof discontent, all but of revolt.\r\n\r\nSometimes the perusal of a love-story embittered her lot to the last\r\npoint of endurance. Before marriage, her love-ideal had been very\r\nvague, elusive; it found scarcely more than negative expression, as a\r\nshrinking from the vulgar or gross desires of her companions in the\r\nshop. Now that she had a clearer understanding of her own nature, the\r\ntype of man correspondent to her natural sympathies also became clear.\r\nIn every particular he was unlike her husband. She found a suggestion\r\nof him in books; and in actual life, already, perhaps something more\r\nthan a suggestion. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy, in so far as it directed\r\nitself against her longing for freedom, was fully justified; this\r\nconsciousness often made her sullen when she desired to express a\r\nnobler indignation; but his special prejudice led him altogether\r\nastray, and in free resistance on this point she found the relief which\r\nenabled her to bear a secret self-reproach. Her refusal to repeat the\r\nsubstance of Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s conversation was, in some degree, prompted by a\r\nwish for the continuance of his groundless fears. By persevering in\r\nsuspicion of Barfoot, he afforded her a firm foothold in their\r\never-renewed quarrels.\r\n\r\nA husband\xe2\x80\x99s misdirected jealousy excites in the wife derision and a\r\nsense of superiority; more often than not, it fosters an unsuspected\r\nattachment, prompts to a perverse pleasure in misleading. Monica became\r\naware of this; in her hours of misery she now and then gave a harsh\r\nlaugh, the result of thoughts not seriously entertained, but tempting\r\nthe fancy to recklessness. What, she asked herself again, would be the\r\nend of it all? Ten years hence, would she have subdued her soul to a\r\nlife of weary insignificance, if not of dishonour? For it was dishonour\r\nto live with a man she could not love, whether her heart cherished\r\nanother image or was merely vacant. A dishonour to which innumerable\r\nwomen submitted, a dishonour glorified by social precept, enforced\r\nunder dread penalties.\r\n\r\nBut she was so young, and life abounds in unexpected changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST LIE\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Cosgrove was a childless widow, with sufficient means and a very\r\nmixed multitude of acquaintances. In the general belief her marriage\r\nhad been a happy one; when she spoke of her deceased husband it was\r\nwith respect, and not seldom with affection. Yet her views on the\r\nmatrimonial relation were known to be of singular audacity. She\r\nrevealed them only to a small circle of intimates; most of the people\r\nwho frequented her house had no startling theories to maintain, and\r\nregarded their hostess as a good-natured, rather eccentric woman, who\r\nloved society and understood how to amuse her guests.\r\n\r\nWealth and position were rarely represented in her drawing-room; nor,\r\non the other hand, was Bohemianism. Mrs. Cosgrove belonged by birth and\r\nmarriage to the staid middle class, and it seemed as if she made it her\r\nobject to provide with social entertainment the kind of persons who, in\r\nan ordinary way, would enjoy very little of it. Lonely and impecunious\r\ngirls or women were frequently about her; she tried to keep them in\r\ngood spirits, tried to marry them if marriage seemed possible, and, it\r\nwas whispered, used a good deal of her income for the practical benefit\r\nof those who needed assistance. A sprinkling of maidens who were\r\nneither lonely nor impecunious served to attract young men, generally\r\nstrugglers in some profession or other, on the lookout for a wife.\r\nIntercourse went on with a minimum of formalities. Chaperonage\xe2\x80\x94save\r\nfor that represented by the hostess herself\xe2\x80\x94was as often as not\r\ndispensed with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to get rid of a lot of sham propriety\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so she urged to her\r\ncloser friends. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls must learn to trust themselves, and look out for\r\ndangers. If a girl can only be kept straight by incessant watchfulness,\r\nwhy, let her go where she will, and learn by experience. In fact, I\r\nwant to see experience substituted for precept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween this lady and Miss Barfoot there were considerable divergences\r\nof opinion, yet they agreed on a sufficient number of points to like\r\neach other very well. Occasionally one of Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s _protegees_\r\npassed into Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s hands, abandoning the thought of matrimony\r\nfor study in Great Portland Street. Rhoda Nunn, also, had a liking for\r\nMrs. Cosgrove, though she made no secret of her opinion that Mrs.\r\nCosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s influence was on the whole decidedly harmful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat house,\xe2\x80\x9d she once said to Miss Barfoot, \xe2\x80\x9cis nothing more than a\r\nmatrimonial agency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut so is every house where many people are entertained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the same way. Mrs. Cosgrove was speaking to me of some girl who\r\nhas just accepted an offer of marriage. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll suit\r\neach other,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in trying.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot could not restrain a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows? Perhaps she is right in that view of things. After all, you\r\nknow, it\xe2\x80\x99s only putting into plain words what everybody thinks on all\r\nbut every such occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first part of her remark\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda caustically. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as\r\nfor the \xe2\x80\x9cno harm in trying,\xe2\x80\x9d well, let us ask the wife\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in a\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nMidway in the London season on Sunday afternoon, about a score of\r\nvisitors were assembled in Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-rooms\xe2\x80\x94there were\r\ntwo of them, with a landing between. As usual, some one sat at the\r\npiano, but a hum of talk went on as undercurrent to the music.\r\nDownstairs, in the library, half a dozen people found the quietness\r\nthey preferred, and among these was Mrs. Widdowson. She had an album of\r\nportraits on her lap; whilst turning them over, she listened to a chat\r\ngoing on between the sprightly Mr. Bevis and a young married woman who\r\nlaughed ceaselessly at his jokes. It was only a few minutes since she\r\nhad come down from the drawing-room. Presently her eyes encountered a\r\nglance from Bevis, and at once he stepped over to a seat beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sisters are not here to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. They have guests of their own. And when are you coming to see them\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore long, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBevis looked away and seemed to reflect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo come next Saturday\xe2\x80\x94could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better not promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo try, and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he lowered his voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccome alone. Forgive me for saying\r\nthat. The girls are rather afraid of Mr. Widdowson, that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth.\r\nThey would so like a free gossip with you. Let me tell them to expect\r\nyou about half-past three or four. They will rise up and call me\r\nblessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaughing, Monica at length agreed to come if circumstances were\r\nfavourable. Her talk with Bevis continued for a long time, until people\r\nhad begun to leave. Some other acquaintance then claimed her, but she\r\nwas now dull and monosyllabic, as if conversation had exhausted her\r\nenergies. At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock she stole away unobserved, and went home.\r\n\r\nWiddowson had resigned himself, in appearance at all events, to these\r\nabsences. It was several weeks since he had accompanied his wife to\r\ncall upon any one; a sluggishness was creeping over him, strengthening\r\nhis disinclination for society. The futile endeavour to act with\r\ndecision, to carry Monica away into Somerset, resulted, as futile\r\nefforts of that kind are wont to do, in increased feebleness of the\r\nwill; he was less capable than ever of exerting the authority which he\r\nstill believed himself to keep for the last resort. Occasionally some\r\ndays went by without his leaving the house. Instead of the one daily\r\nnewspaper he had been used to take he now received three; after\r\nbreakfast he sometimes spent a couple of hours over the _Times_, and\r\nthe evening papers often occupied him from dinner to bedtime. Monica\r\nnoticed, with a painful conflict of emotions, that his hair had begun\r\nto lose its uniform colour, and to show streaks that matched with his\r\ngrizzled beard. Was _she_ responsible for this?\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday when she was to visit the Bevises she feared lest he\r\nshould propose to go with her. She wished even to avoid the necessity\r\nof telling him where she was going. As she rose from luncheon Widdowson\r\nglanced at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered the trap, Monica. Will you come for a drive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have promised to go into the town. I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was his latest mode of appealing to her\xe2\x80\x94with an air of pained\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a day or two I haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt at all well,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued gloomily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought a drive might do me good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I hope it will. When would you like to have dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never care to alter the hours. Of course I shall be back at the\r\nusual time. Shall _you_ be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94long before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she got away without any explanation. At a quarter to four she\r\nreached the block of flats in which the Bevises (and Everard Barfoot)\r\nresided. With a fluttering of the heart, she went very quietly\r\nupstairs, as if anxious that her footsteps should not be heard; her\r\nknock at the door was timid.\r\n\r\nBevis in person opened to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted! I thought it _might_ be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe entered, and walked into the first room, where she had been once\r\nbefore. But to her surprise it was vacant. She looked round and saw\r\nBevis\xe2\x80\x99s countenance gleaming with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sisters will be here in a few minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA few minutes at\r\nmost. Will you take this chair, Mrs. Widdowson? How delighted I am that\r\nyou were able to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo perfectly natural was his manner, that Monica, after the first\r\nmoment of consternation, tried to forget that there was anything\r\nirregular in her presence here under these circumstances. As regards\r\nsocial propriety, a flat differs in many respects from a house. In an\r\nordinary drawing-room, it could scarcely have mattered if Bevis\r\nentertained her for a short space until his sisters\xe2\x80\x99 arrival; but in\r\nthis little set of rooms it was doubtfully permissible for her to sit\r\n_tete-a-tete_ with a young man, under any excuse. And the fact of his\r\nopening the front door himself seemed to suggest that not even a\r\nservant was in the flat. A tremor grew upon her as she talked, due in\r\npart to the consciousness that she was glad to be thus alone with Bevis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA place like this must seem to you to be very unhomelike,\xe2\x80\x9d he was\r\nsaying, as he lounged on a low chair not very far from her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe girls\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like it at all at first. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s a retrograde step in\r\ncivilization. Servants are decidedly of that opinion; we have a great\r\ndifficulty in getting them to stay here. The reason seems to me that\r\nthey miss the congenial gossip of the area door. At this moment we are\r\nwithout a domestic. I found she compensated herself for disadvantages\r\nby stealing my tobacco and cigars. She went to work with such a lack of\r\ndiscretion\xe2\x80\x94abstracting half a pound of honeydew at a time\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find any sympathy for her. Moreover, when charged with the\r\ndelinquency, she became abusive, so very abusive that we were obliged\r\nto insist upon her immediate departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she smoked?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monica laughingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have debated that point with much interest. She was a person of\r\nadvanced ideas, as you see; practically a communist. But I doubt\r\nwhether honeydew had any charms for her personally. It seems more\r\nprobable that some milkman, or baker\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, or even metropolitan\r\npoliceman, benefited by her communism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndifferent to the progress of time, Bevis talked on with his usual\r\njocoseness, now and then shaking his tawny hair in a fit of laughter\r\nthe most contagious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have something to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length more seriously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to leave England. They want me to live at Bordeaux for a\r\ntime, two or three years perhaps. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great bore, but I shall have\r\nto go. I am not my own master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your sisters will go to Guernsey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I dare say I shall leave about the end of July.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became silent, looking at Monica with humorous sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think your sisters will soon be here, Mr. Bevis?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica asked,\r\nwith a glance round the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so. Do you know, I did a very silly thing. I wanted your visit\r\n(if you came) to be a surprise for them, and so\xe2\x80\x94in fact, I said\r\nnothing about it. When I got here from business, a little before three,\r\nthey were just going out. I asked them if they were sure they would be\r\nback in less than an hour. Oh, they were quite sure\xe2\x80\x94not a doubt about\r\nit. I do hope they haven\xe2\x80\x99t altered their mind, and gone to call\r\nsomewhere. But, Mrs. Widdowson, I am going to make you a cup of\r\ntea\xe2\x80\x94with my own fair hands, as the novelists say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica begged that he would not trouble. Under the circumstances she\r\nhad better not stay. She would come again very soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you go!\xe2\x80\x9d Bevis exclaimed, softening his gay\r\ntone as he stood before her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I entreat you? If you knew what\r\nan unforgettable delight it will be to me to make you a cup of tea! I\r\nshall think of it at Bordeaux every Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had risen, but exhibited no immutable resolve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really must go, Mr. Bevis\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t drive me to despair. I am capable of turning my poor sisters out\r\nof house and home\xe2\x80\x94flat and home, I mean\xe2\x80\x94in anger at their delay. On\r\ntheir account, in pity for their youth, do stay, Mrs. Widdowson!\r\nBesides, I have a new song that I want you to hear\xe2\x80\x94words and music my\r\nown. One little quarter of an hour! And I know the girls will be here\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis will, and her inclination, prevailed. Monica sat down again, and\r\nBevis disappeared to make the tea. Water must have been already\r\nboiling, for in less than five minutes the young man returned with a\r\ntray, on which all the necessaries were neatly arranged. With merry\r\nhomage he waited upon his guest. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were warm. After the\r\nvain attempt to release herself from what was now distinctly a\r\ncompromising situation, she sat down in an easier attitude than before,\r\nas though resolved to enjoy her liberty whilst she might. There was a\r\nsuspicion in her mind that Bevis had arranged this interview; she\r\ndoubted the truth of his explanation. And indeed she hoped that his\r\nsisters would not return until after her departure; it would be very\r\nembarrassing to meet them.\r\n\r\nWhilst talking and listening, she silently defended herself against the\r\ncharge of impropriety. What wrong was she committing? What matter that\r\nthey were alone? Their talk was precisely what it might have been in\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s presence. And Bevis, such a frank, good-hearted fellow,\r\ncould not by any possibility fail in respect to her. The objections\r\nwere all cant, and cant of the worst kind. She would not be a slave of\r\nsuch ignoble prejudices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t made Mr. Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance yet?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. There seems to have been no opportunity. Did you\r\nseriously wish me to know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I had no wish in the matter at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like Mr. Barfoot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think him very pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful to be praised by you, Mrs. Widdowson! Now if any one\r\nspeaks to you about _me_, when I have left England, will you find some\r\nnice word? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think me foolish. I do so desire the good opinion of\r\nmy friends. To know that you spoke of me as you did for Mr. Barfoot\r\nwould give me a whole day of happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow enviable! To be so easily made happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let me sing you this song of mine. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t very good; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncomposed for years. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down and rattled over the keys. Monica was expecting a lively\r\nair and spirited words, as in the songs she had heard at Guernsey; but\r\nthis composition told of sadness and longing and the burden of a lonely\r\nheart. She thought it very beautiful, very touching. Bevis looked round\r\nto see the effect it produced upon her, and she could not meet his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a new sort of thing for me, Mrs. Widdowson. Does it strike you\r\nas so very bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t honestly praise it?\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed, in dejection. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant\r\nto give you a copy. I made this one specially for you, and\xe2\x80\x94if you will\r\nforgive me\xe2\x80\x94I have taken the liberty of dedicating it to you.\r\nSongwriters do that, you know. Of course it is altogether unworthy of\r\nyour acceptance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94indeed I am very grateful to you, Mr. Bevis. Do give it to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94as you meant to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have it?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for a triumphal march!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst he played, with look corresponding to the exultant strain,\r\nMonica rose from her chair. She stood with eyes downcast and lips\r\npressed together. When the last chord had sounded,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must say good-bye, Mr. Bevis. I am so sorry your sisters haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I\xe2\x80\x94and yet I am not. I have enjoyed the happiest half-hour of my\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give me the piece of music?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me roll it up. There; it won\xe2\x80\x99t be very awkward to carry. But of\r\ncourse I shall see you again before the end of July? You will come some\r\nother afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss Bevis will let me know when she is quite sure\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she shall. Do you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall say a word about\r\nwhat has happened this afternoon. Will you allow me to keep silence\r\nabout your call, Mrs. Widdowson? They would be so annoyed\xe2\x80\x94and really\r\nit was a silly thing not to tell them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica gave no verbal reply. She looked towards the door. Bevis stepped\r\nforward, and held it open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, then. You know what I told you about my tendency to low\r\nspirits. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a terrible turn\xe2\x80\x94down, down, down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and offered her hand. He held it very lightly, looking at\r\nher with his blue eyes, which indeed expressed a profound melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your great kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he opened the front door for her. Without another look\r\nMonica went quickly down the stairs; she appreciated his motive for not\r\naccompanying her to the exit.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nBefore entering the house she had managed to conceal the sheet of music\r\nwhich she was carrying. But, happily, Widdowson was still absent. Half\r\nan hour passed\xe2\x80\x94half an hour of brooding and reverie\xe2\x80\x94before she heard\r\nhis footstep ascending the stairs. On the landing she met him with a\r\npleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you enjoyed your drive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you feel better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much, dear. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLater, he inquired where she had been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had an appointment with Milly Vesper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first falsehood she had ever told him, and yet uttered with such\r\nperfect assumption of sincerity as would have deceived the acutest\r\nobserver. He nodded, discontented as usual, but entertaining no doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd from that moment she hated him. If he had plied her with\r\ninterrogations, if he had seemed to suspect anything, the burden of\r\nuntruth would have been more endurable. His simple acceptance of her\r\nword was the sternest rebuke she could have received. She despised\r\nherself, and hated him for the degradation which resulted from his\r\nlordship over her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTOWARDS THE DECISIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Barfoot had never suffered from lack of interest in life. Many a\r\nvivid moment dwelt in her memory; joys and sorrows, personal or of\r\nlarger scope, affected her the more deeply because of that ruling\r\nintelligence which enabled her to transmute them into principles. No\r\nlonger anticipating or desiring any great change in her own\r\nenvironment, in the modes and motives of her activity, she found it a\r\nsufficient happiness to watch, and when possible to direct, the\r\ntendency of younger lives. So kindly had nature tempered her\r\ndisposition, that already she had been able to outlive those fervours\r\nof instinct which often make the middle life of an unwedded woman one\r\nlong repining; but her womanly sympathies remained. And at present\r\nthere was going forward under her own roof, within her daily\r\nobservation, a comedy, a drama, which had power to excite all her\r\ndisinterested emotions. It had been in progress for twelve months, and\r\nnow, unless she was strangely mistaken, the _denouement_ drew very near.\r\n\r\nFor all her self-study, her unflinching recognition of physical and\r\npsychical facts which the average woman blinks over, Mary deceived\r\nherself as to the date of that final triumph which permitted her to\r\nobserve Rhoda Nunn with perfect equanimity. Her outbreak of angry\r\nfeeling on the occasion of Bella Royston\xe2\x80\x99s death meant something more\r\nthan she would acknowledge before the inquisition of her own mind. It\r\nwas just then that she had become aware of Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s changing attitude\r\ntowards Everard Barfoot; trifles such as only a woman would detect had\r\nconvinced her that Everard\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Rhoda was awakening a serious\r\nresponse; and this discovery, though it could not surprise her, caused\r\nan obscure pang which she attributed to impersonal regret, to mere\r\nnatural misgiving. For some days she thought of Rhoda in an ironic,\r\nhalf-mocking spirit. Then came Bella\xe2\x80\x99s suicide, and the conversation in\r\nwhich Rhoda exhibited a seeming heartlessness, the result, undoubtedly,\r\nof grave emotional disturbance. To her own astonishment, Mary was\r\novercome with an impulse of wrathful hostility, and spoke words which\r\nshe regretted as soon as they had passed her lips.\r\n\r\nPoor Bella had very little to do with this moment of discord between\r\ntwo women who sincerely liked and admired each other. She only offered\r\nthe occasion for an outburst of secret feeling which probably could not\r\nhave been avoided. Mary Barfoot had loved her cousin Everard; it began\r\nwhen he was one-and-twenty; she, so much older, had never allowed\r\nEverard or any one else to suspect her passion, which made her for two\r\nor three years more unhappy than she had ever been, or was ever to be\r\nwhen once her strong reason had prevailed. The scandal of Amy Drake,\r\nhappening long after, revived her misery, which now took the form of\r\ntruly feminine intolerance; she tried to believe that Everard was\r\nhenceforth of less than no account to her, that she detested him for\r\nhis vices. Amy Drake, however, she detested much more.\r\n\r\nWhen her friendship with Rhoda Nunn had progressed to intimacy, she\r\ncould not refrain from speaking of her cousin Everard, absent at the\r\nends of the earth, and perchance lost to her sight for ever. Her\r\nmention of him was severe, yet of a severity so obviously blended with\r\nother feeling, that Rhoda could not but surmise the truth. Sentimental\r\nconfession never entered Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s mind; she had conquered her\r\ndesires, and was by no means inclined to make herself ridiculous; Rhoda\r\nNunn, of all women, seemed the least likely to make remarks, or put\r\nquestions, such as would endanger a betrayal of the buried past. Yet,\r\nat a later time, when pressing the inquiry whether Rhoda had ever been\r\nin love, Mary did not scruple to suggest that her own knowledge in that\r\ndirection was complete. She did it in lightness of heart, secure under\r\nthe protection of her forty years. Rhoda, of course, understood her as\r\nreferring to Everard.\r\n\r\nSo the quarrel was one of jealousy. But no sooner had it taken place\r\nwhen Mary Barfoot experienced a shame, a distress, which in truth\r\nsignified the completion of self-conquest. She thought herself ashamed\r\nof being angry where anger was uncalled for; in reality, she chastised\r\nherself for the last revival of a conflict practically over and done\r\nwith so many years ago. And on this very account, precisely because she\r\nwas deceiving herself as to her state of mind, she prolonged the\r\npainful situation. She said to herself that Rhoda had behaved so\r\nwrongly that displeasure was justified, that to make up the quarrel at\r\nonce would be unwise, for Miss Nunn needed a little discipline. This\r\ninsistence upon the side issue helped her to disregard the main one,\r\nand when at length she offered Rhoda the kiss of reconcilement, that\r\nalso signified something other than was professed. It meant a hope that\r\nRhoda might know the happiness which to her friend had been denied.\r\n\r\nEverard\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of his passion for Miss Nunn seemed to Mary a\r\nwell-calculated piece of boldness. If he seriously sought Rhoda for his\r\nwife, this frank avowal of the desire before a third person might\r\nremove some of the peculiar difficulties of the case. Whether willing\r\nor not to be wooed, Rhoda, in mere consistency with her pronounced\r\nopinions, must needs maintain a scornful silence on the subject of\r\nEverard\xe2\x80\x99s love-making; by assailing this proud reserve, this dignity\r\nwhich perchance had begun to burden its supporter, Everard made\r\npossible, if not inevitable, a discussion of his suit between the two\r\nwomen. She who talks of her lover will be led to think of him.\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot knew not whether to hope for the marriage of this strange\r\npair. She was distrustful of her cousin, found it hard to imagine him a\r\nloyal husband, and could not be sure whether Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s qualities were\r\nsuch as would ultimately retain or repel him. She inclined to think\r\nthis wooing a mere caprice. But Rhoda gave ear to him, of that there\r\ncould be little doubt; and since his inheritance of ample means the\r\naffair began to have a new aspect. That Everard persevered, though the\r\nworld of women was now open to him\xe2\x80\x94for, on a moderate computation, any\r\nman with Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s personal advantages, and armed with fifteen hundred\r\na year, may choose among fifty possible maidens\xe2\x80\x94seemed to argue that\r\nhe was really in love. But what it would cost Rhoda to appear before\r\nher friends in the character of a bride! What a humbling of her glory!\r\n\r\nWas she capable of the love which defies all humiliation? Or, loving\r\nardently, would she renounce a desired happiness from dread of female\r\nsmiles and whispers? Or would it be her sufficient satisfaction to\r\nreject a wealthy suitor, and thus pose more grandly than ever before\r\nthe circle who saw in her an example of woman\xe2\x80\x99s independence? Powerful\r\nwas the incitement to curiosity in a situation which, however it ended,\r\nwould afford such matter for emotional hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThey did not talk of Everard. Whether Rhoda replied to his letters from\r\nabroad Miss Barfoot had no means of ascertaining. But after his return\r\nhe had a very cold reception\xe2\x80\x94due, perhaps, to some audacity he had\r\nallowed himself in his correspondence. Rhoda again avoided meeting with\r\nhim, and, as Miss Barfoot noticed, threw herself with increased energy\r\ninto all her old pursuits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about your holiday this year?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked one evening in June.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you go first, or shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease make whatever arrangements you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot had a reason for wishing to postpone her holiday until\r\nlate in August. She said so, and proposed that Rhoda should take any\r\nthree weeks she liked prior to that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vesper,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9ccan manage your room very well. We shall be\r\nmuch more at ease in that respect than last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Miss Vesper is getting to be very useful and trustworthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda mused when she had made this remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked presently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether she sees much of Mrs.\r\nWiddowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey decided that Rhoda should go away at the close of July. Where was\r\nher holiday to be spent? Miss Barfoot suggested the lake country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have some\r\nsea-bathing, though. A week by the shore, and then the rest of the time\r\nspent in vagabondage among the mountains, would suit me very well. Mrs.\r\nCosgrove is at home in Cumberland; I must ask her advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was done, and there resulted a scheme which seemed to excite Rhoda\r\nwith joyous anticipation. On the coast of Cumberland, a few miles south\r\nof St. Bees, is a little place called Seascale, unknown to the ordinary\r\ntourist, but with a good hotel and a few scattered houses where\r\nlodgings can be obtained. Not far away rise the mountain barriers of\r\nlake-land, Wastdale clearly discernible. At Seascale, then, Rhoda would\r\nspend her first week, the quiet shore with its fine stretch of sand\r\naffording her just the retreat that she desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are one or two bathing-machines, Mrs. Cosgrove says, but I hope\r\nto avoid such abominations. How delicious it was in one\xe2\x80\x99s childhood,\r\nwhen one ran into the sea naked! I will enjoy that sensation once more,\r\nif I have to get up at three in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout this time Barfoot made one of his evening calls. He had no hope\r\nof seeing Rhoda, and was agreeably surprised by her presence in the\r\ndrawing-room. Just as happened a year ago, the subject of Miss Barfoot\r\nmaking a direct inquiry. With lively interest, Mary waited for the\r\nreply, and was careful not to smile when Rhoda made known her\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you planned a route after your stay at Seascale?\xe2\x80\x9d Barfoot asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I shall do that when I am there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether or not he intended a contrast to these homely projects, Barfoot\r\npresently began to talk of travel on a grander scale. When he next left\r\nEngland, he should go by the Orient Express right away to\r\nConstantinople. His cousin asked questions about the Orient Express,\r\nand he supplied her with details very exciting to the imagination of\r\nany one who longs to see the kingdoms of the earth\xe2\x80\x94as undoubtedly\r\nRhoda did. The very name, Orient Express, has a certain sublimity, such\r\nas attaches, more or less, to all the familiar nomenclature of\r\nworld-transits. He talked himself into fervour, and kept a watch on\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s countenance. As also did Miss Barfoot. Rhoda tried to appear\r\nunaffected, but her coldness betrayed its insincerity.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when work at Great Portland Street was just finished, she\r\nfell into conversation with Mildred Vesper. Miss Barfoot had an\r\nengagement to dine out that evening, and Rhoda ended by inviting Milly\r\nto come home with her to Chelsea. To Milly this was a great honour; she\r\nhesitated because of her very plain dress, but easily allowed herself\r\nto be persuaded when she saw that Miss Nunn really desired her company.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner they had a walk in Battersea Park. Rhoda had never been\r\nso frank and friendly; she induced the quiet, unpretending girl to talk\r\nof her early days, her schools, her family. Remarkable was Milly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquiet contentedness; not long ago she had received an increase of\r\npayment from Miss Barfoot, and one would have judged that scarcely a\r\nwish now troubled her, unless it were that she might see her scattered\r\nbrothers and sisters, all of whom, happily, were doing pretty well in\r\nthe struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must feel rather lonely in your lodgings sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery rarely. In future I shall have music in the evening. Our best\r\nroom has been let to a young man who has a violin, and he plays \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nBlue Bells of Scotland\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda did not miss the humorous intention, veiled, as usual, under a\r\nmanner of extreme sedateness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Mrs. Widdowson come to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot often. She came a few days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go to her house sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been there for several months. At first I used to go rather\r\nfrequently, but\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a long way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this subject Rhoda returned after dinner, when they were cosily\r\nsettled in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Widdowson comes here now and then, and we are always very glad to\r\nsee her. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking she looks rather unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she does,\xe2\x80\x9d assented the other gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and I were both at her wedding. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very cheerful, was it? I\r\nhad a disagreeable sense of bad omens all the time. Do you think she is\r\nsorry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really afraid she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda observed the look that accompanied this admission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish girl! Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she stay with us, and keep her liberty? She\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have made any new friends. Has she spoken to you of\r\nany?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly of people she has met here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda yielded\xe2\x80\x94or seemed to yield\xe2\x80\x94to an impulse of frankness. Bending\r\nslightly forward, with an anxious expression, she said in confidential\r\ntones\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you help to put my mind at rest about Monica? You saw her a week\r\nago. Did she say anything, or give any sign, that might make one really\r\nuneasy on her account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a struggle in Milly before she answered. Rhoda added\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you had rather not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had rather tell you. She said a good many strange things, and I\r\n_have_ been uneasy about her. I wished I could speak to some one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange that I should feel urged to ask you about this,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRhoda, her eyes, peculiarly bright and keen, fixed on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor thing is very miserable, I am sure. Her husband seems to\r\nleave her entirely to herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilly looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica made quite the opposite complaint to me. She said that she was a\r\nprisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very odd. She certainly goes about a good deal and alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has very often talked to me\r\nabout a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to the same freedom as a man, and I always\r\nunderstood that Mr. Widdowson objected to her going anywhere without\r\nhim, except just to call here, or at my lodgings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she has any acquaintance that he dislikes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe direct answer was delayed, but it came at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some one. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told me who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn plain words, Mr. Widdowson thinks he has cause for jealousy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understand Monica to mean that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s face had grown very dark. She moved her hands nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t think she could deceive him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think that!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Vesper, with much earnestness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help fearing, after I saw her last, was that she\r\nmight almost be tempted to leave her husband. She spoke so much of\r\nfreedom\xe2\x80\x94and of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to release herself if she found her\r\nmarriage was a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so grateful to you for telling me all this. We must try to help\r\nher. Of course I will make no mention of you, Miss Vesper. Then you are\r\nreally under the impression that there\xe2\x80\x99s some one she\xe2\x80\x94prefers to her\r\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking there is,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted the other very solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas so sorry for her, and felt so powerless. She cried a little. All I\r\ncould do was to entreat her not to behave rashly. I thought her sister\r\nought to know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Madden is useless. Monica cannot look to her for advice or\r\nsupport.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation Rhoda passed a very unquiet night, and gloom\r\nappeared in her countenance for the next few days.\r\n\r\nShe wished to have a private interview with Monica, but doubted whether\r\nit would in any degree serve her purpose\xe2\x80\x94that of discovering whether\r\ncertain suspicions she entertained had actual ground. Confidence\r\nbetween her and Mrs. Widdowson had never existed, and in the present\r\nstate of things she could not hope to probe Monica\xe2\x80\x99s secret feelings.\r\nWhilst she still brooded over the difficulty there came a letter for\r\nher from Everard Barfoot. He wrote formally; it had occurred to him\r\nthat he might be of some slight service, in view of her approaching\r\nholiday, if he looked through the guide-books, and jotted down the\r\noutline of such a walking-tour as she had in mind. This he had done,\r\nand the results were written out on an enclosed sheet of paper. Rhoda\r\nallowed a day to intervene, then sent a reply. She thanked Mr. Barfoot\r\nsincerely for the trouble he had so kindly taken. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you limit me\r\nto ten miles a day. In such scenery of course one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurry on, but\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t help informing you that twenty miles wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t alarm me. I think\r\nit very likely that I shall follow your itinerary, after my week of\r\nbathing and idling. I leave on Monday week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot did not call again. Every evening she sat in expectation of his\r\ncoming. Twice Miss Barfoot was away until a late hour, and on those\r\noccasions, after dinner, Rhoda sat in complete idleness, her face\r\ndeclaring the troubled nature of her thoughts. On the Sunday before\r\nher departure she took a sudden resolve and went to call upon Monica at\r\nHerne Hill.\r\n\r\nMrs. Widdowson, she learnt from the servant, had left home about an\r\nhour since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Widdowson at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, he was. And Rhoda waited for some time in the drawing-room until\r\nhe made his appearance. Of late Widdowson had grown so careless in the\r\nmatter of toilet, that an unexpected visit obliged him to hurry through\r\na change of apparel before he could present himself. Looking upon him\r\nfor the first time for several months, Rhoda saw that misery was\r\nundermining the man\xe2\x80\x99s health. Words could not have declared his trouble\r\nmore plainly than the haggard features and stiff, depressed,\r\nself-conscious manner. He fixed his sunken eyes upon the visitor, and\r\nsmiled, as was plain, only for civility\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Rhoda did her best to\r\nseem at ease; she explained (standing, for he forgot to ask her to be\r\nseated) that she was going away on the morrow, and had hoped to see\r\nMrs. Widdowson, who, she was told, had not been very well of late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she is not in very good health,\xe2\x80\x9d said Widdowson vaguely. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\ngone this afternoon to Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I think you know her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLess encouragement to remain could not have been offered, but Rhoda\r\nconceived a hope of hearing something significant if she persevered in\r\nconversation. The awkwardness of doing so was indifferent to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you be leaving town shortly, Mr. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not quite sure\xe2\x80\x94But pray sit down, Miss Nunn. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen\r\nmy wife lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a chair, and rested his hands upon his knees, gazing at the\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s skirt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Widdowson hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been to see us for more than a month\xe2\x80\x94if I\r\nremember rightly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis look expressed both surprise and doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA month? But I thought\xe2\x80\x94I had an idea\xe2\x80\x94that she went only a few days\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the day time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Great Portland Street, I mean\xe2\x80\x94to hear a lecture, or something of\r\nthat kind, by Miss Barfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda kept silence for a moment. Then she replied hastily\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94very likely\xe2\x80\x94I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there that afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. That would explain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed relieved, but only for the instant; then his eyes glanced\r\nhither and thither, with painful restlessness. Rhoda observed him\r\nclosely. After fidgeting with his feet, he suddenly took a stiff\r\nposition, and said in a louder voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to leave London altogether. I have decided to take a\r\nhouse at my wife\xe2\x80\x99s native place, Clevedon. Her sisters will come and\r\nlive with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a recent decision, Mr. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought about it for some time. London doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit Monica\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. She will be much better in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think that very likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you say that you have noticed her changed looks, I shall lose no\r\ntime in getting away.\xe2\x80\x9d He made a great show of determined energy. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nfew weeks\xe2\x80\x94. We will go down to Clevedon at once and find a house. Yes,\r\nwe will go to-morrow, or the day after. Miss Madden, also, is very far\r\nfrom well. I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t delayed so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are doing very wisely, I think. I had meant to suggest something\r\nof this kind to Mrs. Widdowson. Perhaps, if I went at once to Mrs.\r\nCosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s, I might be fortunate enough to find her still there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might. Did I understand you to say that you go away to-morrow? For\r\nthree weeks. Ah, then we may be getting ready to remove when you come\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe change that had come over him was remarkable. He could not keep his\r\nseat, and began to pace the end of the room. Seeing no possibility of\r\nprolonging the talk for her own purposes, Rhoda accepted this\r\ndismissal, and with the briefest leave-taking went her way to Mrs.\r\nCosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nShe was deeply agitated. Monica had not attended that lecture of Miss\r\nBarfoot\xe2\x80\x99s, and so, it was evident, had purposely deceived her husband.\r\nTo what end? Where were those hours spent? Mildred Vesper\xe2\x80\x99s report\r\nsupplied grounds for sombre conjecture, and the incident at Sloane\r\nSquare Station, the recollection of Monica and Barfoot absorbed in\r\ntalk, seemed to have a possible significance which fired Rhoda with\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nHer arrival at Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s was too late. Monica had been there said\r\nthe hostess, but had left nearly half an hour ago.\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s instant desire was to go on to Bayswater, and somehow keep\r\nwatch near the flats where Barfoot lived. Monica might be there. Her\r\ncoming forth from the building might be detected.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty of the understanding, and, still more, a dread of\r\nbeing seen hovering about that quarter, checked her purpose as soon as\r\nit was formed. She returned home, and for an hour or two kept in\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Barfoot, when they at length met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappened? Nothing that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour imagination. I have been packing; perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s from stooping over\r\nthe trunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis by no means satisfied Mary, who felt that things mysterious were\r\ngoing on about her. But she could only wait, repeating to herself that\r\nthe grand _denouement_ decidedly was not far off.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock sounded the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s bell. If, as she thought likely,\r\nthe caller was Everard, Miss Barfoot decided that she would disregard\r\neverything but the dramatic pressure of the moment, and leave those two\r\nalone together for half an hour. Everard it was; he entered the\r\ndrawing-room with an unusual air of gaiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in the country all day,\xe2\x80\x9d were his first words; and he went\r\non to talk of trivial things\xe2\x80\x94the doings of a Cockney excursion party\r\nthat had come under his notice.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Mary made an excuse for absenting herself. When she\r\nwas gone, Rhoda looked steadily at Barfoot, and asked\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you really been out of town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou left this morning, and have only just returned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe averted her look. After examining her curiously, Everard came and\r\nstood before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask your leave to meet you somewhere during these next three\r\nweeks. At any point on your route. We could have a day\xe2\x80\x99s ramble\r\ntogether, and then\xe2\x80\x94say good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lake country is free to you, Mr. Barfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t miss you. You will leave Seascale to-morrow week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt present I think so. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t restrict myself by any agreement.\r\nHoliday must be a time of liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other\xe2\x80\x94she with a carelessness which was all but\r\ndefiance, he with a significant smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow week, then, perhaps we may meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda made no reply, beyond a movement of her eyebrows, as if to\r\nexpress indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t stay longer this evening. A pleasant journey to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands, and left the room. In the hall Miss Barfoot came to\r\nmeet him; they exchanged a few words, unimportant and without reference\r\nto what had passed between him and Rhoda. Nor did Rhoda speak of the\r\nmatter when joined by her friend. She retired early, having settled all\r\nthe arrangements for her departure by the ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock express from\r\nEuston next morning.\r\n\r\nHer luggage was to consist of one trunk and a wallet with a strap,\r\nwhich would serve the purposes of a man\xe2\x80\x99s knapsack. Save the\r\nindispensable umbrella, she carried no impeding trifles. A new costume,\r\nsuitable for shore and mountain, was packed away in the trunk; Miss\r\nBarfoot had judged of its effect, and was of opinion that it became the\r\nwearer admirably.\r\n\r\nBut Rhoda, having adjusted everything that she was going to take with\r\nher, still had an occupation which kept her up for several hours. From\r\na locked drawer she brought forth packets of letters, the storage of\r\nmany years, and out of these selected carefully perhaps a tithe, which\r\nshe bound together and deposited in a box; the remainder she burnt in\r\nthe empty fireplace. Moreover, she collected from about the room a\r\nnumber of little objects, ornaments and things of use, which also found\r\na place in the same big box. All her personal property which had any\r\nvalue for her, except books, was finally under lock and key, and in\r\nportable repositories. But still she kept moving, as if in search of\r\ntrifles that might have escaped her notice; silently, in her soft\r\nslippers, she strayed hither and thither, till the short summer night\r\nhad all but given place to dawn; and when at length weariness compelled\r\nher to go to bed, she was not able to sleep.\r\n\r\nNor did Mary Barfoot enjoy much sleep that night. She lay thinking, and\r\nforecasting strange possibilities.\r\n\r\nOn Monday evening, returned from Great Portland Street, the first thing\r\nshe did was to visit Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s chamber. The ashes of burnt paper had been\r\ncleared away, but a glance informed her of the needless and\r\nunprecedented care with which Miss Nunn had collected and packed most\r\nof the things that belonged to her. Again Mary had a troubled night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nHONOUR IN DIFFICULTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s, this Sunday afternoon, Monica had eyes and thoughts\r\nfor one person only. Her coming at all was practically an appointment\r\nto meet Bevis, whom she had seen twice since her visit to the flat. A\r\nday or two after that occasion, she received a call from the Bevis\r\ngirls, who told her of their brother\xe2\x80\x99s approaching departure for\r\nBordeaux, and thereupon she invited the trio to dine with her. A\r\nfortnight subsequently to the dinner she had a chance encounter with\r\nBevis in Oxford Street; constraint of business did not allow him to\r\nwalk beside her for more than a minute or two, but they spoke of Mrs.\r\nCosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s on the following Sunday, and there, accordingly, found each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nTremor of self-consciousness kept Monica in dread of being watched and\r\nsuspected. Few people were present to-day, and after exchanging formal\r\nwords with Bevis, she moved away to talk with the hostess. Not till\r\nhalf an hour had passed did she venture to obey the glances which her\r\nall but avowed lover cast towards her in conversation. He was so much\r\nat ease, so like what she had always known him, that Monica asked\r\nherself whether she had not mistaken the meaning of his homage. One\r\nmoment she hoped it might be so; the next, she longed for some sign of\r\npassionate devotion, and thought with anguish of the day, now so near,\r\nwhen he would be gone for ever. This, she ardently believed, was the\r\nman who should have been her husband. Him she could love with heart and\r\nsoul, could make his will her absolute law, could live on his smiles,\r\ncould devote herself to his interests. The independence she had been\r\nstruggling to assert ever since her marriage meant only freedom to\r\nlove. If she had understood herself as she now did, her life would\r\nnever have been thus cast into bondage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girls,\xe2\x80\x9d Bevis was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cleave on Thursday. The rest of the week\r\nI shall be alone. On Monday the furniture will be stowed away at the\r\nPantechnicon, and on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x94off I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA casual listener could have supposed that the prospect pleased him.\r\nMonica, with a fixed smile, looked at the other groups conversing in\r\nthe room; no one was paying any attention to her. In the same moment\r\nshe heard a murmur from her companion\xe2\x80\x99s lips; he was speaking still,\r\nbut in a voice only just audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on Friday afternoon about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer heart began to throb painfully, and she knew that a treacherous\r\ncolour had risen to her checks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo come\xe2\x80\x94once more\xe2\x80\x94for the last time. It shall be just as\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94just as before. An hour\xe2\x80\x99s talk, and we will say good-bye to\r\neach other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was powerless to breathe a word. Bevis, noticing that Mrs. Cosgrove\r\nhad thrown a look in their direction, suddenly laughed as if at some\r\njest between them, and resumed his lively strain of talk. Monica also\r\nlaughed. An interval of make-believe, and again the soft murmur fell\r\nupon her ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall expect you. I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me this one last kindness.\r\nSome day,\xe2\x80\x9d his voice was all but extinguished, \xe2\x80\x9csome day\xe2\x80\x94who knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDreadful hope struck through her. A stranger\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned their way,\r\nand again she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Friday, at four. I shall expect you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, looked for an instant about the room, then offered him her\r\nhand, uttering some commonplace word of leave-taking. Their eyes did\r\nnot meet. She went up to Mrs. Cosgrove, and as soon as possible left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nWiddowson met her as she crossed the threshold of home. His face told\r\nher that something extraordinary had happened, and she trembled before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack already?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a grim smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quick, and take\r\nyour things off, and come to the library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had discovered anything (the lie, for instance, that she told him\r\na month ago, or that more recent falsehood when she pretended, without\r\nserious reason, to have been at Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s lecture), he would not\r\nlook and speak thus. Hurrying, panting, she made a change of dress, and\r\nobeyed his summons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nunn has been here,\xe2\x80\x9d were his first words.\r\n\r\nShe turned pale as death. Of course he observed it; she was now\r\npreparing for anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wanted to see you because she is going away on Monday. What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. You spoke so strangely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I? And you _look_ very strangely. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you. Miss\r\nNunn says that everybody has noticed how ill you seem. It\xe2\x80\x99s time we did\r\nsomething. To-morrow morning we are going down into Somerset, to\r\nClevedon, to find a house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had given up that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether I had or not doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the determination to appear, and be, energetic, he spoke with a\r\nrough obstinacy, a doggedness that now and then became violence. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ndecided on it now. There\xe2\x80\x99s a train to Bristol at ten-twenty. You will\r\npack just a few things; we shan\xe2\x80\x99t be away for more than a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\xe2\x80\x94By Friday they might be back. Till now,\r\nin an anguish of uncertainty, Monica had made up her mind. She would\r\nkeep the appointment on Friday, come of it what might. If she could not\r\nbe back in time, she would write a letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you talking in this tone?\xe2\x80\x9d she said coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat tone? I am telling you what I have decided to do, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I\r\nshall easily find a house down there, no doubt. Knowing the place, you\r\nwill be able to suggest the likely localities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down, for strength was failing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d Widdowson went on, staring at her with inflamed\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are beginning to look like a ghost. Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an end of\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d He cackled in angry laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a day\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary delay!\r\nWrite to both your sisters this evening and tell them. I wish them both\r\nto come and live with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, won\xe2\x80\x99t you be glad? Won\xe2\x80\x99t it be better in every way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came so near that she felt his feverish breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you before,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cto do just as you liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about being kept a prisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe scarcely knew what words fell from her lips. Let him propose, let\r\nhim do what he liked; to her it was indifferent. She saw something\r\nbefore her\xe2\x80\x94something she durst not, even an hour ago, have steadily\r\ncontemplated; it drew her with the force of fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on living like this\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Monica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see!\xe2\x80\x9d He almost shouted in triumph, misled by the smile on her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that was needed was resolution on my part. I have been\r\nabsurdly weak, and weakness in the husband means unhappiness in the\r\nwife. From to-day you look to me for guidance. I am no tyrant, but I\r\nshall rule you for your own good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill she smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of our misery\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, darling? What misery! Good\r\nGod, how I have suffered! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you known it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known it too well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you will make up to me for it, Monica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain prompted by the irresistible force, she answered mechanically,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do the best for both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw himself on the ground beside her and clasped her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is my own dear wife once more! Your face has altogether\r\nchanged. See how right it is that a husband should take the law into\r\nhis own hands! Our second year of marriage shall be very different from\r\nthe first. And yet we _were_ happy, weren\xe2\x80\x99t we, my beautiful? It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthis cursed London that has come between us. At Clevedon we shall begin\r\nour life over again\xe2\x80\x94like we did at Guernsey. All our trouble, I am\r\nconvinced, has come of your ill-health. This air has never suited you;\r\nyou have felt miserable, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at peace in your home. Poor\r\nlittle girl! My poor darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the evening he was in a state of transport, due partly to the\r\nbelief that Monica really welcomed his decision, partly to the sense of\r\nhaving behaved at length like a resolute man. His eyes were severely\r\nbloodshot, and before bedtime headache racked him intolerably.\r\n\r\nEverything was carried out as he had planned it. They journeyed down\r\ninto Somerset, put up at a Clevedon hotel, and began house-hunting. On\r\nWednesday the suitable abode was discovered\xe2\x80\x94a house of modest\r\npretensions, but roomy and well situated. It could be made ready for\r\noccupation in a fortnight. Bent on continuing his exhibition of\r\nvigorous promptitude, Widdowson signed a lease that same evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow we will go straight home and make our preparations for\r\nremoval. When all is ready, you shall come down here and live at the\r\nhotel until the house is furnished. Go to your sister Virginia and\r\nsimply bid her do as you wish. Imitate me!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed fatuously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to any objection. When you have once got her away she\r\nwill thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy Thursday afternoon they were back at Herne Hill. Widdowson still\r\nkept up the show of extravagant spirits, but he was worn out. He spoke\r\nso hoarsely that one would have thought he had contracted a severe sore\r\nthroat; it resulted merely from nervous strain. After a pretence of\r\ndinner, he seated himself as if to read; glancing at him a few minutes\r\nlater, Monica found that he was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nShe could not bear to gaze at him, yet her eyes turned thither again\r\nand again. His face was repulsive to her; the deep furrows, the red\r\neyelids, the mottled skin moved her to loathing. And yet she pitied\r\nhim. His frantic exultation was the cruelest irony. What would he do?\r\nWhat would become of him? She turned away, and presently left the room,\r\nfor the sound of his uneasy breathing made her suffer too much.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke up, he came in search of her, and laughed over his\r\ninvoluntary nap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, you will go and see your sister to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the afternoon, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Don\xe2\x80\x99t let us have any procrastination. The morning, the morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do let me have my way in such a trifle as that,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica\r\nexclaimed nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cI have all sorts of things to see to here before\r\nI can go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caressed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t say that I am unreasonable. In the afternoon, then. And\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to any objections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was Friday. All the morning Widdowson had business with house agents\r\nand furniture removers, for he would not let a day go by without some\r\npractical step towards release from the life he detested. Monica seemed\r\nto be equally active in her own department; she was turning out drawers\r\nand wardrobes, and making selection of things\xe2\x80\x94on some principle\r\nunderstood by herself. A flush remained upon her cheeks, in marked\r\ncontrast to the pallor which for a long time had given her an\r\nappearance of wasting away. That and her singularly bright eyes endowed\r\nher with beauty suggestive of what she might have gained in happy\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThey had luncheon at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and at a quarter to two Monica started\r\nby train for Clapham Junction. It was her purpose to have a short\r\nconversation with Virginia, who knew of the trip to Clevedon, and to\r\nspeak as though she were quite reconciled to the thought of removal;\r\nafter that, she would pursue her journey so as to reach Bayswater by\r\nfour o\xe2\x80\x99clock. But Virginia was not at home. Mrs. Conisbee said she had\r\ngone out at eleven in the morning, and with the intention of returning\r\nby teatime. After a brief hesitation Monica requested the landlady to\r\ndeliver a message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease ask her not to come to Herne Hill until she hears from me, as I\r\nam not likely to be at home for a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis left more time at her disposal than she knew how to employ. She\r\nreturned to the railway station, and travelled on to Victoria; there,\r\nin the corner of a waiting-room, she sat, feverishly impatient, until\r\nher watch told her that she might take the next train westward.\r\n\r\nA possible danger was before her\xe2\x80\x94though perhaps she need not trouble\r\nherself with the thought of such dangers. What if Mr. Barfoot happened\r\nto encounter her as she ascended the stairs? But most likely he had no\r\nidea that her female friends, who dwelt on the floor above him, were\r\ngone away. Did it matter what he might think? In a day or two\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nShe came to the street, approached the block of flats, involuntarily\r\ncasting anxious glances about her. And when she was within twenty yards\r\nof the door, it opened, and forth came Barfoot. Her first sensation was\r\nunreasoning terror; her next, thankfulness that she had not been a few\r\nminutes sooner, when the very meeting she had feared, within the\r\nbuilding itself, would have come to pass. He walked this way; he saw\r\nher; and the pleasantest smile of recognition lit up his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Widdowson! Not a minute ago you were in my thoughts. I wished I\r\ncould see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going\xe2\x80\x94to make a call in this neighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not command herself. The shock had left her trembling, and\r\nthe necessity of feigning calmness was a new trial of her nerves.\r\nBarfoot, she felt certain, was reading her face like a printed page; he\r\nsaw guilt there; his quickly-averted eyes, his peculiar smile, seemed\r\nto express the facile tolerance of a man of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to accompany you to the end of the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words buzzed in her ears. She walked on without conscious effort,\r\nlike an automaton obedient to a touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that Miss Nunn has gone down into Cumberland?\xe2\x80\x9d Barfoot was\r\nsaying, his look bent upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to glance at him with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going there myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Cumberland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see her, I hope. Perhaps she will only be angry with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. But perhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer confusion would not be overcome. She felt a burning in her ears, on\r\nher neck. It was an agony of shame. The words she spoke sounded\r\nimbecile mutterings, which must confirm Barfoot in his worst opinion of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is all in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I shall say good-bye, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not\xe2\x80\x94I should think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUseless. She set her lips and became mute. If only he would leave her!\r\nAnd almost immediately he did so, with a few words of kind tone. She\r\nfelt the pressure of his hand, and saw him walk rapidly away; doubtless\r\nhe knew this was what she desired.\r\n\r\nUntil he had passed out of sight, Monica kept the same direction. Then\r\nshe turned round and hurried back, fearful lest the detention might\r\nmake her late, and Bevis might lose hope of her coming. There could be\r\nno one in the building now whom she need fear to meet. She opened the\r\nbig entrance door and went up.\r\n\r\nBevis must have been waiting for the sound of her light footstep; his\r\ndoor flew open before she could knock. Without speaking, a silent laugh\r\nof joy upon his lips, he drew back to make room for her entrance, and\r\nthen pressed both her hands.\r\n\r\nIn the sitting-room were beginnings of disorder. Pictures had been\r\ntaken down from the walls and light ornaments removed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep here after to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d Bevis began, his agitation\r\nscarcely less obvious than Monica\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow I shall be packing what\r\nis to go with me. How I hate it all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica dropped into a chair near the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not there!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, where you sat before. We are\r\ngoing to have tea together again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis utterances were forced, and the laugh that came between them\r\nbetrayed the quivering of his nerves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what you have been doing. I have thought of you day and night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe brought a chair close to her, and when he had seated himself he took\r\none of her hands. Monica, scarcely repressing a sob, the result of\r\nreaction from her fears and miseries, drew the hand away. But again he\r\ntook it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the glove on it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a shaking voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat harm in my\r\nholding your glove? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it, and talk to me. I love music,\r\nbut no music is like your voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go on Monday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was her lips spoke the sentence, not she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x94I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Widdowson is going to take me away from London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told him the circumstances. Bevis kept his eyes upon her face, with\r\na look of rapt adoration which turned at length to pain and woeful\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been married a year,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I had met you\r\nbefore that! What a cruel fate that we should know each other only when\r\nthere was no hope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man revealed himself in this dolorous sentimentality. His wonted\r\nblitheness and facetiousness, his healthy features, his supple,\r\nwell-built frame, suggested that when love awoke within him he would\r\nexpress it with virile force. But he trembled and blushed like a young\r\ngirl, and his accents fell at last into a melodious whining.\r\n\r\nHe raised the gloved fingers to his lips. Monica bent her face away,\r\ndeadly pale, with closed eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we to part to-day, and never again see each other?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that you love me! Only say that you love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou despise me for coming to you like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDespise you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a sudden rapture he folded his arms about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that you love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed away the last syllable of her whispered reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica!\xe2\x80\x94what is there before us? How can I leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYielding herself for the moment in a faintness that threatened to\r\nsubdue her, she was yet able, when his caresses grew wild with passion,\r\nto put back his arms and move suddenly away. He sprang up, and they\r\nstood speechless. Again he drew near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me away with you!\xe2\x80\x9d Monica then cried, clasping her hands\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t live with _him_. Let me go with you to France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBevis\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes widened with consternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare you\xe2\x80\x94dare you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare I? What courage is needed? How _dare_ I remain with a man I hate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must leave him. Of course you must leave him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, before another day has passed!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is wrong even\r\nto go back to-day. I love you, and in that there is nothing to be\r\nashamed of; but what bitter shame to be living with _him_, practising\r\nhypocrisy. He makes me hate myself as much as I hate _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he behaved brutally to you, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to accuse him of, except that he persuaded me to marry\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94made me think that I could love him when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what love\r\nmeant. And now he wishes to get me away from all the people I know\r\nbecause he is jealous of every one. And how can I blame him? Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\ncause for jealousy? I am deceiving him\xe2\x80\x94I have deceived him for a long\r\ntime, pretending to be a faithful wife when I have often wished that he\r\nmight die and release me. It is I who am to blame. I ought to have left\r\nhim. Every woman who thinks of her husband as I do ought to go away\r\nfrom him. It is base and wicked to stay there\xe2\x80\x94pretending\xe2\x80\x94deceiving\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBevis came towards her and took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love me?\xe2\x80\x9d she panted under his hot kisses. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will take me away\r\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you shall come. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t travel together, but you shall\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94when I am settled there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t I go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own darling, think what it would mean if our secret were\r\ndiscovered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscovered? But how can we think of that? How can I go back there,\r\nwith your kisses on my lips? Oh, I must live somewhere in secret until\r\nyou go, and then\xe2\x80\x94I have put aside the few things that I want to take.\r\nI could never have continued to live with him even if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said\r\nyou love me. I was obliged to pretend that I agreed to everything, but\r\nI will beg and starve rather than bear that misery any longer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou love me enough to face whatever may happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you with all my soul, Monica! Sit down again, dearest; let us\r\ntalk about it, and see what we can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe half led, half carried, her to a couch, and there, holding her\r\nembraced, gave way to such amorous frenzy that again Monica broke from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you love me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in tones of bitter distress, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\nrespect me as much as before I came to you. Help me\xe2\x80\x94I am suffering so\r\ndreadfully. Say at once that I shall go away with you, even if we\r\ntravel as strangers. If you are afraid of it becoming known I will do\r\neverything to prevent it. I will go back and live there until Tuesday,\r\nand come away only at the last hour, so that no one will ever suspect\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how humbly I live when we are abroad. I can have\r\nlodgings somewhere in the same town, or near, and you will come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hair disordered, his eyes wild, quivering throughout with\r\nexcitement, he stood as if pondering possibilities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I be a burden to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a faint voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the\r\nexpense more than you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no! How can you think of such a thing? But it would be so much\r\nbetter if you could wait here until I\xe2\x80\x94Oh, what a wretched thing to\r\nhave to seem so cowardly to you! But the difficulties are so great,\r\ndarling. I shall be a perfect stranger in Bordeaux. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even speak\r\nthe language at all well. When I reach there I shall be met at the\r\nstation by one of our people, and\xe2\x80\x94just think, how could we manage? You\r\nknow, if it were discovered that I had run away with you, it would\r\ndamage my position terribly. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say what might happen. My darling,\r\nwe shall have to be very careful. In a few weeks it might all be\r\nmanaged very easily. I would write to you, to some address, and as soon\r\nas ever I had made arrangements\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica broke down. The unmanliness of his tone was so dreadful a\r\ndisillusion. She had expected something so entirely different\xe2\x80\x94swift,\r\nvirile passion, eagerness even to anticipate her desire of flight, a\r\nstrength, a courage to which she could abandon herself, body and soul.\r\nShe broke down utterly, and wept with her hands upon her face.\r\n\r\nBevis, in sympathetic distraction, threw himself on his knees before her,\r\nclutching at her waist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear that! I will do as you wish,\r\nMonica. Tell me some place where I can write to you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\r\ndarling\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the couch again, and rested her face against the back,\r\nsobbing. For a time they exchanged mere incoherences. Then passion\r\nseized upon both, and they clung together, mute, motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow I shall leave him,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Monica, when at length their\r\neyes met. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be away in the morning, and I can take what I need.\r\nTell me where I shall go to, dear\xe2\x80\x94to wait until you are ready. No one\r\nwill ever suspect that we have gone together. He knows I am miserable\r\nwith him; he will believe that I have found some way of supporting\r\nmyself in London. Where shall I live till Tuesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBevis scarcely listened to her words. The temptation of the natural\r\nman, basely selfish, was strengthening its hold upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me? Do you really love me?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied to her, with thick,\r\nagitated utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you ask that? How can you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really love me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face and tones frightened her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make me doubt _your_ love! If I have not perfect trust in you\r\nwhat will become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet once more she drew resolutely away from him. He pursued, and held\r\nher arms with violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am mistaken in you!\xe2\x80\x9d Monica cried in fear and bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what love means, as _I_ feel it. You won\xe2\x80\x99t speak, you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink, of our future life together\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have promised\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave loose of me! It\xe2\x80\x99s because I have come here. You think me a\r\nworthless woman, without sense of honour, with no self-respect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe protested vehemently. The anguished look in her eyes had its effect\r\nupon his senses; by degrees it subjugated him, and made him ashamed of\r\nhis ignoble impulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I find a lodging for you till Tuesday?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, after moving\r\naway and returning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure you can leave home to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94without being suspected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am sure I can. He is going to the City in the morning. Appoint\r\nsome place where I can meet you. I will come in a cab, and then you can\r\ntake me on to the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are forgetting the risks. If you take a cab from Herne Hill,\r\nwith your luggage, he will be able to find out the driver afterwards,\r\nand learn where you went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will drive only as far as the station, and come to Victoria,\r\nand you shall meet me there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe necessity of these paltry arrangements filled her soul with shame.\r\nOn the details of her escape she had hardly reflected. All such\r\nconsiderations were, she deemed, naturally the care of her lover, who\r\nwould act with promptitude, and so as to spare her a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperplexity. She had imagined everything in readiness within a few\r\nhours; on _her_ no responsibility save that of breaking the hated bond.\r\nInevitably she turned to the wretched thought that Bevis regarded her\r\nas a burden. Yes, he had already his mother and his sisters to support;\r\nshe ought to have remembered that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time would it be?\xe2\x80\x9d he was asking.\r\n\r\nUnable to reply, she pursued her reflections. She had money, but how to\r\nobtain possession of it? Afterwards, when her flight was accomplished,\r\nsecrecy, it appeared, would be no less needful than now. That necessity\r\nhad never occurred to her; declaration of the love that had freed her\r\nseemed inevitable\xe2\x80\x94nay, desirable. Her self-respect demanded it; only\r\nthus could she justify herself before his sisters and other people who\r\nknew her. _They_, perhaps, would not see it in the light of\r\njustification, but that mattered little; her own conscience would\r\napprove what she had done. But to steal away, and live henceforth in\r\nhiding, like a woman dishonoured even in her own eyes\xe2\x80\x94from that she\r\nshrank with repugnance. Rather than that, would it not be preferable to\r\nbreak with her husband, and openly live apart from him, alone?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe honest with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHad you rather I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, if that is true, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you the courage to let every one\r\nknow it? In your heart you must think that we are acting wrongly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t! I believe, as you do, that love is the only true marriage.\r\nVery well!\xe2\x80\x9d He made a desperate gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us defy all consequences.\r\nFor your sake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis exaggerated vehemence could not deceive Monica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you most fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to babble protestations, but she would not listen to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94I have every right to ask\xe2\x80\x94what you most fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear nothing if _you_ are with me. Let my relatives say and think\r\nwhat they like. I have made great sacrifices for them; to give up _you_\r\nwould be too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet his distress was evident. It strained the corners of his mouth,\r\nwrinkled his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe disgrace would be more than you could bear. You would never see\r\nyour mother and your sisters again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they are so prejudiced, so unreasonable, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. They\r\nmust\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a loud rat-tat at the outer door. Blanched\r\nherself, Monica saw that her lover\xe2\x80\x99s face turned to ghastly pallor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect no one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeed you answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be\xe2\x80\x94? Have you been followed? Does any one suspect\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other, still half-paralysed, and stood waiting thus\r\nuntil the knock was repeated impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daren\xe2\x80\x99t open,\xe2\x80\x9d Bevis whispered, coming close to her, as if on the\r\nimpulse of seeking protection\xe2\x80\x94for to offer it was assuredly not in his\r\nmind. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! That\xe2\x80\x99s impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daren\xe2\x80\x99t go to the door. The risk is too frightful. He will go away,\r\nwhoever it is, if no one answers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth were shaking in the second stage of terror. Bevis put his arm\r\nabout Monica, and felt her heart give great throbs against his own.\r\nTheir passion for the moment was effectually quenched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen! That\xe2\x80\x99s the clink of the letter-box. A card or something has\r\nbeen put in. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped to the door of the room, opened it without sound, and at\r\nonce heard footsteps descending the stairs. In the look which he cast\r\nback at her, a grin rather than a smile, Monica saw something that gave\r\nher a pang of shame on his behalf. On going to the letter-box he found\r\na card, with a few words scribbled upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one of our partners!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed gleefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWants to see me\r\nto-night. Of course he took it for granted I was out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica was looking at her watch. Past five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I must go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are our arrangements? Do you still intend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntend? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it for you to decide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a coldness in the words of both, partly the result of the\r\ngreat shock they had undergone, in part due to their impatience with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling\xe2\x80\x94do what I proposed at first. Stay for a few days, until I am\r\nsettled at Bordeaux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay with my\xe2\x80\x94my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe used the word purposely, significantly, to see how it would affect\r\nhim. The bitterness of her growing disillusion allowed her to think and\r\nspeak as if no ardent feeling were concerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor both our sakes, dearest, dearest love! A few days longer, until I\r\nhave written to you, and told you exactly what to do. The journey won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe very difficult for you; and think how much better, dear Monica, if\r\nwe can escape discovery, and live for each other without any shame or\r\nfear to disturb us. You will be my own dear true wife. I will love and\r\nguard you as long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe embraced her with placid tenderness, laying his cheek against hers,\r\nkissing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must see each other again,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on Sunday, will\r\nyou? And in the meantime find out some place where I could address\r\nletters to you. You can always find a stationer\xe2\x80\x99s shop where they will\r\nreceive letters. Be guided by me, dear little girl. Only a week or\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x94to save the happiness of our whole lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica listened, but with half-attention, her look fixed on the floor.\r\nEncouraged by her silence, the lover went on in a strain of heightening\r\nenthusiasm, depicting the raptures of their retirement from the world\r\nin some suburb of Bordeaux. How this retreat was to escape the notice\r\nof his business companions, through whom the scandal might get wind, he\r\ndid not suggest. The truth was, Bevis found himself in an extremely\r\nawkward position, with issues he had not contemplated, and all he cared\r\nfor was to avert the immediate peril of public discovery. The\r\neasy-going, kindly fellow had never considered all the responsibility\r\ninvolved in making mild love\xe2\x80\x94timorously selfish from the first\xe2\x80\x94to a\r\nmarried woman who took his advances with desperate seriousness. He had\r\nnot in him the stuff of vigorous rascality, still less the only other\r\nquality which can support a man in such a situation as this\xe2\x80\x94heroism of\r\nmoral revolt. So he cut a very poor figure, and was dolefully aware of\r\nit. He talked, talked; trying to disguise his feebleness in tinsel\r\nphrases; and Monica still kept her eyes cast down.\r\n\r\nWhen another half-hour had passed, she sighed deeply and rose from her\r\nseat. She would write to him, she said, and let him know where a reply\r\nwould reach her. No, she must not come here again; all he had to tell\r\nher would be communicated by letter. The subdued tone, the simple\r\nsadness of her words, distressed Bevis, and yet he secretly\r\ncongratulated himself. He had done nothing for which this woman could\r\njustly reproach him; marvellous\xe2\x80\x94so he considered\xe2\x80\x94had been his\r\nself-restraint; absolutely, he had behaved \xe2\x80\x9clike a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d To be\r\nsure, he was miserably in love, and, if circumstances by any means\r\nallowed of it, would send for Monica to join him in France. Should the\r\nthing prove impossible, he had nothing whatever on his conscience.\r\n\r\nHe held out his arms to her. Monica shook her head and looked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay once more that you love me, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not\r\nrest for an hour until I am able to write and say, \xe2\x80\x9cCome to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe permitted him to hold her once more in his soft embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me, Monica!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her lips to his cheek, and withdrew them, still shunning his\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not that kind of kiss. Like you kissed me before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with choking voice, the tears again starting\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what have I done that you should love me less, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed the falling drops, murmuring assurances, encouragements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t leave me until I have heard you say that your love is\r\nunchanged. Whisper it to me, sweetest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we meet again\xe2\x80\x94not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou frighten me. Monica, we are not saying good-bye for ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you send for me I _will_ come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promise faithfully? You will come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you send for me I will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was her last word. He opened the door for her, and listened as she\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nIN AMBUSH\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto, Widdowson had entertained no grave mistrust of his wife. The\r\nprinciples she had avowed, directly traceable as it seemed to her\r\nfriendship with the militant women in Chelsea, he disliked and feared;\r\nbut her conduct he fully believed to be above reproach. His jealousy\r\nof Barfoot did not glance at Monica\xe2\x80\x99s attitude towards the man; merely\r\nat the man himself, whom he credited with native scoundreldom. Barfoot\r\nrepresented to his mind a type of licentious bachelor; why, he could\r\nnot have made perfectly clear to his own understanding. Possibly the\r\nease of Everard\xe2\x80\x99s bearing, the something aristocratic in his\r\ncountenance and his speech, the polish of his manner, especially in\r\nformal converse with women, from the first gave offence to Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nessentially middle-class sensibilities. If Monica were in danger at\r\nall, it was, he felt convinced, from that quarter. The subject of his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s intimate dialogue with Barfoot at the Academy still remained a\r\nmystery to him. He put faith in her rebellious declaration that every\r\nword might have been safely repeated in his hearing, but, be the matter\r\nwhat it might, the manner of Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s talk meant evil. Of that\r\nconviction he could not get rid.\r\n\r\nHe had read somewhere that a persistently jealous husband may not\r\nimprobably end by irritating an innocent wife into affording real\r\nground for jealousy. A man with small knowledge of the world is much\r\nimpressed by dicta such as these; they get into the crannies of his\r\nmind, and thence direct the course of his thinking. Widdowson, before\r\nhis marriage, had never suspected the difficulty of understanding a\r\nwoman; had he spoken his serious belief on that subject, it would have\r\nbeen found to represent the most primitive male conception of the\r\nfeminine being. Women were very like children; it was rather a task to\r\namuse them and to keep them out of mischief. Therefore the blessedness\r\nof household toil, in especial the blessedness of child-bearing and all\r\nthat followed. Intimacy with Monica had greatly affected his views, yet\r\nchiefly by disturbing them; no firmer ground offered itself to his\r\ntreading when he perforce admitted that his former standpoint was\r\nevery day assailed by some incontestable piece of evidence. Woman had\r\nindividual characters; that discovery, though not a very profound one,\r\nimpressed him with the force of something arrived at by independent\r\nobservation. Monica often puzzled him gravely; he could not find the\r\nkey to her satisfactions and discontents. To regard her simply as a\r\nhuman being was beyond the reach of his intelligence. He cast the blame\r\nof his difficulties upon sex, and paid more attention to the hints on\r\nsuch topics afforded him by his reading. He would endeavour to keep his\r\njealousy out of sight, lest the mysterious tendency of the female\r\nnature might prompt Monica to deliberate wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nTo-day for the first time there flashed across him the thought that\r\nalready he might have been deceived. It originated in a peculiarity of\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour at luncheon. She ate scarcely anything; she seemed\r\nhurried, frequently glancing at the clock; and she lost herself in\r\nreverie. Discovering that his eye was upon her, she betrayed\r\nuneasiness, and began to talk without considering what she meant to\r\nsay. All this might mean nothing more than her barely-concealed regret\r\nat being obliged to leave London; but Widdowson remarked it with a\r\nvivacity of feeling perhaps due to the excitement in which he had lived\r\nfor the past week. Perhaps the activity, the resolution to which he had\r\nurged himself, caused a sharpening of his perceptions. And the very\r\nthought, never out of his mind, that only a few days had to elapse\r\nbefore he carried off his wife from the scene of peril, tended to make\r\nhim more vividly conscious of that peril. Certain it was that a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s clairvoyance assailed his peace, and left behind it all manner\r\nof ugly conjectures. Women\xe2\x80\x94so said the books\xe2\x80\x94are adepts at\r\ndissimulation. Was it conceivable that Monica had taken advantage of\r\nthe liberty he had of late allowed her? If a woman could not endure a\r\ndirect, searching gaze, must it not imply some enormous\r\nwickedness?\xe2\x80\x94seeing that nature has armed them for this very trial.\r\n\r\nIn her setting forth for the railway station hurry was again evident,\r\nand disinclination to exchange parting words. If the eagerness were\r\nsimple and honest, would she not have accepted his suggestion and have\r\ngone in the morning?\r\n\r\nFor five minutes after her departure he stood in the hall, staring\r\nbefore him. A new jealousy, a horrible constriction of the heart, had\r\nbegun to torture him. He went and walked about in the library, but\r\ncould not dispel his suffering. Vain to keep repeating that Monica was\r\nincapable of baseness. Of that he was persuaded, but none the less a\r\nhideous image returned upon his mental vision\xe2\x80\x94a horror\xe2\x80\x94a pollution of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nOne thing he could do to restore his sanity. He would walk over to\r\nLavender Hill, and accompany his wife on her return home. Indeed, the\r\nmere difficulty of getting through the afternoon advised this project.\r\nHe could not employ himself, and knew that his imagination, once\r\ninflamed, would leave him not a moment\xe2\x80\x99s rest. Yes, he would walk to\r\nLavender Hill, and ramble about that region until Monica had had\r\nreasonable time for talk with her sister.\r\n\r\nAbout three o\xe2\x80\x99clock there fell a heavy shower of rain. Strangely\r\nagainst his habits, Widdowson turned into a quiet public-house, and sat\r\nfor a quarter of an hour at the bar, drinking a glass of whisky. During\r\nthe past week he had taken considerably more wine than usual at meals;\r\nhe seemed to need the support. Whilst sipping at his glass of spirits,\r\nhe oddly enough fell into talk with the barmaid, a young woman of some\r\ncharms, and what appeared to be unaffected modesty. Not for twenty\r\nyears had Widdowson conversed with a member of this sisterhood. Their\r\ndialogue was made up of the most trifling of trivialities\xe2\x80\x94weather, a\r\nrailway accident, the desirability of holidays at this season. And when\r\nat length he rose and put an end to the chat it was with appreciable\r\nreluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good, nice sort of girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he went away saying to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cPity she\r\nshould be serving at a bar\xe2\x80\x94hearing doubtful talk, and seeing very\r\noften vile sights. A nice, soft-spoken little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he mused upon her remembered face with a complacency which soothed\r\nhis feelings.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden he was checked by the conversion of his sentiment into\r\nthought. Would he not have been a much happier man if he had married a\r\ngirl distinctly his inferior in mind and station? Provided she were\r\nsweet, lovable, docile\xe2\x80\x94such a wife would have spared him all the\r\nmisery he had known with Monica. From the first he had understood that\r\nMonica was no representative shop-girl, and on that very account he had\r\nstriven so eagerly to win her. But it was a mistake. He had loved her,\r\nstill loved her, with all the emotion of which he was capable. How many\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 genuine happiness of soul had that love afforded him? The\r\nminutest fraction of the twelve months for which she had been his wife.\r\nAnd of suffering, often amounting to frantic misery, he could count\r\nmany weeks. Could such a marriage as this be judged a marriage at all,\r\nin any true sense of the word?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask myself a question. If Monica were absolutely free to choose\r\nbetween continuing to live with me and resuming her perfect liberty,\r\ncan I persuade myself that she would remain my wife? She would not. Not\r\nfor a day, not for an hour. Of that I am morally convinced. And I\r\nacknowledge the grounds of her dissatisfaction. We are unsuited to each\r\nother. We do not understand each other. Our marriage is physical and\r\nnothing more. My love\xe2\x80\x94what is my love? I do not love her mind, her\r\nintellectual part. If I did, this frightful jealousy from which I\r\nsuffer would be impossible. My ideal of the wife perfectly suited to me\r\nis far liker that girl at the public-house bar than Monica. Monica\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindependence of thought is a perpetual irritation to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat her thoughts really are, what her intellectual life signifies. And\r\nyet I hold her to me with the sternest grasp. If she endeavoured to\r\nrelease herself I should feel capable of killing her. Is not this a\r\nstrange, a brutal thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson had never before reached this height of speculation. In the\r\nmoment, by the very fact, of admitting that Monica and he ought not to\r\nbe living together, he became more worthy of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s companionship\r\nthan ever hitherto.\r\n\r\nWell, he would exercise greater forbearance. He would endeavour to win\r\nher respect by respecting the freedom she claimed. His recent\r\nsuspicions of her were monstrous. If she knew them, how her soul would\r\nrevolt from him! What if she took an interest in other men, perchance\r\nmore her equals than he? Why, had he not just been thinking of another\r\nwoman, reflecting that she, or one like her, would have made him a more\r\nsuitable wife than Monica? Yet this could not reasonably be called\r\nunfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nThey were bound together for life, and their wisdom lay in mutual\r\ntoleration, the constant endeavour to understand each other aright\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nin fierce restraint of each other\xe2\x80\x99s mental liberty. How many marriages\r\nwere anything more than mutual forbearance? Perhaps there ought not to\r\nbe such a thing as enforced permanence of marriage. This was daring\r\nspeculation; he could not have endured to hear it from Monica\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, some day, marriage would be dissoluble at the will of\r\neither party to it. Perhaps the man who sought to hold a woman when she\r\nno longer loved him would be regarded with contempt and condemnation.\r\n\r\nWhat a simple thing marriage had always seemed to him, and how far from\r\nsimple he had found it! Why, it led him to musings which overset the\r\norder of the world, and flung all ideas of religion and morality into\r\nwildest confusion. It would not do to think like this. He was a man\r\nwedded to a woman very difficult to manage\xe2\x80\x94there was the practical\r\nupshot of the matter. His duty was to manage her. He was responsible\r\nfor her right conduct. With intentions perfectly harmless, she might\r\nrun into unknown jeopardy\xe2\x80\x94above all, just at this time when she was\r\ntaking reluctant leave of her friends. The danger justified him in\r\nexceptional vigilance.\r\n\r\nSo, from his excursion into the realms of reason did he return to the\r\nsafe sphere of the commonplace. And now he might venture to press on\r\ntowards Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s house, for it was half-past four, and already\r\nMonica must have been talking with her sister for a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nHis knock at the door was answered by the landlady herself. She told of\r\nMrs. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s arrival and departure. Ah, then Monica had no doubt\r\ngone straight home again. But, as Miss Madden had returned, he would\r\nspeak with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor lady isn\xe2\x80\x99t very well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Conisbee, fingering the\r\nhem of her apron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very well? But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I see her for a moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia answered this question by appearing on the staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one for me, Mrs. Conisbee?\xe2\x80\x9d she called from above. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it\r\n_you_, Edmund? So very glad! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs. Conisbee will have the\r\nkindness to let you come into her sitting-room. What a pity I was away\r\nwhen Monica called! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\xe2\x80\x94business to see to in town; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwalked and walked, until I\xe2\x80\x99m really\xe2\x80\x94hardly able\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sank upon a chair in the room, and looked fixedly at the visitor\r\nwith a broad, benevolent smile, her head moving up and down. Widdowson\r\nwas for a moment in perplexity. If the evidence of his eyes could be\r\ntrusted, Miss Madden\xe2\x80\x99s indisposition pointed to a cause so strange that\r\nit seemed incredible. He turned to look for Mrs. Conisbee, but the\r\nlandlady had hurriedly withdrawn, closing the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so foolish of me, Edmund,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia rambled on, addressing him\r\nwith a familiarity she had never yet used. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am away from home I\r\nforget all about my meals\xe2\x80\x94really forget\xe2\x80\x94and then all at once I find\r\nthat I am quite exhausted\xe2\x80\x94quite exhausted\xe2\x80\x94as you see. And the worst\r\nof it is I have altogether lost my appetite by the time I get back. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat a mouthful of food\xe2\x80\x94not a mouthful\xe2\x80\x94I assure you I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it does so distress good Mrs. Conisbee. She is\r\nexceedingly kind to me\xe2\x80\x94exceedingly careful about my health. Oh, and in\r\nBattersea Park Road I saw such a shocking sight; a great cart ran over\r\na poor little dog, and it was killed on the spot. It unnerved me\r\ndreadfully. I do think, Edmund, those drivers ought to be more careful.\r\nI was saying to Mrs. Conisbee only the other day\xe2\x80\x94and that reminds me,\r\nI do so want to know all about your visit to Clevedon. Dear, dear\r\nClevedon! And have you really taken a house there, Edmund? Oh, if we\r\ncould all end our days at Clevedon! You know that our dear father and\r\nmother are buried in the old churchyard. You remember Tennyson\xe2\x80\x99s lines\r\nabout the old church at Clevedon? Oh, and what did Monica decide\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x94about\xe2\x80\x94really, what _was_ I going to ask? It is so foolish of me\r\nto forget that dinner-time has come and gone. I get so exhausted, and\r\neven my memory fails me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could doubt no longer. This poor woman had yielded to one of the\r\ntemptations that beset a life of idleness and solitude. His pity was\r\nmingled with disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wished to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we have taken a\r\nhouse at Clevedon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really _have_!\xe2\x80\x9d She clasped her hands together. \xe2\x80\x9cWhereabouts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear Dial Hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia began a rhapsody which her brother-in-law had no inclination\r\nto hear. He rose abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you had better come and see us to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Monica left a message that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at home for the next\r\nfew days, and that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to come till I heard from her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at home\xe2\x80\x94? I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, impossible! We\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Mrs. Conisbee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the door and called. From the landlady Widdowson learnt\r\nexactly what Monica had said. He reflected for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe shall write to you then. Don\xe2\x80\x99t come just yet. I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t stay any\r\nlonger now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with a mere pretence of shaking hands he abruptly left the house.\r\n\r\nSuspicions thickened about him. He would have thought it utterly\r\nimpossible for Miss Madden to disgrace herself in this vulgar way, and\r\nthe appalling discovery affected his view of Monica. They were sisters;\r\nthey had characteristics in common, family traits, weaknesses. If the\r\nelder woman could fall into this degradation, might there not be\r\npossibilities in Monica\xe2\x80\x99s character such as he had refused to\r\ncontemplate? Was there not terrible reason for mistrusting her? What\r\ndid she mean by her message to Virginia?\r\n\r\nBlack and haggard, he went home as fast as a hansom could take him. It\r\nwas half-past five when he reached the house. His wife was not here,\r\nand had not been here.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Monica was starting by train from Bayswater, after her\r\nparting with Bevis. Arrived at Victoria, she crossed to the main\r\nstation, and went to the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 waiting-room for the purpose of\r\nbathing her face. She had red, swollen eyes, and her hair was in slight\r\ndisorder. This done, she inquired as to the next train for Herne Hill.\r\nOne had just gone; another would leave in about a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nA dreadful indecision was harassing her. Ought she, did she dare, to\r\nreturn home at all? Even if her strength sufficed for simulating a\r\nnatural manner, could she consent to play so base a part?\r\n\r\nThere was but one possible alternative. She might go to Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodgings, and there remain, writing to her husband that she had left\r\nhim. The true cause need not be confessed. She would merely declare\r\nthat life with him had become intolerable to her, that she demanded a\r\nrelease. Their approaching removal to Clevedon offered the occasion.\r\nShe would say that her endurance failed before that prospect of\r\nsolitude, and that, feeling as she did, it was dishonourable to make\r\nlonger pretence of doing her duty as a wife. Then, if Bevis wrote to\r\nher in such a way as to revive her love, if he seriously told her to\r\ncome to him, all difficulties could be solved by her disappearance.\r\n\r\nWas such revival of disheartened love a likely or a possible thing? At\r\nthis moment she felt that to flee in secret, and live with Bevis as he\r\nproposed, would be no less dishonour than abiding with the man who had\r\na legal claim upon her companionship. Her lover, as she had thought of\r\nhim for the past two or three months, was only a figment of her\r\nimagination; Bevis had proved himself a complete stranger to her mind;\r\nshe must reshape her knowledge of him. His face was all that she could\r\nstill dwell upon with the old desire; nay, even that had suffered a\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nInsensibly the minutes went by. Whilst she sat in the waiting-room her\r\ntrain started; and when she had become aware of that, her irresolution\r\ngrew more tormenting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came upon her a feeling of illness, of nausea.\r\nPerspiration broke out on her forehead; her eyes dazzled; she had to\r\nlet her head fall back. It passed, but in a minute or two the fit again\r\nseized her, and with a moan she lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nTwo or three women who were in the room rendered assistance. The\r\nremarks they exchanged, though expressing uncertainty and discreetly\r\nambiguous, would have been significant to Monica. On her recovery,\r\nwhich took place in a few moments, she at once started up, and with\r\nhurried thanks to those about her, listening to nothing that was said\r\nand answering no inquiry, went out on to the platform. There was just\r\ntime to catch the train now departing for Herne Hill.\r\n\r\nShe explained her fainting fit by the hours of agitation through which\r\nshe had passed. There was no room for surprise. She had suffered\r\nindescribably, and still suffered. Her wish was to get back into the\r\nquietness of home, to rest and to lose herself in sleep.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOn entering, she saw nothing of her husband. His hat hung on the\r\nhall-tree, and he was perhaps sitting in the library; the more genial\r\ntemper would account for his not coming forth at once to meet her, as\r\nhad been his custom when she returned from an absence alone.\r\n\r\nShe changed her dress, and disguised as far as was possible the traces\r\nof suffering on her features. Weakness and tremor urged her to lie\r\ndown, but she could not venture to do this until she had spoken to her\r\nhusband. Supporting herself by the banisters, she slowly descended, and\r\nopened the library door. Widdowson was reading a newspaper. He did not\r\nlook round, but said carelessly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect me sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw a rapid glance at her over his shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a long talk with Virginia, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson seemed to be much interested in some paragraph. He put his\r\nface closer to the paper, and was silent for two or three seconds. Then\r\nhe again looked round, this time observing his wife steadily, but with\r\na face that gave no intimation of unusual thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she consent to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica replied that it was still uncertain; she thought, however, that\r\nVirginia\xe2\x80\x99s objections would be overcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very tired,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon she withdrew, unable to command her countenance, scarce\r\nable to remain standing for another moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTRACKED\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Widdowson went up to the bedroom that night, Monica was already\r\nasleep. He discovered this on turning up the gas. The light fell upon\r\nher face, and he was drawn to the bedside to look at her. The features\r\nsignified nothing but repose; her lips were just apart, her eyelids lay\r\nsoftly with their black fringe of exquisite pencilling, and her hair\r\nwas arranged as she always prepared it for the pillow. He watched her\r\nfor full five minutes, and detected not the slightest movement, so\r\nprofound was her sleep. Then he turned away, muttering savagely under\r\nhis breath, \xe2\x80\x9cHypocrite! Liar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut for a purpose in his thoughts he would not have lain down beside\r\nher. On getting into bed he kept as far away as possible, and all\r\nthrough the wakeful night his limbs shrank from the touch of hers.\r\n\r\nHe rose an hour earlier than usual. Monica had long been awake, but she\r\nmoved so seldom that he could not be sure of this; her face was turned\r\nfrom him. When he came back to the room after his bath, Monica propped\r\nherself on her elbow and asked why he was moving so early.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be in the City at nine,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with a show of\r\ncheerfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a money affair I must see after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that\xe2\x80\x99s going wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid so. I must lose no time in looking to it. What plans have\r\nyou for to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday, you know. I promised to see Newdick this afternoon.\r\nPerhaps I may bring him to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock he returned from his business. At two he went away\r\nagain, saying that he should not be back before seven, it might be a\r\nlittle later. In Monica these movements excited no special remark; they\r\nwere merely a continuance of his restlessness. But no sooner had he\r\ndeparted, after luncheon, than she went to her dressing-room, and began\r\nto make slow, uncertain preparations for leaving home herself.\r\n\r\nThis morning she had tried to write a letter for Bevis, but vainly. She\r\nknew not what to say to him, uncertain of her own desires and of what\r\nlay before her. Yet, if she were to communicate with him henceforth at\r\nall, it was necessary, this very afternoon, to find an address where\r\nletters could be received for her, and to let him know of it.\r\nTo-morrow, Sunday, was useless for the purpose, and on Monday it might\r\nbe impossible for her to go out alone. Besides that, she could not be\r\nsure of the safety of a letter delivered at the flat on Monday night or\r\nTuesday morning.\r\n\r\nShe dressed at length and went out. Her wisest course, probably, was to\r\nseek for some obliging shopkeeper near Lavender Hill. Then she could\r\ncall on Virginia, transact the business she had pretended to discharge\r\nyesterday, and there pen a note to Bevis.\r\n\r\nHer moods alternated with distracting rapidity. A hundred times she had\r\nresolved that Bevis could be nothing more to her, and again had thought\r\nof him with impulses of yearning, trying to persuade herself that he\r\nhad acted well and wisely. A hundred times she determined to carry out\r\nher idea of yesterday\xe2\x80\x94to quit her husband and resist all his efforts\r\nto recall her\xe2\x80\x94and again had all but resigned herself to live with him,\r\naccepting degradation as so many wives perforce did. Her mind was in\r\nconfusion, and physically she felt far from well. A heaviness weighed\r\nupon her limbs, making it hardship to walk however short a distance.\r\n\r\nArrived at Clapham Junction, she began to search wearily,\r\nindifferently, for the kind of shop that might answer her purpose. The\r\nreceiving of letters which, for one reason or another, must be\r\ndispatched to a secret address, is a very ordinary complaisance on the\r\npart of small London stationers; hundreds of such letters are sent and\r\ncalled for every week within the metropolitan postal area. It did not\r\ntake Monica long to find an obliging shopkeeper; the first to whom she\r\napplied\xe2\x80\x94a decent woman behind a counter which displayed newspapers,\r\ntobacco, and fancy articles\xe2\x80\x94willingly accepted the commission.\r\n\r\nShe came out of the shop with flushed cheeks. Another step in shameful\r\ndescent\xe2\x80\x94yet it had the result of strengthening once more her emotions\r\nfavourable to Bevis. On his account she had braved this ignominy, and\r\nit drew her towards him, instead of producing the effect which would\r\nhave seemed more natural. Perhaps the reason was that she felt herself\r\nmore hopelessly an outcast from the world of honourable women, and\r\ntherefore longed in her desolation for the support of a man\xe2\x80\x99s love. Did\r\nhe not love her? It was _her_ fault if she expected him to act with a\r\nboldness that did not lie in his nature. Perhaps his discretion, which\r\nshe had so bitterly condemned as weakness, meant a wise regard for her\r\ninterests as well as his own. The public scandal of divorce was a\r\nhideous thing. If it damaged his prospects and sundered him from his\r\nrelatives, how could she hope that his love of her, the cause of it\r\nall, would long endure?\r\n\r\nThe need of love overcame her. She would submit to any conditions\r\nrather than lose this lover whose kisses were upon her lips, and whose\r\narms had held her so passionately. She was too young to accept a life\r\nof resignation, too ardent. Why had she left him in despondency, in\r\ndoubt whether he would ever again see her?\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nShe turned back on her way to Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings, re-entered the\r\nstation, and journeyed townwards. It was an odd incident, by Monica\r\nunperceived, that when she was taking her ticket there stood close by\r\nher a man, seemingly a mechanic, who had also stood within hearing when\r\nshe booked at Herne Hill. This same man, though he had not travelled in\r\nthe compartment with her, followed her when she alighted at Bayswater.\r\nShe did not once observe him.\r\n\r\nInstead of writing, she had resolved to see Bevis again\xe2\x80\x94if it were\r\npossible. Perhaps he would not be at the flat; yet his wish might\r\nsuggest the bare hope of her coming to-day. The risk of meeting Barfoot\r\nprobably need not be considered, for he had told her that he was\r\ntravelling to-day into Cumberland, and for so long a journey he would\r\nbe sure to set forth in the morning. At worst she would suffer a\r\ndisappointment. Indulgence of her fervid feelings had made her as eager\r\nto see Bevis as she was yesterday. Words of tenderness rushed to her\r\nlips for utterance. When she reached the building all but delirium\r\npossessed her.\r\n\r\nShe had hurried up to the first landing, when a footstep behind drew\r\nher attention. It was a man in mechanic\xe2\x80\x99s dress, coming up with head\r\nbent, doubtless for some task or other in one of the flats. Perhaps he\r\nwas going to Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s. She went forward more slowly, and on the next\r\nlanding allowed the man to pass her. Yes, more likely than not he was\r\nengaged in packing her lover\xe2\x80\x99s furniture. She stood still. At that\r\nmoment a door closed above, and another step, lighter and quicker, that\r\nof a woman, came downstairs. As far as her ear could judge, this person\r\nmight have left Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s flat. A conflict of emotions excited her to\r\npanic. She was afraid either to advance or to retreat, and in equal\r\ndread of standing without purpose. She stepped up to the nearest door,\r\nand gave a summons with the knocker.\r\n\r\nThis door was Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s. She knew that; in the first instant of fear\r\noccasioned by the workman\xe2\x80\x99s approach, she had glanced at the door and\r\nreminded herself that here Mr. Barfoot dwelt, immediately beneath\r\nBevis. But for the wild alarm due to her conscience-stricken state she\r\ncould not have risked the possibility of the tenant being still at\r\nhome; and yet it seemed to her that she was doing the only thing\r\npossible under the circumstances. For this woman whom she heard just\r\nabove might perchance be one of Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s sisters, returned to London for\r\nsome purpose or other, and in that case she preferred being seen at\r\nBarfoot\xe2\x80\x99s door to detection as she made for her lover\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nUncertainty on this point lasted but a few seconds. Dreading to look at\r\nthe woman, Monica yet did so, just as she passed, and beheld the face\r\nof a perfect stranger. A young and good-looking face, however. Her\r\nmind, sufficiently tumultuous, received a new impulse of disturbance.\r\nHad this woman come forth from Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s fiat or from the one\r\nopposite?\xe2\x80\x94for on each floor there were two dwellings.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime no one answered her knock. Mr. Barfoot had gone; she\r\nbreathed thankfully. Now she might venture to ascend to the next floor.\r\nBut then sounded a knock from above. That, she felt convinced, was at\r\nBevis\xe2\x80\x99s door, and if so her conjecture about the workman was correct.\r\nShe stood waiting for certainty, as if still expecting a reply to her\r\nown signal at Mr. Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s door. The mechanic looked down at her over\r\nthe banisters, but of this she was unaware.\r\n\r\nThe knock above was repeated. Yes, this time there could be no mistake;\r\nit was on this side of the landing\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, at her lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor. But the door did not open; thus, without going up herself, she\r\nreceived assurance that Bevis was not at home. He might come later. She\r\nstill had an hour or two to spare. So, as if disappointed in a call at\r\nMr. Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s, she descended the stairs and issued into the street.\r\n\r\nAgitation had exhausted her, and a dazzling of her eyes threatened a\r\nrecurrence of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s faintness. She found a shop where\r\nrefreshments were sold, and sat for half an hour over a cup of tea,\r\ntrying to amuse herself with illustrated papers. The mechanic who had\r\nknocked at Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s door passed once or twice along the pavement, and,\r\nas long as she remained here, kept the shop within sight.\r\n\r\nAt length she asked for writing materials, and penned a few lines. If\r\non her second attempt she failed to see Bevis, she would drop this note\r\ninto his letter-box. It acquainted him with the address to which he\r\nmight direct letters, assured him passionately of her love, and\r\nimplored him to be true to her, to send for her as soon as\r\ncircumstances made it possible.\r\n\r\nSelf-torment of every kind was natural to her position. Though the\r\nrelief of escaping from several distinct dangers had put her mind\r\ncomparatively at ease for a short time, she had now begun to suffer a\r\nfresh uneasiness with reference to the young and handsome woman who\r\ncame downstairs. The fact that no one answered the workman\xe2\x80\x99s knock had\r\nseemed to her a sufficient proof that Bevis was not at home, and that\r\nthe stranger must have come forth from the flat opposite his. But she\r\nrecollected the incident which had so alarmingly disturbed her and her\r\nlover yesterday. Bevis did not then go to the door, and suppose\xe2\x80\x94oh, it\r\nwas folly! But suppose that woman had been with him; suppose he did not\r\ncare to open to a visitor whose signal sounded only a minute or two\r\nafter that person\xe2\x80\x99s departure?\r\n\r\nHad she not anguish enough to endure without the addition of frantic\r\njealousy? She would not give another thought to such absurd\r\nsuggestions. The woman had of course come from the dwelling opposite.\r\nYet why might she not have been in Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s flat when he himself was\r\nabsent? Suppose her an intimate to whom he had entrusted a latchkey.\r\nIf any such connection existed, might it not help to explain Bevis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf-heartedness?\r\n\r\nTo think thus was courting madness. Unable to sit still any longer,\r\nMonica left the shop, and strayed for some ten minutes about the\r\nneighbouring streets, drawing nearer and nearer to her goal. Finally\r\nshe entered the building and went upstairs. On this occasion no one met\r\nher, and no one entered in her rear. She knocked at her lover\xe2\x80\x99s door,\r\nand stood longing, praying, that it might open. But it did not. Tears\r\nstarted to her eyes; she uttered a moan of bitterest disappointment,\r\nand slipped the envelope she was carrying into the letter-box.\r\n\r\nThe mechanic had seen her go in, and he waited outside, a few yards\r\naway. Either she would soon reappear, or her not doing so would show\r\nthat she had obtained admittance somewhere. In the latter case, this\r\nworkman of much curiosity and leisure had only to lurk about the\r\nstaircase until she came forth again. But this trial of patience was\r\nspared him. He found that he had simply to follow the lady back to\r\nHerne Hill. Acting on very suggestive instructions, it never occurred\r\nto the worthy man that the lady\xe2\x80\x99s second visit was not to the same flat\r\nas in the former instance.\r\n\r\nMonica was home again long before dinner-time. When that hour arrived\r\nher husband had not yet come; the delay, no doubt, was somehow\r\nconnected with his visit to Mr. Newdick. But this went on. At nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock Monica still sat alone, hungry, yet scarce conscious of hunger\r\nowing to her miseries. Widdowson had never behaved thus. Another\r\nquarter of an hour and she heard the front door open.\r\n\r\nHe came to the drawing-room, where she sat waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow late you are! Are you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t had dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be in rather a gloomy mood, but Monica noticed nothing\r\nthat alarmed her. He was drawing nearer, his eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had bad news\xe2\x80\x94in the City?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill he came nearer, and at length, when a yard or two away, raised\r\nhis look to her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been out this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was prompted to a falsehood, but durst not utter it, so keenly was\r\nhe regarding her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I went to see Miss Barfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the word burst from his lips, he sprang at her, clutched her dress\r\nat the throat, and flung her violently upon her knees. A short cry of\r\nterror escaped her; then she was stricken dumb, with eyes starting and\r\nmouth open. It was well that he held her by the garment and not by the\r\nneck, for his hand closed with murderous convulsion, and the desire of\r\ncrushing out her life was for an instant all his consciousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiar!\xe2\x80\x9d again burst from him. \xe2\x80\x9cDay after day you have lied to me. Liar!\r\nAdultress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not! I am not that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clung upon his arms and strove to raise herself. The bloodless\r\nlips, the choked voice, meant dread of him, but the distortion of her\r\nfeatures was hatred and the will to resist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that? What is your word worth? The prostitute in the street is\r\nsooner to be believed. She has the honesty to say what she is, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94Where were you yesterday when you were not at your sister\xe2\x80\x99s? Where\r\nwere you this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had nearly struggled to her feet; he thrust her down again, crushed\r\nher backwards until her head all but touched the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you? Tell the truth, or you shall never speak again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94help! help! He will kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer cry rang through the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall them up\xe2\x80\x94let them come and look at you and hear what you are.\r\nSoon enough every one will know. Where were you this afternoon? You\r\nwere watched every step of the way from here to that place where you\r\nhave made yourself a base, vile, unclean creature\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not that! Your spies have misled you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMisled? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go to that man Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s door and knock there? And\r\nbecause you were disappointed, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you wait about, and go there a\r\nsecond time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I did? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You go time after time to the private chambers of an unmarried\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94a man such as that\xe2\x80\x94and it means no harm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been there before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou expect me to believe you?\xe2\x80\x9d Widdowson cried with savage contumely.\r\nHe had just loosed his hold of her, and she was upright again before\r\nhim, her eyes flashing defiance, though every muscle in her frame\r\nquivered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did your lies begin? Was it when you told me you had\r\nbeen to hear Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s lecture, and never went there at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe aimed the charge at a venture, and her face told him that his\r\nsuspicion had been grounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how many weeks, for how many months, have you been dishonouring me\r\nand yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not guilty of what you believe, but I shan\xe2\x80\x99t try to defend\r\nmyself. Thank Heaven, this is the end of everything between us! Charge\r\nme with what you like. I am going away from you, and I hope we may\r\nnever meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are going\xe2\x80\x94no doubt of that. But not before you have answered\r\nmy questions. Whether with lies or not doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter much. You shall\r\ngive your own account of what you have been doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth panting as if after some supreme effort of their physical force,\r\nthey stood and looked at each other. Each to the other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes was\r\nincredibly transformed. Monica could not have imagined such brutal\r\nferocity in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face, and she herself had a wild recklessness\r\nin her eyes, a scorn and abhorrence in all the lines of her\r\ncountenance, which made Widdowson feel as if a stranger were before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall answer no question whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I want is\r\nto leave your house, and never see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe regretted what he had done. The result of the first day\xe2\x80\x99s espionage\r\nbeing a piece of evidence so incomplete, he had hoped to command\r\nhimself until more solid proof of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s guilt were forthcoming.\r\nBut jealousy was too strong for such prudence, and the sight of Monica\r\nas she uttered her falsehood made a mere madman of him. Predisposed to\r\nbelieve a story of this kind, he could not reason as he might have done\r\nif fear of Barfoot had never entered his thoughts. The whole course of\r\ndishonour seemed so clear; he traced it from Monica\xe2\x80\x99s earliest meetings\r\nwith Barfoot at Chelsea. Wavering between the impulse to cast off his\r\nwife with every circumstance of public shame, and the piteous desire to\r\narrest her on her path of destruction, he rushed into a middle course,\r\ncompatible with neither of these intentions. If at this stage he chose\r\nto tell Monica what had come to his knowledge, it should have been done\r\nwith the sternest calm, with dignity capable of shaming her guilt. As\r\nit was, he had spoilt his chances in every direction. Perhaps Monica\r\nunderstood this; he had begun to esteem her a mistress in craft and\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you were never at that man\xe2\x80\x99s rooms before to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in\r\na lower voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have said you must take the trouble to recollect. I shall\r\nanswer no question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the impulse assailed him to wring confession from her by terror.\r\nHe took a step forward, the demon in his face. Monica in that moment\r\nleapt past him, and reached the door of the room before he could stop\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cIf your hands touch me again I shall\r\ncall for help until someone comes up. I won\xe2\x80\x99t endure your touch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you pretend you are innocent of any crime against me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not what you called me. Explain everything as you like. I will\r\nexplain nothing. I want only to be free from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the door, rapidly crossed the landing, and went upstairs.\r\nFeeling it was useless to follow, Widdowson allowed the door to remain\r\nwide, and waited. Five minutes passed and Monica came down again,\r\ndressed for leaving the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, stepping out of the room to intercept\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing to you. I am going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey subdued their voices, which might else have been audible to the\r\nservants below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that you shall not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward to block the head of the stairs, but again Monica\r\nwas too quick for him. She fled down, and across the hall, and to the\r\nhouse-door. Only there, as she was arrested by the difficulty of\r\ndrawing back the two latches, did Widdowson overtake her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake what scandal you like, you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis tones were violent rather than resolute. What could he do? If\r\nMonica persisted, what means had he of confining her to the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94short of carrying her by main force to an upper room and there\r\nlocking her in? He knew that his courage would not sustain him through\r\nsuch a task as this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor scandal I care nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d was her reply. \xe2\x80\x9cOne way or another I will\r\nleave the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my sister\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand on the door, Widdowson stood as if determined in opposition.\r\nBut her will was stronger than his. Only by homicide can a man maintain\r\nhis dignity in a situation of this kind; Widdowson could not kill his\r\nwife, and every moment that he stood there made him more ridiculous,\r\nmore contemptible.\r\n\r\nHe turned back into the hall and reached his hat. Whilst he was doing\r\nso Monica opened the door. Heavy rain was falling, but she paid no heed\r\nto it. In a moment Widdowson hastened after her, careless, he too, of\r\nthe descending floods. Her way was towards the railway station, but the\r\ndriver of a cab chancing to attract her notice, she accepted the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffer, and bade him drive to Lavender Hill.\r\n\r\nOn the first opportunity Widdowson took like refuge from the rain, and\r\nwas driven in the same direction. He alighted not far from Mrs.\r\nConisbee\xe2\x80\x99s house. That Monica had come hither he felt no doubt, but he\r\nwould presently make sure of it. As it still rained he sought shelter\r\nin a public-house, where he quenched a painful thirst, and then\r\nsatisfied his hunger with such primitive foods as a licensed victualler\r\nis disposed to vend. It was nearing eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and he had neither\r\neaten nor drunk since luncheon.\r\n\r\nAfter that he walked to Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s, and knocked at the door. The\r\nlandlady came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you please to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhether Mrs. Widdowson is here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sly curiosity of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s face informed him at once that she saw\r\nsomething unusual in these circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. Mrs. Widdowson is with her sister,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word he departed. But went only a short distance, and\r\nuntil midnight kept Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s door in view. The rain fell, the\r\nair was raw; shelterless, and often shivering with fever, Widdowson\r\nwalked the pavement with a constable\xe2\x80\x99s regularity. He could not but\r\nremember the many nights when he thus kept watch in Walworth Road and\r\nin Rutland Street, with jealousy, then too, burning in his heart, but\r\nalso with amorous ardours, never again to be revived. A little more\r\nthan twelve months ago! And he had waited, longed for marriage through\r\nhalf a lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF THE IDEAL\r\n\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s week at the seashore was spoilt by uncertain weather. Only two\r\ndays of abiding sunshine; for the rest, mere fitful gleams across a sky\r\nheaped with stormclouds. Over Wastdale hung a black canopy; from\r\nScawfell came mutterings of thunder; and on the last night of the\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x94when Monica fled from her home in pelting rain\xe2\x80\x94tempest broke\r\nupon the mountains and the sea. Wakeful until early morning, and at\r\ntimes watching the sky from her inland-looking window, Rhoda saw the\r\nrocky heights that frown upon Wastwater illuminated by lightning-flare\r\nof such intensity and duration that miles of distance were annihilated,\r\nand it seemed but a step to those stern crags and precipices.\r\n\r\nSunday began with rain, but also with promise of better things; far\r\nover the sea was a broad expanse of blue, and before long the foam of\r\nthe fallen tide glistened in strong, hopeful rays. Rhoda wandered about\r\nthe shore towards St. Bees Head. A broad stream flowing into the sea\r\nstopped her progress before she had gone very far; the only way of\r\ncrossing it was to go up on to the line of railway, which here runs\r\nalong the edge of the sands. But she had little inclination to walk\r\nfarther. No house, no person within sight, she sat down to gaze at the\r\ngulls fishing by the little river-mouth, their screams the only sound\r\nthat blended with that of the subdued breakers.\r\n\r\nOn the horizon lay a long, low shape that might have been mistaken for\r\ncloud, though it resembled land. It was the Isle of Man. In an hour or\r\ntwo the outline had grown much clearer; the heights and hollows were no\r\nlonger doubtful. In the north became visible another remote and hilly\r\ntract; it was the coast of Scotland beyond Solway Firth.\r\n\r\nThese distant objects acted as incentives to Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. She\r\nheard Everard Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s voice as he talked of travel\xe2\x80\x94of the Orient\r\nExpress. That joy of freedom he had offered her. Perhaps he was now\r\nvery near her, anxious to repeat his offer. If he carried out the\r\nproject suggested at their last interview, she would see him to-day or\r\nto-morrow morning\xe2\x80\x94then she must make her choice. To have a day\xe2\x80\x99s walk\r\nwith him among the mountains would be practically deciding. But for\r\nwhat? If she rejected his proposal of a free union, was he prepared to\r\nmarry her in legal form? Yes; she had enough power over him for that.\r\nBut how would it affect his thought of her? Constraining him to legal\r\nmarriage, would she not lower herself in his estimation, and make the\r\nendurance of his love less probable? Barfoot was not a man to accept\r\nwith genuine satisfaction even the appearance of bondage, and more\r\nlikely than not his love of her depended upon the belief that in her he\r\nhad found a woman capable of regarding life from his own point of\r\nview\xe2\x80\x94a woman who, when she once loved, would be scornful of the\r\nformalities clung to by feeble minds. He would yield to her if she\r\ndemanded forms, but afterwards\xe2\x80\x94when passion had subsided\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n\r\nA week had been none too long to ponder these considerations by\r\nthemselves; but they were complicated with doubts of a more disturbing\r\nnature. Her mind could not free itself from the thought of Monica. That\r\nMrs. Widdowson was not always truthful with her husband she had\r\nabsolute proof; whether that supported her fear of an intimacy between\r\nMonica and Everard she was unable to determine. The grounds of\r\nsuspicion seemed to her very grave; so grave, that during her first day\r\nor two in Cumberland she had all but renounced the hopes long secretly\r\nfostered. She knew herself well enough to understand how jealousy might\r\nwreck her life\xe2\x80\x94even if it were only retrospective. If she married\r\nBarfoot (forms or none\xe2\x80\x94that question in no way touched this other),\r\nshe would demand of him a flawless faith. Her pride revolted against\r\nthe thought of possessing only a share in his devotion; the moment that\r\nany faithlessness came to her knowledge she would leave him, perforce,\r\ninevitably\xe2\x80\x94and what miseries were then before her!\r\n\r\nWas flawless faith possible to Everard Barfoot? His cousin would\r\nridicule the hope of any such thing\xe2\x80\x94or so Rhoda believed. A\r\nconventional woman would of course see the completest evidence of his\r\nuntrustworthiness in his dislike of legal marriage; but Rhoda knew the\r\nidleness of this argument. If love did not hold him, assuredly the\r\nforms of marriage could be no restraint upon Everard; married ten times\r\nover, he would still deem himself absolutely free from any obligation\r\nsave that of love. Yet how did he think of that obligation? He might\r\nhold it perfectly compatible with the indulgence of casual impulse. And\r\nthis (which she suspected to be the view of every man) Rhoda had no\r\npower of tolerating. It must be all or nothing, whole faith or none\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she suffered from impatient expectancy. If Barfoot\r\ncame to-day\xe2\x80\x94she imagined him somewhere in the neighbourhood,\r\napproaching Seascale as the time of his appointment drew near\xe2\x80\x94would he\r\ncall at her lodgings? The address she had not given him, but doubtless\r\nhe had obtained it from his cousin. Perhaps he would prefer to meet her\r\nunexpectedly\xe2\x80\x94not a difficult thing in this little place, with its\r\nhandful of residents and visitors. Certain it was she desired his\r\narrival. Her heart leapt with joy in the thought that this very evening\r\nmight bring him. She wished to study him under new conditions,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94possibly\xe2\x80\x94to talk with him even more frankly than ever yet, for\r\nthere would be opportunity enough.\r\n\r\nAbout six o\xe2\x80\x99clock a train coming from the south stopped at the station,\r\nwhich was visible from Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room window. She had been\r\nwaiting for this moment. She could not go to the station, and did not\r\nventure even to wait anywhere in sight of the exit. Whether any\r\npassenger had alighted must remain uncertain. If Everard had arrived by\r\nthis train, doubtless he would go to the hotel, which stood only a few\r\nyards from the line. He would take a meal and presently come forth.\r\n\r\nHaving allowed half an hour to elapse, she dressed and walked\r\nshoreward. Seascale has no street, no shops; only two or three short\r\nrows of houses irregularly placed on the rising ground above the beach.\r\nTo cross the intervening railway, Rhoda could either pass through the\r\nlittle station, in which case she would also pass the hotel and be\r\nobservable from its chief windows, or descend by a longer road which\r\nled under a bridge, and in this way avoid the hotel altogether. She\r\ntook the former route. On the sands were a few scattered people, and\r\nsome children subdued to Sunday decorum. The tide was rising. She went\r\ndown to the nearest tract of hard sand, and stood there for a long\r\ntime, a soft western breeze playing upon her face.\r\n\r\nIf Barfoot were here he would now be coming out to look for her. From a\r\ndistance he might not recognize her figure, clad as she was in a\r\ncostume such as he had never seen her wearing. She might venture now to\r\nwalk up towards the dry, white sandheaps, where the little convolvulus\r\ngrew in abundance, and other flowers of which she neither knew nor\r\ncared to learn the names. Scarcely had she turned when she saw Everard\r\napproaching, still far off, but unmistakable. He signalled by taking\r\noff his hat, and quickly was beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know me before I happened to look round?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked laughingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did. Up there by the station I caught sight of you. Who\r\nelse bears herself as you do\xe2\x80\x94with splendid disdain of common mortals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t make me think that my movements are ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are superb. The sea has already touched your cheeks. But I am\r\nafraid you have had abominable weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, rather bad; but there\xe2\x80\x99s hope to-day. Where do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy train, only from Carnforth. I left London yesterday morning, and\r\nstopped at Morecambe\xe2\x80\x94some people I know are there. As trains were\r\nawkward to-day, I drove from Morecambe to Carnforth. Did you expect me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might come, as you spoke of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I have got through the week I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I should have\r\nbeen here days ago, but I was afraid. Let us go nearer to the sea. I\r\nwas afraid of making you angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better to keep one\xe2\x80\x99s word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is. And I am all the more delighted to be with you for\r\nthe miserable week of waiting. Have you bathed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce or twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a swim this morning before breakfast, in pouring rain. Now _you_\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I can\xe2\x80\x99t. But why were you sure about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly because it\xe2\x80\x99s so rare for any girl to learn swimming. A man who\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t swim is only half the man he might be, and to a woman I should\r\nthink it must be of even more benefit. As in everything else, women are\r\ntrammelled by their clothes; to be able to get rid of them, and to move\r\nabout with free and brave exertion of all the body, must tend to every\r\nkind of health, physical, mental, and mortal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I quite believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, gazing at the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke rather exultantly, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? I like to feel myself superior to\r\nyou in some things. You have so often pointed out to me what a paltry,\r\nineffectual creature I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember ever using those words, or implying them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does the day stand with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Everard in the tone of perfect\r\ncomradeship. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you still to dine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dining is a very simple matter; it happens at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. About\r\nnine I shall have supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us walk a little then. And may I smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard lit a cigar, and, as the tide drove them back, they moved\r\neventually to the higher ground, whence there was a fine view of the\r\nmountains, rich in evening colours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow you leave here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go by railway to Coniston, and walk\r\nfrom there towards Helvellyn, as you suggested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something else to propose. A man I talked to in the train told\r\nme of a fine walk in this neighbourhood. From Ravenglass, just below\r\nhere, there\xe2\x80\x99s a little line runs up Eskdale to a terminus at the foot\r\nof Scawfell, a place called Boot. From Boot one can walk either over\r\nthe top of Scawfell or by a lower track to Wastdale Head. It\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\ngrand, wild country, especially the last part, the going down to\r\nWastwater, and not many miles in all. Suppose we have that walk\r\nto-morrow? From Wastdale we could drive back to Seascale in the\r\nevening, and then the next day\xe2\x80\x94just as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure about the distances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite. I have the Ordnance map in my pocket. Let me show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spread the map on the top of a wall, and they stood side by side\r\ninspecting it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must take something to eat; I\xe2\x80\x99ll provide for that. And at the\r\nWastdale Head hotel we can have dinner\xe2\x80\x94about three or four, probably.\r\nIt would be enjoyable, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll hope it won\xe2\x80\x99t. As we go back we can look out the trains at the\r\nstation. No doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s one soon after breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir rambling, with talk in a strain of easy friendliness, brought\r\nthem back to Seascale half an hour after sunset, which was of a kind\r\nthat seemed to promise well for the morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come out again after supper?\xe2\x80\x9d Barfoot asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot again to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a quarter of an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged. \xe2\x80\x9cJust down to the sea and back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been walking all day. I shall be glad to rest and read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. To-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving discovered the train which would take them to Ravenglass, and\r\nconnect with one on the Eskdale line, they agreed to meet at the\r\nstation. Barfoot was to bring with him such refreshment as would be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nTheir hopes for the weather had complete fulfilment. The only fear was\r\nlest the sun\xe2\x80\x99s heat might be oppressive, but this anxiety could be\r\ncheerfully borne. Slung over his shoulders Barfoot had a small\r\nforage-bag, which gave him matter for talk on the railway journey; it\r\nhad been his companion in many parts of the world, and had held strange\r\nkinds of food.\r\n\r\nThe journey up Eskdale, from Ravenglass to Boot, is by a miniature\r\nrailway, with the oddest little engine and a carriage or two of\r\nprimitive simplicity. At each station on the upward winding\r\ntrack\xe2\x80\x94stations represented only by a wooden shed like a\r\ntool-house\xe2\x80\x94the guard jumps down and acts as booking-clerk, if\r\npassengers there be desirous of booking. In a few miles the scenery\r\nchanges from beauty to grandeur, and at the terminus no further\r\nsteaming would be possible, for the great flank of Scawfell bars the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nEverard and his companion began their climb through the pretty\r\nstraggling village of Boot. A mountain torrent roared by the wayside,\r\nand the course they had marked upon the map showed that they must\r\nfollow this stream for some miles up to the tarn where it originated.\r\nHouses, human beings, and even trodden paths they soon left behind,\r\ncoming out on to a vast moorland, with hill summits near and far.\r\nScawfell they could not hope to ascend; with the walk that lay before\r\nthem it was enough to make a way over one of his huge shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your strength fails,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard merrily, when for an hour they\r\nhad been plodding through grey solitudes, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no human help. I\r\nshould have to choose between carrying you back to Boot or on to\r\nWastdale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy strength is not likely to fail sooner than yours,\xe2\x80\x9d was the laughing\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have chicken sandwiches, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man.\r\nTell me when hunger overcomes you. I should think we had better make\r\nour halt at Burmoor Tarn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat, indeed, proved to be the convenient resting-place. A wild spot, a\r\nhollow amid the rolling expanse of moorland, its little lake of black\r\nwater glistening under the midday sun. And here stood a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage, the only habitation they had seen since leaving Boot. Somewhat\r\nuncertain about the course to be henceforth followed, they made inquiry\r\nat this cottage, and a woman who appeared to be quite alone gave them\r\nthe needful direction. Thus at ease in mind they crossed the bridge at\r\nthe foot of the tarn, and just beyond it found a spot suitable for\r\nrepose. Everard brought forth his sandwiches and his flask of wine,\r\nmoreover a wine-glass, which was for Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s use. They ate and drank\r\nfestively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow this is just what I have enjoyed in imagination for a year or\r\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barfoot, when the luncheon was over, and he lay propped\r\nupon his elbow, gazing at Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s fine eyes and her sun-warmed cheeks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ideal realized, for once in one\xe2\x80\x99s life. A perfect moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like the scent of burning peat from that cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I like everything about us, in heaven and earth, and most of all\r\nI like your companionship, Rhoda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not resent this first use of her Christian name; it was so\r\nnatural, so inevitable; yet she moved her head as if with a slight\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs mine as agreeable to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, stroking the back of her hand\r\nwith a spray of heather. \xe2\x80\x9cOr do you just tolerate me out of\r\ngood-nature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have liked your companionship all the way from Seascale. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisturb my enjoyment of it for the rest of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a misfortune indeed. The whole day shall be perfect. Not\r\na note of discord. But I must have liberty to say what comes into my\r\nmind, and when you don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to answer I shall respect your silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to smoke a cigar before we start again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But I like still better not to. The scent of peat is pleasanter\r\nto you than that of tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOblige me by lighting the cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you command\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He did her bidding. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole day shall be perfect.\r\nA delightful dinner at the inn, a drive to Seascale, an hour or two of\r\nrest, and then one more quiet talk by the sea at nightfall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll but the last. I shall be too tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I must have that hour of talk by the sea. You are free to answer\r\nme or not, but your presence you must grant me. We are in an ideal\r\nworld remember. We care nothing for all the sons and daughters of men.\r\nYou and I will spend this one day together between cloudless heaven and\r\nsilent earth\xe2\x80\x94a memory for lifetime. At nightfall you will come out\r\nagain, and meet me down by the sea, where you stood when I first saw\r\nyou yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda made no reply. She looked away from him at the black, deep water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, raising his hand to point at the\r\ncottage, \xe2\x80\x9cfor saying the silliest of conceivable things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _might_ that be, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that to dwell there together for the rest of our lives would be\r\nsupreme felicity. You know the kind of man that would say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot personally, thank goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA week\xe2\x80\x94a month, even\xe2\x80\x94with weather such as this. Nay, with a storm\r\nfor variety; clouds from the top of Scawfell falling thick about us; a\r\nfierce wind shrieking across the tarn; sheets and torrents and floods\r\nof rain beating upon our roof; and you and I by the peat-fire. With a\r\ngood supply of books, old and new, I can picture it for three months,\r\nfor half a year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe on your guard. Remember \xe2\x80\x9cthat kind of man\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in no danger. There is a vast difference between six months and\r\nall one\xe2\x80\x99s life. When the half-year was over we would leave England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Orient Express?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed together, Rhoda colouring, for the words that had escaped\r\nher meant too much for mere jest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Orient Express. We would have a house by the Bosphorus for the\r\nnext half-year, and contrast our emotions with those we had known by\r\nBurmoor Tarn. Think what a rich year of life that would make! How much\r\nwe should have learnt from nature and from each other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how dreadfully tired of each other we should be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot looked keenly at her. He could not with certainty read her\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! The day is to be perfect. I won\xe2\x80\x99t admit that we could ever tire\r\nof each other with reasonable variety of circumstance. You to me are\r\ninfinitely interesting, and I believe that I might become so to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not allow himself to vary from this tone of fanciful\r\nspeculation, suited to the idle hour. Rhoda said very little; her\r\nremarks were generally a purposed interruption of Everard\xe2\x80\x99s theme. When\r\nthe cigar was smoked out they rose and set forward again. This latter\r\nhalf of their walk proved the most interesting, for they were expectant\r\nof the view down upon Wastdale. A bold summit came in sight, dark,\r\ndesolate, which they judged to be Great Gabel; and when they had\r\npressed on eagerly for another mile, the valley opened beneath them\r\nwith such striking suddenness that they stopped on the instant and\r\nglanced at each other in silence. From a noble height they looked down\r\nupon Wastwater, sternest and blackest of the lakes, on the fields and\r\ncopses of the valley head with its winding stream, and the rugged\r\ngorges which lie beyond in mountain shadow.\r\n\r\nThe descent was by a path which in winter becomes the bed of a torrent,\r\nsteep and stony, zigzagging through a thick wood. Here, and when they\r\nhad reached the level road leading into the village, their talk was in\r\nthe same natural, light-hearted strain as before they rested. So at the\r\ninn where they dined, and during their drive homewards\xe2\x80\x94by the dark\r\nlake with its woods and precipices, out into the country of green\r\nhills, and thence through Gosforth on the long road descending seaward.\r\nSince their early departure scarcely a cloud had passed over the sun\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nperfect day.\r\n\r\nThey alighted before reaching Seascale. Barfoot discharged his debt to\r\nthe driver\xe2\x80\x94who went on to bait at the hotel\xe2\x80\x94and walked with Rhoda for\r\nthe last quarter of a mile. This was his own idea; Rhoda made no\r\nremark, but approved his discretion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is six o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard, after a short silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember\r\nyour arrangement. At eight, down on the shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be much more comfortable in the armchair with a book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you have had enough of books. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you so very tired? Poor girl! The day has been rather too much for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could walk back again to Wastwater if it were necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; I knew that. You are magnificent. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing more was said on the subject. When in sight of Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings\r\nthey parted without hand-shaking.\r\n\r\nBefore eight Everard was straying about the beach, watching the sun go\r\ndown in splendour. He smiled to himself frequently. The hour had come\r\nfor his last trial of Rhoda, and he felt some confidence as to the\r\nresult. If her mettle endured his test, if she declared herself willing\r\nnot only to abandon her avowed ideal of life, but to defy the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion by becoming his wife without forms of mutual bondage\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nthe woman he had imagined, and by her side he would go cheerfully on\r\nhis way as a married man. Legally married; the proposal of free union\r\nwas to be a test only. Loving her as he had never thought to love,\r\nthere still remained with him so much of the temper in which he first\r\nwooed her that he could be satisfied with nothing short of\r\nunconditional surrender. Delighting in her independence of mind, he\r\nstill desired to see her in complete subjugation to him, to inspire her\r\nwith unreflecting passion. Tame consent to matrimony was an everyday\r\nexperience. Agnes Brissenden, he felt sure, would marry him whenever he\r\nchose to ask her\xe2\x80\x94and would make one of the best wives conceivable. But\r\nof Rhoda Nunn he expected and demanded more than this. She must rise\r\nfar above the level of ordinary intelligent women. She must manifest an\r\nabsolute confidence in him\xe2\x80\x94that was the true significance of his\r\npresent motives. The censures and suspicions which she had not scrupled\r\nto confess in plain words must linger in no corner of her mind.\r\n\r\nHis heart throbbed with impatience for her coming. Come she would; it\r\nwas not in Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s nature to play tricks; if she had not meant to meet\r\nhim she would have said so resolutely, as last night.\r\n\r\nAt a few minutes past the hour he looked landward, and saw her figure\r\nagainst the golden sky. She came down from the sandbank very slowly,\r\nwith careless, loitering steps. He moved but a little way to meet her,\r\nand then stood still. He had done his part; it was now hers to forego\r\nfemale privileges, to obey the constraint of love. The western\r\nafterglow touched her features, heightening the beauty Everard had\r\nlearnt to see in them. Still she loitered, stooping to pick up a piece\r\nof seaweed; but still he kept his place, motionless, and she came\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the light of sunset on the mountains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been no such evening since I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wanted to sit at home with a book. That was no close for a\r\nperfect day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found a letter from your cousin. She was with her friends the\r\nGoodalls yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Goodalls\xe2\x80\x94I used to know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe word was uttered with significance. Everard understood the\r\nallusion, but did not care to show that he did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does Mary get on without you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she any one capable of taking your place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Miss Vesper can do all that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven to inspiring the girls with zeal for an independent life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps even that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went along by the waves, in the warm-coloured twilight, until the\r\nhouses of Seascale were hidden. Then Everard stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow we go to Coniston?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling as he stood before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I can leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fell. She held the long strip of seaweed with both hands\r\nand tightened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you _wish_ me to leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that we are to go through the lakes together\xe2\x80\x94as we have been\r\nto-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda took a few steps onward, so that he remained standing behind.\r\nAnother moment and his arms had folded about her, his lips were on\r\nhers. She did not resist. His embrace grew stronger, and he pressed\r\nkiss after kiss upon her mouth. With exquisite delight he saw the deep\r\ncrimson flush that transfigured her countenance; saw her look for one\r\ninstant into his eyes, and was conscious of the triumphant gleam she\r\nmet there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember my saying in the letter how I hungered to taste your\r\nlips? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I have refrained so long\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your love worth?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rhoda, speaking with a great effort.\r\nShe had dropped the seaweed, and one of her hands rested upon his\r\nshoulder, with a slight repelling pressure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorth your whole life!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a low, glad laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I doubt. Convince me of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConvince you? With more kisses? But what is _your_ love worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps more than you yet understand. Perhaps more than you _can_\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will believe that, Rhoda. I know, at all events, that it is\r\nsomething of inestimable price. The knowledge has grown in me for a\r\nyear and more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me stand away from you again. There is something more to be said\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94No, let me be quite apart from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe released her after one more kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you answer me a question with perfect truthfulness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice was not quite steady, but she succeeded in looking at him\r\nwith unflinching eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I will answer you _any_ question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is spoken like a man. Tell me then\xe2\x80\x94is there at this moment any\r\nwoman living who has a claim upon you\xe2\x80\x94a moral claim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such woman exists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94do we speak the same language?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with great earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no woman to\r\nwhom I am bound by any kind of obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long wave rolled up, broke, and retreated, whilst Rhoda stood in\r\nsilent uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must put the question in another way. During the past month\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npast three months\xe2\x80\x94have you made profession of love\xe2\x80\x94have you even\r\npretended love\xe2\x80\x94to any woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo no woman whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat satisfies me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I knew what is in your mind!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Everard, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nsort of life have you imagined for me? Is this the result of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, she planted the suspicion. Believe me, you have been altogether\r\nmistaken. I never was the kind of man Mary thought me. Some day you\r\nshall understand more about it\xe2\x80\x94in the meantime my word must be enough.\r\nI have no thought of love for any woman but you. Did I frighten you\r\nwith those joking confessions in my letters? I wrote them purposely\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nyou must have seen. The mean, paltry jealousies of women such as one\r\nmeets every day are so hateful to me. They argue such a lack of brains.\r\nIf I were so unfortunate as to love a woman who looked sour when I\r\npraised a beautiful face, I would snap the bond between us like a bit\r\nof thread. But you are not one of those poor creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with some gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you think me a poor creature if I resented any kind of\r\nunfaithfulness?\xe2\x80\x94whether love, in any noble sense, had part in it or\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. That is the reasonable understanding between man and wife. If I\r\nexact fidelity from you, and certainly I should, I must consider myself\r\nunder the same obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say \xe2\x80\x9cman and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d Do you say it with the ordinary meaning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as it applies to us. You know what I mean when I ask you to be my\r\nwife. If we cannot trust each other without legal bonds, any union\r\nbetween us would be unjustified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuppressing the agitation which he felt, he awaited her answer. They\r\ncould still read each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces perfectly in a pale yellow light\r\nfrom across the sea. Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s manifested an intense conflict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, you doubt of your love for me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Barfoot quietly.\r\n\r\nThat was not her doubt. She loved with passion, allowing herself to\r\nindulge the luxurious emotion as never yet. She longed once more to\r\nfeel his arms about her. But even thus she could consider the vast\r\nissues of the step to which she was urged. The temptation to yield was\r\nvery strong, for it seemed to her an easier and a nobler thing to\r\nproclaim her emancipation from social statutes than to announce before\r\nher friends the simple news that she was about to marry. That\r\nannouncement would excite something more than surprise. Mary Barfoot\r\ncould not but smile with gentle irony; other women would laugh among\r\nthemselves; the girls would feel a shock, as at the fall of one who had\r\nmade heroic pretences. A sure way of averting this ridicule was by\r\nfurnishing occasion for much graver astonishment. If it became known\r\nthat she had taken a step such as few women would have dared to\r\ntake\xe2\x80\x94deliberately setting an example of new liberty\xe2\x80\x94her position in\r\nthe eyes of all who knew her remained one of proud independence.\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s character was specially exposed to the temptation of such a\r\nmotive. For months this argument had been in her mind, again and again\r\nshe decided that the sensational step was preferable to a commonplace\r\nrenunciation of all she had so vehemently preached. And now that the\r\nmoment of actual choice had come she felt able to dare everything\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nfar as the danger concerned herself; but she perceived more strongly\r\nthan hitherto that not only her own future was involved. How would such\r\npractical heresy affect Everard\xe2\x80\x99s position?\r\n\r\nShe uttered this thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you willing, for the sake of this idea, to abandon all society but\r\nthat of the very few people who would approve or tolerate what you have\r\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI look upon the thing in this way. We are not called upon to declare\r\nour principles wherever we go. If we regard each other as married, why,\r\nwe _are_ married. I am no Quixote, hoping to convert the world. It is\r\nbetween you and me\xe2\x80\x94our own sense of what is reasonable and dignified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you would not make it a mere deception?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary would of course be told, and any one else you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe believed him entirely serious. Another woman might have suspected\r\nthat he was merely trying her courage, either to assure himself of her\r\nlove or to gratify his vanity. But Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s idealism enabled her to take\r\nhim literally. She herself had for years maintained an exaggerated\r\nstandard of duty and merit; desirous of seeing Everard in a nobler\r\nlight than hitherto, she endeavoured to regard his scruple against\r\nformal wedlock as worthy of all respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t answer you at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, half turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must. Here and at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe one word of assent would have satisfied him. This he obstinately\r\nrequired. He believed that it would confirm his love beyond any other\r\nsatisfaction she could render him. He must be able to regard her as\r\nmagnanimous, a woman who had proved herself worth living or dying for.\r\nAnd he must have the joy of subduing her to his will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t answer you to-night. I can\xe2\x80\x99t decide so\r\nsuddenly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was disingenuous, and she felt humiliated by her subterfuge.\r\nAnything but a sudden decision was asked of her. Before leaving Chelsea\r\nshe had foreseen this moment, and had made preparations for the\r\npossibility of never returning to Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x94knowing the\r\nnature of the proposal that would be offered to her. But the practical\r\nresolve needed a greater effort than she had imagined. Above all, she\r\nfeared an ignominious failure of purpose after her word was given;\r\n_that_ would belittle her in Everard\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and so shame her in her\r\nown that all hope of happiness in marriage must be at an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are still doubtful of me, Rhoda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and again drew her close. But she refused her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr are you doubtful of your own love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. If I understand what love means, I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen give me the kiss I am waiting for. You have not kissed me yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94until I am sure of myself\xe2\x80\x94of my readiness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer broken words betrayed the passion with which she was struggling.\r\nEverard felt her tremble against his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe left hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore she could guess his purpose he had slipped a ring upon her\r\nfinger, a marriage ring. Rhoda started away from him, and at once drew\r\noff the perilous symbol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94that proves to me I can\xe2\x80\x99t! What should we gain? You see, you dare\r\nnot be quite consistent. It\xe2\x80\x99s only deceiving the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have explained to you. The consistency is in ourselves, our own\r\nminds\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it back. Custom is too strong for us. We should only play at\r\ndefying it. Take it back\xe2\x80\x94or I shall drop it on the sand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfoundly mortified, Everard restored the gold circlet to its\r\nhiding-place and stood gazing at the dim horizon. Some moments passed,\r\nthen he heard his name murmured. He did not look round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverard, dearest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas that Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s voice, so low, tender, caressing? It thrilled him, and\r\nwith a silent laugh of scorn at his own folly, he turned to her, every\r\nthought burnt up in passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you kiss me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an answer she laid her hands on his shoulders and gazed at him.\r\nBarfoot understood. He smiled constrainedly, and said in a low voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish for that old, idle form\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the religious form, which has no meaning for either of us. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been living here seven or eight days. Stay till the\r\nfifteenth, then we can get a licence from the registrar of the\r\ndistrict. Does that please you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes made reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me any the less, Everard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did, and consciousness was lost for them as their mouths clung\r\ntogether and their hearts throbbed like one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it better?\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda asked, as they walked back in the darkness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t it make our life so much simpler and happier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it will.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed joyously, trying to meet his look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall let no one hear of it until\xe2\x80\x94. Then let us go abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dare not face Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare, if you wish it. Of course she will laugh at me. They will all\r\nlaugh at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you may laugh as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have spoilt my life, you know. Such a grand life it might have\r\nbeen. Why did you come and interfere with me? And you have been so\r\nterribly obstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; that\xe2\x80\x99s my nature. But after all I have been weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYielding in one point that didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to you at all? It was the\r\nonly way of making sure that you loved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot laughed slightingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if I needed the other proof that you loved _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE UNIDEAL TESTED\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd neither was content.\r\n\r\nBarfoot, over his cigar and glass of whisky at the hotel, fell into a\r\nmood of chagrin. The woman he loved would be his, and there was matter\r\nenough for ardent imagination in the indulgence of that thought; but\r\nhis temper disturbed him. After all, he had not triumphed. As usual the\r\nwoman had her way. She played upon his senses, and made him her\r\nobedient slave. To prolong the conflict would have availed nothing;\r\nRhoda, doubtless, was in part actuated by the desire to conquer, and\r\nshe knew her power over him. So it was a mere repetition of the old\r\nstory\xe2\x80\x94a marriage like any other. And how would it result?\r\n\r\nShe had great qualities; but was there not much in her that he must\r\nsubdue, reform, if they were really to spend their lives together? Her\r\nenergy of domination perhaps excelled his. Such a woman might be unable\r\nto concede him the liberty in marriage which theoretically she granted\r\nto be just. Perhaps she would torment him with restless jealousies,\r\nsuspecting on every trivial occasion an infringement of her right. From\r\nthat point of view it would have been far wiser to persist in rejecting\r\nlegal marriage, that her dependence upon him might be more complete.\r\nLater, if all went well, the concession could have been made\xe2\x80\x94if, for\r\ninstance, she became a mother. But then returned the exasperating\r\nthought that Rhoda had overcome his will. Was not that a beginning of\r\nevil augury?\r\n\r\nTo be sure, after marriage their relations would be different. He would\r\nnot then be at the mercy of his senses. But how miserable to anticipate\r\na long, perhaps bitter, struggle for predominance. After all, that\r\ncould hardly come about. The commencement of any such discord would be\r\nthe signal for separation. His wealth assured his freedom. He was not\r\nlike the poor devils who must perforce live with an intolerable woman\r\nbecause they cannot support themselves and their families in different\r\nplaces. Need he entertain that worst of fears\xe2\x80\x94the dread that his\r\nindependence might fail him, subdued by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s will?\r\n\r\nFree as he boasted himself from lover\xe2\x80\x99s silliness, he had magnified\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s image. She was not the glorious rebel he had pictured. Like any\r\nother woman, she mistrusted her love without the sanction of society.\r\nWell, that was something relinquished, lost. Marriage would after all\r\nbe a compromise. He had not found his ideal\xe2\x80\x94though in these days it\r\nassuredly existed.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAnd Rhoda, sitting late in the little lodging-house parlour, visited\r\nher soul with questionings no less troublesome. Everard was not\r\nsatisfied with her. He had yielded, perhaps more than half\r\ncontemptuously, to what he thought a feminine weakness. In going with\r\nher to the registrar\xe2\x80\x99s office he would feel himself to be acting an\r\nignoble part. Was it not a bad beginning to rule him against his\r\nconscience?\r\n\r\nShe had triumphed splendidly. In the world\xe2\x80\x99s eye this marriage of hers\r\nwas far better than any she could reasonably have hoped, and her heart\r\napproved it with rapture. At a stage in life when she had sternly\r\nreconciled herself never to know a man\xe2\x80\x99s love, this love had sought her\r\nwith passionate persistency of which even a beautiful young girl might\r\nfeel proud. She had no beauty; she was loved for her mind, her very\r\nself. But must not Everard\xe2\x80\x99s conception of her have suffered? In\r\nwinning her had he obtained the woman of his desire?\r\n\r\nWhy was she not more politic? Would it not have been possible to\r\ngratify him, and yet to gain his consent to legal marriage? By first of\r\nall complying she would have seemed to confirm all he believed of her;\r\nand then, his ardour at height, how simple to point out to him\xe2\x80\x94without\r\nentreaty, without show of much concern\xe2\x80\x94that by neglecting formalities\r\nthey gained absolutely nothing. Artifice of that kind was perhaps\r\ndemanded by the mere circumstances. Possibly he himself would have\r\nwelcomed it\xe2\x80\x94after the grateful sense of inspiring such complete\r\ndevotion. It is the woman\xe2\x80\x99s part to exercise tact; she had proved\r\nherself lamentably deficient in that quality.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow she must study his manner. If she discerned any serious\r\nchange, any grave indication of disappointment\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWhat was her life to be? At first they would travel together; but\r\nbefore long it might be necessary to have a settled home, and what then\r\nwould be her social position, her duties and pleasures? Housekeeping,\r\nmere domesticities, could never occupy her for more than the smallest\r\npossible part of each day. Having lost one purpose in life, dignified,\r\nabsorbing, likely to extend its sphere as time went on, what other\r\ncould she hope to substitute for it?\r\n\r\nLove of husband\xe2\x80\x94perhaps of child. There must be more than that. Rhoda\r\ndid not deceive herself as to the requirements of her nature. Practical\r\nactivity in some intellectual undertaking; a share\xe2\x80\x94nay, leadership\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nsome \xe2\x80\x9cmovement;\xe2\x80\x9d contact with the revolutionary life of her time\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nimpulses of her heart once satisfied, these things would again claim\r\nher. But how if Everard resisted such tendencies? Was he in truth\r\ncapable of respecting her individuality? Or would his strong instinct\r\nof lordship urge him to direct his wife as a dependent, to impose upon\r\nher his own view of things? She doubted whether he had much genuine\r\nsympathy with woman\xe2\x80\x99s emancipation as she understood it. Yet in no\r\nparticular had her convictions changed; nor would they change. She\r\nherself was no longer one of the \xe2\x80\x9codd women\xe2\x80\x9d; fortune had\xe2\x80\x94or seemed to\r\nhave\xe2\x80\x94been kind to her; none the less her sense of a mission remained.\r\nNo longer an example of perfect female independence, and unable\r\ntherefore to use the same language as before, she might illustrate\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s claim of equality in marriage.\xe2\x80\x94If her experience proved no\r\nobstacle.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nNext morning, as had been agreed, they met at some distance from\r\nSeascale, and spent two or three hours together. There was little\r\ndanger in observation unless by a casual peasant; for the most part\r\ntheir privacy could not have been more secure in a locked chamber. Lest\r\ncuriosity should be excited by his making inquiries at the hotel,\r\nBarfoot proposed to walk over to Gosforth, the nearest town, this\r\nafternoon, and learn where the registrar for the locality of Seascale\r\nmight be found. By neither was allusion made to their difference of\r\nlast evening, but Rhoda distressed herself by imagining a diminished\r\nfervour in her companion; he seemed unusually silent and meditative,\r\nand was content to hold her hand now and then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you stay here all the week?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find it wearisome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, with you here. But if I run up to London for a day or two\r\nit might be better. There are preparations. We shall go first of all to\r\nmy rooms\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not have stayed in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might wish to make purchases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to some other town, and spend a few days there before\r\nleaving England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Manchester or Birmingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak rather impatiently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, looking at him with an\r\nuneasy smile. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it be London if you prefer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn no account. It\xe2\x80\x99s all indifferent to me so long as we get safely\r\naway together. Every man is impatient of these preliminaries. Yes, in\r\nthat case I must of course go up to London. To-morrow, and back on\r\nSaturday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shower of rain caused them some discomfort. Through the afternoon it\r\nstill rained at intervals whilst Barfoot was discharging his business\r\nat Gosforth. He was to see Rhoda again at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and as the\r\ntime threatened to hang heavily on his hands he returned by a long\r\ndetour, reaching the Seascale hotel about half-past six. No sooner had\r\nhe entered than there was delivered to him a letter, brought by\r\nmessenger an hour or two ago. It surprised him to recognize Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting on the envelope, which seemed to contain at least two sheets of\r\nnotepaper. What now? Some whimsey? Agitated and annoyed by the\r\nanticipation of trouble, he went apart and broke the letter open.\r\n\r\nFirst appeared an enclosure\xe2\x80\x94a letter in his cousin Mary\xe2\x80\x99s writing. He\r\nturned to the other sheet and read these lines,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI send you something that has come by post this afternoon. Please to\r\nbring it with you when you meet me at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94if you still care\r\nto do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face flushed with anger. What contemptible woman\xe2\x80\x99s folly was this?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you still care to do so\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and written in a hand that shook. If this\r\nwas to be his experience of matrimonial engagement\xe2\x80\x94What rubbish had\r\nMary been communicating?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy DEAR RHODA,\xe2\x80\x94I have just gone through a very painful scene, and I\r\nfeel bound to let you know of it without delay, as it _may_ concern\r\nyou. This evening (Monday), when I came home from Great Portland\r\nStreet, Emma told me that Mr. Widdowson had called, that he wished to\r\nsee me as soon as possible, and would be here again at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He\r\ncame, and his appearance alarmed me, he was looking so dreadfully ill.\r\nWithout preface, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife has left me; she has gone to her\r\nsister, and refuses to return.\xe2\x80\x9d This was astonishing in itself, and I\r\nwondered still more why he should come and tell _me_ about it in so\r\nstrange a way. The explanation followed very promptly, and you may\r\njudge how I heard it. Mr. Widdowson said that his wife had been\r\nbehaving very badly of late; that he had discovered several falsehoods\r\nshe had told him as to her employment during absences from home, in\r\ndaytime and evening. Having cause for suspecting the worst, he last\r\nSaturday engaged a private detective to follow Mrs. Widdowson wherever\r\nshe went. This man saw her go to the flats in Bayswater where Everard\r\nlives and knock at _his_ door. As no one replied, she went away for a\r\ntime and returned, but again found no one at home. This being at once\r\nreported to Mr. Widdowson he asked his wife where she had been that\r\nafternoon. The answer was false; she said she had been here, with me.\r\nThereupon he lost command of himself, and charged her with infidelity.\r\nShe refused to offer any kind of explanation, but denied that she was\r\nguilty and at once left the house. Since, she has utterly refused to\r\nsee him. Her sister can only report that Monica is very ill, and that\r\nshe charges her husband with accusing her falsely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had come to me, he said, in unspeakable anguish and helplessness,\r\nto ask me whether I had seen anything suspicious in the relations\r\nbetween Monica and my cousin when they met at this house or elsewhere.\r\nA nice question! Of course I could only reply that it had never even\r\noccurred to me to observe them\xe2\x80\x94that to my knowledge they had met so\r\nrarely\xe2\x80\x94and that I should never have dreamt of suspecting Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cYet\r\nyou see she _must_ be guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept on repeating. I said no, that I\r\nthought her visit _might_ have an innocent significance, though I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest why she had told falsehoods. Then he inquired what I\r\nknew about Everard\xe2\x80\x99s present movements. I answered that I had every\r\nreason to think that he was out of town, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when he went,\r\nor when he might be expected to return. The poor man was grievously\r\ndissatisfied; he looked at me as if I were in a base plot against him.\r\nIt was an immense relief when he went away, after begging me to respect\r\nhis confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write very hurriedly, as you see. That I _ought_ to write is, I\r\nthink, clear\xe2\x80\x94though I may be doing lamentable mischief. I cannot\r\ncredit this charge against Mrs. Widdowson; there must surely be some\r\nexplanation. If you have already left Seascale, no doubt this letter\r\nwill be forwarded.\xe2\x80\x94Ever yours, dear Rhoda,\r\n\r\nMARY BARFOOT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard laughed bitterly. The completeness of the case against him in\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes must be so overwhelming, and his absolute innocence made\r\nit exasperating to have to defend himself. How, indeed, was he to\r\ndefend himself?\r\n\r\nThe story was strange enough. Could he be right in the interpretation\r\nwhich at once suggested itself to his mind\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps to his vanity?\r\nHe remembered the meeting with Mrs. Widdowson near his abode on Friday.\r\nHe recollected, moreover, the signs of interest in himself which, as he\r\nnow thought, she had shown on previous occasions. Had the poor little\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94doubtless miserable with her husband\xe2\x80\x94actually let herself fall\r\nin love with him? But, even in that case, what a reckless thing to\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94to come to his rooms! Why, she must have been driven by a despair\r\nthat blinded her to all sense of delicacy! Perhaps, had he been at\r\nhome, she would have made a pretence of wishing to speak about Rhoda\r\nNunn. That was imprudent behaviour of his, making such a person his\r\nconfidante. But he was tempted by his liking for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, overcome by the thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad I was _not_\r\nat home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut then\xe2\x80\x94he had told her that he was going away on Saturday. How could\r\nshe expect to find him? The hour of her visit was not stated; probably\r\nshe hoped to catch him before he left. And was her appearance in the\r\nneighbourhood on Friday\xe2\x80\x94her troubled aspect\xe2\x80\x94to be explained as an\r\nabortive attempt to have a private interview with him?\r\n\r\nThe queerest affair\xe2\x80\x94and maddening in its issues! Rhoda was raging with\r\njealousy. Well, he too would rage. And without affectation. It was\r\nstrange that he felt almost glad of a ground of quarrel with Rhoda. All\r\nday he had been in an irritable temper, and so far as he could\r\nunderstand himself it was due to resentment of his last night\xe2\x80\x99s defeat.\r\nHe though of Rhoda as ardently as ever, but an element that was very\r\nlike brutality had intruded into his emotions; that was his reason from\r\nrefraining from caresses this morning; he could not trust himself.\r\n\r\nHe would endure no absurdities. If Rhoda did not choose to accept his\r\nsimple assurance\xe2\x80\x94let her take the consequences. Even now, perhaps, he\r\nwould bring her to her knees before him. Let her wrong him by baseless\r\naccusation! Then it would no longer be _he_ who sued for favour. He\r\nwould whistle her down the wind, and await her penitent reappearance.\r\nSooner or later his pride and hers, the obstinacy in their natures,\r\nmust battle it out; better that it should be now, before the\r\nirrevocable step had been taken.\r\n\r\nHe ate his dinner with savage appetite, and drank a good deal more wine\r\nthan of wont. Then he smoked until the last minute of delay that his\r\nengagement allowed. Of course she had sent the letter to the hotel\r\nbecause he might be unable to read it in twilight. Wise precaution. And\r\nhe was glad to have been able to think the matter over, to work himself\r\ninto reasonable wrath. If ever man did well to be angry\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nThere she was, down by the edge of the waves. She would not turn to see\r\nif he were coming; he felt sure of that. Whether she heard his\r\nfootsteps he could not tell. When quite close to her, he exclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Rhoda?\xe2\x80\x9d She must have known of his approach, for she gave no\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nShe faced slowly to him. No trace of tears on her countenance; no,\r\nRhoda was above that. Gravity of the sternest\xe2\x80\x94that was all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have you to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that it is my business to explain what Mary has told you. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t, so there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in clear, distant tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely what I say, Rhoda. And I am obliged to ask what _you_ mean\r\nby this odd way of speaking to me. What has happened since we parted\r\nthis morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda could not suppress her astonishment; she gazed fixedly at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t explain this letter, who can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Mrs. Widdowson would be able to account for her doings. I\r\ncertainly am not able to. And it seems to me that you are strangely\r\nforgetful of something that passed between us yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked coldly, her face, which was held proudly up,\r\nturning towards the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently you accuse me of concealing something from you. Please to\r\nremember a certain plain question you asked me, and the equally plain\r\nanswer I gave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe detected the beginning of a smile about her rigid lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can still behave to me with indignation? Surely the\r\nindignation should be on my side. You are telling me that I deceived\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Rhoda lost her self-control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help thinking so?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a gesture of misery.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can this letter mean? Why should she go to your rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Rhoda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe preserved the show of calmness just because he saw that it provoked\r\nher to anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has never been there before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever to my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda watched his face with greedy attention. She seemed to find there\r\na confirmation of her doubts. Indeed, it was impossible for her to\r\ncredit his denials after what she had observed in London, and the\r\ncircumstances which, even before Mary\xe2\x80\x99s letter, had made her suspicious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you last see Mrs. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t consent to be cross-examined,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Everard, with a\r\ndisdainful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as you refuse to accept my word it\xe2\x80\x99s folly\r\nto ask further questions. You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. Say it honestly and let\r\nus understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have good reason for thinking that you could explain Mrs.\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour if you chose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. There\xe2\x80\x99s no misunderstanding _that_. And if I get angry I am\r\nan unpardonable brute. Come now, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be offended if I treat you\r\nas simply my equal, Rhoda. Let me test your sincerity. Suppose I had\r\nseen you talking somewhere with some man who seemed to interest you\r\nvery much, and then\xe2\x80\x94to-day, let us say\xe2\x80\x94I heard that he had called\r\nupon you when you were alone. I turn with a savage face and accuse you\r\nof grossly deceiving me\xe2\x80\x94in the worst sense. What would your answer be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are idle suppositions,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the case is possible, you must admit. I want you to realize what I\r\nam feeling. In such a case as that, you could only turn from me with\r\ncontempt. How else can I behave to _you_\xe2\x80\x94conscious of my innocence,\r\nyet in the nature of things unable to prove it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAppearances are very strongly against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an accident\xe2\x80\x94to me quite unaccountable. If I charged you with\r\ndishonour you would only have your word to offer in reply. So it is\r\nwith me. And my word is bluntly rejected. You try me rather severely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda kept silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you are thinking.  My character was previously none of the best.\r\nThere is a prejudice against me in such a matter as this. Well,\r\nyou shall hear some more plain speech, altogether for your good.  My record\r\nis not immaculate; nor, I believe, is any mans.  I have gone here\r\nand there, and have had my adventures like other men. One of them you\r\nhave heard about\xe2\x80\x94the story of that girl Amy Drake\xe2\x80\x94the subject of Mrs.\r\nGoodall\xe2\x80\x99s righteous wrath. You shall know the truth, and if it offends\r\nyour ears I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. The girl simply threw herself into my arms,\r\non a railway journey, when we met by pure chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to hear that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you _shall_ hear it. That story has predisposed you to believe the\r\nworst things of me. If I hold you by force, you shall hear every word\r\nof it. Mary seems to have given you mere dark hints\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she has told me the details. I know it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom their point of view. Very well; that saves me a lot of narrative.\r\nWhat those good people didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand was the girl\xe2\x80\x99s character. They\r\nthought her a helpless innocent; she was a\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll spare you the word.\r\nShe simply planned to get me into her power\xe2\x80\x94thought I should be forced\r\nto marry her. It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that happens far oftener than you\r\nwould suppose; that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why men so often smile in what you\r\nwould call a brutal way when certain stories are told to other men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscredit. You will have to take this into account, Rhoda, before you\r\nreach satisfactory results on the questions that have occupied you so\r\nmuch. I was not in the least responsible for Amy Drake\xe2\x80\x99s desertion of\r\ncreditable paths. At the worst I behaved foolishly; and knowing I had\r\ndone so, knowing how thankless it was to try and clear myself at her\r\nexpense, I let people say what they would; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. And you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe me; I can see you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Sexual pride won\xe2\x80\x99t let you\r\nbelieve me. In such a case the man must necessarily be the villain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you mean by saying you only behaved \xe2\x80\x9cfoolishly,\xe2\x80\x9d I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain as I once did in telling the story to\r\na man, a friend of mine. But however strict your moral ideas, you will\r\nadmit that a girl of thoroughly bad character isn\xe2\x80\x99t a subject for the\r\noutcry that was raised about Miss Amy Drake. By taking a little trouble\r\nI could have brought things to light which would have given worthy Mrs.\r\nGoodall and cousin Mary a great shock. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. I have\r\nnever pretended to sanctity; but, on the other hand, I have never\r\nbehaved like a scoundrel. You charge me, deliberately, with being a\r\nscoundrel, and I defend myself as best I can. You argue that the man\r\nwho would mislead an innocent girl and then cast her off is more likely\r\nthan not to be guilty in a case like this of Mrs. Widdowson, when\r\nappearances are decidedly against him. There is only my word in each\r\ninstance. The question is\xe2\x80\x94Will you accept my word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a wonder, their privacy was threatened by the approach of two men\r\nwho were walking this way from Seascale. Voices in conversation caused\r\nRhoda to look round; Barfoot had already observed the strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go up on to the higher sand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nWithout reply Rhoda accompanied him, and for several minutes they\r\nexchanged no word. The men, talking and laughing loudly, went by; they\r\nseemed to be tourists of a kind that do not often trouble this quiet\r\nspot on the coast; their cigars glowed in the dusk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all this, what have you to say to me, Rhoda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you please to give me your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x9d she said coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is. Now you will go back to your lodgings, and sit with that\r\nletter open before you half through the night. You will make yourself\r\nunutterably wretched, and all for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt himself once more in danger of weakness. Rhoda, in her haughty,\r\nresentful mood, was very attractive to him. He was tempted to take her\r\nin his arms, and kiss her until she softened, pleaded with him. He\r\nwished to see her shed tears. But the voice in which she now spoke to\r\nhim was far enough from tearfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must prove to me that you have been wrongly suspected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, that was to be her line of conduct. She believed her power over him\r\nwas absolute. She stood on her dignity, would bring him to\r\nsupplication, would give him all the trouble she could before she\r\nprofessed herself satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to prove it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked bluntly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there was nothing wrong between you and Mrs. Widdowson, there must\r\nbe some very simple explanation of her coming to your rooms and being\r\nso anxious to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it my business to discover that explanation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must either be yours, Rhoda, or no one\xe2\x80\x99s. I shall take no single\r\nstep in the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe battle was declared. Each stood at full height, pertinacious,\r\nresolved on victory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are putting yourself wildly in the wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Everard continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nrefusing to take my word you make it impossible for me to hope that we\r\ncould live together as we imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words fell upon her heart like a crushing weight. But she could not\r\nyield. Last night she had suffered in his opinion by urging what he\r\nthought a weak, womanly scruple; she had condescended to plead tenderly\r\nwith him, and had won her cause. Now she would prevail in another way.\r\nIf he were telling the truth, he should acknowledge that natural\r\nsuspicion made it incumbent upon him to clear so strange a case of its\r\ndifficulties. If he were guilty of deception, as she still believed,\r\nthough willing to admit to herself that Monica might be most at fault,\r\nthat there might have been no actual wrongdoing between them\xe2\x80\x94he should\r\nconfess with humblest penitence, and beseech pardon. Impossible to take\r\nany other attitude. Impossible to marry him with this doubt in her\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94equally out of the question to seek Monica, and humiliate herself\r\nby making inquiries on such a subject. Guilty or not, Monica would\r\nregard her with secret disdain, with woman\xe2\x80\x99s malice. Were she _able_ to\r\nbelieve him, that indeed would be a grand consummation of their love,\r\nan ideal union of heart and soul. Listening to him, she had tried to\r\nput faith in his indignant words. But it was useless. The incredulity\r\nshe could not help must either part them for ever, or be to her an\r\noccasion of new triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse to take your word,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with conscious quibbling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only say that your name must be cleared from suspicion. Mr.\r\nWiddowson is sure to tell his story to other people. Why has his wife\r\nleft him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI neither know nor care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must prove to me that you are not the cause of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not make the slightest effort to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda began to move away from him. As he kept silence, she walked on in\r\nthe Seascale direction. He followed at a distance of a few yards,\r\nwatching her movements. When they had gone so far that five minutes\r\nmore must bring them within sight of the hotel, Everard spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRhoda!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused and awaited him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember that I was going to London to-morrow. It seems that I had\r\nbetter go and not trouble to return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is for you to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said all that I _can_ say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so have I. But surely you must be unconscious how grossly you are\r\ninsulting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want only to understand what purpose Mrs. Widdowson had in going to\r\nyour rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why not ask her? You are friends. She would doubtless tell you\r\nthe truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she comes to me voluntarily to make an explanation, I will hear it.\r\nBut I shall not ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour view of the fitness of things is that I should request her to\r\nwait upon you for that purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are others who can act for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Then we are at a deadlock. It seems to me that we had\r\nbetter shake hands like sensible people, and say good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better\xe2\x80\x94if it seems so to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time for emotional help was past. In very truth they had nothing\r\nmore to say to each other, being now hardened in obstinacy. Each\r\nsuffered from the other\xe2\x80\x99s coldness, each felt angry with the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstubborn refusal to concede a point of dignity. Everard put out his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are ready to say that you have used me very ill, I shall\r\nremember only yesterday. Till then\xe2\x80\x94good-bye, Rhoda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a show of taking his hand, but said nothing. And so they\r\nparted.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock next morning Barfoot was seated in the southward\r\ntrain. He rejoiced that his strength of will had thus far asserted\r\nitself. Of final farewell to Rhoda he had no thought whatever. Her\r\ncuriosity would, of course, compel her to see Monica; one way or\r\nanother she would learn that he was blameless. His part was to keep\r\naloof from her, and to wait for her inevitable submission.\r\n\r\nViolent rain was beating upon the carriage windows; it drove from the\r\nmountains, themselves invisible, though dense low clouds marked their\r\nposition. Poor Rhoda! She would not have a very cheerful day at\r\nSeascale. Perhaps she would follow him by a later train. Certain it was\r\nthat she must be suffering intensely\xe2\x80\x94and that certainly rejoiced him.\r\nThe keener her suffering the sooner her submission. Oh, but the\r\nsubmission should be perfect! He had seen her in many moods, but not\r\nyet in the anguish of broken pride. She must shed tears before him,\r\ndeclare her spirit worn and subjugated by torment of jealousy and fear.\r\nThen he would raise her, and seat her in the place of honour, and fall\r\ndown at her feet, and fill her soul with rapture.\r\n\r\nMany times between Seascale and London he smiled in anticipation of\r\nthat hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE REASCENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the rain pelted, and it did so until afternoon, Rhoda sat in her\r\nlittle parlour, no whit less miserable than Barfoot imagined. She could\r\nnot be sure whether Everard had gone to London; at the last moment\r\nreflection or emotion might have detained him. Early in the morning she\r\nhad sent to post a letter for Miss Barfoot, written last night\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nletter which made no revelation of her feelings, but merely expressed a\r\ncold curiosity to hear anything that might become known as to the\r\ncourse of Mr. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s domestic troubles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may still write to\r\nthis address; if I leave, letters shall be forwarded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the sky cleared she went out. In the evening she again rambled\r\nabout the shore. Evidently Barfoot had gone; if still here, he would\r\nhave watched and joined her.\r\n\r\nHer solitude now grew insufferable, yet she could not decide whither to\r\nbetake herself. The temptation to return to London was very strong, but\r\npride prevailed against it. Everard might perhaps go to see his cousin,\r\nand relate all that had happened at Seascale, justifying himself as he\r\nhad here done. Whether Miss Barfoot became aware of the story or not,\r\nRhoda could not reconcile it with her self-respect to curtail the\r\nstipulated three weeks of holiday. Rather she would strain her nerves\r\nto the last point of endurance\xe2\x80\x94and if she were not suffering, then\r\nnever did woman suffer.\r\n\r\nAnother cheerless day helped her to make up her mind. She cared nothing\r\nnow for lake and mountain; human companionship was her supreme need. By\r\nthe earliest train next day she started, not for London, but for her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s home in Somerset, and there she remained until it was time to\r\nreturn to work. Miss Barfoot wrote twice in the interval, saying that\r\nshe had heard nothing more of Monica. Of Everard she made no mention.\r\n\r\nRhoda got back again to Chelsea on the appointed Saturday afternoon.\r\nMiss Barfoot knew when she would arrive, but was not at home to meet\r\nher, and did not return till a couple of hours had passed. They met at\r\nlength as if nothing remarkable had occurred during the three weeks.\r\nMary, if she felt any solicitude, effectually concealed it; Rhoda\r\ntalked as if very glad to be at home again, explaining her desertion of\r\nthe lake country by the bad weather that prevailed there. It was not\r\ntill after dinner that the inevitable subject came up between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Everard since you went away?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barfoot began by\r\nasking.\r\n\r\nSo he had not been here to tell his story and plead his cause\xe2\x80\x94or it\r\nseemed not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him at Seascale,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda replied, without sign of emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore or after that news came?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth before and after. I showed him your letter, and all he had to say\r\nwas that he knew nothing of the affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all he has to say to me. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him. A letter I sent to\r\nhis address was answered, after a week, from a place I never heard\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94Arromanches, in Normandy. The shortest and rudest letter I ever had\r\nfrom him. Practically he told me to mind my own business. And there\r\nthings stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda smiled a little, conscious of the extreme curiosity her friend\r\nmust be feeling, and determined not to gratify it. For by this time,\r\nthough her sunken cheeks were hard to reconcile with the enjoyment of a\r\nsummer holiday, she had matured a resolve to betray nothing of what she\r\nhad gone through. Her state of mind resembled that of the ascetic who\r\nhas arrived at a morbid delight in self-torture. She regarded the world\r\nwith an intense bitterness, and persuaded herself not only that the\r\nthought of Everard Barfoot was hateful to her soul, but that sexual\r\nlove had become, and would ever be, to her an impure idea, a vice of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she said carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Widdowson will try to divorce\r\nhis wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in dread of that. But they may have made it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have no doubt of her guilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary tried to understand the hard, austere face, with its touch of\r\ncynicism. Conjecture as to its meaning was not difficult, but, in the\r\nutter absence of information, certainty there could be none. Under any\r\ncircumstances, it was to be expected that Rhoda would think and speak\r\nof Mrs. Widdowson no less severely than of the errant Bella Royston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have _some_ doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d was Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s answer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I should be glad\r\nof some one else\xe2\x80\x99s favourable opinion to help my charity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madden hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been here, you see. She certainly would have come\r\nif she had felt convinced that her sister was wronged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless a day or two saw the end of the trouble\xe2\x80\x94when naturally none of\r\nthem would say any more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the possibility which occupied Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s reflections as long as\r\nshe lay awake that night.\r\n\r\nHer feelings on entering the familiar bedroom were very strange. Even\r\nbefore starting for her holiday she had bidden it good-bye, and at\r\nSeascale, that night following upon the \xe2\x80\x9cperfect day,\xe2\x80\x9d she had thought\r\nof it as a part of her past life, a place abandoned for ever, already\r\ninfinitely remote. Her first sensation when she looked upon the white\r\nbed was one of disgust; she thought it would be impossible to use this\r\nroom henceforth, and that she must ask Miss Barfoot to let her change\r\nto another. To-night she did not restore any of the ornaments which were\r\nlying packed up. The scent of the room revived so many hours of\r\nconflict, of hope, that it caused her a sick faintness. In frenzy of\r\ndetestation she cursed the man who had so disturbed and sullied the\r\nswift, pure stream of her life.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nArromanches, in Normandy\xe2\x80\x94? On Sunday she sought the name on a map, but\r\nit was not marked, being doubtless too insignificant. Improbable that\r\nhe had gone to such a place alone; he was enjoying himself with\r\nfriends, careless what became of her. Having allowed all this time to\r\ngo by he would never seek her again. He found that her will was the\r\nequal of his own, and, as he could not rule her, she was numbered among\r\nthe women who had afforded him interesting experiences, to be thought\r\nof seriously no more.\r\n\r\nDuring the next week she threw herself with energy upon her work,\r\nstifling the repugnance with which at first it affected her, and\r\nseeming at length to recover the old enthusiasm. This was the only way\r\nof salvation. Idleness and absence of purpose would soon degrade her in\r\na sense she had never dreamt of. She made a plan of daily occupation,\r\nwhich by leaving not a vacant moment from early morning to late at\r\nnight, should give her the sleep of utter weariness. New studies were\r\nbegun in the hour or two before breakfast. She even restricted her\r\ndiet, and ate only just enough to support life, rejecting wine and\r\neverything that was most agreeable to her palate.\r\n\r\nShe desired to speak privately with Mildred Vesper, and opportunity\r\nmight have been made, but, as part of her scheme of self-subdual, this\r\nconversation was postponed until the second week. It took place one\r\nevening when work was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been wanting to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda began, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you have any\r\nnews of Mrs. Widdowson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to her not long ago, and she answered from a new address. She\r\nsaid she had left her husband and would never go back to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what I had heard was true. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe asked me not to come. She is living with her sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she give you any reason for the separation from her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mildred. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she said it was no secret; that every\r\none knew. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to you about it\xe2\x80\x94as I should have\r\ndone otherwise after our last conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is no secret,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why will she offer no\r\nexplanation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMildred shook her head, signifying inability to make any satisfactory\r\nreply, and there the dialogue ended; for Rhoda could not proceed in it\r\nwithout appearing to encourage scandal. The hope of eliciting some\r\nsuggestive information had failed; but whether Mildred had really\r\ndisclosed all she knew seemed doubtful.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week Miss Barfoot left home for her own holiday; she\r\nwas going to Scotland, and would be away for nearly the whole of\r\nSeptember. At this time of the year the work in Great Portland Street\r\nwas very light; not much employment offered for the typewriters, and\r\nthe pupils numbered only about half a dozen. Nevertheless, it pleased\r\nRhoda to have the establishment under her sole direction; she desired\r\nauthority, and by magnifying the importance of that which now fell into\r\nher hands, she endeavoured to sustain herself under the secret misery\r\nwhich, for all her efforts, weighed no less upon her as time went on.\r\nIt was a dreary make-believe. On the first night of solitude at Chelsea\r\nshe shed bitter tears; and not only wept, but agonized in mute frenzy,\r\nthe passions of her flesh torturing her until she thought of death as a\r\nrefuge. Now she whispered the name of her lover with every word and\r\nphrase of endearment that her heart could suggest; the next moment she\r\ncursed him with the fury of deadliest hatred. In the half-delirium of\r\nsleeplessness, she revolved wild, impossible schemes for revenging\r\nherself, or, as the mood changed, all but resolved to sacrifice\r\neverything to her love, to accuse herself of ignoble jealousy and\r\nentreat forgiveness. Of many woeful nights this was the worst she had\r\nyet suffered.\r\n\r\nIt recalled to her with much vividness a memory of girlhood, or indeed\r\nof childhood. She thought of that figure in the dim past, that rugged,\r\nharsh-featured man, who had given her the first suggestion of\r\nindependence; thrice her own age, yet the inspirer of such tumultuous\r\nemotion in her ignorant heart; her friend at Clevedon\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Smithson. A\r\nquestion from Mary Barfoot had caused her to glance back at him across\r\nthe years, but only for an instant, and with self-mockery. What she now\r\nendured was the ripe intensity of a woe that fell upon her, at fifteen,\r\nwhen Mr. Smithson passed from her sight and away for ever. Childish\r\nfolly! but the misery of it, the tossing at night, the blank outlook!\r\nHow contemptible to revive such sensations, with mature intellect,\r\nafter so long and stern a discipline!\r\n\r\nDreading the Sunday, so terrible in its depressing effect upon the\r\nlonely and unhappy, she breakfasted as soon as possible, and left\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94simply to walk, to exert herself physically, that fatigue and\r\nsleep might follow. There was a dull sky, but no immediate fear of\r\nrain; the weather brightened a little towards noon. Careless of the\r\ndirection, she walked on and on until the last maddening church bell\r\nhad ceased its clangour; she was far out in the western suburbs, and\r\nweariness began to check her quick pace. Then she turned back. Without\r\nintending it, she passed by Mrs. Cosgrove\xe2\x80\x99s house, or rather would have\r\npassed, when she saw Mrs. Cosgrove at the dining-room window making\r\nsigns to her. In a moment the door opened and she went in. She was glad\r\nof this accident, for the social lady might have something to tell\r\nabout Mrs. Widdowson, who often visited her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn mercy, come and talk to me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Cosgrove. \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite\r\nalone, and feel as if I could hang myself. Are you obliged to go\r\nanywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I was having a walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA walk? What astonishing energy! It never occurs to me to take a walk\r\nin London. I came from the country last night and expected to find my\r\nsister here, but she won\xe2\x80\x99t arrive till Tuesday. I have been standing at\r\nthe window for an hour, getting crazy with _ennui_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to the drawing-room. It was not long before Mrs. Cosgrove\r\nmade an allusion which enabled Rhoda to speak of Mrs. Widdowson. For a\r\nmonth or more Mrs. Cosgrove had seen and heard nothing of her; she had\r\nbeen out of town all the time. Rhoda hesitated, but could not keep\r\nsilence on the subject that had become a morbid preoccupation of her\r\nmind. She told as much as she knew\xe2\x80\x94excepting the suspicion against\r\nEverard Barfoot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the listener, with\r\ninterest. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to live together very well.\r\nWithout children the thing was impossible. Of course she has told you\r\nall about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her since it happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I always have a distinct feeling of pleasure when I hear\r\nof married people parting. How horrible that would seem to some of our\r\ngood friends! But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a malicious pleasure; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\npersonal in it. As I have told you before, I think, I led a very\r\ncontented life with my husband. But marriage in general is _such_ a\r\nhumbug\xe2\x80\x94you forgive the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Rhoda, laughing with forced gaiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of anything that seems to threaten it as an institution\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nits present form. A scandalous divorce case is a delight to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94anything that makes it evident how much misery would be spared if\r\nwe could civilize ourselves in this respect. There are women whose\r\nconduct I think personally detestable, and whom yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nthanking for their assault upon social laws. We shall have to go\r\nthrough a stage of anarchy, you know, before reconstruction begins.\r\nYes, in that sense I am an anarchist. Seriously, I believe if a few men\r\nand women in prominent position would contract marriage of the free\r\nkind, without priest or lawyer, open and defiantly, they would do more\r\nbenefit to their kind than in any other possible way. I don\xe2\x80\x99t declare\r\nthis opinion to every one, but only because I am a coward. Whatever one\r\nbelieves with heart and soul one ought to make known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda wore a look of anxious reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt needs a great deal of courage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo take that step, I\r\nmean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. We need martyrs. And yet I doubt whether the martyrdom\r\nwould be very long, or very trying, to intellectual people. A woman of\r\nbrains who boldly acted upon her conviction would have no lack of\r\ncongenial society. The best people are getting more liberal than they\r\ncare to confess to each other. Wait until some one puts the matter to\r\nthe test and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda became so busy with her tumultuous thoughts that she spoke only a\r\nword now and then, allowing Mrs. Cosgrove to talk at large on this\r\nengrossing theme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mrs. Widdowson living?\xe2\x80\x9d the revolutionist at length inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But I can get you her address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray do. I shall go and see her. We are quite friendly enough for me\r\nto do so without impertinence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving lunched with her acquaintance, Rhoda went in the afternoon to\r\nMildred Vesper\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings. Miss Vesper was at home, reading, in her\r\nusual placid mood. She gave Rhoda the address that was on Mrs.\r\nWiddowson\xe2\x80\x99s last brief note, and that evening Rhoda sent it to Mrs.\r\nCosgrove by letter.\r\n\r\nIn two days she received a reply. Mrs. Cosgrove had called upon Mrs.\r\nWiddowson at her lodgings at Clapham. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is ill, wretched, and\r\nunwilling to talk. I could only stay about a quarter of an hour, and to\r\nask questions was impossible. She mentioned your name, and appeared\r\nvery anxious to hear about you; but when I asked whether she would like\r\nyou to call she grew timid all at once, and said she hoped you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunless you really desired to see her. Poor thing! Of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what it all means, but I came away with maledictions on marriage\r\nin my heart\xe2\x80\x94one is always safe in indulging that feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA week or so after this there arrived for Miss Barfoot a letter from\r\nEverard. The postmark was Ostend.\r\n\r\nNever before had Rhoda been tempted to commit a break of confidence\r\nsuch as in any one else she would have scorned beyond measure. She had\r\nheard, of course, of people secretly opening letters with the help of\r\nsteam; whether it could be done with absolute security from detection\r\nshe did not feel sure, but her thoughts dwelt on the subject for\r\nseveral hours. It was terrible to hold this letter of Everard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting, and yet be obliged to send it away without knowledge of the\r\ncontents, which perhaps gravely concerned her. She could not ask Miss\r\nBarfoot to let her know what Everard had written. The information might\r\nperhaps be voluntarily granted; but perhaps not.\r\n\r\nTo steam the back of the envelope\xe2\x80\x94would it not leave marks, a rumpling\r\nor discoloration? Even to be suspected of such dishonour would be more\r\nbitter to her than death. Could she even think of it? How she was\r\ndegraded by this hateful passion, which wrought in her like a disease!\r\n\r\nWith two others which that day had arrived she put the letter into a\r\nlarge envelope, and so dispatched it. But no satisfaction rewarded her;\r\nher heart raged against the world, against every law of life.\r\n\r\nWhen, in a few days, a letter came to her from Miss Barfoot, she tore\r\nit open, and there\xe2\x80\x94yes, there was Everard\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting. Mary had sent\r\nthe communication for her to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR COUSIN MARY,\xe2\x80\x94After all I was rather too grumpy in my last note\r\nto you. But my patience had been desperately tried. I have gone through\r\na good deal; now at last I am recovering sanity, and can admit that you\r\nhad no choice but to ask those questions. I know and care nothing about\r\nMrs. Widdowson. By her eccentric behaviour she either did me a great\r\ninjury or a great service, I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure which, but I incline to\r\nthe latter view. Here is a conundrum\xe2\x80\x94not very difficult to solve, I\r\ndare say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything about Arromanches? A very quiet little spot on\r\nthe Normandy coast. You get to it by an hour\xe2\x80\x99s coach from Bayeux. Not\r\ninfested by English. I went there on an invitation from the\r\nBrissendens; who discovered the place last year. Excellent people\r\nthese. I like them better the more I know of them. A great deal of\r\nquiet liberality\xe2\x80\x94even extreme liberality\xe2\x80\x94in the two girls. They would\r\nsuit you, I am sure. Well instructed. Agnes, the younger, reads half a\r\ndozen languages, and shames me by her knowledge of all sorts of things.\r\nAnd yet delightfully feminine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs they were going to Ostend I thought I might as well follow them,\r\nand we continue to see each other pretty frequently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye, I shall have to find new quarters if I come back to\r\nLondon. The engineer, back from Italy after a longer absence than he\r\nanticipated, wants his flat, and of course must have it. But then I may\r\nnot come back at all, except to gather my traps. I shall not call on\r\nyou, unless I have heard that you don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt the assurance I have now\r\ntwice given.\xe2\x80\x94Your profligate relative,\r\n\r\nE. B.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we may safely believe him. Such a lie\r\nwould be too bad; he is incapable of it. Remember, I have never charged\r\nhim with falsehood. I shall write and tell him that I accept his word.\r\nHas it, or has it not, occurred to you to see Mrs. Widdowson herself?\r\nOr, if there are insuperable objections, why not see Miss Madden? We\r\ntalk to each other in a sort of cypher, dear Rhoda. Well, I desire\r\nnothing but your good, as I think you know, and you must decide for\r\nyourself where that good lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard\xe2\x80\x99s letter put Rhoda beside herself with wrath. In writing it he\r\nknew it would come into her hands; he hoped to sting her with jealousy.\r\nSo Mrs. Widdowson had done him a service. He was free to devote himself\r\nto Agnes Brissenden, with her six languages, her extreme liberality,\r\nher feminine charm.\r\n\r\nIf she could not crush out her love for this man she would poison\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94as she had so often decided she would do if ever some hopeless\r\nmalady, such as cancer, took hold upon her\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd be content to feed his vanity? To give him the lifelong reflection\r\nthat, for love of him, a woman excelled by few in qualities of brain\r\nand heart had died like a rat?\r\n\r\nShe walked about the rooms, here and there, upstairs and downstairs, in\r\na fever of unrest. After all, was he not behaving in the very way she\r\nought to desire? Was he not helping her to hate him? He struck at her\r\nwith unmanly blows, thinking, no doubt, to quell her pride, and bring\r\nher to him in prostrate humility. Never! Even if it were proved in the\r\nclearest way that she ought to have believed him she would make no\r\nsubmission. If he loved her he must woo once more.\r\n\r\nBut the suggestion in Mary\xe2\x80\x99s letter was not fruitless. When she had\r\nthought over it for a day or two she wrote to Virginia Madden, asking\r\nher as a favour to come to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road on Saturday afternoon. Virginia\r\nquickly replied with a promise to call, and punctually kept the\r\nengagement. Though she was much better dressed than in the days\r\nprevious to Monica\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, she had lost something for which costume\r\ncould not compensate: her face had no longer that unmistakable\r\nrefinement which had been wont to make her attire a secondary\r\nconsideration. A disagreeable redness tinged her eyelids and the lower\r\npart of her nose; her mouth was growing coarse and lax, the under-lip\r\nhanging a little; she smiled with a shrinking, apologetic shyness only\r\nseen in people who have done something to be ashamed of\xe2\x80\x94smiled even\r\nwhen she was endeavouring to look sorrowful; and her glance was\r\nfurtive. She sat down on the edge of a chair, like an anxious applicant\r\nfor work or charity, and a moistness of the eyes, which obliged her to\r\nuse her handkerchief frequently, strengthened this resemblance.\r\n\r\nRhoda could not play at smooth phrases with this poor, dispirited\r\nwoman, whose change during the last few years, and especially during\r\nthe last twelve months, had often occupied her thoughts in a very\r\nunpleasant way. She came almost at once to the subject of their\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you not been to see me before this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. The circumstances\xe2\x80\x94everything is so very painful.\r\nYou know\xe2\x80\x94of course you know what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Virginia timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cdid the news first of all reach you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Widdowson came here and told Miss Barfoot everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came? We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that. Then you have heard the accusation he\r\nmakes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite unfounded, I do assure you. Monica is not guilty. The poor\r\nchild has done nothing\xe2\x80\x94it was an indiscretion\xe2\x80\x94nothing more than\r\nindiscretion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very anxious to believe it. Can you give me certainty? Can you\r\nexplain Monica\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour\xe2\x80\x94not only on that one occasion, but the\r\ndeceit she practised at other times? Her husband told Miss Barfoot that\r\nshe had frequently told him untruths\xe2\x80\x94such as saying that she called\r\nhere when she certainly did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain that,\xe2\x80\x9d lamented Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cMonica won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me why\r\nshe concealed her movements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how can you ask me to believe your assurance that she isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nguilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sternness of this question caused Virginia to redden and become\r\nutterly disconcerted. She dropped her handkerchief, fumbled for it,\r\nbreathed hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Nunn! How can you think Monica\xe2\x80\x94? You know her better; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure you do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny human being may commit a crime,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other impatiently,\r\nexasperated by what seemed to be merely new evidence against Barfoot.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows any one well enough to say that a charge _must_ be\r\nunfounded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Madden began to sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that is true. But my sister\xe2\x80\x94my dear sister\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to distress you. Do command yourself, and let us talk\r\nabout it calmly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I will\xe2\x80\x94I shall be so glad to talk about it with you. Oh, if I\r\ncould persuade her to return to her husband! He is willing to receive\r\nher. I meet him very often on Clapham Common, and\xe2\x80\x94We are living at his\r\nexpense. When Monica had been with me in my old lodgings for about a\r\nweek he took these new rooms for us, and Monica consented to remove.\r\nBut she won\xe2\x80\x99t hear of going back to live with him. He has offered to\r\nlet us have the house to ourselves, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no use. He writes to her,\r\nbut she won\xe2\x80\x99t reply. Do you know that he has taken a house at\r\nClevedon\xe2\x80\x94a beautiful house? They were to go to it in a week or two,\r\nand Alice and I would have gone to share it with them\xe2\x80\x94then this\r\ndreadful thing happened. And Mr. Widdowson doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even insist on her\r\ntelling him what she keeps secret. He is willing to take her back under\r\nany circumstances. And she is so ill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia broke off, as if there were something more that she did not\r\nventure to impart. Her cheeks coloured, and she looked distressfully\r\nabout the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeriously ill, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Rhoda, with difficulty softening\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gets up each day, but I\xe2\x80\x99m often afraid that\xe2\x80\x94She has had fainting\r\nfits\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda gazed at the speaker with pitiless scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can have caused this? Is it the result of her being falsely\r\naccused?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly that. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly Virginia rose, stepped to Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s side, and whispered a word\r\nor two. Rhoda turned pale; her eyes glared fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _still_ you believe her innocent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has sworn to me that she is innocent. She says that she has a\r\nproof of it which I shall see some day\xe2\x80\x94and her husband also. A\r\npresentiment has fixed itself in her mind that she can\xe2\x80\x99t live, and\r\nbefore the end she will tell everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband knows of this, of course\xe2\x80\x94of what you have told me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. She has forbidden me to say anything\xe2\x80\x94and how could I, Miss Nunn?\r\nShe has made me promise solemnly that he shall not be told. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven told Alice. But she will know very soon. At the end of September\r\nshe leaves her place, and will come to London to be with us\xe2\x80\x94for a time\r\nat all events. We do so hope that we shall succeed in persuading Monica\r\nto go to the house at Clevedon. Mr. Widdowson is keeping it, and will\r\nmove the furniture from Herne Hill at any moment. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you help us,\r\ndear Miss Nunn? Monica would listen to you; I am sure she would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can be of no use,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been hoping to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has said so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in so many words\xe2\x80\x94but I am sure she wishes to see you. She has\r\nasked about you several times, and when your note came she was very\r\npleased. It would be a great kindness to us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she declare that she will never return to her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I am sorry to say she does. But the poor child believes that she\r\nhas only a short time to live. Nothing will shake her presentiment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall die, and give no more trouble\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what she always says to\r\nme. And a conviction of that kind is so likely to fulfil itself. She\r\nnever leaves the house, and of course that is very wrong; she ought to\r\ngo out every day. She won\xe2\x80\x99t see a medical man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mr. Widdowson given her any cause for disliking him?\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was dreadfully violent when he discovered\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it was\r\nnatural\xe2\x80\x94he thought the worst of her, and he has always been so devoted\r\nto Monica. She says he seemed on the point of killing her. He is a man\r\nof very severe nature, I have always thought. He never could bear that\r\nMonica should go anywhere alone. They were very, very unhappy, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid\xe2\x80\x94so ill-matched in almost every respect. Still, under the\r\ncircumstances\xe2\x80\x94surely she ought to return to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s voice signified a conflict of feeling. Had she been\r\ndisinterested her opinion would not have wavered for a moment; she\r\nwould have declared that the wife\xe2\x80\x99s inclination must be the only law in\r\nsuch a case. As it was, she could only regard Monica with profound\r\nmistrust and repugnance. The story of decisive evidence kept back\r\nseemed to her only a weak woman\xe2\x80\x99s falsehood\xe2\x80\x94a fiction due to shame and\r\ndespair. Undoubtedly it would give some vague relief to her mind if\r\nMonica were persuaded to go to Clevedon, but she could not bring\r\nherself to think of visiting the suffering woman. Whatever the end\r\nmight be, she would have no part in bringing it about. Her dignity,\r\nher pride, should remain unsullied by such hateful contact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t stay longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginia, rising after a painful silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am always afraid to be away from her even for an hour; the fear of\r\ndreadful things that might happen haunts me day and night. How glad I\r\nshall be when Alice comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda had no words of sympathy. Her commiseration for Virginia was only\r\nsuch as she might have felt for any stranger involved in sordid\r\ntroubles; all the old friendliness had vanished. Nor would she have\r\nbeen greatly shocked or astonished had she followed Miss Madden on the\r\nway to the railway station and seen her, after a glance up and down the\r\nstreet, turn quickly into a public-house, and come forth again holding\r\nher handkerchief to her lips. A feeble, purposeless, hopeless woman;\r\ntype of a whole class; living only to deteriorate\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWill! Purpose! Was _she_ not in danger of forgetting these watchwords,\r\nwhich had guided her life out of youth into maturity? That poor\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness was doubtless in great measure due to the\r\nconviction that in missing love and marriage she had missed everything.\r\nSo thought the average woman, and in her darkest hours she too had\r\nfallen among those poor of spirit, the flesh prevailing. But the soul\r\nin her had not finally succumbed. Passion had a new significance; her\r\nconception of life was larger, more liberal; she made no vows to crush\r\nthe natural instincts. But her conscience, her sincerity should not\r\nsuffer. Wherever destiny might lead, she would still be the same proud\r\nand independent woman, responsible only to herself, fulfilling the\r\nnobler laws of her existence.\r\n\r\nA day or two after this she had guests to dine with her\xe2\x80\x94Mildred Vesper\r\nand Winifred Haven. Among the girls whom she had helped to educate,\r\nthese two seemed by far the most self-reliant, the most courageous and\r\nhopeful. In minor details of character they differed widely, and\r\nintellectually Miss Haven was far in advance. Rhoda had a strong desire\r\nto observe them as they talked about the most various subjects; she knew\r\nthem well, but hoped to find in them some new suggestion of womanly\r\nforce which would be of help to her in her own struggle for redemption.\r\n\r\nIt was seldom that either of them ailed anything. Mildred still showed\r\ntraces of her country breeding; she was the more robust, walked with a\r\nheavier step, had less polish of manner. Under strain of any kind\r\nWinifred\xe2\x80\x99s health would sooner give way, but her natural vivacity\r\npromised long resistance to oppressing influences. Mildred had worked\r\nharder, and amid privations of which the other girl knew nothing. She\r\nwould never distinguish herself, but it was difficult indeed to imagine\r\nher repining so long as she had her strength and her congenial friends.\r\nTwenty years hence, in all probability, she would keep the same clear,\r\nsteady eye, the same honest smile, and the same dry humour in her talk.\r\nWinifred was more likely to traverse a latitude of storm. For one\r\nthing, her social position brought her in the way of men who might fall\r\nin love with her, whereas Mildred lived absolutely apart from the male\r\nworld; doubtless, too, her passions were stronger. She loved\r\nliterature, spent as much time as possible in study, and had set her\r\nmind upon helping to establish that ideal woman\xe2\x80\x99s paper of which there\r\nwas often talk at Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIn this company Rhoda felt her old ambitions regaining their power over\r\nher. To these girls she was an exemplar; it made her smile to think how\r\nlittle they could dream of what she had experienced during the last few\r\nweeks; if ever a moment of discontent assailed them, they must\r\nnaturally think of her, of the brave, encouraging words she had so\r\noften spoken. For a moment she had deserted them, abandoning a course\r\nwhich her reason steadily approved for one that was beset with perils\r\nof indignity. It would shame her if they knew the whole truth\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\nshe wished it were possible for them to learn that she had been\r\npassionately wooed. A contemptible impulse of vanity; away with it!\r\n\r\nThere was a chance, it seemed to her, that during Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence Everard might come to the house. Mary had written to him; he\r\nwould know that she was away. What better opportunity, if he had not\r\ndismissed her memory from his thoughts?\r\n\r\nEvery evening she made herself ready to receive a possible visitor. She\r\ntook thought for her appearance. But the weeks passed by, Miss Barfoot\r\nreturned, and Everard had given no sign.\r\n\r\nShe would set a date, a limit. If before Christmas he neither came nor\r\nwrote all was at an end; after that she would not see him, whatever his\r\nplea. And having persuaded herself that this decision was irrevocable,\r\nshe thought it as well to gratify Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity, for by now\r\nshe felt able to relate what had happened in Cumberland with a certain\r\nsatisfaction\xe2\x80\x94the feeling she had foreseen when, in the beginning of\r\nher acquaintance with Everard, it flattered her to observe his growing\r\ninterest. Her narrative, to which Mary listened with downcast eyes,\r\npresented the outlines of the story veraciously; she told of Everard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwish to dispense with the legal bond, of her own indecision, and of the\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen your letter came, could I very well have acted otherwise than I\r\ndid? It was not a flat refusal to believe him; all I asked was that\r\nthings should be cleared up before our marriage. For his own sake he\r\nought to have willingly agreed to that. He preferred to take my request\r\nas an insult. His unreasonable anger made me angry too. And now I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink we shall ever meet again unless as mere acquaintances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d commented the listener, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he behaved with extraordinary\r\nimpudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first proposal? But I myself attach no importance to the\r\nmarriage ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you insist upon it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary, with a smile that might\r\nhave become sarcastic but that her eye met Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have received us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the one case as readily as in the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda was silent and darkly thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I never felt entire confidence in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary smiled and sighed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BURDEN OF FUTILE SOULS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own dearest love, if I could but describe to you all I have\r\nsuffered before sitting down to write this letter! Since our last\r\nmeeting I have not known one hour of quietness. To think that I missed\r\nyou when you called and left that note\xe2\x80\x94for it was you yourself, was it\r\nnot? The journey was horrible, and the week that I have spent here\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nassure you I have not slept for more than a few minutes at a time, and\r\nI am utterly broken down by misery. My darling\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94etc. \xe2\x80\x9cI regard myself\r\nas a criminal; if _you_ have suffered a thousandth part of what _I_\r\nhave, I deserve any punishment that could be devised. For it has all\r\nbeen my fault. Knowing as I did that our love could never end in\r\nhappiness, it was my duty to hide what I felt. I ought never to have\r\ncontrived that first meeting alone\xe2\x80\x94for it _was_ contrived; I sent my\r\nsisters away on purpose. I ought never\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94etc. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only reflection that\r\ncan ever bring me comfort is that our love has been pure. We can always\r\nthink of each other without shame. And why should this love ever have\r\nan end? We are separated, and perhaps shall never see each other again,\r\nbut may not our hearts remain for ever true? May we not think\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94etc.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to bid you leave your home and come to me, I should be once\r\nmore acting with base selfishness. I should ruin your life, and load my\r\nown with endless self-reproach. I find that even mere outward\r\ncircumstances would not allow of what for a moment we dreamt might be\r\npossible, and of that I am _glad_, since it helps me to overcome the\r\nterrible temptation. Oh, if you knew how that temptation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94etc. \xe2\x80\x9cTime\r\nwill be a friend to both of us, dearest Monica. Forget each other we\r\nnever can, we _never_ will. But our unsullied love\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94etc.\r\n\r\nMonica read it through again, the long rigmarole. Since the day that\r\nshe received it\xe2\x80\x94addressed to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Williamson\xe2\x80\x9d at the little\r\nstationer\xe2\x80\x99s by Lavender Hill\xe2\x80\x94the day before she consented to accompany\r\nher sister into new lodgings\xe2\x80\x94the letter had lain in its hiding-place.\r\nAlone this afternoon, for Virginia was gone to call on Miss Nunn, alone\r\nand miserable, every printed page a weariness to her sight, she took\r\nout the French-stamped envelope and tried to think that its contents\r\ninterested her. But not a word had power of attraction or of repulsion.\r\nThe tender phrases affected her no more than if they had been addressed\r\nto a stranger. Love was become a meaningless word. She could not\r\nunderstand how she had ever drifted into such relations with the\r\nwriter. Fear and anger were the sole passions surviving in her memory\r\nfrom those days which had violently transformed her life, and it was\r\nnot with Bevis, but her husband, that these emotions were connected.\r\nBevis\xe2\x80\x99s image stood in that already distant past like a lay figure, the\r\nmere semblance of a man. And with such conception of him his letter\r\ncorresponded; it was artificial, lifeless, as if extracted from some\r\nvapid novel.\r\n\r\nBut she must not destroy it. Its use was still to come. Letter and\r\nenvelope must go back again into hiding, and await the day which would\r\ngive them power over human lives.\r\n\r\nSuffering, as always, from headache and lassitude, she sat by the\r\nwindow and watched the people who passed along\xe2\x80\x94her daily occupation.\r\nThis sitting-room was on the ground floor. In a room above some one was\r\nreceiving a music lesson; every now and then the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s voice became\r\naudible, raised in sharp impatience, and generally accompanied by a\r\nclash upon the keys of the piano. At the area gate of the house\r\nopposite a servant was talking angrily with a tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s errand boy,\r\nwho at length put his thumb to his nose with insulting significance and\r\nscampered off. Then, at the house next to that one, there stopped a\r\ncab, from which three busy-looking men alighted. Cabs full of people\r\nwere always stopping at that door. Monica wondered what it meant, who\r\nmight live there. She thought of asking the landlady.\r\n\r\nVirginia\xe2\x80\x99s return aroused her. She went upstairs with her sister into\r\nthe double-bedded room which they occupied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went there. He told them everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did Miss Nunn look? How did she speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she was very, very distant,\xe2\x80\x9d lamented Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nknow why she sent for me. She said there would be no use in her coming\r\nto see you\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she ever will. I told her that there was\r\nno truth in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did she look?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monica impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all well, I thought. She had been away for her holiday, but it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have done her much good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went there and told them everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94just after it happened. But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen them since that. I\r\ncould see they believed him. It was no use all that I said. She looked\r\nso stern and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ask anything about Mr. Barfoot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t venture to. It was impossible. But I feel quite sure\r\nthat they must have broken off all intercourse with him. Whatever he\r\nmay have said, they evidently didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Miss Barfoot is away\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you tell her about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything that you said I might, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else\xe2\x80\x94you are sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia coloured, but made asseveration that nothing else had passed\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have mattered if you had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica indifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sister, struggling with shame, was irritated by the needlessness of\r\nher falsehood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why were you so particular to forbid me, Monica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was better\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for anything. Let them\r\nbelieve and say what they like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica, if I find out at last that you have deceived me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do, do, do be quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other wretchedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go\r\nsomewhere and live alone\xe2\x80\x94or die alone. You worry me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not very grateful, Monica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be grateful! You must expect nothing from me. If you keep\r\ntalking and questioning I shall go away. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what becomes of\r\nme. The sooner I die the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScenes such as this had been frequent lately. The sisters were a great\r\ntrial to each other\xe2\x80\x99s nerves. Tedium and pain drove Monica to the\r\nrelief of altercation, and Virginia, through her secret vice, was\r\nlosing all self-control. They wrangled, wailed, talked of parting, and\r\nonly became quiet when their emotions had exhausted them. Yet no\r\nill-feeling resulted from these disputes. Virginia had a rooted faith\r\nin her sister\xe2\x80\x99s innocence; when angry, she only tried to provoke Monica\r\ninto a full explanation of the mystery, so insoluble by unaided\r\nconjecture. And Monica, say what she might, repaid this confidence with\r\nprofound gratitude. Strangely, she had come to view herself as not only\r\ninnocent of the specific charge brought against her, but as a woman in\r\nevery sense maligned. So utterly void of significance, from her present\r\npoint of view, was all that had passed between her and Bevis. One\r\nreason for this lay in the circumstance that, when exchanging\r\ndeclarations with her lover, she was ignorant of a fact which, had she\r\nknown it, would have made their meetings impossible. Her husband she\r\ncould never regard but as a cruel enemy; none the less, nature had set\r\na seal upon their marriage against which the revolt of her heart was\r\npowerless. If she lived to bear a child, that child would be his.\r\nWiddowson, when he heard of her condition, would declare it the final\r\nproof of infidelity; and this injustice it was that exclusively\r\noccupied her mind. On this account she could think only of the\r\naccusation which connected her name with Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94all else was\r\ntriviality. Had there been no slightest ground for imputation upon her\r\nconduct, she could not have resented more vigorously her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrefusal to acquit her of dishonour.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, after their early dinner, Monica unexpectedly\r\ndeclared that she must go out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go into the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you refused to go out this morning when it was fine,\xe2\x80\x9d complained\r\nVirginia. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you can see it will rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sister at once started up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready. Where do you wish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere out of this dead place. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go by train, and walk from\r\nVictoria\xe2\x80\x94anywhere. To the Abbey, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be very careful not to catch cold. After all this time that\r\nyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t left the house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica cut short the admonition and dressed herself with feverish\r\nimpatience. As they set forth, drops of rain had begun to fall, but\r\nMonica would not hear of waiting. The journey by train made her\r\nnervous, but affected her spirits favourably. At Victoria it rained so\r\nheavily that they could not go out into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty to see here. Let us walk about and\r\nlook at things. We\xe2\x80\x99ll buy something at the bookstall to take back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they turned again towards the platform, Monica was confronted by a\r\nface which she at once recognized, though it had changed noticeably in\r\nthe eighteen months since she last saw it. The person was Miss Eade,\r\nher old acquaintance at the shop. But the girl no longer dressed as in\r\nthose days; cheap finery of the \xe2\x80\x9cloudest\xe2\x80\x9d description arrayed her form,\r\nand it needed little scrutiny to perceive that her thin cheeks were\r\nartificially reddened. The surprise of the meeting was not Monica\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly reason for evincing embarrassment. Seeing that Miss Eade was\r\nuncertain whether to make a sign of acquaintance, she felt it would be\r\nwiser to go by. But this was not permitted. As they were passing each\r\nother the girl bent her head and whispered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you\xe2\x80\x94just a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia perceived the communication, and looked in surprise at her\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of the girls from Walworth Road,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cJust walk on;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you at the bookstall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look respectable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on; I won\xe2\x80\x99t be a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica motioned to Miss Eade, who followed her towards a more retired\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have left the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft\xe2\x80\x94I should think so. Nearly a year ago. I told you I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand it much longer. Are you married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica did not understand why the girl should eye her so suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Eade. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody that I know, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a stranger to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other made an unpleasant click with her tongue, and looked vaguely\r\nabout her. Then she remarked inconsequently that she was waiting the\r\narrival of her brother by train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a traveller for a West-end shop; makes five hundred a year. I\r\nkeep house for him, because of course he\xe2\x80\x99s a widower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d puzzled Monica for a moment, but she remembered that it\r\nwas an unmeaning expletive much used by people of Miss Eade\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neducation. However, the story did not win her credence; by this time\r\nher disagreeable surmises had too much support.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there anything you wished particularly to speak about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen nothing of Mr. Bullivant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo what a remote period of her life this name seemed to recall Monica!\r\nShe glanced quickly at the speaker, and again detected suspicion in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have neither seen nor heard of him since I left Walworth Road. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe still there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he. He went about the same time you did, and nobody knew where he\r\nhid himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHid? Why should he hide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only mean he got out of sight somewheres. I thought perhaps you\r\nmight have come across him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. Now I must say good-bye. That lady is waiting for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Eade nodded, but immediately altered her mind and checked Monica\r\nas she was turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling me what your married name may be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern you, Miss Eade,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other\r\nstiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow you till I find out, and chance it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe change from tolerable civility to coarse insolence was so sudden\r\nthat Monica stood in astonishment. There was unconcealed malignity in\r\nthe gaze fixed upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? What interest have you in learning my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl brought her face near, and snarled in the true voice of the\r\npavement\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a name as you\xe2\x80\x99re ashamed to let out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica walked away to the bookstall. When she had joined her sister,\r\nshe became aware that Miss Eade was keeping her in sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us buy a book,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand go home again. The rain won\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey selected a cheap volume, and, having their return tickets, moved\r\ntowards the departure platform. Before she could reach the gates Monica\r\nheard Miss Eade\xe2\x80\x99s voice just behind her; it had changed again, and the\r\nappealing note reminded her of many conversations in Walworth Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me! I beg your pardon for bein\xe2\x80\x99 rude. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go without telling\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this importunity had already flashed upon Monica, and\r\nnow she felt a slight pity for the tawdry, abandoned creature, in whom\r\nthere seemed to survive that hopeless passion of old days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name,\xe2\x80\x9d she said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cis Mrs. Widdowson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you telling me the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you what you wish to know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t really know nothing about _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Eade moved sullenly away, not more than half convinced. Long after\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance she strayed about the platform and the\r\napproaches to the station. Her brother was slow in arriving. Once or\r\ntwice she held casual colloquy with men who also stood\r\nwaiting\xe2\x80\x94perchance for their sisters; and ultimately one of these was\r\nkind enough to offer her refreshment, which she graciously accepted.\r\nRhoda Nunn would have classed her and mused about her: a not\r\nunimportant type of the odd woman.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAfter this Monica frequently went out, always accompanied by her\r\nsister. It happened more than once that they saw Widdowson, who walked\r\npast the house at least every other day; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t approach them, and\r\nhad he done so Monica would have kept an obstinate silence.\r\n\r\nFor more than a fortnight he had not written to her. At length there\r\ncame a letter, merely a repetition of his former appeals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your elder sister is coming to London. Why\r\nshould she live here in lodgings, when a comfortable house is at the\r\ndisposal of you all? Let me again entreat you to go to Clevedon. The\r\nfurniture shall be moved any moment you wish. I solemnly promise not to\r\nmolest you in any way, not even by writing. It shall be understood that\r\nbusiness makes it necessary for me to live in London. For your sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake do accept this offer. If I could see you in private, I should be\r\nable to give you a very good reason why your sister Virginia would\r\nbenefit by the change; perhaps you yourself know of it. Do answer me,\r\nMonica. Never again will I refer by word or look to what has passed. I\r\nam anxious only to put an end to the wretched life that you are\r\nleading. Do go to the house at Clevedon, I implore you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time he had hinted darkly at a benefit that might\r\naccrue to Virginia if she left London. Monica had no inkling of what he\r\nmeant. She showed her sister this communication, and asked if she could\r\nunderstand the passage which concerned her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia replied, her hand trembling as she\r\nheld the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only suppose that he thinks that I am not\r\nlooking well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter was burnt, as all the others had been, no answer vouchsafed.\r\nVirginia\xe2\x80\x99s mind seemed to waver with regard to the proposed settlement\r\nat Clevedon. Occasionally she had urged Monica, with extreme\r\npersistence, to accept what was offered; at other times, as now, for\r\ninstance, she said nothing. Yet Alice had written beseeching her to use\r\nall means for Monica\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion. Miss Madden infinitely preferred the\r\nthought of dwelling at Clevedon\xe2\x80\x94however humble the circumstances had\r\nbeen\xe2\x80\x94to that of coming back into London lodgings whilst she sought for\r\na new engagement. The situation she was about to quit had proved more\r\nlaborious than any in her experience. At first merely a governess, she\r\nhad gradually become children\xe2\x80\x99s nurse as well, and for the past three\r\nmonths had been expected to add the tendance of a chronic invalid to\r\nher other duties. Not a day\xe2\x80\x99s holiday since she came. She was broken\r\ndown and utterly woebegone.\r\n\r\nBut Monica could not be moved. She refused to go again under her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s roof until he had stated that his charge against her was\r\nabsolutely unfounded. This concession went beyond Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s power; he\r\nwould forgive, but still declined to stultify himself by a statement\r\nthat could have no meaning. To what extent his wife had deceived him\r\nmight be uncertain, but the deception was a proved fact. Of course it\r\nnever occurred to him that Monica\xe2\x80\x99s demand had a significance which\r\nemphasized the name of Barfoot. Had he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced that your\r\nrelations with Barfoot were innocent,\xe2\x80\x9d he would have seemed to himself\r\nto be acquitting her of all criminality; whereas Monica, from her point\r\nof view, illogically supposed that he might credit her on this one\r\nissue without overthrowing all the evidence that declared her\r\nuntrustworthy. In short, she expected him to read a riddle which there\r\nwas scarcely a possibility of his understanding.\r\n\r\nAlice was in correspondence with the gloomy husband. She promised him\r\nto use every effort to gain Monica\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. Perhaps as the eldest\r\nsister she might succeed where Virginia had failed. Her faith in\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s protestations had been much shaken by the item of intelligence\r\nwhich Virginia secretly communicated; she thought it too likely that\r\nher unhappy sister saw no refuge from disgrace but in stubborn denial\r\nof guilt. And in the undertaking that was before her she had no hope\r\nsave through the influence of religion\xe2\x80\x94with her a much stronger force\r\nthan with either of the others.\r\n\r\nHer arrival was expected on the last day of September. The evening\r\nbefore, Monica went to bed soon after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock; for a day or two\r\nshe had suffered greatly, and at length had allowed a doctor to be\r\ncalled. Whenever her sister retired very early, Virginia also went to\r\nher own bedroom, saying that she preferred to sit there.\r\n\r\nThe room much surpassed in comfort that which she had occupied at Mrs.\r\nConisbee\xe2\x80\x99s; it was spacious, and provided with a couple of very soft\r\narmchairs. Having locked her door, Virginia made certain preparations\r\nwhich had nothing to do with natural repose. From the cupboard she\r\nbrought out a little spirit-kettle, and put water to boil. Then from a\r\nmore private repository were produced a bottle of gin and a\r\nsugar-basin, which, together with a tumbler and spoon, found a place on\r\na little table drawn up within reach of the chair where she was going\r\nto sit. On the same table lay a novel procured this afternoon from the\r\nlibrary. Whilst the water was boiling, Virginia made a slight change of\r\ndress, conducive to bodily ease. Finally, having mixed a glass of gin\r\nand water\xe2\x80\x94one-third only of the diluent\xe2\x80\x94she sat down with one of her\r\nfrequent sighs and began to enjoy the evening.\r\n\r\nThe last, the very last, of such enjoyment; so she assured herself.\r\nAlice\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the house would render impossible what she had\r\nhitherto succeeded in disguising from Monica. Her conscience welcomed\r\nthe restraint, which was coming none too soon, for her will could no\r\nlonger be depended upon. If she abstained from strong liquors for three\r\nor four days it was now a great triumph; yet worthless, for even in\r\nabstaining she knew that the hour of indulgence had only been\r\npostponed. A fit of unendurable depression soon drove her to the only\r\nresource which had immediate efficacy. The relief, she knew, was\r\nanother downward step; but presently she would find courage to climb\r\nback again up to the sure ground. Save for her trouble on Monica\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount the temptation would already have been conquered. And now\r\nAlice\xe2\x80\x99s arrival made courage a mere necessity.\r\n\r\nHer bottle was all but empty; she would finish it to-night, and in the\r\nmorning, as her custom was, take it back to the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s in her little\r\nhand-bag. How convenient that this kind of thing could be purchased at\r\nthe grocer\xe2\x80\x99s! In the beginning she had chiefly made use of railway\r\nrefreshment rooms. Only on rare occasions did she enter a public-house,\r\nand always with the bitterest sense of degradation. To sit comfortably\r\nat home, the bottle beside her, and a novel on her lap, was an\r\navoidance of the worst shame attaching to this vice; she went to bed,\r\nand in the morning\xe2\x80\x94ah, the morning brought its punishment, but she\r\nincurred no risk of being detected.\r\n\r\nBrandy had first of all been her drink, as is generally the case with\r\nwomen of the educated class. There are so many plausible excuses for\r\ntaking a drop of brandy. But it cost too much. Whisky she had tried,\r\nand did not like. Finally she had recourse to gin, which was palatable\r\nand very cheap. The name, debased by such foul associations, still\r\nconfused her when she uttered it; as a rule, she wrote it down in a\r\nlist of groceries which she handed over the counter.\r\n\r\nTo-night she drank her first glass quickly; a consuming thirst was upon\r\nher. By half-past eight the second was gently steaming at her elbow. At\r\nnine she had mixed the third; it must last a long time, for the bottle\r\nwas now empty.\r\n\r\nThe novel entertained her, but she often let her thoughts stray from\r\nit; she reflected with exultation that to-night\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence was her\r\nvery last. On the morrow she would be a new woman. Alice and she would\r\ndevote themselves to their poor sister, and never rest till they had\r\nrestored her to a life of dignity. This was a worthy, a noble task;\r\nsuccess in it must need minister to her own peace. Before long they\r\nwould all be living at Clevedon\xe2\x80\x94a life of ideal contentment. It was no\r\nlonger necessary to think of the school, but she would exert herself\r\nfor the moral instruction of young women\xe2\x80\x94on the principles inculcated\r\nby Rhoda Nunn.\r\n\r\nThe page before her was no longer legible; the book dropped from her\r\nlap. Why this excited her laughter she could not understand; but she\r\nlaughed for a long time, until her eyes were dim with tears. It might\r\nbe better to go to bed. What was the hour? She tried vainly to read her\r\nwatch, and again laughed at such absurd incapacity. Then\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSurely that was a knock at her door? Yes; it was repeated, with a\r\ndistinct calling of her name. She endeavoured to stand up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madden!\xe2\x80\x9d It was the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madden! Are you in\r\nbed yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia succeeded in reaching the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother voice spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I, Virginia. I have come this evening instead of to-morrow.\r\nPlease let me come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice? You can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll come\xe2\x80\x94wait downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was still able to understand the situation, and able, she thought,\r\nto speak coherently, to disguise her condition. The things on the table\r\nmust be put out of sight. In trying to do this, she upset her glass and\r\nknocked the empty bottle on to the floor. But in a few minutes bottle,\r\nglass, and spirit-kettle were hidden away. The sugar-basin she lost\r\nsight of; it still remained in its former place.\r\n\r\nThen she opened the door, and with uncertain step went out into the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice!\xe2\x80\x9d she called aloud.\r\n\r\nAt once both her sisters appeared, coming out of Monica\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.\r\nMonica had partly dressed herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you come to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia exclaimed, in a voice which\r\nseemed to her own ears perfectly natural.\r\n\r\nShe tottered, and was obliged to support herself against the wall. The\r\nlight from her room fell full upon her, and Alice, who had stepped\r\nforward to give her a kiss, not only saw, but smelt, that something\r\nvery strange was the matter. The odour proceeding from the bedroom, and\r\nthat of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s breath, left small doubt as to the cause of delay in\r\ngiving admittance.\r\n\r\nWhilst Alice stood bewildered, Monica received an illumination which\r\ninstantly made clear to her many things in Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s daily life. At\r\nthe same moment she understood those mysterious hints concerning her\r\nsister in Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into the room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Virgie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x94why has Alice come to-night?\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica took hold of the tottering woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm and drew her out of the\r\npassage. The cold air had produced its natural effect upon Virginia,\r\nwho now with difficulty supported herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Virgie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the eldest sister, when the door was closed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nthe matter? What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlready she had been shedding tears at the meeting with Monica, and now\r\ndistress overcame her; she sobbed and lamented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing, Virgie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monica with severity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoing? I feel a little faint\xe2\x80\x94surprise\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down at once. You are disgusting! Look, Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed to the\r\nsugar-basin on the table; then, after a rapid glance round the room,\r\nshe went to the cupboard and threw the door open. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so. Look,\r\nAlice. And to think I never suspected this! It has been going on a long\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94oh, a long time. She was doing it at Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s before I was\r\nmarried. I remember smelling spirits\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginia was making efforts to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed in a thick voice, and with\r\na countenance which was changing from dazed astonishment to anger.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only when I feel faint. Do you suppose I drink? Where\xe2\x80\x99s Alice?\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t Alice here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Virgie! What _does_ it mean? How _could_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to bed at once, Virginia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re ashamed of you. Go\r\nback into my room, Alice, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get her to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUltimately this was done. With no slight trouble, Monica persuaded her\r\nsister to undress, and got her into a recumbent position, Virginia all\r\nthe time protesting that she had perfect command of her faculties, that\r\nshe needed no help whatever, and was utterly at a loss to comprehend\r\nthe insults directed against her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie quiet and go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d was Monica\xe2\x80\x99s last word, uttered\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\nShe extinguished the lamp and returned to her own room, where Alice was\r\nstill weeping. The unexpected arrival had already been explained to\r\nMonica. Sudden necessity for housing a visitor had led to the\r\nproposition that Miss Madden, for her last night, should occupy a\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Glad to get away, Alice chose the alternative of\r\nleaving the house at once. It had been arranged that she should share\r\nVirginia\xe2\x80\x99s room, but to-night this did not seem advisable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monica, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must talk to her very seriously. I\r\nbelieve she has been drinking like that night after night. It explains\r\nthe look she always has the first thing in the morning. Could you have\r\nimagined anything so disgraceful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Alice had softened towards the erring woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must remember what her life has been, dear. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid loneliness\r\nis very often a cause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe needn\xe2\x80\x99t have been lonely. She refused to come and live at Herne\r\nHill, and now of course I understand why. Mrs. Conisbee must have known\r\nabout it, and it was her duty to tell me. Mr. Widdowson had found out\r\nsomehow, I feel sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe explained the reason of this belief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what it all points to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Madden, drying her sallow,\r\npimpled cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must do as your husband wishes, dearest. We must\r\ngo to Clevedon. There the poor girl will be out of temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and Virgie may go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou too, Monica. My dear sister, it is your duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t use that word to me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is _not_\r\nmy duty. It can be no woman\xe2\x80\x99s duty to live with a man she hates\xe2\x80\x94or even\r\nto make a pretence of living with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, dearest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t begin this to-night, Alice. I have been ill all day, and\r\nnow my head is aching terribly. Go downstairs and eat the supper they\r\nhave laid for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch a morsel,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Miss Madden. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, everything is too\r\ndreadful! Life is too hard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica had returned to bed, and lay there with her face half hidden\r\nagainst the pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want any supper,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cplease go and\r\ntell them, so that they needn\xe2\x80\x99t sit up for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice obeyed. When she came up again, her sister was, or pretended to\r\nbe, asleep; even the noise made by bringing luggage into the room did\r\nnot cause her to move. Having sat in despondency for a while, Miss\r\nMadden opened one of her boxes, and sought in it for the Bible which it\r\nwas her custom to make use of every night. She read in the book for\r\nabout half an hour, then covered her face with her hands and prayed\r\nsilently. This was _her_ refuge from the barrenness and bitterness of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nCONFESSION AND COUNSEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sisters did not exchange a word until morning, but both of them lay\r\nlong awake. Monica was the first to lose consciousness; she slept for\r\nabout an hour, then the pains of a horrid dream disturbed her, and\r\nagain she took up the burden of thought. Such waking after brief,\r\nbroken sleep, when mind and body are beset by weariness, yet cannot\r\nrest, when night with its awful hush and its mysterious movements makes\r\na strange, dread habitation for the spirit\xe2\x80\x94such waking is a grim trial\r\nof human fortitude. The blood flows sluggishly, yet subject to sudden\r\ntremors that chill the veins and for an instant choke the heart.\r\nPurpose is idle, the will impure; over the past hangs a shadow of\r\nremorse, and life that must yet be lived shows lurid, a steep pathway\r\nto the hopeless grave. Of this cup Monica drank deeply.\r\n\r\nA fear of death compassed her about. Night after night it had thus\r\nhaunted her. In the daytime she could think of death with resignation,\r\nas a refuge from miseries of which she saw no other end; but this hour\r\nof silent darkness shook her with terrors. Reason availed nothing; its\r\nexercise seemed criminal. The old faiths, never abandoned, though\r\nmodified by the breath of intellectual freedom that had just touched\r\nher, reasserted all their power. She saw herself as a wicked woman, in\r\nthe eye of truth not less wicked than her husband declared her. A\r\nsinner stubborn in impenitence, defending herself by a paltry ambiguity\r\nthat had all the evil of a direct lie. Her soul trembled in its\r\nnakedness.\r\n\r\nWhat redemption could there be for her? What path of spiritual health\r\nwas discoverable? She could not command herself to love the father of\r\nher child; the repugnance with which she regarded him seemed to her a\r\nsin against nature, yet how was she responsible for it? Would it profit\r\nher to make confession and be humbled before him? The confession must\r\nsome day be made, if only for her child\xe2\x80\x99s sake; but she foresaw in it\r\nno relief of mind. Of all human beings her husband was the one least\r\nfitted to console and strengthen her. She cared nothing for his pardon;\r\nfrom his love she shrank. But if there were some one to whom she could\r\nutter her thoughts with the certainty of being understood\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHer sisters had not the sympathetic intelligence necessary for aiding\r\nher; Virginia was weaker than she herself, and Alice dealt only in\r\nsorrowful commonplaces, profitable perhaps to her own heart, but\r\npowerless over the trouble of another\xe2\x80\x99s. Among the few people she had\r\ncalled her friends there was one strong woman\xe2\x80\x94strong of brain, and\r\ncapable, it might be, of speaking the words that go from soul to soul;\r\nthis woman she had deeply offended, yet owing to mere mischance.\r\nWhether or no Rhoda Nunn had lent ear to Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s wooing she must be\r\ngravely offended; she had given proof of it in the interview reported\r\nby Virginia. The scandal spread abroad by Widdowson might even have\r\nbeen fatal to a happiness of which she had dreamt. To Rhoda Nunn some\r\nform of reparation was owing. And might not an avowal of the whole\r\ntruth elicit from her counsel of gratitude\xe2\x80\x94some solace, some guidance?\r\n\r\nAmid the tremors of night Monica felt able to take this step, for the\r\nmere chance of comfort that it offered. But when day came the\r\nresolution had vanished; shame and pride again compelled her to silence.\r\n\r\nAnd this morning she had new troubles to think about. Virginia was\r\nkeeping her room; would admit no one; answered every whisper of appeal\r\nwith brief, vague words that signified anything or nothing. The others\r\nbreakfasted in gloom that harmonized only too well with the heavy,\r\ndripping sky visible from their windows. Only at midday did Alice\r\nsucceed in obtaining speech with her remorseful sister. They were\r\ncloseted together for more than an hour, and the elder woman came forth\r\nat last with red, tear-swollen eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must leave her alone to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Monica. \xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nany meal. Oh, the wretched state she is in! If only I could have known\r\nof this before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas it been going on for very long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt began soon after she went to live at Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s. She has told\r\nme all about it\xe2\x80\x94poor girl, poor thing! Whether she can ever break\r\nherself of it, who knows? She says that she will take the pledge of\r\ntotal abstinence, and I encouraged her to do so; it may be some use,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have no faith in her reforming unless she goes away from London.\r\nShe thinks herself that only a new life in a new place will give her\r\nthe strength. My dear, at Mrs. Conisbee\xe2\x80\x99s she starved herself to have\r\nmoney to buy spirits; she went without any food but dry bread day after\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course that made it worse. She must have craved for support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. And your husband knows about it. He came once when she was\r\nin that state\xe2\x80\x94when you were away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica nodded sullenly, her eyes averted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer life has been so dreadfully unhealthy. She seems to have become\r\nweak-minded. All her old interests have gone; she reads nothing but\r\nnovels, day after day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we help her, Monica? Won\xe2\x80\x99t you make a sacrifice for the poor\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s sake? Cannot I persuade you, dear? Your position has a bad\r\ninfluence on her; I can see it has. She worries so about you, and then\r\ntries to forget the trouble\xe2\x80\x94you know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot that day, nor the next, could Monica listen to these entreaties.\r\nBut her sister at length prevailed. It was late in the evening;\r\nVirginia had gone to bed, and the others sat silently, without\r\noccupation. Miss Madden, after several vain efforts to speak, bent\r\nforward and said in a low, grave voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica\xe2\x80\x94you are deceiving us all. You are guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it. I have watched you. You betray yourself when you are\r\nthinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other sat with brows knitted, with hard, defiant lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll your natural affection is dead, and only guilt could have caused\r\nthat. You don\xe2\x80\x99t care what becomes of your sister. Only the fear, or the\r\nevil pride, that comes of guilt could make you refuse what we ask of\r\nyou. You are afraid to let your husband know of your condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice could not have spoken thus had she not believed what she said.\r\nThe conviction had become irresistible to her mind. Her voice quivered\r\nwith intensity of painful emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat last is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister, when there had been silence for a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou confess it? O Monica\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t confess what you think,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the younger, with more\r\ncalmness than she had yet commanded in these discussions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf that I am _not_ guilty. I am afraid of his knowing, because he will\r\nnever believe me. I have a proof which would convince anyone else; but,\r\neven if I produced it, it would be no use. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is possible\r\nto persuade him\xe2\x80\x94when once he knows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were innocent you would disregard that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, Alice. If I were guilty I should not be living here at\r\nhis expense. I only consented to do that when I knew what my condition\r\nwas. But for this thing I should have refused to accept another penny\r\nfrom him. I should have drawn upon my own money until I was able to\r\nearn my own living again. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe this it shows you know\r\nnothing of me. Your reading of my face is all foolishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would to God I were sure of what you say!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Miss Madden, with\r\nvehemence which seemed extraordinary in such a feeble, flabby person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I told my husband lies,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Monica, \xe2\x80\x9cso you think\r\nI am never to be trusted. I did tell him lies; I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, and I\r\nam ashamed of it. But I am not a deceitful woman\xe2\x80\x94I can say that\r\nboldly. I love the truth better than falsehood. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for that\r\nI should never have left home. A deceitful woman, in my\r\ncircumstances\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand them\xe2\x80\x94would have cheated her\r\nhusband into forgiving her\xe2\x80\x94such a husband as mine. She would have\r\ncalculated the most profitable course. I left my husband because it was\r\nhateful to me to be with a man for whom I had lost every trace of\r\naffection. In keeping away from him I am acting honestly. But I have\r\ntold you that I am also afraid of his making a discovery. I want him to\r\nbelieve\xe2\x80\x94when the time comes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Monica, you ought to make known to him what you have been\r\nconcealing. If you are telling the truth, that confession can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nanything very dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice, I am willing to make an agreement. If my husband will promise\r\nnever to come near Clevedon until I send for him I will go and live\r\nthere with you and Virgie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has promised that, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Madden delightedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me. He has only said that he will make his home in London for a\r\ntime: that means he would come whenever he wished, if it were only to\r\nspeak to you and Virgie. But he must undertake never to come near until\r\nI give him permission. If he will promise this, and keep his word, I\r\npledge myself to let him know the whole truth in less than a year.\r\nWhether I live or die, he shall be told the truth in less than a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed Alice wrote and dispatched a few lines to\r\nWiddowson, requesting an interview with him as soon as possible. She\r\nwould come to his house at any hour he liked to appoint. The next\r\nafternoon brought a reply, and that same evening Miss Madden went to\r\nHerne Hill. As a result of what passed there, a day or two saw the\r\nbeginning of the long-contemplated removal to Clevedon. Widdowson found\r\na lodging in the neighbourhood of his old home; he had engaged never to\r\ncross the bounds of Somerset until he received his wife\xe2\x80\x99s permission.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this compact was established Monica wrote to Miss Nunn. A\r\nshort submissive letter. \xe2\x80\x9cI am about to leave London, and before I go I\r\nvery much wish to see you. Will you allow me to call at some hour when\r\nI could speak to you in private? There is something I must make known\r\nto you, and I cannot write it.\xe2\x80\x9d After a day\xe2\x80\x99s interval came the reply,\r\nwhich was still briefer. Miss Nunn would be at home at half-past eight\r\nthis or the next evening.\r\n\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that she must go out alone after nightfall\r\nalarmed her sisters. When told that her visit was to Rhoda Nunn they\r\nwere somewhat relieved, but Alice begged to be permitted to accompany\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be lost trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica declared. \xe2\x80\x9cMore likely than not there\r\nis a spy waiting to follow me wherever I go. Your assurance that I\r\nreally went to Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s won\xe2\x80\x99t be needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the others still opposed her purpose she passed from irony into\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you undertaken to save him the expense of private detectives?\r\nHave you promised never to let me go out of your sight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I have not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has never asked anything of the\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you may be sure that the spies are still watching me. Let them\r\nhave something to do, poor creatures. I shall go alone, so you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took train to York Road Station, and thence, as the night was fine,\r\nwalked to Chelsea. This semblance of freedom, together with the sense\r\nof having taken a courageous resolve, raised her spirits. She hoped\r\nthat a detective might be tracking her; the futility of such measures\r\nafforded her a contemptuous satisfaction. Not to arrive before the\r\nappointed hour she loitered on Chelsea Embankment, and it gave her\r\npleasure to reflect that in doing this she was outraging the\r\nproprieties. Her mind was in a strange tumult of rebellious and\r\ndistrustful thought. She had determined on making a confession to\r\nRhoda; but would she benefit by it? Was Rhoda generous enough to\r\nappreciate her motives? It did not matter much. She would have\r\ndischarged a duty at the expense of such shame, and this fact alone\r\nmight strengthen her to face the miseries beyond.\r\n\r\nAs she stood at Miss Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s door her heart quailed. To the servant\r\nwho opened she could only speak Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s name; fortunately\r\ninstructions had been given, and she was straightway led to the\r\nlibrary. Here she waited for nearly five minutes. Was Rhoda doing this\r\non purpose? Her face, when at length she entered, made it seem\r\nprobable; a cold dignity, only not offensive haughtiness, appeared in\r\nher bearing. She did not offer to shake hands, and used no form of\r\ncivility beyond requesting her visitor to be seated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica began, when silence compelled her to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so you told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see that you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why I have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour note only said that you wished to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and Monica knew in the moment that succeeded that she\r\nwas being examined from head to foot. It seemed to her that she had\r\nundertaken something beyond her strength; her impulse was to invent a\r\nsubject of brief conversation and escape into the darkness. But Miss\r\nNunn spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that I can be of any service to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You might be. But\xe2\x80\x94I find it is very difficult to say what I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda waited, offering no help whatever, not even that of a look\r\nexpressing interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me, Miss Nunn, why you behave so coldly to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need any explanation, Mrs. Widdowson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you believe everything Mr. Widdowson has said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Widdowson has said nothing to me. But I have seen your sister, and\r\nthere seemed no reason to doubt what she told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the truth, because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume she at least told no untruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Virginia say? I think I have a right to ask that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda appeared to doubt it. She turned her eyes to the nearest\r\nbookcase, and for a moment reflected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affairs don\xe2\x80\x99t really concern me, Mrs. Widdowson,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at\r\nlength. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have been forced upon my attention, and perhaps I regard\r\nthem from a wrong point of view. Unless you have come to defend\r\nyourself against a false accusation, is there any profit in our talking\r\nof these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ come for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am not so unjust as to refuse to hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name has been spoken of together with Mr. Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s. This is wrong.\r\nIt began from a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica could not shape her phrases. Hastening to utter the statement\r\nthat would relieve her from Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s personal displeasure, she used\r\nthe first simple words that rose to her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went to Bayswater that day I had no thought of seeing Mr.\r\nBarfoot. I wished to see someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listener manifested more attention. She could not mistake the signs\r\nof sincerity in Monica\xe2\x80\x99s look and speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cwho was living with Mr. Barfoot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Some one in the same building; in another flat. When I knocked at\r\nMr. Barfoot\xe2\x80\x99s door, I knew\xe2\x80\x94or I felt sure\xe2\x80\x94no one would answer. I knew\r\nMr. Barfoot was going away that day\xe2\x80\x94going into Cumberland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s look was fixed on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew he was going to Cumberland?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a slow, careful\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me so. I met him, quite by chance, the day before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you meet him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear the flats,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica answered, colouring. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had just come out\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsaw him come out. I had an appointment there that afternoon, and I\r\nwalked a short way with him, so that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice failed. She saw that Rhoda had begun to mistrust her, to\r\nthink that she was elaborating falsehoods. The burdensome silence was\r\nbroken by Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s saying repellently,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked for your confidence, remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94and if you try to imagine what it means for me to be speaking like\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94I am not shameless. I have suffered a great deal before I could\r\nbring myself to come here and tell you. If you were more human\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\ntried to believe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe agitation which found utterance in these words had its effect upon\r\nRhoda. In spite of herself she was touched by the note of womanly\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you come? Why do you tell me this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it isn\xe2\x80\x99t only that I have been falsely accused. I felt I must\r\ntell you that Mr. Barfoot had never\xe2\x80\x94that there was nothing between us.\r\nWhat has he said? How did he meet the charge Mr. Widdowson made against\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply by denying it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t he wished to appeal to _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of his expressing such a wish. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee that you are called upon to take any trouble about Mr. Barfoot. He\r\nought to be able to protect his own reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he done so?\xe2\x80\x9d Monica asked eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you believe him when he\r\ndenied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does it matter whether I believed him or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would think it mattered a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barfoot would think so? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me how much he wished to have your good opinion That is what\r\nwe used to talk about. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he took me into his confidence.\r\nIt happened first of all when we were going by train\xe2\x80\x94the same train,\r\nby chance\xe2\x80\x94after we had both been calling here. He asked me many\r\nquestions about you, and at last said\xe2\x80\x94that he loved you\xe2\x80\x94or something\r\nthat meant the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had fallen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Monica, \xe2\x80\x9cwe several times spoke of you. We did so\r\nwhen we happened to meet near his rooms\xe2\x80\x94as I have told you. He told me\r\nhe was going to Cumberland with the hope of seeing you; and I\r\nunderstood him to mean he wished to ask you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sudden and great change in Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s expression checked the\r\nspeaker. Scornful austerity had given place to a smile, stern indeed,\r\nbut exultant. There was warmth upon her face; her lips moved and\r\nrelaxed; she altered her position in the chair as if inclined for more\r\nintimate colloquy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was never more than that between us,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Monica with\r\nearnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy interest in Mr. Barfoot was only on your account. I\r\nhoped he might be successful. And I have come to you because I feared\r\nyou would believe my husband\xe2\x80\x94as I see you have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda, though she thought it very unlikely that all this should be\r\nadmirable acting, showed that the explanation had by no means fully\r\nsatisfied her. Unwilling to put the crucial question, she waited, with\r\ngravity which had none of the former harshness, for what else Mrs.\r\nWiddowson might choose to say. A look of suffering appeal obliged her\r\nto break the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry you have laid this task upon yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Monica looked at her, and at length murmured,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I could know that I had done any good\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, with a searching glance, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t wish me to\r\nrepeat what you have said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only for you. I thought\xe2\x80\x94if you felt able to let Mr. Barfoot\r\nknow that you had no longer any\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flash of stern intelligence shot from the listener\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen him then?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with abrupt directness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has written to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94still in the same voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed he has not. Mr. Barfoot never wrote to me. I know nothing\r\nwhatever about him. No one asked me to come to you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t think that.\r\nNo one knows of what I have been telling you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Rhoda was oppressed by the difficulty of determining how much\r\ncredit was due to such assertions. Monica understood her look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I have said so much I must tell you all. It would be dreadful after\r\nthis to go away uncertain whether you believed me or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHuman feeling prompted the listener to declare that she had no doubts\r\nleft. Yet she could not give utterance to the words. She knew they\r\nwould sound forced, insincere. Shame at inflicting shame caused her to\r\nbend her head. Already she had been silent too long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Monica was saying in low, tremulous\r\ntones. \xe2\x80\x9cIf no one else believes me, you at all events shall. I have not\r\ndone what\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear this,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda broke in, the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice affecting\r\nher too powerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI will believe you without this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica broke into sobbing. The strain of this last effort had overtaxed\r\nher strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t talk any more of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, with an endeavour to speak\r\nkindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done all that could be asked of you. I am grateful to\r\nyou for coming on my account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other controlled herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hear what I have to say, Miss Nunn? Will you hear it as a\r\nfriend? I want to put myself right in your thoughts. I have told no one\r\nelse; I shall be easier in mind if you will hear me. My husband will\r\nknow everything before very long\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps I shall not be alive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s face suggested to Monica that her meaning was\r\nunderstood. Perhaps, notwithstanding her denial, Virginia had told more\r\nwhen she was here than she had permission to make known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you wish to tell _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rhoda uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are so strong. You will say something that will help me. I\r\nknow you think that I have committed a sin which it is a shame to speak\r\nof. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. If it were true I should never consent to go and\r\nlive in my husband\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are returning to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Monica related the agreement that had been arrived at. When she\r\nspoke of the time that must elapse before she would make a confession\r\nto her husband, it again seemed to her that Miss Nunn understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a reason why I consent to be supported by him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were true that I had sinned as he suspects I would\r\nrather kill myself than pretend still to be his wife. The day before he\r\nhad me watched I thought I had left him forever. I thought that if I\r\nwent back to the house again it would only be to get a few things that\r\nI needed. It was some one who lived in the same building as Mr.\r\nBarfoot. You have met him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes for an instant, and they encountered the\r\nlistener\xe2\x80\x99s. Rhoda was at no loss to supply the omitted name; she saw at\r\nonce how plain things were becoming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has left England,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Monica in a hurried but clear voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought then that I should go away with him. But\xe2\x80\x94it was impossible. I\r\nloved him\xe2\x80\x94or thought I loved him; but I was guiltless of anything more\r\nthan consenting to leave my husband. Will you believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Monica, I do believe you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any doubt, I can show you a letter he wrote to me from\r\nabroad, which will prove\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you absolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me tell you more. I must explain how the misunderstanding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRapidly she recounted the incidents of that fatal Saturday afternoon.\r\nAt the conclusion her self-command was again overcome; she shed tears,\r\nand murmured broken entreaties for kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do, Miss Nunn? How can I live until\xe2\x80\x94? I know it\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nfor a short time. My wretched life will soon be at an end\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonica\xe2\x80\x94there is one thing you must remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice was so gentle, though firm\xe2\x80\x94so unlike what she had expected\r\nto hear\xe2\x80\x94that the sufferer looked up with grateful attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94give me what help you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife seems so bitter to you that you are in despair. Yet isn\xe2\x80\x99t it your\r\nduty to live as though some hope were before you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica gazed in uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will understand. I am not speaking of your husband.\r\nWhether you have duties to him or not I can\xe2\x80\x99t say; that is for your own\r\nmind and heart to determine. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true that your health has a\r\ngraver importance than if you yourself only were concerned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94you have understood me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it your duty to remember at every moment that your thoughts,\r\nyour actions, may affect another life\xe2\x80\x94that by heedlessness, by\r\nabandoning yourself to despair, you may be the cause of suffering it\r\nwas in your power to avert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerself strongly moved, Rhoda had never spoken so impressively, had\r\nnever given counsel of such earnest significance. She felt her power in\r\nquite a new way, without touch of vanity, without posing or any trivial\r\nself-consciousness. When she least expected it an opportunity had come\r\nfor exerting the moral influence on which she prided herself, and which\r\nshe hoped to make the ennobling element of her life. All the better\r\nthat the case was one calling for courage, for contempt of vulgar\r\nreticences; the combative soul in her became stronger when faced by\r\nsuch conditions. Seeing that her words were not in vain, she came\r\nnearer to Monica and spoke yet more kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you encourage that fear of your life coming to an end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more a hope than a fear\xe2\x80\x94at most times. I can see nothing before\r\nme. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s morbid. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t yourself that speaks, but your trouble. You\r\nare young and strong, and in a year\xe2\x80\x99s time very much of this\r\nunhappiness will have passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have felt it like a certainty\xe2\x80\x94as if it had been foretold to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94ever since I knew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it very likely that young wives have often the same dread. It\r\nis physical, Monica, and in your case there is so little relief from\r\ndark brooding. But again you must think of your responsibility. You\r\nwill live, because the poor little life will need your care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica turned her head away and moaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not love my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you will. And that love, that duty, is the life to which you must\r\nlook forward. You have suffered a great deal, but after such sorrow as\r\nyours there comes quietness and resignation. Nature will help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you could give me some of _your_ strength! I have never been\r\nable to look at life as you do. I should never have married him if I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been tempted by the thoughts of living easily\xe2\x80\x94and I feared\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94that I might always be alone\xe2\x80\x94My sisters are so miserable; it\r\nterrified me to think of struggling on through life as they do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mistake was in looking only at the weak women. You had other\r\nexamples before you\xe2\x80\x94girls like Miss Vesper and Miss Haven, who live\r\nbravely and work hard and are proud of their place in the world. But\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s idle to talk of the past, and just as foolish to speak as if you\r\nwere sorrowing without hope. How old are you, Monica?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo-and-twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am two-and-thirty\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t call myself old. When you have\r\nreached my age I prophesy you will smile at your despair of ten years\r\nago. At your age one talks so readily of \xe2\x80\x9cwrecked life\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chopeless\r\nfuture,\xe2\x80\x9d and all that kind of thing. My dear girl, you may live to be\r\none of the most contented and most useful women in England. Your life\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t wrecked at all\xe2\x80\x94nonsense! You have gone through a storm, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrue; but more likely than not you will be all the better for it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk or think about _sins_; simply make up your mind that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nbeaten by trials and hardships. There cannot\xe2\x80\x94can there?\xe2\x80\x94be the least\r\ndoubt as to how you ought to live through these next coming months.\r\nYour duty is perfectly clear. Strengthen yourself in body and mind. You\r\n_have_ a mind, which is more than can be said of a great many women.\r\nThink bravely and nobly of yourself! Say to yourself: This and that it\r\nis in me to do, and I will do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonica bent suddenly forward and took one of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and\r\nclung to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you could say something that would help me. You have a way of\r\nspeaking. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t only now. I shall be so far away, and so lonely,\r\nall through the dark winter. Will you write to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGladly. And tell you all we are doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda\xe2\x80\x99s voice sank for a moment; her eyes wandered; but she recovered\r\nthe air of confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe seemed to have lost you; but before long you will be one of us\r\nagain. I mean, you will be one of the women who are fighting in woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncause. You will prove by your life that we can be responsible human\r\nbeings\xe2\x80\x94trustworthy, conscious of purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94do you think it right for me to live with my husband when I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t even regard him as a friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that I dare not counsel you. If you _can_ think of him as a friend,\r\nin time to come, surely it will be better. But here you must guide\r\nyourself. You seem to have made a very sensible arrangement, and before\r\nlong you will see many things more clearly. Try to recover\r\nhealth\xe2\x80\x94health; that is what you need. Drink in the air of the Severn\r\nSea; it will be a cordial to you after this stifling London. Next\r\nsummer I shall\xe2\x80\x94I hope I shall be at Cheddar, and then I shall come\r\nover to Clevedon\xe2\x80\x94and we shall laugh and talk as if we had never known\r\na care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if that time were come! But you have done me good. I shall try\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda, without looking at her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I owe you\r\nthanks. You have done what you felt was right in spite of all it cost\r\nyou; and you have very greatly relieved my mind. Of course it is all a\r\nsecret between us. If I make it understood that a doubt is no longer\r\ntroubling me I shall never say how it was removed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I wish I had come before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your own sake, if I have really helped you, I wish you had. But as\r\nfor anything else\xe2\x80\x94it is much better as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Rhoda stood with erect head, smiling her smile of liberty. Monica\r\ndid not dare to ask any question. She moved up to her friend, holding\r\nout both hands timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill next summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey embraced, and kissed each other, Monica, when she had withdrawn\r\nher hot lips, again murmuring words of gratitude. Then in silence they\r\nwent together to the house-door, and in silence parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nRETREAT WITH HONOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nAlighting, on his return to London, at the Savoy Hotel, Barfoot\r\ninsensibly prolonged his stay there. For the present he had no need of\r\na more private dwelling; he could not see more than a few days ahead;\r\nhis next decisive step was as uncertain as it had been during the first\r\nfew months after his coming back from the East.\r\n\r\nMeantime, he led a sufficiently agreeable life. The Brissendens were\r\nnot in town, but his growing intimacy with that family had extended his\r\nsocial outlook, and in a direction correspondent with the change in his\r\nown circumstances. He was making friends in the world with which he had\r\na natural affinity; that of wealthy and cultured people who seek no\r\nprominence, who shrink from contact with the circles known as \xe2\x80\x9csmart,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwho possess their souls in quiet freedom. It is a small class,\r\nespecially distinguished by the charm of its women. Everard had not\r\nadapted himself without difficulty to this new atmosphere; from the\r\nfirst he recognized its soothing and bracing quality, but his\r\nexperiences had accustomed him to an air more rudely vigorous; it was\r\nonly after those weeks spent abroad in frequent intercourse with the\r\nBrissendens that he came to understand the full extent of his sympathy\r\nwith the social principles these men and women represented.\r\n\r\nIn the houses where his welcome was now assured he met some three or\r\nfour women among whom it would have been difficult to assign the\r\nprecedence for grace of manner and of mind. These persons were not in\r\ndeclared revolt against the order of things, religious, ethical, or\r\nsocial; that is to say, they did not think it worthwhile to identify\r\nthemselves with any \xe2\x80\x9cmovement\xe2\x80\x9d; they were content with the unopposed\r\nright of liberal criticism. They lived placidly; refraining from much\r\nthat the larger world enjoined, but never aggressive. Everard admired\r\nthem with increasing fervour. With one exception they were married, and\r\nsuitably married; that member of the charming group who kept her maiden\r\nfreedom was Agnes Brissenden, and it seemed to Barfoot that, if\r\npreference were at all justified, Agnes should receive the palm. His\r\nview of her had greatly changed since the early days of their\r\nacquaintance; in fact, he perceived that till of late he had not known\r\nher at all. His quick assumption that Agnes was at his disposal if he\r\nchose to woo her had been mere fatuity; he misread her perfect\r\nsimplicity of demeanour, the unconstraint of her intellectual\r\nsympathies. What might now be her personal attitude to him he felt\r\naltogether uncertain, and the result was a genuine humility such as he\r\nhad never known. Nor was it Agnes only that subdued his masculine\r\nself-assertiveness; her sisters in grace had scarcely less dominion\r\nover him; and at times, as he sat conversing in one of these\r\ndrawing-rooms, he broke off to marvel at himself, to appreciate the\r\nperfection of his own suavity, the vast advance he had been making in\r\npolished humanism.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of November he learnt that the Brissendens were at\r\ntheir town house, and a week later he received an invitation to dine\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nOver his luncheon at the hotel Everard reflected with some gravity,\r\nfor, if he were not mistaken, the hour had come when he must make up\r\nhis mind on a point too long in suspense. What was Rhoda Nunn doing? He\r\nhad heard nothing whatever of her. His cousin Mary wrote to him, whilst\r\nhe was at Ostend, in a kind and friendly tone, informing him that his\r\nsimple assurance with regard to a certain disagreeable matter was all\r\nshe had desired, and hoping that he would come and see her as usual\r\nwhen he found himself in London. But he had kept away from the house in\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, and it was probable that Mary did not even know his\r\naddress. As the result of meditation he went to his sitting-room, and\r\nwith an air of reluctance sat down to write a letter. It was a request\r\nthat Mary would let him see her somewhere or other\xe2\x80\x94not at her house.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they have a talk at the place in Great Portland Street, when\r\nno one else was there?\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot answered with brief assent. If he liked to come to Great\r\nPortland Street at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Saturday she would be awaiting him.\r\n\r\nOn arriving, he inspected the rooms with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often wished to come here, Mary. Show me over the premises,\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was your purpose\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not altogether. But you know how your work interests me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary complied, and freely answered his various questions. Then they sat\r\ndown on hard chairs by the fire, and Everard, leaning forward as if to\r\nwarm his hands, lost no more time in coming to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to hear about Miss Nunn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo hear about her? Pray, what do you wish to hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad of that. Does she ever speak of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she has referred to you lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us play a comedy, Mary. I want to talk very seriously. Shall\r\nI tell you what happened when I went to Seascale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you went to Seascale, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, unable to decide the question from\r\nhis cousin\xe2\x80\x99s face, which was quite friendly, but inscrutable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou went when Miss Nunn was there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. You must have known I was going, when I asked you for her\r\nSeascale address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did happen? I shall be glad to hear\xe2\x80\x94if you feel at liberty\r\nto tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Everard began the narrative. But he did not see fit to\r\ngive it with all the detail which Mary had learnt from her friend. He\r\nspoke of the excursion to Wastwater, and of the subsequent meeting on\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe end of it was that Miss Nunn consented to marry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe consented?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat comes as a surprise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we arranged everything. Rhoda was to stay till the fifteen days\r\nwere over, and the marriage would have been there. But then arrived\r\nyour letter, and we quarrelled about it. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t disposed to beg and\r\npray for justice. I told Rhoda that her wish for evidence was an\r\ninsult, that I would take no step to understand Mrs. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehaviour. Rhoda was illogical, I think. She did not refuse to take my\r\nword, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry me until the thing was cleared up. I told\r\nher that she must investigate it for herself, and so we parted in no\r\nvery good temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barfoot smiled and mused. Her duty, she now felt convinced, was to\r\nabstain from any sort of meddling. These two people must settle their\r\naffairs as they chose. To interfere was to incur an enormous\r\nresponsibility. For what she had already done in that way Mary reproved\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I want to ask you a plain question,\xe2\x80\x9d Everard resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat letter\r\nyou wrote to me at Ostend\xe2\x80\x94did it represent Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s mind as well as\r\nyour own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite impossible for me to say. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps that is a satisfactory answer. It implies, no doubt,\r\nthat she was still resolved not to concede the point on which I\r\ninsisted. But since then? Has she come to a decision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to prevaricate. Mary knew of the interview between\r\nMiss Nunn and Mrs. Widdowson, knew its result; but she would not hint\r\nat this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no means of judging how she regards you, Everard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible she even thinks me a liar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understood you to say that she never refused to believe you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a movement of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlainly\xe2\x80\x94you will tell me nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I suppose I must see Rhoda. Perhaps she will refuse to admit me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say. But if she does her meaning would be unmistakable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin Mary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked at her and laughed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will be very\r\nglad if she _does_ refuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed about to reply with some pleasantry, but checked herself,\r\nand spoke in a serious voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have no such feeling. Whatever you both agree upon will satisfy\r\nme. So come by all means if you wish. I can have nothing to do with it.\r\nYou had better write and ask her if she will see you, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarfoot rose from his seat, and Mary was glad to be released so quickly\r\nfrom a disagreeable situation. For her own part she had no need to put\r\nindiscreet questions; Everard\xe2\x80\x99s manner acquainted her quite\r\nsufficiently with what was going on in his thoughts. However, he had\r\nstill something to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I have behaved rather badly\xe2\x80\x94let us say, harshly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so foolish as to form any judgment in such a case, cousin\r\nEverard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking as a woman, should you say that Rhoda had reason on her\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94in the first instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary replied, with reluctance, but deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\r\nwas not unreasonable in wishing to postpone her marriage until she knew\r\nwhat was to be the result of Mrs. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s indiscreet behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps she was not,\xe2\x80\x9d Everard admitted thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what _has_ been the result?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only know that Mrs. Widdowson has left London and gone to live at a\r\nhouse her husband has taken somewhere in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m relieved to hear that. By-the-bye, the little lady\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindiscreet\r\nbehaviour\xe2\x80\x9d is as much a mystery to me as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary replied with an air of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let us take it for granted that I was rather harsh with\r\nRhoda. But suppose she still meets me with the remark that things are\r\njust as they were\xe2\x80\x94that nothing has been explained?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss your relations with Miss Nunn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, you defend her original action. Be so good as to admit that I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t go to Mrs. Widdowson and request her to publish a statement that\r\nI have never\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall admit nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Miss Barfoot rather tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave advised you to see Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x94if she is willing. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing more to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. I will write to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nHe did so, in the fewest possible words, and received an answer of\r\nequal brevity. In accordance with permission granted, on the Monday\r\nevening he found himself once more in his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room,\r\nsitting alone, waiting Miss Nunn\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. He wondered how she\r\nwould present herself, in what costume. Her garb proved to be a plain\r\ndress of blue serge, certainly not calculated for effect; but his eye\r\nat once distinguished the fact that she had arranged her hair as she\r\nwore it when he first knew her, a fashion subsequently abandoned for\r\none that he thought more becoming.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands. Externally Barfoot was the more agitated, and his\r\nembarrassment appeared in the awkward words with which he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had made up my mind never to come until you let me know that I was\r\ntried and acquitted But after all it is better to have reason on one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rhoda, with a smile which emphasized her\r\nambiguity.\r\n\r\nShe sat down, and he followed her example. Their relative positions\r\ncalled to mind many a conversation they had held in this room.\r\nBarfoot\xe2\x80\x94he wore evening dress\xe2\x80\x94settled in the comfortable chair as\r\nthough he were an ordinary guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you would never have written to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are too proud, or because the mystery is still a mystery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no longer any mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard made a movement of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? You have discovered what it all meant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know what it all meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you gratify my not unnatural curiosity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can say nothing about it, except that I know how the\r\nmisunderstanding arose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda was betraying the effort it had cost her to seem so\r\nself-possessed when she entered. Her colour had deepened, and she spoke\r\nhurriedly, unevenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur to you that it would be a kindness, not\r\ninconsistent with your dignity, to make me in some way acquainted with\r\nthis fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel no uneasiness on your account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendidly frank, as of old. You really didn\xe2\x80\x99t care in the least how\r\nmuch I suffered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou misunderstand me. I felt sure that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see. You imagined me calm in the assurance that I should some\r\nday be justified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had every reason for imagining it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rhoda. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise, you\r\nwould have given some sign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course he had deeply offended her by his persistent silence. He had\r\nintended to do so first of all; and afterwards\xe2\x80\x94had thought it might be\r\nas well. Now that he had got over the difficulty of the meeting he\r\nenjoyed his sense of security. How the interview would end he know not;\r\nbut on his side there would be nothing hasty, unconsidered, merely\r\nemotional. Had Rhoda any new revelation of personality within her\r\nresources?\xe2\x80\x94that was the question. If so, he would be pleased to\r\nobserve it. If not\xe2\x80\x94why, it was only the end to which he had long ago\r\nlooked forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not for me to give any sign,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you have said that it is well to have reason on one\xe2\x80\x99s side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps a softer note allowed itself to be detected in these words. In\r\nany case, they were not plainly ironical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmit, then, that an approach was due from me. I have made it. I am\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda said nothing. Yet she had not an air of expectancy. Her eye was\r\ngrave, rather sad, as though for the moment she had forgotten what was\r\nat issue, and had lost herself in remoter thought. Regarding her,\r\nEverard felt a nobility in her countenance which amply justified all he\r\nhad ever felt and said. But was there anything more\xe2\x80\x94any new power?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we go back,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cto our day at Wastwater. The perfect\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never wish to forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda reflectively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we stand as when we quitted each other that night\xe2\x80\x94do we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is the difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited some seconds, and repeated the question before Rhoda answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are conscious of no difference?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonths have elapsed. We are different because we are older. But you\r\nspeak as if you were conscious of some greater change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are changed noticeably. I thought I knew you; perhaps I did.\r\nNow I should have to learn you all over again. It is difficult, you\r\nsee, for me to keep pace with you. Your opportunities are so much\r\nwider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was puzzling. Did it signify mere jealousy, or a profounder view\r\nof things? Her voice had something even of pathos, as though she\r\nuttered a simple thought, without caustic intention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI try not to waste my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI have made new\r\nacquaintances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me first about yourself. You say you would never have written to\r\nme. That means, I think, that you never loved me. When you found that I\r\nhad been wrongly suspected\xe2\x80\x94and you suspected me yourself, say what you\r\nwill\xe2\x80\x94if you had loved me, you would have asked forgiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a like reason for doubting _your_ love. If you had loved me you\r\ncould never have waited so long without trying to remove the obstacle\r\nthat was between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was you who put the obstacle there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everard, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. An unlucky chance did that. Or a lucky one. Who knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to think: If this woman had enjoyed the social advantages to\r\nwhich Agnes Brissenden and those others were doubtless indebted for so\r\nmuch of their charm, would she not have been their equal, or more? For\r\nthe first time he compassionated Rhoda. She was brave, and\r\ncircumstances had not been kind to her. At this moment, was she not\r\ncontending with herself? Was not her honesty, her dignity, struggling\r\nagainst the impulses of her heart? Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s love had been worth more\r\nthan his, and it would be her one love in life. A fatuous reflection,\r\nperhaps; yet every moment\xe2\x80\x99s observation seemed to confirm it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the question which we must decide. If\r\nyou incline to think that the chance was fortunate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must know each other\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is so difficult!\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda murmured, just raising her hand and\r\nletting it fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, unless we give each other help. Let us imagine ourselves back at\r\nSeascale, down by the waves. (How cold and grim it must be there\r\nto-night!) I repeat what I said then: Rhoda, will you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked fixedly at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do the words matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not what you said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe watched the agitation of her features, until his gaze seemed to\r\ncompel her to move. She stepped towards the fireplace, and moved a\r\nlittle screen that stood too near the fender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want me to repeat exactly what I said?\xe2\x80\x9d Everard asked,\r\nrising and following her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak of the \xe2\x80\x9cperfect day.\xe2\x80\x9d Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the day\xe2\x80\x99s perfection end before\r\nthere was any word of marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with surprise. She had spoken without turning her face\r\ntowards him; it was visible now only by the glow of the fire. Yes, what\r\nshe said was true, but a truth which he had neither expected nor\r\ndesired to hear. Had the new revelation prepared itself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho first used the word, Rhoda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Rhoda stood unmoving, the fire\xe2\x80\x99s glow upon her face,\r\nand Barfoot watched her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cI was not quite serious when I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned sharply upon him, a flash of indignation in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite serious? Yes, I have thought that. And were you quite\r\nserious in _anything_ you said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered curtly, answering her steady look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet wanted to see whether\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not finish the sentence; her throat quivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved you, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. And I believe I still love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhoda turned to the fire again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, moving a step nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are \xe2\x80\x9cnot quite serious\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have asked you twice. I ask for the third time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t marry you with the forms of marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhoda answered in an\r\nabrupt, harsh tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it is you who play with a serious matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said we had both changed. I see now that our \xe2\x80\x9cperfect day\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nmarred by my weakness at the end. If you wish to go back in imagination\r\nto that summer night, restore everything, only let _me_ be what I now\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverard shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible. It must be then or now for both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLegal marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, glancing at him, \xe2\x80\x9chas acquired some new\r\nsanction for you since then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole, perhaps it has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally. But I shall never marry, so we will speak no more of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if finally dismissing the subject she walked to the opposite side of\r\nthe hearth, and there turned towards her companion with a cold smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, then, you have ceased to love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I no longer love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, if I had been willing to revive that fantastic idealism\xe2\x80\x94as you\r\nthought it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _was_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a kind of idealism undoubtedly. I was so bent on making sure that\r\nyou loved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, the perfection of our day was half make-believe. You never\r\nloved me with entire sincerity. And you will never love any woman\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nas well as you loved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul, I believe it, Rhoda. And even now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even now it is just possible for us to say good-bye with something\r\nlike friendliness. But not if you talk longer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let us spoil it;\r\nthings are so straight\xe2\x80\x94and clear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA threatened sob made her break off, but she recovered herself and\r\noffered him her hand.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nHe walked all the way back to his hotel, and the cold, clammy night\r\nrestored his equanimity. A fortnight later, sending a Christmas\r\npresent, with greetings, to Mr. and Mrs. Micklethwaite, he wrote thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am about to do my duty\xe2\x80\x94as you put it\xe2\x80\x94that is, to marry. The name\r\nof my future wife is Miss Agnes Brissenden. It will be in March, I\r\nthink. But I shall see you before then, and give you a fuller account\r\nof myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nA NEW BEGINNING\r\n\r\n\r\nWiddowson tried two or three lodgings; he settled at length in a small\r\nhouse at Hampstead; occupying two plain rooms. Here, at long intervals,\r\nhis friend Newdick came to see him, but no one else. He had brought\r\nwith him a selection of solid books from his library, and over these\r\nthe greater part of each day was spent. Not that he studied with any\r\nzeal; reading, and of a kind that demanded close attention, was his\r\nonly resource against melancholia; he knew not how else to occupy\r\nhimself. Adam Smith\xe2\x80\x99s classical work, perused with laborious\r\nthoroughness, gave him employment for a couple of months; subsequently\r\nhe plodded through all the volumes of Hallam.\r\n\r\nHis landlady, and the neighbours who were at leisure to observe him\r\nwhen he went out for his two hours\xe2\x80\x99 walk in the afternoon, took him for\r\nan old gentleman of sixty-five or so. He no longer held himself\r\nupright, and when out of doors seldom raised his eyes from the ground;\r\ngrey streaks had begun to brindle his hair; his face grew yellower and\r\nmore deeply furrowed. Of his personal appearance, even of cleanliness,\r\nhe became neglectful, and occasionally it happened that he lay in bed\r\nall through the morning, reading, dozing, or in a state of mental\r\nvacuity.\r\n\r\nIt was long since he had seen his relative, the sprightly widow; but he\r\nhad heard from her. On the point of leaving England for her summer\r\nholiday, Mrs. Luke sent him a few lines, urging him, in the language of\r\nthe world, to live more sensibly, and let his wife \xe2\x80\x9chave her head\xe2\x80\x9d now\r\nand then; it would be better for both of them. Then followed the time\r\nof woe, and for many weeks he gave no thought to Mrs. Luke. But close\r\nupon the end of the year he received one day a certain society journal,\r\naddressed in a hand he knew to the house at Herne Hill. In it was\r\ndiscoverable, marked with a red pencil, the following paragraph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong the English who this year elected to take their repose and\r\nrecreation at Trouville there was no more brilliant figure than Mrs.\r\nLuke Widdowson. This lady is well known in the _monde_ where one never\r\n_s\xe2\x80\x99ennuie_; where smart people are gathered together, there is the\r\ncharming widow sure to be seen. We are able to announce that, before\r\nleaving Trouville, Mrs. Widdowson had consented to a private engagement\r\nwith Capt. William Horrocks\xe2\x80\x94no other, indeed, than \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nuniversal favourite, so beloved by hostesses as a sure dancing man. By\r\nthe lamented death of his father, this best of good fellows has now\r\nbecome Sir William, and we understand that his marriage will be\r\ncelebrated after the proper delays. Our congratulations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSubsequently arrived a newspaper with an account of the marriage. Mrs.\r\nLuke was now Lady Horrocks: she had the title desired of her heart.\r\n\r\nAnother two months went by, and there came a letter\xe2\x80\x94re-addressed, like\r\nthe other communications, at the post office\xe2\x80\x94in which the baronet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife declared herself anxious to hear of her friends. She found they\r\nhad left Herne Hill; if this letter reached him, would not Edmund come\r\nand see her at her house in Wimpole Street?\r\n\r\nMisery of solitude, desire for a woman\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy and counsel, impelled\r\nhim to use this opportunity, little as it seemed to promise. He went to\r\nWimpole Street and had a very long private talk with Lady Horrocks,\r\nwho, in some way he could not understand, had changed from her old\r\nself. She began frivolously, but in rather a dull, make-believe way;\r\nand when she heard that Widdowson had parted from his wife, when a few\r\nvague, miserable words had suggested the domestic drama so familiar to\r\nher observation, she at once grew quiet, sober, sympathetic, as if\r\nreally glad to have something serious to talk about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, Edmund. Tell the whole story from the first. You\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nsort of man to make awful blunders in such a case as this. Just tell me\r\nall about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bad sort, you know, and I have troubles of my\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you so much. Women make fools of\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94well, never mind. Just tell me about the little girl, and\r\nsee if we can\xe2\x80\x99t square things somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a struggle with himself, but at length narrated everything,\r\noften interrupted by shrewd questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one writes to you?\xe2\x80\x9d the listener finally inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am expecting to hear from them,\xe2\x80\x9d was Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s answer, as he sat\r\nin the usual position, head hanging forward and hands clasped between\r\nhis knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo hear what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall be sent for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSent for? To make it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is going to give birth to a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Horrocks nodded twice thoughtfully, and with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you find this out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known it long enough. Her sister Virginia told me before they\r\nwent away. I had a suspicion all at once, and I forced her to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you are sent for shall you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson seemed to mutter an affirmative, and added,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall hear what she has to tell me, as she promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it\xe2\x80\x94is it possible\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady\xe2\x80\x99s question remained incomplete. Widdowson, though he\r\nunderstood it, vouchsafed no direct answer. Intense suffering was\r\nmanifest in his face, and at length he spoke vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever she tells me\xe2\x80\x94how can I believe it? When once a woman has\r\nlied how can she ever again be believed? I can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that fibbing,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Lady Horrocks, \xe2\x80\x9chas an unpleasant look. No\r\ndenying it. She got entangled somehow. But I think you had better\r\nbelieve that she pulled up just in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no love for her left,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in a despairing voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nall perished in those frightful days. I tried hard to think that I\r\nstill loved her. I kept writing letters\xe2\x80\x94but they meant nothing\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nthey only meant that I was driven half crazy by wretchedness. I had\r\nrather we lived on as we have been doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s miserable enough for me,\r\nGod knows; but it would be worse to try and behave to her as if I could\r\nforget everything. I know her explanation won\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy me. Whatever it\r\nis I shall still suspect her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the child is mine. It\r\nmay be. Perhaps as it grows up there will be a likeness to help me to\r\nmake sure. But what a life! Every paltry trifle will make me uneasy;\r\nand if I discovered any fresh deceit I should do something terrible.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how near I was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shuddered and hid his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Othello business won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Horrocks not unkindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone on together, of course; you had to part for a time.\r\nWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all over; take it as something that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.\r\nYou were behaving absurdly, you know; I told you plainly; I guessed\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d be trouble. You oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have married at all, that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nfact; it would be better for most of us if we kept out of it. Some\r\nmarry for a good reason, some for a bad, and mostly it all comes to the\r\nsame in the end. But there, never mind. Pull yourself together, dear\r\nboy. It\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense about not caring for her. Of course you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\neating your heart out for want of her. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I think:\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very likely Monica was pulled up just in time by discovering\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x94that she was more your wife than any one else\xe2\x80\x99s. Something\r\ntells me that\xe2\x80\x99s how it was. Just try to look at it in that way. If the\r\nchild lives she\xe2\x80\x99ll be different. She has sowed her wild oats\xe2\x80\x94why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a woman as well as a man? Go down to Clevedon and forgive\r\nher. You\xe2\x80\x99re an honest man, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t every woman\xe2\x80\x94never mind. I\r\ncould tell you stories about people\xe2\x80\x94but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to hear\r\nthem. Just take things with a laugh\xe2\x80\x94we _all_ have to. Life\xe2\x80\x99s as you\r\ntake it: all gloom or moderately shiny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith much more to the same solacing effect. For the time Widdowson was\r\nperchance a trifle comforted; at all events, he went away with a sense\r\nof gratitude to Lady Horrocks. And when he had left the house he\r\nremembered that not even a civil formality with regard to Sir William\r\nhad fallen from his lips. But Sir William\xe2\x80\x99s wife, for whatever reason,\r\nhad also not once mentioned the baronet\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOnly a few days passed before Widdowson received the summons he was\r\nexpecting. It came in the form of a telegram, bidding him hasten to his\r\nwife; not a word of news added. At the time of its arrival he was\r\ntaking his afternoon walk; this delay made it doubtful whether he could\r\nget to Paddington by six-twenty, the last train which would enable him\r\nto reach Clevedon that night. He managed it, with only two or three\r\nminutes to spare.\r\n\r\nNot till he was seated in the railway carriage could he fix his\r\nthoughts on the end of the journey. An inexpressible repugnance then\r\naffected him; he would have welcomed any disaster to the train, any\r\ninjury which might prevent his going to Monica at such a time. Often,\r\nin anticipation, the event which was now come to pass had confused and\r\ndarkened his mind; he loathed the thought of it. If the child, perhaps\r\nalready born, were in truth his, it must be very long before he could\r\nregard it with a shadow of paternal interest; uncertainty, to which he\r\nwas condemned, would in all likelihood make it an object of aversion to\r\nhim as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nHe was at Bristol by a quarter past nine, and had to change for a slow\r\ntrain, which by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock brought him to Yatton, the little junction\r\nfor Clevedon. It was a fine starry night, but extremely cold. For the\r\nfew minutes of detention he walked restlessly about the platform. His\r\nchief emotion was now a fear lest all might not go well with Monica.\r\nWhether he could believe what she had to tell him or not, it would be\r\nworse if she were to die before he could hear her exculpation. The\r\nanguish of remorse would seize upon him.\r\n\r\nAlone in his compartment, he did not sit down, but stamped backwards\r\nand forwards on the floor, and before the train stopped he jumped out.\r\nNo cab was procurable; he left his bag at the station, and hastened\r\nwith all speed in the direction that he remembered. But very soon the\r\ncrossways had confused him. As he met no one whom he could ask to\r\ndirect him, he had to knock at a door. Streaming with perspiration, he\r\ncame at length within sight of his own house. A church clock was\r\nstriking eleven.\r\n\r\nAlice and Virginia were both standing in the hall when the door was\r\nopened; they beckoned him into a room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it over?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, staring from one to the other with his dazzled\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt four this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Alice, scarce able to articulate. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nlittle girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had to have chloroform,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginia, who looked a miserable,\r\nlifeless object, and shook like one in an ague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all\xe2\x80\x99s well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe think so\xe2\x80\x94we hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d they stammered together.\r\n\r\nAlice added that the doctor was to make another call to-night. They had\r\na good nurse. The infant seemed healthy, but was a very, very little\r\nmite, and had only made its voice heard for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows you sent for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And we have something to give you. You were to have this as soon\r\nas you arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Madden handed him a sealed envelope; then both the sisters drew\r\naway, as if fearing the result of what they had done. Widdowson just\r\nglanced at the unaddressed missive and put it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have something to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, wiping his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the\r\ndoctor comes I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis visit took place while he was engaged on his supper. On coming\r\ndown from the patient the doctor gave him an assurance that things were\r\nprogressing \xe2\x80\x9cfairly well\xe2\x80\x9d; the morning, probably, would enable him to\r\nspeak with yet more confidence. Widdowson had another brief\r\nconversation with the sisters, then bade them good-night, and went to\r\nthe room that had been prepared for him. As he closed the door he heard\r\na thin, faint wail, and stood listening until it ceased; it came from a\r\nroom on the floor below.\r\n\r\nHaving brought himself with an effort to open the envelope he had\r\nreceived, he found several sheets of notepaper, one of them, remarked\r\nimmediately, in a man\xe2\x80\x99s writing. At this he first glanced, and the\r\nbeginning showed him that it was a love-letter written to Monica. He\r\nthrew it aside and took up the other sheets, which contained a long\r\ncommunication from his wife; it was dated two months ago. In it Monica\r\nrecounted to him, with scrupulous truthfulness, the whole story of her\r\nrelations with Bevis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only make this confession\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so she concluded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor the sake of the\r\npoor child that will soon be born. The child is yours, and ought not to\r\nsuffer because of what I did. The enclosed letter will prove this to\r\nyou, if anything can. For myself I ask nothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall\r\nlive. If I do I will consent to anything you propose. I only ask you to\r\nbehave without any pretence; if you cannot forgive me, do not make a\r\nshow of it. Say what your will is, and that shall be enough\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nHe did not go to bed that night. There was a fire in the room, and he\r\nkept it alight until daybreak, when he descended softly to the hall and\r\nlet himself out of the house.\r\n\r\nIn a fierce wind that swept from the north-west down the foaming\r\nChannel, he walked for an hour or two, careless whither the roads\r\ndirected him. All he desired was to be at a distance from that house,\r\nwith its hideous silence and the faint cry that could scarcely be\r\ncalled a sound. The necessity of returning, of spending days there, was\r\nan oppression which held him like a nightmare.\r\n\r\nMonica\xe2\x80\x99s statement he neither believed nor disbelieved; he simply could\r\nnot make up his mind about it. She had lied to him so resolutely\r\nbefore; was she not capable of elaborate falsehood to save her\r\nreputation and protect her child? The letter from Bevis might have been\r\na result of conspiracy between them.\r\n\r\nThat Bevis was the man against whom his jealousy should have been\r\ndirected at first astounded him. By now he had come to a full\r\nperception of his stupidity in never entertaining such a thought. The\r\nrevelation was equivalent to a second offence just discovered; for he\r\nfound it impossible to ignore his long-cherished suspicion of Barfoot,\r\nand he even surmised the possibility of Monica\xe2\x80\x99s having listened to\r\nlove-making from that quarter previously to her intimacy with Bevis. He\r\nloathed the memory of his life since marriage; and as for pardoning his\r\nwife, he could as soon pardon and smile upon the author of that\r\naccursed letter from Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nBut go back to the house he must. By obeying his impulse, and\r\nstraightway returning to London, he might be the cause of a fatal turn\r\nin Monica\xe2\x80\x99s illness. Constraint of bare humanity would keep him here\r\nuntil his wife was out of danger. But he could not see her, and as soon\r\nas possible he must escape from such unendurable circumstances.\r\n\r\nRe-entering at half-past eight, he was met by Alice, who seemed to have\r\nslept as little as he himself had done. They went into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been inquiring about you,\xe2\x80\x9d began Miss Madden timorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot worse, I believe. But so very weak. She wishes me to ask you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis manner did not encourage the poor woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be obliged to tell her something. If I have nothing to say she\r\nwill fret herself into a dangerous state. She wants to know if you have\r\nread her letter, and if\xe2\x80\x94if you will see the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson turned away and stood irresolute. He felt Miss Madden\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nupon his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse! Let me give her some comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the child she\xe2\x80\x99s anxious about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice admitted it, looking into her brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s face with woeful\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay I will see it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand have it brought into some\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94then say I _have_ seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t I take her a word of forgiveness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, say I forgive her. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wish me to go to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen say I forgive her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he directed so it was done; and in the course of the morning Miss\r\nMadden brought word to him that her sister had experienced great\r\nrelief. She was sleeping.\r\n\r\nBut the doctor thought it necessary to make two visits before\r\nnightfall, and late in the evening he came again. He explained to\r\nWiddowson that there were complications, not unlikely to be dangerous,\r\nand finally he suggested that, if the morrow brought no decided\r\nimprovement, a second medical man should be called in to consult. This\r\nconsultation was held. In the afternoon Virginia came weeping to her\r\nbrother-in-law, and told him that Monica was delirious. That night the\r\nwhole household watched. Another day was passed in the gravest anxiety,\r\nand at dusk the medical attendant no longer disguised his opinion that\r\nMrs. Widdowson was sinking. She became unconscious soon after, and in\r\nthe early morning breathed her last.\r\n\r\nWiddowson was in the room, and at the end sat by the bedside for an\r\nhour. But he did not look upon his wife\xe2\x80\x99s face. When it was told him\r\nthat she had ceased to breathe, he rose and went into his own chamber,\r\ndeath-pale, but tearless.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOn the day after the funeral\xe2\x80\x94Monica was buried in the cemetery, which\r\nis hard by the old church\xe2\x80\x94Widdowson and the elder sister had a long\r\nconversation in private. It related first of all to the motherless\r\nbaby. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s desire was that Miss Madden should undertake the care\r\nof the child. She and Virginia might live wherever they preferred;\r\ntheir needs would be provided for. Alice had hardly dared to hope for\r\nsuch a proposal\xe2\x80\x94as it concerned the child, that is to say. Gladly she\r\naccepted it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s something I must tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with embarrassed\r\nappeal in her wet eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Virginia wishes to go into an\r\ninstitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWiddowson looked at her, not understanding; whereupon she broke into\r\ntears, and made known that her sister was such a slave to strong drink\r\nthat they both despaired of reformation unless by help of the measure\r\nshe had indicated. There were people, she had heard, who undertook the\r\ncare of inebriates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that we are by no means penniless,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Alice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\r\nvery well bear the expense. But will you assist us to find a suitable\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe promised to proceed at once in the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when she is cured,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Madden, \xe2\x80\x9cshe shall come and live\r\nwith me. And when baby is about two years old we will do what we have\r\nbeen purposing for a long time. We will open a school for young\r\nchildren, either here or at Weston. That will afford my poor sister\r\noccupation. Indeed, we shall both be better for the exertion of such an\r\nundertaking\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a wise thing, I have no doubt whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe large house was to be abandoned, and as much of the furniture as\r\nseemed needful transported to a smaller dwelling in another part of\r\nClevedon. For Alice resolved to stay here in spite of painful\r\nassociations. She loved the place, and looked forward with quiet joy to\r\nthe life that was prepared for her. Widdowson\xe2\x80\x99s books would go back to\r\nLondon; not to the Hampstead lodgings, however. Fearful of solitude, he\r\nproposed to his friend Newdick that they should live together, he, as a\r\nman of substance, bearing the larger share of the expense. And this\r\nplan also came into execution.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThree months went by, and on a day of summer, when the wooded hills and\r\ngreen lanes and rich meadows of Clevedon looked their best, when the\r\nChannel was still and blue, and the Welsh mountains loomed through a\r\nsunny haze, Rhoda Nunn came over from the Mendips to see Miss Madden.\r\nIt could not be a gladsome meeting, but Rhoda was bright and natural,\r\nand her talk as inspiriting as ever. She took the baby in her arms, and\r\nwalked about with it for a long time in the garden, often murmuring,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little child! Dear little child!\xe2\x80\x9d There had been doubt whether it\r\nwould live, but the summer seemed to be fortifying its health. Alice,\r\nit was plain, had found her vocation; she looked better than at any\r\ntime since Rhoda had known her. Her complexion was losing its muddiness\r\nand spottiness; her step had become light and brisk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Miss Nunn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStaying with friends at present. She will be back before long, I hope.\r\nAnd as soon as baby can walk we are going to think very seriously about\r\nthe school. You remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe school? You will really make the attempt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be so good for us both. Why, look,\xe2\x80\x9d she added laughingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere is one pupil growing for us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake a brave woman of her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhoda kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will try\xe2\x80\x94ah, we will try! And is your work as successful as ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rhoda. \xe2\x80\x9cWe flourish like the green bay-tree. We shall\r\nhave to take larger premises. By-the-bye, you must read the paper we\r\nare going to publish; the first number will be out in a month, though\r\nthe name isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite decided upon yet. Miss Barfoot was never in such\r\nhealth and spirit\xe2\x80\x94nor I myself. The world is moving!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst Miss Madden went into the house to prepare hospitalities, Rhoda,\r\nstill nursing, sat down on a garden bench. She gazed intently at those\r\ndiminutive features, which were quite placid and relaxing in soft\r\ndrowsiness. The dark, bright eye was Monica\xe2\x80\x99s. And as the baby sank\r\ninto sleep, Rhoda\xe2\x80\x99s vision grew dim; a sigh made her lips quiver, and\r\nonce more she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ODD WOMEN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 4313-0.txt or 4313-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/4/3/1/4313/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
