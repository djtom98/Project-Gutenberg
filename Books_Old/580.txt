In which is given a faithful\r\nPortraiture of two distinguished Persons; and an accurate Description of\r\na public Breakfast in their House and Grounds: which public Breakfast\r\nleads to the Recognition of an old Acquaintance, and the Commencement of\r\nanothe r Chapter 16. Too full of Adventure to be briefly described 17.\r\nShowing that an Attack of Rheumatism, in some Cases, acts as a Quickener\r\nto inventive Genius 18.

Showing how Dodson and\r\nFogg were Men of Business, and their Clerks Men of pleasure; and how an\r\naffecting Interview took place between Mr. Weller and his long-lost\r\nParent; showing also what Choice Spirits assembled at the Magpie and\r\nStump, and what a C apital Chapter the next one will be 21. In which the\r\nold Man launches forth into his favourite Theme, and relates a Story\r\nabout a queer Client 22. Mr. Pickwick journeys to Ipswich and meets with\r\na romantic Adventure with a middle-aged Lady in yellow Curl-papers 23.\r\nIn which Mr. Samuel Weller begins to devote his Energies to the Return\r\nMatch between himself and Mr. Trotter 24.

The Story of\r\nthe Goblins who stole a Sexton 30. How the Pickwickians made and\r\ncultivated the Acquaintance of a Couple of nice young Men belonging to\r\none of the liberal Professions; how they disported themselves on the\r\nIce; and how their Visit came to a Conclusion 31. Which is all about the\r\nLaw, and sundry Great Authorities learned therein 32. Describes, far\r\nmore fully than the Court Newsman ever did, a Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Party, given by\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer at his Lodgings in the Borough 33. Mr. Weller the elder\r\ndelivers some Critical Sentiments respecting Literary Composition; and,\r\nassisted by his Son Samuel, pays a small Instalment of Retaliation to\r\nthe Account of the Reverend Gentleman with the Red Nose 34. Is wholly\r\ndevoted to a full and faithful Report of the memorable Trial of Bardell\r\nagainst Pickwick 35. In which Mr. Pickwick thinks he had better go to\r\nBath; and goes accordingly 36. The chief Features of which will be found\r\nto be an authentic Version of the Legend of Prince Bladud, and a most\r\nextraordinary Calamity that befell Mr. Winkle 37. Honourably accounts\r\nfor Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s Absence, by describing a Soiree to which he was invited\r\nand went; also relates how he was intrusted by Mr. Pickwick with a\r\nPrivate Mission of Delicacy and Importance 38.

What befell Mr. Pickwick when he got into the\r\nFleet; what Prisoners he saw there; and how he passed the Night 42.\r\nIllustrative, like the preceding one, of the old Proverb, that Adversity\r\nbrings a Man acquainted with strange Bedfellows--Likewise containing Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary and startling Announcement to Mr. Samuel Weller\r\n43.

Descriptive of an affecting Interview between\r\nMr. Samuel Weller and a Family Party. Mr. Pickwick makes a Tour of the\r\ndiminutive World he inhabits, and resolves to mix with it, in Future, as\r\nlittle as possible 46. Records a touching Act of delicate Feeling not\r\nunmixed with Pleasantry, achieved and performed by Messrs. Dodson and\r\nFogg 47. Is chiefly devoted to Matters of Business, and the temporal\r\nAdvantage of Dodson and Fogg--Mr. Winkle reappears under extraordinary\r\nCircumstances--Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s Benevolence proves stronger than his\r\nObstinacy 48. Relates how Mr. Pickwick, with the Assistance of Samuel\r\nWeller, essayed to soften the Heart of Mr. Benjamin Allen, and to\r\nmollify the Wrath of Mr. Robert Sawyer 49.

In which\r\nMr. Pickwick encounters an old Acquaintance--To which fortunate\r\nCircumstance the Reader is mainly indebted for Matter of thrilling\r\nInterest herein set down, concerning two great Public Men of Might and\r\nPower 52. Involving a serious Change in the Weller Family, and the\r\nuntimely Downfall of Mr. Stiggins 53. Comprising the final Exit of Mr.\r\nJingle and Job Trotter, with a great Morning of business in Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn\r\nSquare--Concluding with a Double Knock at Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s Door 54.\r\nContaining some Particulars relative to the Double Knock, and other\r\nMatters: among which certain interesting Disclosures relative to Mr.\r\nSnodgrass and a Young Lady are by no Means irrelevant to this History\r\n55. Mr. Solomon Pell, assisted by a Select Committee of Coachmen,\r\narranges the affairs of the elder Mr. Weller 56. An important Conference\r\ntakes place between Mr. Pickwick and Samuel Weller, at which his Parent\r\nassists--An old Gentleman in a snuff-coloured Suit arrives unexpectedly\r\n57. In which the Pickwick Club is finally dissolved, and everything\r\nconcluded to the Satisfaction of Everybody\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK CLUB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE PICKWICKIANS\r\n\r\nThe first ray of light which illumines the gloom, and converts into a\r\ndazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the\r\npublic career of the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved, is\r\nderived from the perusal of the following entry in the Transactions of\r\nthe Pickwick Club, which the editor of these papers feels the highest\r\npleasure in laying before his readers, as a proof of the careful\r\nattention, indefatigable assiduity, and nice discrimination, with which\r\nhis search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May 12, 1827. Joseph Smiggers, Esq., P.V.P.M.P.C. [Perpetual Vice-\r\nPresident--Member Pickwick Club], presiding. The following resolutions\r\nunanimously agreed to:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That this Association has heard read, with feelings of unmingled\r\nsatisfaction, and unqualified approval, the paper communicated by Samuel\r\nPickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C. [General Chairman--Member Pickwick Club],\r\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cSpeculations on the Source of the Hampstead Ponds, with some\r\nObservations on the Theory of Tittlebats;\xe2\x80\x9d and that this Association\r\ndoes hereby return its warmest thanks to the said Samuel Pickwick, Esq.,\r\nG.C.M.P.C., for the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which\r\nmust accrue to the cause of science, from the production to which they\r\nhave just adverted--no less than from the unwearied researches of Samuel\r\nPickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., in Hornsey, Highgate, Brixton, and\r\nCamberwell--they cannot but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable\r\nbenefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of\r\nthat learned man into a wider field, from extending his travels, and,\r\nconsequently, enlarging his sphere of observation, to the advancement of\r\nknowledge, and the diffusion of learning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, with the view just mentioned, this Association has taken into its\r\nserious consideration a proposal, emanating from the aforesaid, Samuel\r\nPickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., and three other Pickwickians hereinafter\r\nnamed, for forming a new branch of United Pickwickians, under the title\r\nof The Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club is therefore hereby\r\nconstituted; and that Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., Tracy Tupman,\r\nEsq., M.P.C., Augustus Snodgrass, Esq., M.P.C., and Nathaniel Winkle,\r\nEsq., M.P.C., are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same;\r\nand that they be requested to forward, from time to time, authenticated\r\naccounts of their journeys and investigations, of their observations of\r\ncharacter and manners, and of the whole of their adventures, together\r\nwith all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may\r\ngive rise, to the Pickwick Club, stationed in London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every\r\nmember of the Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling\r\nexpenses; and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the\r\nsaid society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they\r\nplease, upon the same terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That the members of the aforesaid Corresponding Society be, and are\r\nhereby informed, that their proposal to pay the postage of their\r\nletters, and the carriage of their parcels, has been deliberated upon by\r\nthis Association: that this Association considers such proposal worthy\r\nof the great minds from which it emanated, and that it hereby signifies\r\nits perfect acquiescence therein.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA casual observer, adds the secretary, to whose notes we are indebted\r\nfor the following account--a casual observer might possibly have\r\nremarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head, and circular\r\nspectacles, which were intently turned towards his (the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s)\r\nface, during the reading of the above resolutions: to those who knew\r\nthat the gigantic brain of Pickwick was working beneath that forehead,\r\nand that the beaming eyes of Pickwick were twinkling behind those\r\nglasses, the sight was indeed an interesting one. There sat the man who\r\nhad traced to their source the mighty ponds of Hampstead, and agitated\r\nthe scientific world with his Theory of Tittlebats, as calm and unmoved\r\nas the deep waters of the one on a frosty day, or as a solitary specimen\r\nof the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar. And how much more\r\ninteresting did the spectacle become, when, starting into full life and\r\nanimation, as a simultaneous call for \xe2\x80\x98Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99 burst from his\r\nfollowers, that illustrious man slowly mounted into the Windsor chair,\r\non which he had been previously seated, and addressed the club himself\r\nhad founded. What a study for an artist did that exciting scene present!\r\nThe eloquent Pickwick, with one hand gracefully concealed behind his\r\ncoat tails, and the other waving in air to assist his glowing\r\ndeclamation; his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters,\r\nwhich, had they clothed an ordinary man, might have passed without\r\nobservation, but which, when Pickwick clothed them--if we may use the\r\nexpression--inspired involuntary awe and respect; surrounded by the men\r\nwho had volunteered to share the perils of his travels, and who were\r\ndestined to participate in the glories of his discoveries. On his right\r\nsat Mr. Tracy Tupman--the too susceptible Tupman, who to the wisdom and\r\nexperience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a\r\nboy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses--love.\r\nTime and feeding had expanded that once romantic form; the black silk\r\nwaistcoat had become more and more developed; inch by inch had the gold\r\nwatch-chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvision; and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders\r\nof the white cravat: but the soul of Tupman had known no change--\r\nadmiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion. On the left of\r\nhis great leader sat the poetic Snodgrass, and near him again the\r\nsporting Winkle; the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue\r\ncloak with a canine-skin collar, and the latter communicating additional\r\nlustre to a new green shooting-coat, plaid neckerchief, and closely-\r\nfitted drabs.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s oration upon this occasion, together with the debate\r\nthereon, is entered on the Transactions of the Club. Both bear a strong\r\naffinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies; and, as it is\r\nalways interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of\r\ngreat men, we transfer the entry to these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick observed (says the secretary) that fame was dear to the\r\nheart of every man. Poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend\r\nSnodgrass; the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend Tupman;\r\nand the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field, the air, and\r\nthe water was uppermost in the breast of his friend Winkle. He (Mr.\r\nPickwick) would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and\r\nhuman feelings (cheers)--possibly by human weaknesses (loud cries of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d); but this he would say, that if ever the fire of self-importance\r\nbroke out in his bosom, the desire to benefit the human race in\r\npreference effectually quenched it. The praise of mankind was his swing;\r\nphilanthropy was his insurance office. (Vehement cheering.) He had felt\r\nsome pride--he acknowledged it freely, and let his enemies make the most\r\nof it--he had felt some pride when he presented his Tittlebatian Theory\r\nto the world; it might be celebrated or it might not. (A cry of \xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and great cheering.) He would take the assertion of that honourable\r\nPickwickian whose voice he had just heard--it was celebrated; but if the\r\nfame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the\r\nknown world, the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of\r\nthat production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which\r\nhe looked around him, on this, the proudest moment of his existence.\r\n(Cheers.) He was a humble individual. (\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d) Still he could not but\r\nfeel that they had selected him for a service of great honour, and of\r\nsome danger. Travelling was in a troubled state, and the minds of\r\ncoachmen were unsettled. Let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes\r\nwhich were enacting around them. Stage-coaches were upsetting in all\r\ndirections, horses were bolting, boats were overturning, and boilers\r\nwere bursting. (Cheers--a voice \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d) No! (Cheers.) Let that honourable\r\nPickwickian who cried \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d so loudly come forward and deny it, if he\r\ncould. (Cheers.) Who was it that cried \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d? (Enthusiastic cheering.)\r\nWas it some vain and disappointed man--he would not say haberdasher\r\n(loud cheers)--who, jealous of the praise which had been--perhaps\r\nundeservedly--bestowed on his (Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s) researches, and smarting\r\nunder the censure which had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at\r\nrivalry, now took this vile and calumnious mode of--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MR. BLOTTON (of Aldgate) rose to order. Did the honourable Pickwickian\r\nallude to him? (Cries of \xe2\x80\x9cOrder,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChair,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLeave\r\noff,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MR. PICKWICK would not put up to be put down by clamour. He had alluded\r\nto the honourable gentleman. (Great excitement.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MR. BLOTTON would only say then, that he repelled the hon. gent.\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfalse and scurrilous accusation, with profound contempt. (Great\r\ncheering.) The hon. gent. was a humbug. (Immense confusion, and loud\r\ncries of \xe2\x80\x9cChair,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOrder.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. A. SNODGRASS rose to order. He threw himself upon the chair.\r\n(Hear.) He wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two\r\nmembers of that club should be allowed to continue. (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The CHAIRMAN was quite sure the hon. Pickwickian would withdraw the\r\nexpression he had just made use of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MR. BLOTTON, with all possible respect for the chair, was quite sure he\r\nwould not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The CHAIRMAN felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable\r\ngentleman, whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him\r\nin a common sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MR. BLOTTON had no hesitation in saying that he had not--he had used\r\nthe word in its Pickwickian sense. (Hear, hear.) He was bound to\r\nacknowledge that, personally, he entertained the highest regard and\r\nesteem for the honourable gentleman; he had merely considered him a\r\nhumbug in a Pickwickian point of view. (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MR. PICKWICK felt much gratified by the fair, candid, and full\r\nexplanation of his honourable friend. He begged it to be at once\r\nunderstood, that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a\r\nPickwickian construction. (Cheers.)\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the entry terminates, as we have no doubt the debate did also,\r\nafter arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point. We\r\nhave no official statement of the facts which the reader will find\r\nrecorded in the next chapter, but they have been carefully collated from\r\nletters and other MS. authorities, so unquestionably genuine as to\r\njustify their narration in a connected form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE FIRST DAY\xe2\x80\x99S JOURNEY, AND THE FIRST EVENING\xe2\x80\x99S ADVENTURES;\r\nWITH THEIR CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\nThat punctual servant of all work, the sun, had just risen, and begun to\r\nstrike a light on the morning of the thirteenth of May, one thousand\r\neight hundred and twenty-seven, when Mr. Samuel Pickwick burst like\r\nanother sun from his slumbers, threw open his chamber window, and looked\r\nout upon the world beneath. Goswell Street was at his feet, Goswell\r\nStreet was on his right hand--as far as the eye could reach, Goswell\r\nStreet extended on his left; and the opposite side of Goswell Street was\r\nover the way. \xe2\x80\x98Such,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98are the narrow views of\r\nthose philosophers who, content with examining the things that lie\r\nbefore them, look not to the truths which are hidden beyond. As well\r\nmight I be content to gaze on Goswell Street for ever, without one\r\neffort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 And having given vent to this beautiful reflection, Mr. Pickwick\r\nproceeded to put himself into his clothes, and his clothes into his\r\nportmanteau. Great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of\r\ntheir attire; the operation of shaving, dressing, and coffee-imbibing\r\nwas soon performed; and, in another hour, Mr. Pickwick, with his\r\nportmanteau in his hand, his telescope in his greatcoat pocket, and his\r\nnote-book in his waistcoat, ready for the reception of any discoveries\r\nworthy of being noted down, had arrived at the coach-stand in St.\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s-le-Grand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cab!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here you are, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted a strange specimen of the human race, in a\r\nsackcloth coat, and apron of the same, who, with a brass label and\r\nnumber round his neck, looked as if he were catalogued in some\r\ncollection of rarities. This was the waterman. \xe2\x80\x98Here you are, sir. Now,\r\nthen, fust cab!\xe2\x80\x99 And the first cab having been fetched from the public-\r\nhouse, where he had been smoking his first pipe, Mr. Pickwick and his\r\nportmanteau were thrown into the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Golden Cross,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a bob\xe2\x80\x99s vorth, Tommy,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the driver sulkily, for the\r\ninformation of his friend the waterman, as the cab drove off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How old is that horse, my friend?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his\r\nnose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forty-two,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the driver, eyeing him askant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand upon his note-book. The\r\ndriver reiterated his former statement. Mr. Pickwick looked very hard at\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s face, but his features were immovable, so he noted down the\r\nfact forthwith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how long do you keep him out at a time?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick,\r\nsearching for further information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two or three veeks,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Weeks!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick in astonishment, and out came the note-book\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He lives at Pentonwil when he\xe2\x80\x99s at home,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the driver coolly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but we seldom takes him home, on account of his weakness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On account of his weakness!\xe2\x80\x99 reiterated the perplexed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He always falls down when he\xe2\x80\x99s took out o\xe2\x80\x99 the cab,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the\r\ndriver, \xe2\x80\x98but when he\xe2\x80\x99s in it, we bears him up werry tight, and takes him\r\nin werry short, so as he can\xe2\x80\x99t werry well fall down; and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\npair o\xe2\x80\x99 precious large wheels on, so ven he does move, they run after\r\nhim, and he must go on--he can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick entered every word of this statement in his note-book, with\r\nthe view of communicating it to the club, as a singular instance of the\r\ntenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances. The entry was\r\nscarcely completed when they reached the Golden Cross. Down jumped the\r\ndriver, and out got Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr.\r\nWinkle, who had been anxiously waiting the arrival of their illustrious\r\nleader, crowded to welcome him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s your fare,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, holding out the shilling to the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\nWhat was the learned man\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, when that unaccountable person\r\nflung the money on the pavement, and requested in figurative terms to be\r\nallowed the pleasure of fighting him (Mr. Pickwick) for the amount!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are mad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or drunk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or both,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come on!\xe2\x80\x99 said the cab-driver, sparring away like clockwork. \xe2\x80\x98Come on--\r\nall four on you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a lark!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted half a dozen hackney coachmen. \xe2\x80\x98Go to vork,\r\nSam!--and they crowded with great glee round the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the row, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Row!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cabman, \xe2\x80\x98what did he want my number for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want your number,\xe2\x80\x99 said the astonished Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you take it for, then?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would anybody believe,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the cab-driver, appealing to the\r\ncrowd, \xe2\x80\x98would anybody believe as an informer\xe2\x80\x99ud go about in a man\xe2\x80\x99s cab,\r\nnot only takin\xe2\x80\x99 down his number, but ev\xe2\x80\x99ry word he says into the\r\nbargain\xe2\x80\x99 (a light flashed upon Mr. Pickwick--it was the note-book).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he though?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired another cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, did he,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the first; \xe2\x80\x98and then arter aggerawatin\xe2\x80\x99 me to\r\nassault him, gets three witnesses here to prove it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it\r\nhim, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve six months for it. Come on!\xe2\x80\x99 and the cabman dashed his hat\r\nupon the ground, with a reckless disregard of his own private property,\r\nand knocked Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles off, and followed up the attack\r\nwith a blow on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and another on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s chest,\r\nand a third in Mr. Snodgrass\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and a fourth, by way of variety, in\r\nMr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat, and then danced into the road, and then back\r\nagain to the pavement, and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of\r\nbreath out of Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s body; and all in half a dozen seconds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s an officer?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put \xe2\x80\x98em under the pump,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested a hot-pieman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall smart for this,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Informers!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come on,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the cabman, who had been sparring without cessation the\r\nwhole time.\r\n\r\nThe mob hitherto had been passive spectators of the scene, but as the\r\nintelligence of the Pickwickians being informers was spread among them,\r\nthey began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of\r\nenforcing the heated pastry-vendor\xe2\x80\x99s proposition: and there is no saying\r\nwhat acts of personal aggression they might have committed, had not the\r\naffray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a new-comer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the fun?\xe2\x80\x99 said a rather tall, thin, young man, in a green coat,\r\nemerging suddenly from the coach-yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Informers!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the crowd again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are not,\xe2\x80\x99 roared Mr. Pickwick, in a tone which, to any dispassionate\r\nlistener, carried conviction with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, though--ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the young man, appealing to Mr.\r\nPickwick, and making his way through the crowd by the infallible process\r\nof elbowing the countenances of its component members.\r\n\r\nThat learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come along, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said he of the green coat, lugging Mr. Pickwick\r\nafter him by main force, and talking the whole way. Here, No. 924, take\r\nyour fare, and take yourself off--respectable gentleman--know him well--\r\nnone of your nonsense--this way, sir--where\xe2\x80\x99s your friends?--all a\r\nmistake, I see--never mind--accidents will happen--best regulated\r\nfamilies--never say die--down upon your luck--Pull him _up_--Put that in\r\nhis pipe--like the flavour--damned rascals.\xe2\x80\x99 And with a lengthened\r\nstring of similar broken sentences, delivered with extraordinary\r\nvolubility, the stranger led the way to the traveller\xe2\x80\x99s waiting-room,\r\nwhither he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and his disciples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, waiter!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the stranger, ringing the bell with tremendous\r\nviolence, \xe2\x80\x98glasses round--brandy-and-water, hot and strong, and sweet,\r\nand plenty,--eye damaged, Sir? Waiter! raw beef-steak for the\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s eye--nothing like raw beef-steak for a bruise, sir; cold\r\nlamp-post very good, but lamp-post inconvenient--damned odd standing in\r\nthe open street half an hour, with your eye against a lamp-post--eh,--\r\nvery good--ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 And the stranger, without stopping to take breath,\r\nswallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy-and-water,\r\nand flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon\r\nhad occurred.\r\n\r\nWhile his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their\r\nthanks to their new acquaintance, Mr. Pickwick had leisure to examine\r\nhis costume and appearance.\r\n\r\nHe was about the middle height, but the thinness of his body, and the\r\nlength of his legs, gave him the appearance of being much taller. The\r\ngreen coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow-tails,\r\nbut had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the\r\nstranger, for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his\r\nwrists. It was buttoned closely up to his chin, at the imminent hazard\r\nof splitting the back; and an old stock, without a vestige of shirt\r\ncollar, ornamented his neck. His scanty black trousers displayed here\r\nand there those shiny patches which bespeak long service, and were\r\nstrapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes, as if to\r\nconceal the dirty white stockings, which were nevertheless distinctly\r\nvisible. His long, black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath\r\neach side of his old pinched-up hat; and glimpses of his bare wrists\r\nmight be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his\r\ncoat sleeves. His face was thin and haggard; but an indescribable air of\r\njaunty impudence and perfect self-possession pervaded the whole man.\r\n\r\nSuch was the individual on whom Mr. Pickwick gazed through his\r\nspectacles (which he had fortunately recovered), and to whom he\r\nproceeded, when his friends had exhausted themselves, to return in\r\nchosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, cutting the address very short, \xe2\x80\x98said\r\nenough--no more; smart chap that cabman--handled his fives well; but if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d been your friend in the green jemmy--damn me--punch his head,--\xe2\x80\x98cod\r\nI would,--pig\xe2\x80\x99s whisper--pieman too,--no gammon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the Rochester\r\ncoachman, to announce that \xe2\x80\x98the Commodore\xe2\x80\x99 was on the point of starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Commodore!\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, starting up, \xe2\x80\x98my coach--place booked,--\r\none outside--leave you to pay for the brandy-and-water,--want change for\r\na five,--bad silver--Brummagem buttons--won\xe2\x80\x99t do--no go--eh?\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\nshook his head most knowingly.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that Mr. Pickwick and his three companions had\r\nresolved to make Rochester their first halting-place too; and having\r\nintimated to their new-found acquaintance that they were journeying to\r\nthe same city, they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach,\r\nwhere they could all sit together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Up with you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, assisting Mr. Pickwick on to the roof\r\nwith so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeportment very materially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any luggage, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who--I? Brown paper parcel here, that\xe2\x80\x99s all--other luggage gone by\r\nwater--packing-cases, nailed up--big as houses--heavy, heavy, damned\r\nheavy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger, as he forced into his pocket as much as he\r\ncould of the brown paper parcel, which presented most suspicious\r\nindications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heads, heads--take care of your heads!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the loquacious stranger,\r\nas they came out under the low archway, which in those days formed the\r\nentrance to the coach-yard. \xe2\x80\x98Terrible place--dangerous work--other day--\r\nfive children--mother--tall lady, eating sandwiches--forgot the arch--\r\ncrash--knock--children look round--mother\xe2\x80\x99s head off--sandwich in her\r\nhand--no mouth to put it in--head of a family off--shocking, shocking!\r\nLooking at Whitehall, sir?--fine place--little window--somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead off there, eh, sir?--he didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a sharp look-out enough either-\r\n-eh, Sir, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am ruminating,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98on the strange mutability of\r\nhuman affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I see--in at the palace door one day, out at the window the next.\r\nPhilosopher, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An observer of human nature, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so am I. Most people are when they\xe2\x80\x99ve little to do and less to get.\r\nPoet, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend Mr. Snodgrass has a strong poetic turn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So have I,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98Epic poem--ten thousand lines--\r\nrevolution of July--composed it on the spot--Mars by day, Apollo by\r\nnight--bang the field-piece, twang the lyre.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were present at that glorious scene, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Present! think I was;* fired a musket--fired with an idea--rushed into\r\nwine shop--wrote it down--back again--whiz, bang--another idea--wine\r\nshop again--pen and ink--back again--cut and slash--noble time, Sir.\r\nSportsman, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 abruptly turning to Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\r\n* A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of Mr. Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination; this dialogue occurring in the year 1827, and the\r\nRevolution in 1830.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A little, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine pursuit, sir--fine pursuit.--Dogs, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not just now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you should keep dogs--fine animals--sagacious creatures--dog of my\r\nown once--pointer--surprising instinct--out shooting one day--entering\r\ninclosure--whistled--dog stopped--whistled again--Ponto--no go; stock\r\nstill--called him--Ponto, Ponto--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t move--dog transfixed--staring\r\nat a board--looked up, saw an inscription--\xe2\x80\x9cGamekeeper has orders to\r\nshoot all dogs found in this inclosure\xe2\x80\x9d--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass it--wonderful\r\ndog--valuable dog that--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Singular circumstance that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to\r\nmake a note of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir, certainly--hundred more anecdotes of the same animal.--\r\nFine girl, Sir\xe2\x80\x99 (to Mr. Tracy Tupman, who had been bestowing sundry\r\nanti-Pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98English girls not so fine as Spanish--noble creatures--jet hair--black\r\neyes--lovely forms--sweet creatures--beautiful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been in Spain, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tracy Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lived there--ages.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many conquests, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Conquests! Thousands. Don Bolaro Fizzgig--grandee--only daughter--Donna\r\nChristina--splendid creature--loved me to distraction--jealous father--\r\nhigh-souled daughter--handsome Englishman--Donna Christina in despair--\r\nprussic acid--stomach pump in my portmanteau--operation performed--old\r\nBolaro in ecstasies--consent to our union--join hands and floods of\r\ntears--romantic story--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the lady in England now, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman, on whom the\r\ndescription of her charms had produced a powerful impression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead, sir--dead,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, applying to his right eye the\r\nbrief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x98Never recovered the\r\nstomach pump--undermined constitution--fell a victim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And her father?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the poetic Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remorse and misery,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98Sudden disappearance--talk\r\nof the whole city--search made everywhere without success--public\r\nfountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing--weeks elapsed--\r\nstill a stoppage--workmen employed to clean it--water drawn off--father-\r\nin-law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe, with a full\r\nconfession in his right boot--took him out, and the fountain played away\r\nagain, as well as ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to note that little romance down, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, deeply affected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir, certainly--fifty more if you like to hear \xe2\x80\x98em--strange\r\nlife mine--rather curious history--not extraordinary, but singular.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn this strain, with an occasional glass of ale, by way of parenthesis,\r\nwhen the coach changed horses, did the stranger proceed, until they\r\nreached Rochester bridge, by which time the note-books, both of Mr.\r\nPickwick and Mr. Snodgrass, were completely filled with selections from\r\nhis adventures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Magnificent ruin!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Augustus Snodgrass, with all the poetic\r\nfervour that distinguished him, when they came in sight of the fine old\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a study for an antiquarian!\xe2\x80\x99 were the very words which fell from\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, as he applied his telescope to his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! fine place,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98glorious pile--frowning walls--\r\ntottering arches--dark nooks--crumbling staircases--old cathedral too--\r\nearthy smell--pilgrims\xe2\x80\x99 feet wore away the old steps--little Saxon\r\ndoors--confessionals like money-takers\xe2\x80\x99 boxes at theatres--queer\r\ncustomers those monks--popes, and lord treasurers, and all sorts of old\r\nfellows, with great red faces, and broken noses, turning up every day--\r\nbuff jerkins too--match-locks--sarcophagus--fine place--old legends too-\r\n-strange stories: capital;\xe2\x80\x99 and the stranger continued to soliloquise\r\nuntil they reached the Bull Inn, in the High Street, where the coach\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remain here, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Nathaniel Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here--not I--but you\xe2\x80\x99d better--good house--nice beds--Wright\xe2\x80\x99s next\r\nhouse, dear--very dear--half-a-crown in the bill if you look at the\r\nwaiter--charge you more if you dine at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s than they would if you\r\ndined in the coffee-room--rum fellows--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle turned to Mr. Pickwick, and murmured a few words; a whisper\r\npassed from Mr. Pickwick to Mr. Snodgrass, from Mr. Snodgrass to Mr.\r\nTupman, and nods of assent were exchanged. Mr. Pickwick addressed the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You rendered us a very important service this morning, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging\r\nthe favour of your company at dinner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great pleasure--not presume to dictate, but broiled fowl and mushrooms-\r\n-capital thing! What time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, referring to his watch, \xe2\x80\x98it is now\r\nnearly three. Shall we say five?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suit me excellently,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98five precisely--till then--\r\ncare of yourselves;\xe2\x80\x99 and lifting the pinched-up hat a few inches from\r\nhis head, and carelessly replacing it very much on one side, the\r\nstranger, with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket,\r\nwalked briskly up the yard, and turned into the High Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Evidently a traveller in many countries, and a close observer of men\r\nand things,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to see his poem,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to have seen that dog,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman said nothing; but he thought of Donna Christina, the stomach\r\npump, and the fountain; and his eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\nA private sitting-room having been engaged, bedrooms inspected, and\r\ndinner ordered, the party walked out to view the city and adjoining\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWe do not find, from a careful perusal of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s notes of the\r\nfour towns, Stroud, Rochester, Chatham, and Brompton, that his\r\nimpressions of their appearance differ in any material point from those\r\nof other travellers who have gone over the same ground. His general\r\ndescription is easily abridged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The principal productions of these towns,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98appear\r\nto be soldiers, sailors, Jews, chalk, shrimps, officers, and dockyard\r\nmen. The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are\r\nmarine stores, hard-bake, apples, flat-fish, and oysters. The streets\r\npresent a lively and animated appearance, occasioned chiefly by the\r\nconviviality of the military. It is truly delightful to a philanthropic\r\nmind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an\r\noverflow both of animal and ardent spirits; more especially when we\r\nremember that the following them about, and jesting with them, affords a\r\ncheap and innocent amusement for the boy population. Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 adds Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98can exceed their good-humour. It was but the day before my\r\narrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of\r\na publican. The barmaid had positively refused to draw him any more\r\nliquor; in return for which he had (merely in playfulness) drawn his\r\nbayonet, and wounded the girl in the shoulder. And yet this fine fellow\r\nwas the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his\r\nreadiness to overlook the matter, and forget what had occurred!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The consumption of tobacco in these towns,\xe2\x80\x99 continues Mr. Pickwick,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98must be very great, and the smell which pervades the streets must be\r\nexceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking. A\r\nsuperficial traveller might object to the dirt, which is their leading\r\ncharacteristic; but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and\r\ncommercial prosperity, it is truly gratifying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPunctual to five o\xe2\x80\x99clock came the stranger, and shortly afterwards the\r\ndinner. He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel, but had made\r\nno alteration in his attire, and was, if possible, more loquacious than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired, as the waiter removed one of the covers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Soles, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Soles--ah!--capital fish--all come from London-stage-coach proprietors\r\nget up political dinners--carriage of soles--dozens of baskets--cunning\r\nfellows. Glass of wine, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; and the stranger took wine, first\r\nwith him, and then with Mr. Snodgrass, and then with Mr. Tupman, and\r\nthen with Mr. Winkle, and then with the whole party together, almost as\r\nrapidly as he talked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Devil of a mess on the staircase, waiter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98Forms\r\ngoing up--carpenters coming down--lamps, glasses, harps. What\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nforward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ball, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Assembly, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sir, not assembly, Sir. Ball for the benefit of a charity, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many fine women in this town, do you know, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman,\r\nwith great interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Splendid--capital. Kent, sir--everybody knows Kent--apples, cherries,\r\nhops, and women. Glass of wine, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman. The stranger filled, and\r\nemptied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should very much like to go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, resuming the subject\r\nof the ball, \xe2\x80\x98very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tickets at the bar, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the waiter; \xe2\x80\x98half-a-guinea each,\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the\r\nfestivity; but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, or the abstracted gaze of Mr. Pickwick, he applied himself\r\nwith great interest to the port wine and dessert, which had just been\r\nplaced on the table. The waiter withdrew, and the party were left to\r\nenjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98bottle stands--pass it\r\nround--way of the sun--through the button-hole--no heeltaps,\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\nemptied his glass, which he had filled about two minutes before, and\r\npoured out another, with the air of a man who was used to it.\r\n\r\nThe wine was passed, and a fresh supply ordered. The visitor talked, the\r\nPickwickians listened. Mr. Tupman felt every moment more disposed for\r\nthe ball. Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s countenance glowed with an expression of\r\nuniversal philanthropy, and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass fell fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re beginning upstairs,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger--\xe2\x80\x98hear the company--\r\nfiddles tuning--now the harp--there they go.\xe2\x80\x99 The various sounds which\r\nfound their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first\r\nquadrille.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I should like to go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So should I,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger--\xe2\x80\x98confounded luggage,--heavy smacks--\r\nnothing to go in--odd, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow general benevolence was one of the leading features of the\r\nPickwickian theory, and no one was more remarkable for the zealous\r\nmanner in which he observed so noble a principle than Mr. Tracy Tupman.\r\nThe number of instances recorded on the Transactions of the Society, in\r\nwhich that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of\r\nother members for left-off garments or pecuniary relief is almost\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the\r\npurpose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tracy Tupman, \xe2\x80\x98but you are rather slim, and I am--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather fat--grown-up Bacchus--cut the leaves--dismounted from the tub,\r\nand adopted kersey, eh?--not double distilled, but double milled--ha!\r\nha! pass the wine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in\r\nwhich he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so\r\nquickly away, or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an\r\ninfluential member of the Pickwick Club being ignominiously compared to\r\na dismounted Bacchus, is a fact not yet completely ascertained. He\r\npassed the wine, coughed twice, and looked at the stranger for several\r\nseconds with a stern intensity; as that individual, however, appeared\r\nperfectly collected, and quite calm under his searching glance, he\r\ngradually relaxed, and reverted to the subject of the ball.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was about to observe, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98that though my apparel would be\r\ntoo large, a suit of my friend Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s would, perhaps, fit you\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stranger took Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s measure with his eye, and that feature\r\nglistened with satisfaction as he said, \xe2\x80\x98Just the thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman looked round him. The wine, which had exerted its somniferous\r\ninfluence over Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle, had stolen upon the senses\r\nof Mr. Pickwick. That gentleman had gradually passed through the various\r\nstages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner, and its\r\nconsequences. He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height\r\nof conviviality to the depth of misery, and from the depth of misery to\r\nthe height of conviviality. Like a gas-lamp in the street, with the wind\r\nin the pipe, he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy, then\r\nsank so low as to be scarcely discernible; after a short interval, he\r\nhad burst out again, to enlighten for a moment; then flickered with an\r\nuncertain, staggering sort of light, and then gone out altogether. His\r\nhead was sunk upon his bosom, and perpetual snoring, with a partial\r\nchoke occasionally, were the only audible indications of the great man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThe temptation to be present at the ball, and to form his first\r\nimpressions of the beauty of the Kentish ladies, was strong upon Mr.\r\nTupman. The temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great.\r\nHe was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants, and the\r\nstranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had\r\nlived there from his infancy. Mr. Winkle was asleep, and Mr. Tupman had\r\nhad sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he\r\nawoke he would, in the ordinary course of nature, roll heavily to bed.\r\nHe was undecided. \xe2\x80\x98Fill your glass, and pass the wine,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nindefatigable visitor.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman did as he was requested; and the additional stimulus of the\r\nlast glass settled his determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom is inside mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman; \xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make him\r\nunderstand what I wanted, if I woke him now, but I know he has a dress-\r\nsuit in a carpet bag; and supposing you wore it to the ball, and took it\r\noff when we returned, I could replace it without troubling him at all\r\nabout the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98famous plan--damned odd situation--\r\nfourteen coats in the packing-cases, and obliged to wear another man\xe2\x80\x99s--\r\nvery good notion, that--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must purchase our tickets,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not worth while splitting a guinea,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98toss who shall\r\npay for both--I call; you spin--first time--woman--woman--bewitching\r\nwoman,\xe2\x80\x99 and down came the sovereign with the dragon (called by courtesy\r\na woman) uppermost.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman rang the bell, purchased the tickets, and ordered chamber\r\ncandlesticks. In another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely\r\narrayed in a full suit of Mr. Nathaniel Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a new coat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, as the stranger surveyed himself\r\nwith great complacency in a cheval glass; \xe2\x80\x98the first that\xe2\x80\x99s been made\r\nwith our club button,\xe2\x80\x99 and he called his companions\xe2\x80\x99 attention to the\r\nlarge gilt button which displayed a bust of Mr. Pickwick in the centre,\r\nand the letters \xe2\x80\x98P. C.\xe2\x80\x99 on either side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cP. C.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger--\xe2\x80\x98queer set out--old fellow\xe2\x80\x99s likeness, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. C.\xe2\x80\x9d--What does \xe2\x80\x9cP. C.\xe2\x80\x9d stand for--Peculiar Coat, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Tupman,\r\nwith rising indignation and great importance, explained the mystic\r\ndevice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather short in the waist, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, screwing\r\nhimself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons,\r\nwhich were half-way up his back. \xe2\x80\x98Like a general postman\xe2\x80\x99s coat--queer\r\ncoats those--made by contract--no measuring--mysterious dispensations of\r\nProvidence--all the short men get long coats--all the long men short\r\nones.\xe2\x80\x99 Running on in this way, Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s new companion adjusted his\r\ndress, or rather the dress of Mr. Winkle; and, accompanied by Mr.\r\nTupman, ascended the staircase leading to the ballroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What names, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the man at the door. Mr. Tracy Tupman was\r\nstepping forward to announce his own titles, when the stranger prevented\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No names at all;\xe2\x80\x99 and then he whispered Mr. Tupman, \xe2\x80\x98names won\xe2\x80\x99t do--\r\nnot known--very good names in their way, but not great ones--capital\r\nnames for a small party, but won\xe2\x80\x99t make an impression in public\r\nassemblies--incog. the thing--gentlemen from London--distinguished\r\nforeigners--anything.\xe2\x80\x99 The door was thrown open, and Mr. Tracy Tupman\r\nand the stranger entered the ballroom.\r\n\r\nIt was a long room, with crimson-covered benches, and wax candles in\r\nglass chandeliers. The musicians were securely confined in an elevated\r\nden, and quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or\r\nthree sets of dancers. Two card-tables were made up in the adjoining\r\ncard-room, and two pair of old ladies, and a corresponding number of\r\nstout gentlemen, were executing whist therein.\r\n\r\nThe finale concluded, the dancers promenaded the room, and Mr. Tupman\r\nand his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charming women,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98fun presently--nobs not come yet--\r\nqueer place--dockyard people of upper rank don\xe2\x80\x99t know dockyard people of\r\nlower rank--dockyard people of lower rank don\xe2\x80\x99t know small gentry--small\r\ngentry don\xe2\x80\x99t know tradespeople--commissioner don\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes, in a fancy\r\ndress?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, pray--pink eyes--fancy dress--little boy--nonsense--ensign 97th--\r\nHonourable Wilmot Snipe--great family--Snipes--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Thomas Clubber, Lady Clubber, and the Misses Clubber!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the\r\nman at the door in a stentorian voice. A great sensation was created\r\nthroughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat\r\nand bright buttons, a large lady in blue satin, and two young ladies, on\r\na similar scale, in fashionably-made dresses of the same hue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Commissioner--head of the yard--great man--remarkably great man,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhispered the stranger in Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s ear, as the charitable committee\r\nushered Sir Thomas Clubber and family to the top of the room. The\r\nHonourable Wilmot Snipe, and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to\r\nrender homage to the Misses Clubber; and Sir Thomas Clubber stood bolt\r\nupright, and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the\r\nassembled company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Smithie, Mrs. Smithie, and the Misses Smithie,\xe2\x80\x99 was the next\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Smithie?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tracy Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something in the yard,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger. Mr. Smithie bowed\r\ndeferentially to Sir Thomas Clubber; and Sir Thomas Clubber acknowledged\r\nthe salute with conscious condescension. Lady Clubber took a telescopic\r\nview of Mrs. Smithie and family through her eye-glass and Mrs. Smithie\r\nstared in her turn at Mrs. Somebody-else, whose husband was not in the\r\ndockyard at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Colonel Bulder, Mrs. Colonel Bulder, and Miss Bulder,\xe2\x80\x99 were the next\r\narrivals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Head of the garrison,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, in reply to Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquiring look.\r\n\r\nMiss Bulder was warmly welcomed by the Misses Clubber; the greeting\r\nbetween Mrs. Colonel Bulder and Lady Clubber was of the most\r\naffectionate description; Colonel Bulder and Sir Thomas Clubber\r\nexchanged snuff-boxes, and looked very much like a pair of Alexander\r\nSelkirks--\xe2\x80\x98Monarchs of all they surveyed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile the aristocracy of the place--the Bulders, and Clubbers, and\r\nSnipes--were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room,\r\nthe other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts\r\nof it. The less aristocratic officers of the 97th devoted themselves to\r\nthe families of the less important functionaries from the dockyard. The\r\nsolicitors\xe2\x80\x99 wives, and the wine-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wife, headed another grade\r\n(the brewer\xe2\x80\x99s wife visited the Bulders); and Mrs. Tomlinson, the post-\r\noffice keeper, seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader\r\nof the trade party.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular personages, in his own circle, present, was a\r\nlittle fat man, with a ring of upright black hair round his head, and an\r\nextensive bald plain on the top of it--Doctor Slammer, surgeon to the\r\n97th. The doctor took snuff with everybody, chatted with everybody,\r\nlaughed, danced, made jokes, played whist, did everything, and was\r\neverywhere. To these pursuits, multifarious as they were, the little\r\ndoctor added a more important one than any--he was indefatigable in\r\npaying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow,\r\nwhose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable\r\naddition to a limited income.\r\n\r\nUpon the doctor, and the widow, the eyes of both Mr. Tupman and his\r\ncompanion had been fixed for some time, when the stranger broke silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lots of money--old girl--pompous doctor--not a bad idea--good fun,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwere the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips. Mr. Tupman\r\nlooked inquisitively in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll dance with the widow,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is she?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know--never saw her in all my life--cut out the doctor--here\r\ngoes.\xe2\x80\x99 And the stranger forthwith crossed the room; and, leaning against\r\na mantel-piece, commenced gazing with an air of respectful and\r\nmelancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady. Mr.\r\nTupman looked on, in mute astonishment. The stranger progressed rapidly;\r\nthe little doctor danced with another lady; the widow dropped her fan;\r\nthe stranger picked it up, and presented it--a smile--a bow--a curtsey--\r\na few words of conversation. The stranger walked boldly up to, and\r\nreturned with, the master of the ceremonies; a little introductory\r\npantomime; and the stranger and Mrs. Budger took their places in a\r\nquadrille.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of Mr. Tupman at this summary proceeding, great as it was,\r\nwas immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor. The\r\nstranger was young, and the widow was flattered. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s attentions\r\nwere unheeded by the widow; and the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s indignation was wholly lost\r\non his imperturbable rival. Doctor Slammer was paralysed. He, Doctor\r\nSlammer, of the 97th, to be extinguished in a moment, by a man whom\r\nnobody had ever seen before, and whom nobody knew even now! Doctor\r\nSlammer--Doctor Slammer of the 97th rejected! Impossible! It could not\r\nbe! Yes, it was; there they were. What! introducing his friend! Could he\r\nbelieve his eyes! He looked again, and was under the painful necessity\r\nof admitting the veracity of his optics; Mrs. Budger was dancing with\r\nMr. Tracy Tupman; there was no mistaking the fact. There was the widow\r\nbefore him, bouncing bodily here and there, with unwonted vigour; and\r\nMr. Tracy Tupman hopping about, with a face expressive of the most\r\nintense solemnity, dancing (as a good many people do) as if a quadrille\r\nwere not a thing to be laughed at, but a severe trial to the feelings,\r\nwhich it requires inflexible resolution to encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSilently and patiently did the doctor bear all this, and all the\r\nhandings of negus, and watching for glasses, and darting for biscuits,\r\nand coquetting, that ensued; but, a few seconds after the stranger had\r\ndisappeared to lead Mrs. Budger to her carriage, he darted swiftly from\r\nthe room with every particle of his hitherto-bottled-up indignation\r\neffervescing, from all parts of his countenance, in a perspiration of\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was returning, and Mr. Tupman was beside him. He spoke in a\r\nlow tone, and laughed. The little doctor thirsted for his life. He was\r\nexulting. He had triumphed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, in an awful voice, producing a card, and\r\nretiring into an angle of the passage, \xe2\x80\x98my name is Slammer, Doctor\r\nSlammer, sir--97th Regiment--Chatham Barracks--my card, Sir, my card.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe would have added more, but his indignation choked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger coolly, \xe2\x80\x98Slammer--much obliged--polite\r\nattention--not ill now, Slammer--but when I am--knock you up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--you\xe2\x80\x99re a shuffler, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped the furious doctor, \xe2\x80\x98a poltroon--a\r\ncoward--a liar--a--a--will nothing induce you to give me your card,\r\nsir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, half aside, \xe2\x80\x98negus too strong here--\r\nliberal landlord--very foolish--very--lemonade much better--hot rooms--\r\nelderly gentlemen--suffer for it in the morning--cruel--cruel;\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\nmoved on a step or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are stopping in this house, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the indignant little man;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you are intoxicated now, Sir; you shall hear from me in the morning,\r\nsir. I shall find you out, sir; I shall find you out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather you found me out than found me at home,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the unmoved\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nDoctor Slammer looked unutterable ferocity, as he fixed his hat on his\r\nhead with an indignant knock; and the stranger and Mr. Tupman ascended\r\nto the bedroom of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the\r\nunconscious Winkle.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was fast asleep; the restoration was soon made. The\r\nstranger was extremely jocose; and Mr. Tracy Tupman, being quite\r\nbewildered with wine, negus, lights, and ladies, thought the whole\r\naffair was an exquisite joke. His new friend departed; and, after\r\nexperiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his\r\nnightcap, originally intended for the reception of his head, and finally\r\noverturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on, Mr. Tracy\r\nTupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions,\r\nand shortly afterwards sank into repose.\r\n\r\nSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning, when\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of\r\nunconsciousness, in which slumber had plunged it, by a loud knocking at\r\nhis chamber door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, starting up in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boots, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please, sir, can you tell me which gentleman of your party wears a\r\nbright blue dress-coat, with a gilt button with \xe2\x80\x9cP. C.\xe2\x80\x9d on it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s been given out to brush,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98and the man has\r\nforgotten whom it belongs to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 he called out, \xe2\x80\x98next room but two, on the right hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Boots, and away he went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Tupman, as a loud knocking at his door\r\nroused him from his oblivious repose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I speak to Mr. Winkle, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Boots from the outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winkle--Winkle!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Tupman, calling into the inner room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 replied a faint voice from within the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wanted--some one at the door;\xe2\x80\x99 and, having exerted himself to\r\narticulate thus much, Mr. Tracy Tupman turned round and fell fast asleep\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wanted!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, hastily jumping out of bed, and putting on a\r\nfew articles of clothing; \xe2\x80\x98wanted! at this distance from town--who on\r\nearth can want me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentleman in the coffee-room, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the Boots, as Mr. Winkle\r\nopened the door and confronted him; \xe2\x80\x98gentleman says he\xe2\x80\x99ll not detain you\r\na moment, Sir, but he can take no denial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very odd!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll be down directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe hurriedly wrapped himself in a travelling-shawl and dressing-gown,\r\nand proceeded downstairs. An old woman and a couple of waiters were\r\ncleaning the coffee-room, and an officer in undress uniform was looking\r\nout of the window. He turned round as Mr. Winkle entered, and made a\r\nstiff inclination of the head. Having ordered the attendants to retire,\r\nand closed the door very carefully, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Winkle, I presume?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Winkle, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not be surprised, sir, when I inform you that I have called\r\nhere this morning on behalf of my friend, Doctor Slammer, of the 97th.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctor Slammer!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctor Slammer. He begged me to express his opinion that your conduct\r\nof last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure;\r\nand\xe2\x80\x99 (he added) \xe2\x80\x98which no one gentleman would pursue towards another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment was too real, and too evident, to escape the\r\nobservation of Doctor Slammer\xe2\x80\x99s friend; he therefore proceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend, Doctor Slammer, requested me to add, that he was firmly\r\npersuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening, and\r\npossibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of. He\r\ncommissioned me to say, that should this be pleaded as an excuse for\r\nyour behaviour, he will consent to accept a written apology, to be\r\npenned by you, from my dictation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A written apology!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Winkle, in the most emphatic tone of\r\namazement possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you know the alternative,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the visitor coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were you intrusted with this message to me by name?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nWinkle, whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was not present myself,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the visitor, \xe2\x80\x98and in consequence of\r\nyour firm refusal to give your card to Doctor Slammer, I was desired by\r\nthat gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat--a bright\r\nblue dress-coat, with a gilt button displaying a bust, and the letters\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. C.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own\r\ncostume thus minutely described. Doctor Slammer\xe2\x80\x99s friend proceeded:--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From the inquiries I made at the bar, just now, I was convinced that\r\nthe owner of the coat in question arrived here, with three gentlemen,\r\nyesterday afternoon. I immediately sent up to the gentleman who was\r\ndescribed as appearing the head of the party, and he at once referred me\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf the principal tower of Rochester Castle had suddenly walked from its\r\nfoundation, and stationed itself opposite the coffee-room window, Mr.\r\nWinkle\xe2\x80\x99s surprise would have been as nothing compared with the profound\r\nastonishment with which he had heard this address. His first impression\r\nwas that his coat had been stolen. \xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to detain you one\r\nmoment?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the unwelcome visitor.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle ran hastily upstairs, and with a trembling hand opened the\r\nbag. There was the coat in its usual place, but exhibiting, on a close\r\ninspection, evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must be so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, letting the coat fall from his hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I took too much wine after dinner, and have a very vague recollection\r\nof walking about the streets, and smoking a cigar afterwards. The fact\r\nis, I was very drunk;--I must have changed my coat--gone somewhere--and\r\ninsulted somebody--I have no doubt of it; and this message is the\r\nterrible consequence.\xe2\x80\x99 Saying which, Mr. Winkle retraced his steps in\r\nthe direction of the coffee-room, with the gloomy and dreadful resolve\r\nof accepting the challenge of the warlike Doctor Slammer, and abiding by\r\nthe worst consequences that might ensue.\r\n\r\nTo this determination Mr. Winkle was urged by a variety of\r\nconsiderations, the first of which was his reputation with the club. He\r\nhad always been looked up to as a high authority on all matters of\r\namusement and dexterity, whether offensive, defensive, or inoffensive;\r\nand if, on this very first occasion of being put to the test, he shrunk\r\nback from the trial, beneath his leader\xe2\x80\x99s eye, his name and standing\r\nwere lost for ever. Besides, he remembered to have heard it frequently\r\nsurmised by the uninitiated in such matters that by an understood\r\narrangement between the seconds, the pistols were seldom loaded with\r\nball; and, furthermore, he reflected that if he applied to Mr. Snodgrass\r\nto act as his second, and depicted the danger in glowing terms, that\r\ngentleman might possibly communicate the intelligence to Mr. Pickwick,\r\nwho would certainly lose no time in transmitting it to the local\r\nauthorities, and thus prevent the killing or maiming of his follower.\r\n\r\nSuch were his thoughts when he returned to the coffee-room, and\r\nintimated his intention of accepting the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s challenge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you refer me to a friend, to arrange the time and place of\r\nmeeting?\xe2\x80\x99 said the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98name them to me, and I can\r\nprocure the attendance of a friend afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall we say--sunset this evening?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the officer, in a careless\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, thinking in his heart it was very bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know Fort Pitt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I saw it yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the\r\ntrench, take the foot-path to the left when you arrive at an angle of\r\nthe fortification, and keep straight on, till you see me, I will precede\r\nyou to a secluded place, where the affair can be conducted without fear\r\nof interruption.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fear of interruption!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing more to arrange, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not aware of anything more,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98Good-morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-morning;\xe2\x80\x99 and the officer whistled a lively air as he strode away.\r\n\r\nThat morning\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast passed heavily off. Mr. Tupman was not in a\r\ncondition to rise, after the unwonted dissipation of the previous night;\r\nMr. Snodgrass appeared to labour under a poetical depression of spirits;\r\nand even Mr. Pickwick evinced an unusual attachment to silence and soda-\r\nwater. Mr. Winkle eagerly watched his opportunity: it was not long\r\nwanting. Mr. Snodgrass proposed a visit to the castle, and as Mr. Winkle\r\nwas the only other member of the party disposed to walk, they went out\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Snodgrass,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, when they had turned out of the public\r\nstreet.\xe2\x80\x99Snodgrass, my dear fellow, can I rely upon your secrecy?\xe2\x80\x99 As he\r\nsaid this, he most devoutly and earnestly hoped he could not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass. \xe2\x80\x98Hear me swear--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Winkle, terrified at the idea of his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunconsciously pledging himself not to give information; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t swear,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t swear; it\xe2\x80\x99s quite unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass dropped the hand which he had, in the spirit of poesy,\r\nraised towards the clouds as he made the above appeal, and assumed an\r\nattitude of attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want your assistance, my dear fellow, in an affair of honour,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall have it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass, clasping his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With a doctor--Doctor Slammer, of the 97th,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, wishing\r\nto make the matter appear as solemn as possible; \xe2\x80\x98an affair with an\r\nofficer, seconded by another officer, at sunset this evening, in a\r\nlonely field beyond Fort Pitt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will attend you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nHe was astonished, but by no means dismayed. It is extraordinary how\r\ncool any party but the principal can be in such cases. Mr. Winkle had\r\nforgotten this. He had judged of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s feelings by his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The consequences may be dreadful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The doctor, I believe, is a very good shot,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most of these military men are,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Snodgrass calmly; \xe2\x80\x98but so\r\nare you, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle replied in the affirmative; and perceiving that he had not\r\nalarmed his companion sufficiently, changed his ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Snodgrass,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a voice tremulous with emotion, \xe2\x80\x98if I fall, you\r\nwill find in a packet which I shall place in your hands a note for my--\r\nfor my father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis attack was a failure also. Mr. Snodgrass was affected, but he\r\nundertook the delivery of the note as readily as if he had been a\r\ntwopenny postman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I fall,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98or if the doctor falls, you, my dear\r\nfriend, will be tried as an accessory before the fact. Shall I involve\r\nmy friend in transportation--possibly for life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass winced a little at this, but his heroism was invincible.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the cause of friendship,\xe2\x80\x99 he fervently exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98I would brave all\r\ndangers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Winkle cursed his companion\xe2\x80\x99s devoted friendship internally, as\r\nthey walked silently along, side by side, for some minutes, each\r\nimmersed in his own meditations! The morning was wearing away; he grew\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Snodgrass,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, stopping suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98do not let me be balked in\r\nthis matter--do not give information to the local authorities--do not\r\nobtain the assistance of several peace officers, to take either me or\r\nDoctor Slammer, of the 97th Regiment, at present quartered in Chatham\r\nBarracks, into custody, and thus prevent this duel!--I say, do not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass seized his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand warmly, as he enthusiastically\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x98Not for worlds!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA thrill passed over Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s frame as the conviction that he had\r\nnothing to hope from his friend\xe2\x80\x99s fears, and that he was destined to\r\nbecome an animated target, rushed forcibly upon him.\r\n\r\nThe state of the case having been formally explained to Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nand a case of satisfactory pistols, with the satisfactory accompaniments\r\nof powder, ball, and caps, having been hired from a manufacturer in\r\nRochester, the two friends returned to their inn; Mr. Winkle to ruminate\r\non the approaching struggle, and Mr. Snodgrass to arrange the weapons of\r\nwar, and put them into proper order for immediate use.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull and heavy evening when they again sallied forth on their\r\nawkward errand. Mr. Winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape\r\nobservation, and Mr. Snodgrass bore under his the instruments of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you got everything?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, in an agitated tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass; \xe2\x80\x98plenty of ammunition, in case the\r\nshots don\xe2\x80\x99t take effect. There\xe2\x80\x99s a quarter of a pound of powder in the\r\ncase, and I have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably\r\nfeel most grateful. The presumption is, that the gratitude of Mr. Winkle\r\nwas too powerful for utterance, as he said nothing, but continued to\r\nwalk on--rather slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are in excellent time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, as they climbed the\r\nfence of the first field; \xe2\x80\x98the sun is just going down.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Winkle\r\nlooked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability\r\nof his \xe2\x80\x98going down\xe2\x80\x99 himself, before long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s the officer,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Winkle, after a few minutes\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There--the gentleman in the blue cloak.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Snodgrass looked in the\r\ndirection indicated by the forefinger of his friend, and observed a\r\nfigure, muffled up, as he had described. The officer evinced his\r\nconsciousness of their presence by slightly beckoning with his hand; and\r\nthe two friends followed him at a little distance, as he walked away.\r\n\r\nThe evening grew more dull every moment, and a melancholy wind sounded\r\nthrough the deserted fields, like a distant giant whistling for his\r\nhouse-dog. The sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the\r\nfeelings of Mr. Winkle. He started as they passed the angle of the\r\ntrench--it looked like a colossal grave.\r\n\r\nThe officer turned suddenly from the path, and after climbing a paling,\r\nand scaling a hedge, entered a secluded field. Two gentlemen were\r\nwaiting in it; one was a little, fat man, with black hair; and the\r\nother--a portly personage in a braided surtout--was sitting with perfect\r\nequanimity on a camp-stool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The other party, and a surgeon, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass; \xe2\x80\x98take a\r\ndrop of brandy.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend\r\nproffered, and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend, Sir, Mr. Snodgrass,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, as the officer\r\napproached. Doctor Slammer\xe2\x80\x99s friend bowed, and produced a case similar\r\nto that which Mr. Snodgrass carried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have nothing further to say, Sir, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 he coldly remarked, as\r\nhe opened the case; \xe2\x80\x98an apology has been resolutely declined.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, who began to feel rather\r\nuncomfortable himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you step forward?\xe2\x80\x99 said the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass. The ground was measured, and\r\npreliminaries arranged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will find these better than your own,\xe2\x80\x99 said the opposite second,\r\nproducing his pistols. \xe2\x80\x98You saw me load them. Do you object to use\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass. The offer relieved him from\r\nconsiderable embarrassment, for his previous notions of loading a pistol\r\nwere rather vague and undefined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We may place our men, then, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the officer, with as\r\nmuch indifference as if the principals were chess-men, and the seconds\r\nplayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think we may,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass; who would have assented to any\r\nproposition, because he knew nothing about the matter. The officer\r\ncrossed to Doctor Slammer, and Mr. Snodgrass went up to Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all ready,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, offering the pistol. \xe2\x80\x98Give me your cloak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have got the packet, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said poor Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass. \xe2\x80\x98Be steady, and wing him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Mr. Winkle that this advice was very like that which\r\nbystanders invariably give to the smallest boy in a street fight,\r\nnamely, \xe2\x80\x98Go in, and win\xe2\x80\x99--an admirable thing to recommend, if you only\r\nknow how to do it. He took off his cloak, however, in silence--it always\r\ntook a long time to undo that cloak--and accepted the pistol. The\r\nseconds retired, the gentleman on the camp-stool did the same, and the\r\nbelligerents approached each other.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity. It is conjectured\r\nthat his unwillingness to hurt a fellow-creature intentionally was the\r\ncause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot; and\r\nthat the circumstance of his eyes being closed, prevented his observing\r\nthe very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of Doctor Slammer.\r\nThat gentleman started, stared, retreated, rubbed his eyes, stared\r\nagain, and, finally, shouted, \xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x99 said Doctor Slammer, as his friend and Mr. Snodgrass\r\ncame running up; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s not the man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the man!\xe2\x80\x99 said Doctor Slammer\xe2\x80\x99s second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the man!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the man!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman with the camp-stool in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the little doctor. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not the person who\r\ninsulted me last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman with the camp-stool. \xe2\x80\x98The only question is,\r\nwhether the gentleman, being on the ground, must not be considered, as a\r\nmatter of form, to be the individual who insulted our friend, Doctor\r\nSlammer, yesterday evening, whether he is really that individual or\r\nnot;\xe2\x80\x99 and having delivered this suggestion, with a very sage and\r\nmysterious air, the man with the camp-stool took a large pinch of snuff,\r\nand looked profoundly round, with the air of an authority in such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Winkle had opened his eyes, and his ears too, when he heard his\r\nadversary call out for a cessation of hostilities; and perceiving by\r\nwhat he had afterwards said that there was, beyond all question, some\r\nmistake in the matter, he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he\r\nshould inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming\r\nout; he therefore stepped boldly forward, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not the person. I know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the camp-stool, \xe2\x80\x98is an affront to Doctor\r\nSlammer, and a sufficient reason for proceeding immediately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray be quiet, Payne,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s second. \xe2\x80\x98Why did you not\r\ncommunicate this fact to me this morning, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure--to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the camp-stool indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I entreat you to be quiet, Payne,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other. \xe2\x80\x98May I repeat my\r\nquestion, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, who had had time to deliberate upon\r\nhis answer, \xe2\x80\x98because, Sir, you described an intoxicated and\r\nungentlemanly person as wearing a coat which I have the honour, not only\r\nto wear but to have invented--the proposed uniform, Sir, of the Pickwick\r\nClub in London. The honour of that uniform I feel bound to maintain, and\r\nI therefore, without inquiry, accepted the challenge which you offered\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the good-humoured little doctor advancing with\r\nextended hand, \xe2\x80\x98I honour your gallantry. Permit me to say, Sir, that I\r\nhighly admire your conduct, and extremely regret having caused you the\r\ninconvenience of this meeting, to no purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg you won\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall feel proud of your acquaintance, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nWinkle. Thereupon the doctor and Mr. Winkle shook hands, and then Mr.\r\nWinkle and Lieutenant Tappleton (the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s second), and then Mr.\r\nWinkle and the man with the camp-stool, and, finally, Mr. Winkle and Mr.\r\nSnodgrass--the last-named gentleman in an excess of admiration at the\r\nnoble conduct of his heroic friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think we may adjourn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lieutenant Tappleton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 added the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unless,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the man with the camp-stool, \xe2\x80\x98unless Mr. Winkle\r\nfeels himself aggrieved by the challenge; in which case, I submit, he\r\nhas a right to satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, with great self-denial, expressed himself quite satisfied\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or possibly,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the camp-stool, \xe2\x80\x98the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s second\r\nmay feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at\r\nan early period of this meeting; if so, I shall be happy to give him\r\nsatisfaction immediately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the\r\nhandsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last, which he was only\r\ninduced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings.\r\nThe two seconds adjusted the cases, and the whole party left the ground\r\nin a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remain long here?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Doctor Slammer of Mr. Winkle, as\r\nthey walked on most amicably together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think we shall leave here the day after to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I trust I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my\r\nrooms, and of spending a pleasant evening with you, after this awkward\r\nmistake,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little doctor; \xe2\x80\x98are you disengaged this evening?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have some friends here,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98and I should not like\r\nto leave them to-night. Perhaps you and your friend will join us at the\r\nBull.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little doctor; \xe2\x80\x98will ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock be too\r\nlate to look in for half an hour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98I shall be most happy to introduce you\r\nto my friends, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will give me great pleasure, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Doctor Slammer,\r\nlittle suspecting who Mr. Tupman was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will be sure to come?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the road. Cordial farewells were\r\nexchanged, and the party separated. Doctor Slammer and his friends\r\nrepaired to the barracks, and Mr. Winkle, accompanied by Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nreturned to their inn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. A NEW ACQUAINTANCE--THE STROLLER\xe2\x80\x99S TALE--A DISAGREEABLE\r\nINTERRUPTION, AND AN UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTER\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had felt some apprehensions in consequence of the unusual\r\nabsence of his two friends, which their mysterious behaviour during the\r\nwhole morning had by no means tended to diminish. It was, therefore,\r\nwith more than ordinary pleasure that he rose to greet them when they\r\nagain entered; and with more than ordinary interest that he inquired\r\nwhat had occurred to detain them from his society. In reply to his\r\nquestions on this point, Mr. Snodgrass was about to offer an historical\r\naccount of the circumstances just now detailed, when he was suddenly\r\nchecked by observing that there were present, not only Mr. Tupman and\r\ntheir stage-coach companion of the preceding day, but another stranger\r\nof equally singular appearance. It was a careworn-looking man, whose\r\nsallow face, and deeply-sunken eyes, were rendered still more striking\r\nthan Nature had made them, by the straight black hair which hung in\r\nmatted disorder half-way down his face. His eyes were almost unnaturally\r\nbright and piercing; his cheek-bones were high and prominent; and his\r\njaws were so long and lank, that an observer would have supposed that he\r\nwas drawing the flesh of his face in, for a moment, by some contraction\r\nof the muscles, if his half-opened mouth and immovable expression had\r\nnot announced that it was his ordinary appearance. Round his neck he\r\nwore a green shawl, with the large ends straggling over his chest, and\r\nmaking their appearance occasionally beneath the worn button-holes of\r\nhis old waistcoat. His upper garment was a long black surtout; and below\r\nit he wore wide drab trousers, and large boots, running rapidly to seed.\r\n\r\nIt was on this uncouth-looking person that Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s eye rested, and\r\nit was towards him that Mr. Pickwick extended his hand when he said, \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nfriend of our friend\xe2\x80\x99s here. We discovered this morning that our friend\r\nwas connected with the theatre in this place, though he is not desirous\r\nto have it generally known, and this gentleman is a member of the same\r\nprofession. He was about to favour us with a little anecdote connected\r\nwith it, when you entered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lots of anecdote,\xe2\x80\x99 said the green-coated stranger of the day before,\r\nadvancing to Mr. Winkle and speaking in a low and confidential tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rum fellow--does the heavy business--no actor--strange man--all sorts\r\nof miseries--Dismal Jemmy, we call him on the circuit.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Winkle and\r\nMr. Snodgrass politely welcomed the gentleman, elegantly designated as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dismal Jemmy\xe2\x80\x99; and calling for brandy-and-water, in imitation of the\r\nremainder of the company, seated themselves at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98will you oblige us by proceeding with\r\nwhat you were going to relate?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dismal individual took a dirty roll of paper from his pocket, and\r\nturning to Mr. Snodgrass, who had just taken out his note-book, said in\r\na hollow voice, perfectly in keeping with his outward man--\xe2\x80\x98Are you the\r\npoet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I do a little in that way,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass, rather taken\r\naback by the abruptness of the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! poetry makes life what light and music do the stage--strip the one\r\nof the false embellishments, and the other of its illusions, and what is\r\nthere real in either to live or care for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very true, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be before the footlights,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the dismal man, \xe2\x80\x98is like\r\nsitting at a grand court show, and admiring the silken dresses of the\r\ngaudy throng; to be behind them is to be the people who make that\r\nfinery, uncared for and unknown, and left to sink or swim, to starve or\r\nlive, as fortune wills it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass: for the sunken eye of the dismal man\r\nrested on him, and he felt it necessary to say something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Spanish traveller, \xe2\x80\x98like black-eyed Susan--all\r\nin the Downs--no croaking--speak out--look lively.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you make another glass before you begin, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nThe dismal man took the hint, and having mixed a glass of brandy-and-\r\nwater, and slowly swallowed half of it, opened the roll of paper and\r\nproceeded, partly to read, and partly to relate, the following incident,\r\nwhich we find recorded on the Transactions of the Club as \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nStroller\xe2\x80\x99s Tale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STROLLER\xe2\x80\x99S TALE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is nothing of the marvellous in what I am going to relate,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe dismal man; \xe2\x80\x98there is nothing even uncommon in it. Want and sickness\r\nare too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is\r\nusually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature. I\r\nhave thrown these few notes together, because the subject of them was\r\nwell known to me for many years. I traced his progress downwards, step\r\nby step, until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which\r\nhe never rose again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man of whom I speak was a low pantomime actor; and, like many\r\npeople of his class, an habitual drunkard. In his better days, before he\r\nhad become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease, he had\r\nbeen in the receipt of a good salary, which, if he had been careful and\r\nprudent, he might have continued to receive for some years--not many;\r\nbecause these men either die early, or by unnaturally taxing their\r\nbodily energies, lose, prematurely, those physical powers on which alone\r\nthey can depend for subsistence. His besetting sin gained so fast upon\r\nhim, however, that it was found impossible to employ him in the\r\nsituations in which he really was useful to the theatre. The public-\r\nhouse had a fascination for him which he could not resist. Neglected\r\ndisease and hopeless poverty were as certain to be his portion as death\r\nitself, if he persevered in the same course; yet he did persevere, and\r\nthe result may be guessed. He could obtain no engagement, and he wanted\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a\r\nhost of shabby, poverty-stricken men hang about the stage of a large\r\nestablishment--not regularly engaged actors, but ballet people,\r\nprocession men, tumblers, and so forth, who are taken on during the run\r\nof a pantomime, or an Easter piece, and are then discharged, until the\r\nproduction of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their\r\nservices. To this mode of life the man was compelled to resort; and\r\ntaking the chair every night, at some low theatrical house, at once put\r\nhim in possession of a few more shillings weekly, and enabled him to\r\ngratify his old propensity. Even this resource shortly failed him; his\r\nirregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched\r\npittance he might thus have procured, and he was actually reduced to a\r\nstate bordering on starvation, only procuring a trifle occasionally by\r\nborrowing it of some old companion, or by obtaining an appearance at one\r\nor other of the commonest of the minor theatres; and when he did earn\r\nanything it was spent in the old way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About this time, and when he had been existing for upwards of a year no\r\none knew how, I had a short engagement at one of the theatres on the\r\nSurrey side of the water, and here I saw this man, whom I had lost sight\r\nof for some time; for I had been travelling in the provinces, and he had\r\nbeen skulking in the lanes and alleys of London. I was dressed to leave\r\nthe house, and was crossing the stage on my way out, when he tapped me\r\non the shoulder. Never shall I forget the repulsive sight that met my\r\neye when I turned round. He was dressed for the pantomimes in all the\r\nabsurdity of a clown\xe2\x80\x99s costume. The spectral figures in the Dance of\r\nDeath, the most frightful shapes that the ablest painter ever portrayed\r\non canvas, never presented an appearance half so ghastly. His bloated\r\nbody and shrunken legs--their deformity enhanced a hundredfold by the\r\nfantastic dress--the glassy eyes, contrasting fearfully with the thick\r\nwhite paint with which the face was besmeared; the grotesquely-\r\nornamented head, trembling with paralysis, and the long skinny hands,\r\nrubbed with white chalk--all gave him a hideous and unnatural\r\nappearance, of which no description could convey an adequate idea, and\r\nwhich, to this day, I shudder to think of. His voice was hollow and\r\ntremulous as he took me aside, and in broken words recounted a long\r\ncatalogue of sickness and privations, terminating as usual with an\r\nurgent request for the loan of a trifling sum of money. I put a few\r\nshillings in his hand, and as I turned away I heard the roar of laughter\r\nwhich followed his first tumble on the stage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A few nights afterwards, a boy put a dirty scrap of paper in my hand,\r\non which were scrawled a few words in pencil, intimating that the man\r\nwas dangerously ill, and begging me, after the performance, to see him\r\nat his lodgings in some street--I forget the name of it now--at no great\r\ndistance from the theatre. I promised to comply, as soon as I could get\r\naway; and after the curtain fell, sallied forth on my melancholy errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was late, for I had been playing in the last piece; and, as it was a\r\nbenefit night, the performances had been protracted to an unusual\r\nlength. It was a dark, cold night, with a chill, damp wind, which blew\r\nthe rain heavily against the windows and house-fronts. Pools of water\r\nhad collected in the narrow and little-frequented streets, and as many\r\nof the thinly-scattered oil-lamps had been blown out by the violence of\r\nthe wind, the walk was not only a comfortless, but most uncertain one. I\r\nhad fortunately taken the right course, however, and succeeded, after a\r\nlittle difficulty, in finding the house to which I had been directed--a\r\ncoal-shed, with one storey above it, in the back room of which lay the\r\nobject of my search.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A wretched-looking woman, the man\xe2\x80\x99s wife, met me on the stairs, and,\r\ntelling me that he had just fallen into a kind of doze, led me softly\r\nin, and placed a chair for me at the bedside. The sick man was lying\r\nwith his face turned towards the wall; and as he took no heed of my\r\npresence, I had leisure to observe the place in which I found myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was lying on an old bedstead, which turned up during the day. The\r\ntattered remains of a checked curtain were drawn round the bed\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nto exclude the wind, which, however, made its way into the comfortless\r\nroom through the numerous chinks in the door, and blew it to and fro\r\nevery instant. There was a low cinder fire in a rusty, unfixed grate;\r\nand an old three-cornered stained table, with some medicine bottles, a\r\nbroken glass, and a few other domestic articles, was drawn out before\r\nit. A little child was sleeping on a temporary bed which had been made\r\nfor it on the floor, and the woman sat on a chair by its side. There\r\nwere a couple of shelves, with a few plates and cups and saucers; and a\r\npair of stage shoes and a couple of foils hung beneath them. With the\r\nexception of little heaps of rags and bundles which had been carelessly\r\nthrown into the corners of the room, these were the only things in the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had had time to note these little particulars, and to mark the heavy\r\nbreathing and feverish startings of the sick man, before he was aware of\r\nmy presence. In the restless attempts to procure some easy resting-place\r\nfor his head, he tossed his hand out of the bed, and it fell on mine. He\r\nstarted up, and stared eagerly in my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hutley, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife; \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hutley, that you sent for to-\r\nnight, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid, passing his hand across his forehead; \xe2\x80\x9cHutley--\r\nHutley--let me see.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed endeavouring to collect his thoughts for\r\na few seconds, and then grasping me tightly by the wrist said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nleave me--don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me, old fellow. She\xe2\x80\x99ll murder me; I know she\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHas he been long so?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, addressing his weeping wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSince yesterday night,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn, John, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let her come near me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, with a shudder, as she\r\nstooped over him. \xe2\x80\x9cDrive her away; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear her near me.\xe2\x80\x9d He stared\r\nwildly at her, with a look of deadly apprehension, and then whispered in\r\nmy ear, \xe2\x80\x9cI beat her, Jem; I beat her yesterday, and many times before. I\r\nhave starved her and the boy too; and now I am weak and helpless, Jem,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll murder me for it; I know she will. If you\xe2\x80\x99d seen her cry, as I\r\nhave, you\xe2\x80\x99d know it too. Keep her off.\xe2\x80\x9d He relaxed his grasp, and sank\r\nback exhausted on the pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew but too well what all this meant. If I could have entertained\r\nany doubt of it, for an instant, one glance at the woman\xe2\x80\x99s pale face and\r\nwasted form would have sufficiently explained the real state of the\r\ncase. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better stand aside,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to the poor creature. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan do him no good. Perhaps he will be calmer, if he does not see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She retired out of the man\xe2\x80\x99s sight. He opened his eyes after a few\r\nseconds, and looked anxiously round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIs she gone?\xe2\x80\x9d he eagerly inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes--yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cshe shall not hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Jem,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cshe does hurt\r\nme. There\xe2\x80\x99s something in her eyes wakes such a dreadful fear in my\r\nheart, that it drives me mad. All last night, her large, staring eyes\r\nand pale face were close to mine; wherever I turned, they turned; and\r\nwhenever I started up from my sleep, she was at the bedside looking at\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew me closer to him, as he said in a deep alarmed whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJem, she must be an evil spirit--a devil! Hush! I know she is. If she\r\nhad been a woman she would have died long ago. No woman could have borne\r\nwhat she has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sickened at the thought of the long course of cruelty and neglect\r\nwhich must have occurred to produce such an impression on such a man. I\r\ncould say nothing in reply; for who could offer hope, or consolation, to\r\nthe abject being before me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sat there for upwards of two hours, during which time he tossed\r\nabout, murmuring exclamations of pain or impatience, restlessly throwing\r\nhis arms here and there, and turning constantly from side to side. At\r\nlength he fell into that state of partial unconsciousness, in which the\r\nmind wanders uneasily from scene to scene, and from place to place,\r\nwithout the control of reason, but still without being able to divest\r\nitself of an indescribable sense of present suffering. Finding from his\r\nincoherent wanderings that this was the case, and knowing that in all\r\nprobability the fever would not grow immediately worse, I left him,\r\npromising his miserable wife that I would repeat my visit next evening,\r\nand, if necessary, sit up with the patient during the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I kept my promise. The last four-and-twenty hours had produced a\r\nfrightful alteration. The eyes, though deeply sunk and heavy, shone with\r\na lustre frightful to behold. The lips were parched, and cracked in many\r\nplaces; the hard, dry skin glowed with a burning heat; and there was an\r\nalmost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man\xe2\x80\x99s face, indicating even\r\nmore strongly the ravages of the disease. The fever was at its height.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I took the seat I had occupied the night before, and there I sat for\r\nhours, listening to sounds which must strike deep to the heart of the\r\nmost callous among human beings--the awful ravings of a dying man. From\r\nwhat I had heard of the medical attendant\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, I knew there was no\r\nhope for him: I was sitting by his death-bed. I saw the wasted limbs--\r\nwhich a few hours before had been distorted for the amusement of a\r\nboisterous gallery, writhing under the tortures of a burning fever--I\r\nheard the clown\xe2\x80\x99s shrill laugh, blending with the low murmurings of the\r\ndying man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a touching thing to hear the mind reverting to the ordinary\r\noccupations and pursuits of health, when the body lies before you weak\r\nand helpless; but when those occupations are of a character the most\r\nstrongly opposed to anything we associate with grave and solemn ideas,\r\nthe impression produced is infinitely more powerful. The theatre and the\r\npublic-house were the chief themes of the wretched man\xe2\x80\x99s wanderings. It\r\nwas evening, he fancied; he had a part to play that night; it was late,\r\nand he must leave home instantly. Why did they hold him, and prevent his\r\ngoing?--he should lose the money--he must go. No! they would not let\r\nhim. He hid his face in his burning hands, and feebly bemoaned his own\r\nweakness, and the cruelty of his persecutors. A short pause, and he\r\nshouted out a few doggerel rhymes--the last he had ever learned. He rose\r\nin bed, drew up his withered limbs, and rolled about in uncouth\r\npositions; he was acting--he was at the theatre. A minute\xe2\x80\x99s silence, and\r\nhe murmured the burden of some roaring song. He had reached the old\r\nhouse at last--how hot the room was. He had been ill, very ill, but he\r\nwas well now, and happy. Fill up his glass. Who was that, that dashed it\r\nfrom his lips? It was the same persecutor that had followed him before.\r\nHe fell back upon his pillow and moaned aloud. A short period of\r\noblivion, and he was wandering through a tedious maze of low-arched\r\nrooms--so low, sometimes, that he must creep upon his hands and knees to\r\nmake his way along; it was close and dark, and every way he turned, some\r\nobstacle impeded his progress. There were insects, too, hideous crawling\r\nthings, with eyes that stared upon him, and filled the very air around,\r\nglistening horribly amidst the thick darkness of the place. The walls\r\nand ceiling were alive with reptiles--the vault expanded to an enormous\r\nsize--frightful figures flitted to and fro--and the faces of men he\r\nknew, rendered hideous by gibing and mouthing, peered out from among\r\nthem; they were searing him with heated irons, and binding his head with\r\ncords till the blood started; and he struggled madly for life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the close of one of these paroxysms, when I had with great\r\ndifficulty held him down in his bed, he sank into what appeared to be a\r\nslumber. Overpowered with watching and exertion, I had closed my eyes\r\nfor a few minutes, when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder. I awoke\r\ninstantly. He had raised himself up, so as to seat himself in bed--a\r\ndreadful change had come over his face, but consciousness had returned,\r\nfor he evidently knew me. The child, who had been long since disturbed\r\nby his ravings, rose from its little bed, and ran towards its father,\r\nscreaming with fright--the mother hastily caught it in her arms, lest he\r\nshould injure it in the violence of his insanity; but, terrified by the\r\nalteration of his features, stood transfixed by the bedside. He grasped\r\nmy shoulder convulsively, and, striking his breast with the other hand,\r\nmade a desperate attempt to articulate. It was unavailing; he extended\r\nhis arm towards them, and made another violent effort. There was a\r\nrattling noise in the throat--a glare of the eye--a short stifled groan-\r\n-and he fell back--dead!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt would afford us the highest gratification to be enabled to record Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of the foregoing anecdote. We have little doubt that\r\nwe should have been enabled to present it to our readers, but for a most\r\nunfortunate occurrence.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had replaced on the table the glass which, during the last\r\nfew sentences of the tale, he had retained in his hand; and had just\r\nmade up his mind to speak--indeed, we have the authority of Mr.\r\nSnodgrass\xe2\x80\x99s note-book for stating, that he had actually opened his\r\nmouth--when the waiter entered the room, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some gentlemen, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured that Mr. Pickwick was on the point of delivering\r\nsome remarks which would have enlightened the world, if not the Thames,\r\nwhen he was thus interrupted; for he gazed sternly on the waiter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance, and then looked round on the company generally, as if\r\nseeking for information relative to the new-comers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, rising, \xe2\x80\x98some friends of mine--show them in. Very\r\npleasant fellows,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Winkle, after the waiter had retired--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98officers of the 97th, whose acquaintance I made rather oddly this\r\nmorning. You will like them very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s equanimity was at once restored. The waiter returned, and\r\nushered three gentlemen into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lieutenant Tappleton,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98Lieutenant Tappleton, Mr.\r\nPickwick--Doctor Payne, Mr. Pickwick--Mr. Snodgrass you have seen\r\nbefore, my friend Mr. Tupman, Doctor Payne--Doctor Slammer, Mr.\r\nPickwick--Mr. Tupman, Doctor Slam--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Winkle suddenly paused; for strong emotion was visible on the\r\ncountenance both of Mr. Tupman and the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have met _this_ gentleman before,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Doctor, with marked\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And--and that person, too, if I am not mistaken,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor,\r\nbestowing a scrutinising glance on the green-coated stranger. \xe2\x80\x98I think I\r\ngave that person a very pressing invitation last night, which he thought\r\nproper to decline.\xe2\x80\x99 Saying which the doctor scowled magnanimously on the\r\nstranger, and whispered his friend Lieutenant Tappleton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman, at the conclusion of the\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Doctor Slammer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are bound to kick him on the spot,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the owner of the camp-\r\nstool, with great importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do be quiet, Payne,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the lieutenant. \xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to\r\nask you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, addressing Mr. Pickwick, who was considerably\r\nmystified by this very unpolite by-play--\xe2\x80\x98will you allow me to ask you,\r\nSir, whether that person belongs to your party?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98he is a guest of ours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a member of your club, or I am mistaken?\xe2\x80\x99 said the lieutenant\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And never wears your club-button?\xe2\x80\x99 said the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--never!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the astonished Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Tappleton turned round to his friend Doctor Slammer, with a\r\nscarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder, as if implying some doubt of\r\nthe accuracy of his recollection. The little doctor looked wrathful, but\r\nconfounded; and Mr. Payne gazed with a ferocious aspect on the beaming\r\ncountenance of the unconscious Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, suddenly addressing Mr. Tupman, in a tone which\r\nmade that gentleman start as perceptibly as if a pin had been cunningly\r\ninserted in the calf of his leg, \xe2\x80\x98you were at the ball here last night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman gasped a faint affirmative, looking very hard at Mr. Pickwick\r\nall the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That person was your companion,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, pointing to the still\r\nunmoved stranger.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman admitted the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor to the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98I ask you once again, in\r\nthe presence of these gentlemen, whether you choose to give me your\r\ncard, and to receive the treatment of a gentleman; or whether you impose\r\nupon me the necessity of personally chastising you on the spot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I really cannot allow this matter to go\r\nany further without some explanation. Tupman, recount the\r\ncircumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman, thus solemnly adjured, stated the case in a few words;\r\ntouched slightly on the borrowing of the coat; expatiated largely on its\r\nhaving been done \xe2\x80\x98after dinner\xe2\x80\x99; wound up with a little penitence on his\r\nown account; and left the stranger to clear himself as best he could.\r\n\r\nHe was apparently about to proceed to do so, when Lieutenant Tappleton,\r\nwho had been eyeing him with great curiosity, said with considerable\r\nscorn, \xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen you at the theatre, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the unabashed stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a strolling actor!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lieutenant contemptuously, turning\r\nto Doctor Slammer.--\xe2\x80\x98He acts in the piece that the officers of the 52nd\r\nget up at the Rochester Theatre to-morrow night. You cannot proceed in\r\nthis affair, Slammer--impossible!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite!\xe2\x80\x99 said the dignified Payne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorry to have placed you in this disagreeable situation,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLieutenant Tappleton, addressing Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98allow me to suggest,\r\nthat the best way of avoiding a recurrence of such scenes in future will\r\nbe to be more select in the choice of your companions. Good-evening,\r\nSir!\xe2\x80\x99 and the lieutenant bounced out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And allow me to say, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the irascible Doctor Payne, \xe2\x80\x98that if I\r\nhad been Tappleton, or if I had been Slammer, I would have pulled your\r\nnose, Sir, and the nose of every man in this company. I would, sir--\r\nevery man. Payne is my name, sir--Doctor Payne of the 43rd. Good-\r\nevening, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Having concluded this speech, and uttered the last three\r\nwords in a loud key, he stalked majestically after his friend, closely\r\nfollowed by Doctor Slammer, who said nothing, but contented himself by\r\nwithering the company with a look.\r\n\r\nRising rage and extreme bewilderment had swelled the noble breast of Mr.\r\nPickwick, almost to the bursting of his waistcoat, during the delivery\r\nof the above defiance. He stood transfixed to the spot, gazing on\r\nvacancy. The closing of the door recalled him to himself. He rushed\r\nforward with fury in his looks, and fire in his eye. His hand was upon\r\nthe lock of the door; in another instant it would have been on the\r\nthroat of Doctor Payne of the 43rd, had not Mr. Snodgrass seized his\r\nrevered leader by the coat tail, and dragged him backwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Restrain him,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Snodgrass; \xe2\x80\x98Winkle, Tupman--he must not peril\r\nhis distinguished life in such a cause as this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold him tight,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Snodgrass; and by the united efforts of\r\nthe whole company, Mr. Pickwick was forced into an arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave him alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said the green-coated stranger; \xe2\x80\x98brandy-and-water--\r\njolly old gentleman--lots of pluck--swallow this--ah!--capital stuff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHaving previously tested the virtues of a bumper, which had been mixed\r\nby the dismal man, the stranger applied the glass to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth; and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared.\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause; the brandy-and-water had done its work; the\r\namiable countenance of Mr. Pickwick was fast recovering its customary\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are not worth your notice,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dismal man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are right, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98they are not. I am ashamed\r\nto have been betrayed into this warmth of feeling. Draw your chair up to\r\nthe table, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dismal man readily complied; a circle was again formed round the\r\ntable, and harmony once more prevailed. Some lingering irritability\r\nappeared to find a resting-place in Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, occasioned\r\npossibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat--though it is scarcely\r\nreasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have excited\r\neven a passing feeling of anger in a Pickwickian\xe2\x80\x99s breast. With this\r\nexception, their good-humour was completely restored; and the evening\r\nconcluded with the conviviality with which it had begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. A FIELD DAY AND BIVOUAC--MORE NEW FRIENDS--AN INVITATION TO\r\nTHE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nMany authors entertain, not only a foolish, but a really dishonest\r\nobjection to acknowledge the sources whence they derive much valuable\r\ninformation. We have no such feeling. We are merely endeavouring to\r\ndischarge, in an upright manner, the responsible duties of our editorial\r\nfunctions; and whatever ambition we might have felt under other\r\ncircumstances to lay claim to the authorship of these adventures, a\r\nregard for truth forbids us to do more than claim the merit of their\r\njudicious arrangement and impartial narration. The Pickwick papers are\r\nour New River Head; and we may be compared to the New River Company. The\r\nlabours of others have raised for us an immense reservoir of important\r\nfacts. We merely lay them on, and communicate them, in a clear and\r\ngentle stream, through the medium of these pages, to a world thirsting\r\nfor Pickwickian knowledge.\r\n\r\nActing in this spirit, and resolutely proceeding on our determination to\r\navow our obligations to the authorities we have consulted, we frankly\r\nsay, that to the note-book of Mr. Snodgrass are we indebted for the\r\nparticulars recorded in this and the succeeding chapter--particulars\r\nwhich, now that we have disburdened our consciences, we shall proceed to\r\ndetail without further comment.\r\n\r\nThe whole population of Rochester and the adjoining towns rose from\r\ntheir beds at an early hour of the following morning, in a state of the\r\nutmost bustle and excitement. A grand review was to take place upon the\r\nlines. The manoeuvres of half a dozen regiments were to be inspected by\r\nthe eagle eye of the commander-in-chief; temporary fortifications had\r\nbeen erected, the citadel was to be attacked and taken, and a mine was\r\nto be sprung.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was, as our readers may have gathered from the slight\r\nextract we gave from his description of Chatham, an enthusiastic admirer\r\nof the army. Nothing could have been more delightful to him--nothing\r\ncould have harmonised so well with the peculiar feeling of each of his\r\ncompanions--as this sight. Accordingly they were soon afoot, and walking\r\nin the direction of the scene of action, towards which crowds of people\r\nwere already pouring from a variety of quarters.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching\r\nceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance. There were\r\nsentries posted to keep the ground for the troops, and servants on the\r\nbatteries keeping places for the ladies, and sergeants running to and\r\nfro, with vellum-covered books under their arms, and Colonel Bulder, in\r\nfull military uniform, on horseback, galloping first to one place and\r\nthen to another, and backing his horse among the people, and prancing,\r\nand curvetting, and shouting in a most alarming manner, and making\r\nhimself very hoarse in the voice, and very red in the face, without any\r\nassignable cause or reason whatever. Officers were running backwards and\r\nforwards, first communicating with Colonel Bulder, and then ordering the\r\nsergeants, and then running away altogether; and even the very privates\r\nthemselves looked from behind their glazed stocks with an air of\r\nmysterious solemnity, which sufficiently bespoke the special nature of\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick and his three companions stationed themselves in the front\r\nof the crowd, and patiently awaited the commencement of the proceedings.\r\nThe throng was increasing every moment; and the efforts they were\r\ncompelled to make, to retain the position they had gained, sufficiently\r\noccupied their attention during the two hours that ensued. At one time\r\nthere was a sudden pressure from behind, and then Mr. Pickwick was\r\njerked forward for several yards, with a degree of speed and elasticity\r\nhighly inconsistent with the general gravity of his demeanour; at\r\nanother moment there was a request to \xe2\x80\x98keep back\xe2\x80\x99 from the front, and\r\nthen the butt-end of a musket was either dropped upon Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoe, to remind him of the demand, or thrust into his chest, to insure\r\nits being complied with. Then some facetious gentlemen on the left,\r\nafter pressing sideways in a body, and squeezing Mr. Snodgrass into the\r\nvery last extreme of human torture, would request to know \xe2\x80\x98vere he vos a\r\nshovin\xe2\x80\x99 to\xe2\x80\x99; and when Mr. Winkle had done expressing his excessive\r\nindignation at witnessing this unprovoked assault, some person behind\r\nwould knock his hat over his eyes, and beg the favour of his putting his\r\nhead in his pocket. These, and other practical witticisms, coupled with\r\nthe unaccountable absence of Mr. Tupman (who had suddenly disappeared,\r\nand was nowhere to be found), rendered their situation upon the whole\r\nrather more uncomfortable than pleasing or desirable.\r\n\r\nAt length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which\r\nusually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for.\r\nAll eyes were turned in the direction of the sally-port. A few moments\r\nof eager expectation, and colours were seen fluttering gaily in the air,\r\narms glistened brightly in the sun, column after column poured on to the\r\nplain. The troops halted and formed; the word of command rang through\r\nthe line; there was a general clash of muskets as arms were presented;\r\nand the commander-in-chief, attended by Colonel Bulder and numerous\r\nofficers, cantered to the front. The military bands struck up\r\naltogether; the horses stood upon two legs each, cantered backwards, and\r\nwhisked their tails about in all directions; the dogs barked, the mob\r\nscreamed, the troops recovered, and nothing was to be seen on either\r\nside, as far as the eye could reach, but a long perspective of red coats\r\nand white trousers, fixed and motionless.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about, and\r\ndisentangling himself, miraculously, from between the legs of horses,\r\nthat he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before\r\nhim, until it assumed the appearance we have just described. When he was\r\nat last enabled to stand firmly on his legs, his gratification and\r\ndelight were unbounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can anything be finer or more delightful?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired of Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman, who had had a short man standing on\r\neach of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is indeed a noble and a brilliant sight,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, in\r\nwhose bosom a blaze of poetry was rapidly bursting forth, \xe2\x80\x98to see the\r\ngallant defenders of their country drawn up in brilliant array before\r\nits peaceful citizens; their faces beaming--not with warlike ferocity,\r\nbut with civilised gentleness; their eyes flashing--not with the rude\r\nfire of rapine or revenge, but with the soft light of humanity and\r\nintelligence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick fully entered into the spirit of this eulogium, but he\r\ncould not exactly re-echo its terms; for the soft light of intelligence\r\nburned rather feebly in the eyes of the warriors, inasmuch as the\r\ncommand \xe2\x80\x98eyes front\xe2\x80\x99 had been given, and all the spectator saw before\r\nhim was several thousand pair of optics, staring straight forward,\r\nwholly divested of any expression whatever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are in a capital situation now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking round\r\nhim. The crowd had gradually dispersed in their immediate vicinity, and\r\nthey were nearly alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed both Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are they doing now?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, adjusting his\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I--rather think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, changing colour--\xe2\x80\x98I rather think\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re going to fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I--really think they are,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr. Snodgrass, somewhat alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. He had hardly uttered the word, when\r\nthe whole half-dozen regiments levelled their muskets as if they had but\r\none common object, and that object the Pickwickians, and burst forth\r\nwith the most awful and tremendous discharge that ever shook the earth\r\nto its centres, or an elderly gentleman off his.\r\n\r\nIt was in this trying situation, exposed to a galling fire of blank\r\ncartridges, and harassed by the operations of the military, a fresh body\r\nof whom had begun to fall in on the opposite side, that Mr. Pickwick\r\ndisplayed that perfect coolness and self-possession, which are the\r\nindispensable accompaniments of a great mind. He seized Mr. Winkle by\r\nthe arm, and placing himself between that gentleman and Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nearnestly besought them to remember that beyond the possibility of being\r\nrendered deaf by the noise, there was no immediate danger to be\r\napprehended from the firing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But--but--suppose some of the men should happen to have ball cartridges\r\nby mistake,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Winkle, pallid at the supposition he was\r\nhimself conjuring up. \xe2\x80\x98I heard something whistle through the air now--so\r\nsharp; close to my ear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We had better throw ourselves on our faces, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nSnodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no--it\xe2\x80\x99s over now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. His lip might quiver, and\r\nhis cheek might blanch, but no expression of fear or concern escaped the\r\nlips of that immortal man.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was right--the firing ceased; but he had scarcely time to\r\ncongratulate himself on the accuracy of his opinion, when a quick\r\nmovement was visible in the line; the hoarse shout of the word of\r\ncommand ran along it, and before either of the party could form a guess\r\nat the meaning of this new manoeuvre, the whole of the half-dozen\r\nregiments, with fixed bayonets, charged at double-quick time down upon\r\nthe very spot on which Mr. Pickwick and his friends were stationed.\r\n\r\nMan is but mortal; and there is a point beyond which human courage\r\ncannot extend. Mr. Pickwick gazed through his spectacles for an instant\r\non the advancing mass, and then fairly turned his back and--we will not\r\nsay fled; firstly, because it is an ignoble term, and, secondly, because\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s figure was by no means adapted for that mode of retreat--\r\nhe trotted away, at as quick a rate as his legs would convey him; so\r\nquickly, indeed, that he did not perceive the awkwardness of his\r\nsituation, to the full extent, until too late.\r\n\r\nThe opposite troops, whose falling-in had perplexed Mr. Pickwick a few\r\nseconds before, were drawn up to repel the mimic attack of the sham\r\nbesiegers of the citadel; and the consequence was that Mr. Pickwick and\r\nhis two companions found themselves suddenly inclosed between two lines\r\nof great length, the one advancing at a rapid pace, and the other firmly\r\nwaiting the collision in hostile array.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hoi!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the officers of the advancing line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get out of the way!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the officers of the stationary one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are we to go to?\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the agitated Pickwickians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hoi--hoi--hoi!\xe2\x80\x99 was the only reply. There was a moment of intense\r\nbewilderment, a heavy tramp of footsteps, a violent concussion, a\r\nsmothered laugh; the half-dozen regiments were half a thousand yards\r\noff, and the soles of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s boots were elevated in air.\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle had each performed a compulsory somerset\r\nwith remarkable agility, when the first object that met the eyes of the\r\nlatter as he sat on the ground, staunching with a yellow silk\r\nhandkerchief the stream of life which issued from his nose, was his\r\nvenerated leader at some distance off, running after his own hat, which\r\nwas gambolling playfully away in perspective.\r\n\r\nThere are very few moments in a man\xe2\x80\x99s existence when he experiences so\r\nmuch ludicrous distress, or meets with so little charitable\r\ncommiseration, as when he is in pursuit of his own hat. A vast deal of\r\ncoolness, and a peculiar degree of judgment, are requisite in catching a\r\nhat. A man must not be precipitate, or he runs over it; he must not rush\r\ninto the opposite extreme, or he loses it altogether. The best way is to\r\nkeep gently up with the object of pursuit, to be wary and cautious, to\r\nwatch your opportunity well, get gradually before it, then make a rapid\r\ndive, seize it by the crown, and stick it firmly on your head; smiling\r\npleasantly all the time, as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThere was a fine gentle wind, and Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hat rolled sportively\r\nbefore it. The wind puffed, and Mr. Pickwick puffed, and the hat rolled\r\nover and over as merrily as a lively porpoise in a strong tide: and on\r\nit might have rolled, far beyond Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s reach, had not its\r\ncourse been providentially stopped, just as that gentleman was on the\r\npoint of resigning it to its fate.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, we say, was completely exhausted, and about to give up the\r\nchase, when the hat was blown with some violence against the wheel of a\r\ncarriage, which was drawn up in a line with half a dozen other vehicles\r\non the spot to which his steps had been directed. Mr. Pickwick,\r\nperceiving his advantage, darted briskly forward, secured his property,\r\nplanted it on his head, and paused to take breath. He had not been\r\nstationary half a minute, when he heard his own name eagerly pronounced\r\nby a voice, which he at once recognised as Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s, and, looking\r\nupwards, he beheld a sight which filled him with surprise and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an open barouche, the horses of which had been taken out, the better\r\nto accommodate it to the crowded place, stood a stout old gentleman, in\r\na blue coat and bright buttons, corduroy breeches and top-boots, two\r\nyoung ladies in scarfs and feathers, a young gentleman apparently\r\nenamoured of one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers, a lady of\r\ndoubtful age, probably the aunt of the aforesaid, and Mr. Tupman, as\r\neasy and unconcerned as if he had belonged to the family from the first\r\nmoments of his infancy. Fastened up behind the barouche was a hamper of\r\nspacious dimensions--one of those hampers which always awakens in a\r\ncontemplative mind associations connected with cold fowls, tongues, and\r\nbottles of wine--and on the box sat a fat and red-faced boy, in a state\r\nof somnolency, whom no speculative observer could have regarded for an\r\ninstant without setting down as the official dispenser of the contents\r\nof the before-mentioned hamper, when the proper time for their\r\nconsumption should arrive.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had bestowed a hasty glance on these interesting objects,\r\nwhen he was again greeted by his faithful disciple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickwick--Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman; \xe2\x80\x98come up here. Make haste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come along, Sir. Pray, come up,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Joe!--damn\r\nthat boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to sleep again.--Joe, let down the steps.\xe2\x80\x99 The fat\r\nboy rolled slowly off the box, let down the steps, and held the carriage\r\ndoor invitingly open. Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle came up at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Room for you all, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout man. \xe2\x80\x98Two inside, and one\r\nout. Joe, make room for one of these gentlemen on the box. Now, Sir,\r\ncome along;\xe2\x80\x99 and the stout gentleman extended his arm, and pulled first\r\nMr. Pickwick, and then Mr. Snodgrass, into the barouche by main force.\r\nMr. Winkle mounted to the box, the fat boy waddled to the same perch,\r\nand fell fast asleep instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout man, \xe2\x80\x98very glad to see you. Know you\r\nvery well, gentlemen, though you mayn\xe2\x80\x99t remember me. I spent some\r\nev\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99s at your club last winter--picked up my friend Mr. Tupman here\r\nthis morning, and very glad I was to see him. Well, Sir, and how are\r\nyou? You do look uncommon well, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment, and cordially shook hands with\r\nthe stout gentleman in the top-boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and how are you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout gentleman, addressing Mr.\r\nSnodgrass with paternal anxiety. \xe2\x80\x98Charming, eh? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s right--\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s right. And how are you, sir (to Mr. Winkle)? Well, I am glad to\r\nhear you say you are well; very glad I am, to be sure. My daughters,\r\ngentlemen--my gals these are; and that\xe2\x80\x99s my sister, Miss Rachael Wardle.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s a Miss, she is; and yet she ain\xe2\x80\x99t a Miss--eh, Sir, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 And the\r\nstout gentleman playfully inserted his elbow between the ribs of Mr.\r\nPickwick, and laughed very heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor, brother!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wardle, with a deprecating smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True, true,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98no one can deny it. Gentlemen,\r\nI beg your pardon; this is my friend Mr. Trundle. And now you all know\r\neach other, let\xe2\x80\x99s be comfortable and happy, and see what\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nforward; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say.\xe2\x80\x99 So the stout gentleman put on his\r\nspectacles, and Mr. Pickwick pulled out his glass, and everybody stood\r\nup in the carriage, and looked over somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder at the\r\nevolutions of the military.\r\n\r\nAstounding evolutions they were, one rank firing over the heads of\r\nanother rank, and then running away; and then the other rank firing over\r\nthe heads of another rank, and running away in their turn; and then\r\nforming squares, with officers in the centre; and then descending the\r\ntrench on one side with scaling-ladders, and ascending it on the other\r\nagain by the same means; and knocking down barricades of baskets, and\r\nbehaving in the most gallant manner possible. Then there was such a\r\nramming down of the contents of enormous guns on the battery, with\r\ninstruments like magnified mops; such a preparation before they were let\r\noff, and such an awful noise when they did go, that the air resounded\r\nwith the screams of ladies. The young Misses Wardle were so frightened,\r\nthat Mr. Trundle was actually obliged to hold one of them up in the\r\ncarriage, while Mr. Snodgrass supported the other; and Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister suffered under such a dreadful state of nervous alarm, that Mr.\r\nTupman found it indispensably necessary to put his arm round her waist,\r\nto keep her up at all. Everybody was excited, except the fat boy, and he\r\nslept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe, Joe!\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout gentleman, when the citadel was taken, and\r\nthe besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner. \xe2\x80\x98Damn that boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone\r\nto sleep again. Be good enough to pinch him, sir--in the leg, if you\r\nplease; nothing else wakes him--thank you. Undo the hamper, Joe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy, who had been effectually roused by the compression of a\r\nportion of his leg between the finger and thumb of Mr. Winkle, rolled\r\noff the box once again, and proceeded to unpack the hamper with more\r\nexpedition than could have been expected from his previous inactivity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now we must sit close,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout gentleman. After a great many\r\njokes about squeezing the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 sleeves, and a vast quantity of\r\nblushing at sundry jocose proposals, that the ladies should sit in the\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s laps, the whole party were stowed down in the barouche; and\r\nthe stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy (who\r\nhad mounted up behind for the purpose) into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Joe, knives and forks.\xe2\x80\x99 The knives and forks were handed in, and\r\nthe ladies and gentlemen inside, and Mr. Winkle on the box, were each\r\nfurnished with those useful instruments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plates, Joe, plates.\xe2\x80\x99 A similar process employed in the distribution of\r\nthe crockery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Joe, the fowls. Damn that boy; he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to sleep again. Joe!\r\nJoe!\xe2\x80\x99 (Sundry taps on the head with a stick, and the fat boy, with some\r\ndifficulty, roused from his lethargy.) \xe2\x80\x98Come, hand in the eatables.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something in the sound of the last word which roused the\r\nunctuous boy. He jumped up, and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind\r\nhis mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it\r\nfrom the basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now make haste,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle; for the fat boy was hanging fondly\r\nover a capon, which he seemed wholly unable to part with. The boy sighed\r\ndeeply, and, bestowing an ardent gaze upon its plumpness, unwillingly\r\nconsigned it to his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right--look sharp. Now the tongue--now the pigeon pie. Take care\r\nof that veal and ham--mind the lobsters--take the salad out of the\r\ncloth--give me the dressing.\xe2\x80\x99 Such were the hurried orders which issued\r\nfrom the lips of Mr. Wardle, as he handed in the different articles\r\ndescribed, and placed dishes in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknees, in endless number.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now ain\xe2\x80\x99t this capital?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired that jolly personage, when the work\r\nof destruction had commenced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, who was carving a fowl on the box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glass of wine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With the greatest pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better have a bottle to yourself up there, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re very good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 (He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asleep this time, having just succeeded in\r\nabstracting a veal patty.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box. Glad to see you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Winkle emptied his glass, and placed the bottle on the\r\ncoach-box, by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you permit me to have the pleasure, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trundle to Mr.\r\nWinkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle to Mr. Trundle, and then the\r\ntwo gentlemen took wine, after which they took a glass of wine round,\r\nladies and all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dear Emily is flirting with the strange gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the\r\nspinster aunt, with true spinster-aunt-like envy, to her brother, Mr.\r\nWardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said the jolly old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98all very natural, I\r\ndare say--nothing unusual. Mr. Pickwick, some wine, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick,\r\nwho had been deeply investigating the interior of the pigeon-pie,\r\nreadily assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Emily, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt, with a patronising air, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk so loud, love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor, aunt!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aunt and the little old gentleman want to have it all to themselves, I\r\nthink,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Miss Isabella Wardle to her sister Emily. The young\r\nladies laughed very heartily, and the old one tried to look amiable, but\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young girls have such spirits,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wardle to Mr. Tupman, with an\r\nair of gentle commiseration, as if animal spirits were contraband, and\r\ntheir possession without a permit a high crime and misdemeanour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, they have,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman, not exactly making the sort of\r\nreply that was expected from him. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s quite delightful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wardle, rather dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you permit me?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, in his blandest manner, touching\r\nthe enchanting Rachael\xe2\x80\x99s wrist with one hand, and gently elevating the\r\nbottle with the other. \xe2\x80\x98Will you permit me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Tupman looked most impressive; and Rachael expressed her\r\nfear that more guns were going off, in which case, of course, she should\r\nhave required support again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think my dear nieces pretty?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered their affectionate aunt\r\nto Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should, if their aunt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the ready Pickwickian,\r\nwith a passionate glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you naughty man--but really, if their complexions were a little\r\nbetter, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they would be nice-looking girls--by\r\ncandlelight?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I think they would,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, with an air of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you quiz--I know what you were going to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman, who had not precisely made up his mind to\r\nsay anything at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were going to say that Isabel stoops--I know you were--you men are\r\nsuch observers. Well, so she does; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be denied; and, certainly,\r\nif there is one thing more than another that makes a girl look ugly it\r\nis stooping. I often tell her that when she gets a little older she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe quite frightful. Well, you are a quiz!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a\r\nrate: so he looked very knowing, and smiled mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a sarcastic smile,\xe2\x80\x99 said the admiring Rachael; \xe2\x80\x98I declare I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite afraid of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Afraid of me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you can\xe2\x80\x99t disguise anything from me--I know what that smile means\r\nvery well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, who had not the slightest notion himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said the amiable aunt, sinking her voice still lower--\xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmean, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t think Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s stooping is as bad as Emily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboldness. Well, she is bold! You cannot think how wretched it makes me\r\nsometimes--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I cry about it for hours together--my dear brother\r\nis _so_ good, and so unsuspicious, that he never sees it; if he did, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite certain it would break his heart. I wish I could think it was only\r\nmanner--I hope it may be--\xe2\x80\x99 (Here the affectionate relative heaved a\r\ndeep sigh, and shook her head despondingly).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure aunt\xe2\x80\x99s talking about us,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Miss Emily Wardle to her\r\nsister--\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m quite certain of it--she looks so malicious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Isabella.--\xe2\x80\x98Hem! aunt, dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear love!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m _so_ afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch cold, aunt--have a silk handkerchief to\r\ntie round your dear old head--you really should take care of yourself--\r\nconsider your age!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been, it was\r\nas vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to. There is no\r\nguessing in what form of reply the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s indignation would have vented\r\nitself, had not Mr. Wardle unconsciously changed the subject, by calling\r\nemphatically for Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn that boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to sleep again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very extraordinary boy, that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98does he always sleep\r\nin this way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sleep!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s always asleep. Goes on errands\r\nfast asleep, and snores as he waits at table.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How very odd!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! odd indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of that boy--\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t part with him on any account--he\xe2\x80\x99s a natural curiosity! Here,\r\nJoe--Joe--take these things away, and open another bottle--d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy rose, opened his eyes, swallowed the huge piece of pie he\r\nhad been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep, and slowly\r\nobeyed his master\xe2\x80\x99s orders--gloating languidly over the remains of the\r\nfeast, as he removed the plates, and deposited them in the hamper. The\r\nfresh bottle was produced, and speedily emptied: the hamper was made\r\nfast in its old place--the fat boy once more mounted the box--the\r\nspectacles and pocket-glass were again adjusted--and the evolutions of\r\nthe military recommenced. There was a great fizzing and banging of guns,\r\nand starting of ladies--and then a mine was sprung, to the gratification\r\nof everybody--and when the mine had gone off, the military and the\r\ncompany followed its example, and went off too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, as he shook hands with Mr. Pickwick\r\nat the conclusion of a conversation which had been carried on at\r\nintervals, during the conclusion of the proceedings, \xe2\x80\x98we shall see you\r\nall to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have got the address?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Manor Farm, Dingley Dell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, consulting his pocket-\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t let you off, mind, under a\r\nweek; and undertake that you shall see everything worth seeing. If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve come down for a country life, come to me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you\r\nplenty of it. Joe--damn that boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to sleep again--Joe, help\r\nTom put in the horses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe horses were put in--the driver mounted--the fat boy clambered up by\r\nhis side--farewells were exchanged--and the carriage rattled off. As the\r\nPickwickians turned round to take a last glimpse of it, the setting sun\r\ncast a rich glow on the faces of their entertainers, and fell upon the\r\nform of the fat boy. His head was sunk upon his bosom; and he slumbered\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. A SHORT ONE--SHOWING, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, HOW Mr. PICKWICK\r\nUNDERTOOK TO DRIVE, AND MR. WINKLE TO RIDE, AND HOW THEY BOTH DID IT\r\n\r\nBright and pleasant was the sky, balmy the air, and beautiful the\r\nappearance of every object around, as Mr. Pickwick leaned over the\r\nbalustrades of Rochester Bridge, contemplating nature, and waiting for\r\nbreakfast. The scene was indeed one which might well have charmed a far\r\nless reflective mind, than that to which it was presented.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the spectator lay the ruined wall, broken in many places,\r\nand in some, overhanging the narrow beach below in rude and heavy\r\nmasses. Huge knots of seaweed hung upon the jagged and pointed stones,\r\ntrembling in every breath of wind; and the green ivy clung mournfully\r\nround the dark and ruined battlements. Behind it rose the ancient\r\ncastle, its towers roofless, and its massive walls crumbling away, but\r\ntelling us proudly of its old might and strength, as when, seven hundred\r\nyears ago, it rang with the clash of arms, or resounded with the noise\r\nof feasting and revelry. On either side, the banks of the Medway,\r\ncovered with cornfields and pastures, with here and there a windmill, or\r\na distant church, stretched away as far as the eye could see, presenting\r\na rich and varied landscape, rendered more beautiful by the changing\r\nshadows which passed swiftly across it as the thin and half-formed\r\nclouds skimmed away in the light of the morning sun. The river,\r\nreflecting the clear blue of the sky, glistened and sparkled as it\r\nflowed noiselessly on; and the oars of the fishermen dipped into the\r\nwater with a clear and liquid sound, as their heavy but picturesque\r\nboats glided slowly down the stream.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was roused from the agreeable reverie into which he had\r\nbeen led by the objects before him, by a deep sigh, and a touch on his\r\nshoulder. He turned round: and the dismal man was at his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Contemplating the scene?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the dismal man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And congratulating yourself on being up so soon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! people need to rise early, to see the sun in all his splendour, for\r\nhis brightness seldom lasts the day through. The morning of day and the\r\nmorning of life are but too much alike.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You speak truly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How common the saying,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the dismal man, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe morning\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nfine to last.\xe2\x80\x9d How well might it be applied to our everyday existence.\r\nGod! what would I forfeit to have the days of my childhood restored, or\r\nto be able to forget them for ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen much trouble, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick compassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dismal man hurriedly; \xe2\x80\x98I have. More than those who\r\nsee me now would believe possible.\xe2\x80\x99 He paused for an instant, and then\r\nsaid abruptly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did it ever strike you, on such a morning as this, that drowning would\r\nbe happiness and peace?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God bless me, no!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, edging a little from the\r\nbalustrade, as the possibility of the dismal man\xe2\x80\x99s tipping him over, by\r\nway of experiment, occurred to him rather forcibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have thought so, often,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dismal man, without noticing the\r\naction. \xe2\x80\x98The calm, cool water seems to me to murmur an invitation to\r\nrepose and rest. A bound, a splash, a brief struggle; there is an eddy\r\nfor an instant, it gradually subsides into a gentle ripple; the waters\r\nhave closed above your head, and the world has closed upon your miseries\r\nand misfortunes for ever.\xe2\x80\x99 The sunken eye of the dismal man flashed\r\nbrightly as he spoke, but the momentary excitement quickly subsided; and\r\nhe turned calmly away, as he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There--enough of that. I wish to see you on another subject. You\r\ninvited me to read that paper, the night before last, and listened\r\nattentively while I did so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98and I certainly thought--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I asked for no opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dismal man, interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\nwant none. You are travelling for amusement and instruction. Suppose I\r\nforward you a curious manuscript--observe, not curious because wild or\r\nimprobable, but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life--would\r\nyou communicate it to the club, of which you have spoken so frequently?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98if you wished it; and it would be\r\nentered on their transactions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall have it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the dismal man. \xe2\x80\x98Your address;\xe2\x80\x99 and, Mr.\r\nPickwick having communicated their probable route, the dismal man\r\ncarefully noted it down in a greasy pocket-book, and, resisting Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s pressing invitation to breakfast, left that gentleman at his\r\ninn, and walked slowly away.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick found that his three companions had risen, and were waiting\r\nhis arrival to commence breakfast, which was ready laid in tempting\r\ndisplay. They sat down to the meal; and broiled ham, eggs, tea, coffee\r\nand sundries, began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore\r\ntestimony to the excellence of the fare, and the appetites of its\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, about Manor Farm,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98How shall we go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We had better consult the waiter, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman; and the\r\nwaiter was summoned accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dingley Dell, gentlemen--fifteen miles, gentlemen--cross road--post-\r\nchaise, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Post-chaise won\xe2\x80\x99t hold more than two,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True, sir--beg your pardon, sir.--Very nice four-wheel chaise, sir--\r\nseat for two behind--one in front for the gentleman that drives--oh! beg\r\nyour pardon, sir--that\xe2\x80\x99ll only hold three.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested the\r\nwaiter, looking towards Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98very good saddle-horses, sir--any\r\nof Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s men coming to Rochester, bring \xe2\x80\x98em back, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The very thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Winkle, will you go on horseback?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest\r\nrecesses of his own heart, relative to his equestrian skill; but, as he\r\nwould not have them even suspected, on any account, he at once replied\r\nwith great hardihood, \xe2\x80\x98Certainly. I should enjoy it of all things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle had rushed upon his fate; there was no resource.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let them be at the door by eleven,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe waiter retired; the breakfast concluded; and the travellers ascended\r\nto their respective bedrooms, to prepare a change of clothing, to take\r\nwith them on their approaching expedition.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements, and was looking over\r\nthe coffee-room blinds at the passengers in the street, when the waiter\r\nentered, and announced that the chaise was ready--an announcement which\r\nthe vehicle itself confirmed, by forthwith appearing before the coffee-\r\nroom blinds aforesaid.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious little green box on four wheels, with a low place like\r\na wine-bin for two behind, and an elevated perch for one in front, drawn\r\nby an immense brown horse, displaying great symmetry of bone. An hostler\r\nstood near, holding by the bridle another immense horse--apparently a\r\nnear relative of the animal in the chaise--ready saddled for Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as they stood upon the pavement\r\nwhile the coats were being put in. \xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul! who\xe2\x80\x99s to drive? I\r\nnever thought of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the slightest fear, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the hostler. \xe2\x80\x98Warrant him\r\nquiet, Sir; a hinfant in arms might drive him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He don\xe2\x80\x99t shy, does he?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shy, sir?-he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shy if he was to meet a vagin-load of monkeys\r\nwith their tails burned off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe last recommendation was indisputable. Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass\r\ngot into the bin; Mr. Pickwick ascended to his perch, and deposited his\r\nfeet on a floor-clothed shelf, erected beneath it for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, shiny Villiam,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hostler to the deputy hostler, \xe2\x80\x98give the\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99lm\xe2\x80\x99n the ribbons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShiny Villiam\xe2\x80\x99--so called, probably, from his sleek hair and oily\r\ncountenance--placed the reins in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s left hand; and the upper\r\nhostler thrust a whip into his right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wo-o!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick, as the tall quadruped evinced a decided\r\ninclination to back into the coffee-room window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wo-o!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass, from the bin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only his playfulness, gen\xe2\x80\x99lm\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 said the head hostler encouragingly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98jist kitch hold on him, Villiam.\xe2\x80\x99 The deputy restrained the animal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpetuosity, and the principal ran to assist Mr. Winkle in mounting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99other side, sir, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blowed if the gen\xe2\x80\x99lm\xe2\x80\x99n worn\xe2\x80\x99t a-gettin\xe2\x80\x99 up on the wrong side,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhispered a grinning post-boy to the inexpressibly gratified waiter.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, thus instructed, climbed into his saddle, with about as much\r\ndifficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a\r\nfirst-rate man-of-war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, with an inward presentiment that it\r\nwas all wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let \xe2\x80\x98em go,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the hostler.--\xe2\x80\x98Hold him in, sir;\xe2\x80\x99 and away went the\r\nchaise, and the saddle-horse, with Mr. Pickwick on the box of the one,\r\nand Mr. Winkle on the back of the other, to the delight and\r\ngratification of the whole inn-yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What makes him go sideways?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass in the bin, to Mr.\r\nWinkle in the saddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle. His horse was drifting up the\r\nstreet in the most mysterious manner--side first, with his head towards\r\none side of the way, and his tail towards the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any other\r\nparticular, the whole of his faculties being concentrated in the\r\nmanagement of the animal attached to the chaise, who displayed various\r\npeculiarities, highly interesting to a bystander, but by no means\r\nequally amusing to any one seated behind him. Besides constantly jerking\r\nhis head up, in a very unpleasant and uncomfortable manner, and tugging\r\nat the reins to an extent which rendered it a matter of great difficulty\r\nfor Mr. Pickwick to hold them, he had a singular propensity for darting\r\nsuddenly every now and then to the side of the road, then stopping\r\nshort, and then rushing forward for some minutes, at a speed which it\r\nwas wholly impossible to control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What _can_ he mean by this?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, when the horse had\r\nexecuted this manoeuvre for the twentieth time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman; \xe2\x80\x98it looks very like shying, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Snodgrass was about to reply, when he was interrupted by a\r\nshout from Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Woo!\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98I have dropped my whip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, as the equestrian came trotting up on the\r\ntall horse, with his hat over his ears, and shaking all over, as if he\r\nwould shake to pieces, with the violence of the exercise, \xe2\x80\x98pick up the\r\nwhip, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Winkle pulled at the bridle of the\r\ntall horse till he was black in the face; and having at length succeeded\r\nin stopping him, dismounted, handed the whip to Mr. Pickwick, and\r\ngrasping the reins, prepared to remount.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow whether the tall horse, in the natural playfulness of his\r\ndisposition, was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with\r\nMr. Winkle, or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the\r\njourney as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one, are\r\npoints upon which, of course, we can arrive at no definite and distinct\r\nconclusion. By whatever motives the animal was actuated, certain it is\r\nthat Mr. Winkle had no sooner touched the reins, than he slipped them\r\nover his head, and darted backwards to their full length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle soothingly--\xe2\x80\x98poor fellow--good old\r\nhorse.\xe2\x80\x99 The \xe2\x80\x98poor fellow\xe2\x80\x99 was proof against flattery; the more Mr.\r\nWinkle tried to get nearer him, the more he sidled away; and,\r\nnotwithstanding all kinds of coaxing and wheedling, there were Mr.\r\nWinkle and the horse going round and round each other for ten minutes,\r\nat the end of which time each was at precisely the same distance from\r\nthe other as when they first commenced--an unsatisfactory sort of thing\r\nunder any circumstances, but particularly so in a lonely road, where no\r\nassistance can be procured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What am I to do?\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Winkle, after the dodging had been\r\nprolonged for a considerable time. \xe2\x80\x98What am I to do? I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better lead him till we come to a turnpike,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nPickwick from the chaise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he won\xe2\x80\x99t come!\xe2\x80\x99 roared Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98Do come and hold him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity: he threw\r\nthe reins on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s back, and having descended from his seat,\r\ncarefully drew the chaise into the hedge, lest anything should come\r\nalong the road, and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed\r\ncompanion, leaving Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe horse no sooner beheld Mr. Pickwick advancing towards him with the\r\nchaise whip in his hand, than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he\r\nhad previously indulged, for a retrograde movement of so very determined\r\na character, that it at once drew Mr. Winkle, who was still at the end\r\nof the bridle, at a rather quicker rate than fast walking, in the\r\ndirection from which they had just come. Mr. Pickwick ran to his\r\nassistance, but the faster Mr. Pickwick ran forward, the faster the\r\nhorse ran backward. There was a great scraping of feet, and kicking up\r\nof the dust; and at last Mr. Winkle, his arms being nearly pulled out of\r\ntheir sockets, fairly let go his hold. The horse paused, stared, shook\r\nhis head, turned round, and quietly trotted home to Rochester, leaving\r\nMr. Winkle and Mr. Pickwick gazing on each other with countenances of\r\nblank dismay. A rattling noise at a little distance attracted their\r\nattention. They looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the agonised Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s the other\r\nhorse running away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was but too true. The animal was startled by the noise, and the reins\r\nwere on his back. The results may be guessed. He tore off with the four-\r\nwheeled chaise behind him, and Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the four-\r\nwheeled chaise. The heat was a short one. Mr. Tupman threw himself into\r\nthe hedge, Mr. Snodgrass followed his example, the horse dashed the\r\nfour--wheeled chaise against a wooden bridge, separated the wheels from\r\nthe body, and the bin from the perch; and finally stood stock still to\r\ngaze upon the ruin he had made.\r\n\r\nThe first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their\r\nunfortunate companions from their bed of quickset--a process which gave\r\nthem the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had sustained\r\nno injury, beyond sundry rents in their garments, and various\r\nlacerations from the brambles. The next thing to be done was to\r\nunharness the horse. This complicated process having been effected, the\r\nparty walked slowly forward, leading the horse among them, and\r\nabandoning the chaise to its fate.\r\n\r\nAn hour\xe2\x80\x99s walk brought the travellers to a little road-side public-\r\nhouse, with two elm-trees, a horse trough, and a signpost, in front; one\r\nor two deformed hay-ricks behind, a kitchen garden at the side, and\r\nrotten sheds and mouldering outhouses jumbled in strange confusion all\r\nabout it. A red-headed man was working in the garden; and to him Mr.\r\nPickwick called lustily, \xe2\x80\x98Hollo there!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe red-headed man raised his body, shaded his eyes with his hand, and\r\nstared, long and coolly, at Mr. Pickwick and his companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo there!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 was the red-headed man\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How far is it to Dingley Dell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better er seven mile.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it a good road?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, \xe2\x80\x98tain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99 Having uttered this brief reply, and apparently satisfied\r\nhimself with another scrutiny, the red-headed man resumed his work. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nwant to put this horse up here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I suppose we can,\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWant to put that ere horse up, do ee?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the red-headed man,\r\nleaning on his spade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, who had by this time advanced, horse\r\nin hand, to the garden rails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missus\xe2\x80\x99--roared the man with the red head, emerging from the garden,\r\nand looking very hard at the horse--\xe2\x80\x98missus!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA tall, bony woman--straight all the way down--in a coarse, blue\r\npelisse, with the waist an inch or two below her arm-pits, responded to\r\nthe call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can we put this horse up here, my good woman?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman,\r\nadvancing, and speaking in his most seductive tones. The woman looked\r\nvery hard at the whole party; and the red-headed man whispered something\r\nin her ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the woman, after a little consideration, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeerd on\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Afraid!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the woman afraid of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It got us in trouble last time,\xe2\x80\x99 said the woman, turning into the\r\nhouse; \xe2\x80\x98I woan\xe2\x80\x99t have nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to say to \xe2\x80\x98un.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most extraordinary thing I have ever met with in my life,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nastonished Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I--really believe,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Winkle, as his friends gathered\r\nround him, \xe2\x80\x98that they think we have come by this horse in some dishonest\r\nmanner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in a storm of indignation. Mr. Winkle\r\nmodestly repeated his suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, you fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said the angry Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98do you think we stole\r\nthe horse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure ye did,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the red-headed man, with a grin which\r\nagitated his countenance from one auricular organ to the other. Saying\r\nwhich he turned into the house and banged the door after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s like a dream,\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98a hideous dream. The idea\r\nof a man\xe2\x80\x99s walking about all day with a dreadful horse that he can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nrid of!\xe2\x80\x99 The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away, with the tall\r\nquadruped, for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust,\r\nfollowing slowly at their heels.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their four-footed\r\ncompanion turned into the lane leading to Manor Farm; and even when they\r\nwere so near their place of destination, the pleasure they would\r\notherwise have experienced was materially damped as they reflected on\r\nthe singularity of their appearance, and the absurdity of their\r\nsituation. Torn clothes, lacerated faces, dusty shoes, exhausted looks,\r\nand, above all, the horse. Oh, how Mr. Pickwick cursed that horse: he\r\nhad eyed the noble animal from time to time with looks expressive of\r\nhatred and revenge; more than once he had calculated the probable amount\r\nof the expense he would incur by cutting his throat; and now the\r\ntemptation to destroy him, or to cast him loose upon the world, rushed\r\nupon his mind with tenfold force. He was roused from a meditation on\r\nthese dire imaginings by the sudden appearance of two figures at a turn\r\nof the lane. It was Mr. Wardle, and his faithful attendant, the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, where have you been?\xe2\x80\x99 said the hospitable old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen waiting for you all day. Well, you _do_ look tired. What!\r\nScratches! Not hurt, I hope--eh? Well, I _am_ glad to hear that--very.\r\nSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve been spilt, eh? Never mind. Common accident in these parts.\r\nJoe--he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep again!--Joe, take that horse from the gentlemen, and\r\nlead it into the stable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal; and the old\r\ngentleman, condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s adventures as they thought proper to communicate, led the way to\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll have you put to rights here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98and then\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce you to the people in the parlour. Emma, bring out the\r\ncherry brandy; now, Jane, a needle and thread here; towels and water,\r\nMary. Come, girls, bustle about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThree or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the different\r\narticles in requisition, while a couple of large-headed, circular-\r\nvisaged males rose from their seats in the chimney-corner (for although\r\nit was a May evening their attachment to the wood fire appeared as\r\ncordial as if it were Christmas), and dived into some obscure recesses,\r\nfrom which they speedily produced a bottle of blacking, and some half-\r\ndozen brushes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bustle!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman again, but the admonition was quite\r\nunnecessary, for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy, and\r\nanother brought in the towels, and one of the men suddenly seizing Mr.\r\nPickwick by the leg, at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance,\r\nbrushed away at his boot till his corns were red-hot; while the other\r\nshampooed Mr. Winkle with a heavy clothes-brush, indulging, during the\r\noperation, in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when\r\nengaged in rubbing down a horse.\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass, having concluded his ablutions, took a survey of the\r\nroom, while standing with his back to the fire, sipping his cherry\r\nbrandy with heartfelt satisfaction. He describes it as a large\r\napartment, with a red brick floor and a capacious chimney; the ceiling\r\ngarnished with hams, sides of bacon, and ropes of onions. The walls were\r\ndecorated with several hunting-whips, two or three bridles, a saddle,\r\nand an old rusty blunderbuss, with an inscription below it, intimating\r\nthat it was \xe2\x80\x98Loaded\xe2\x80\x99--as it had been, on the same authority, for half a\r\ncentury at least. An old eight-day clock, of solemn and sedate\r\ndemeanour, ticked gravely in one corner; and a silver watch, of equal\r\nantiquity, dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the\r\ndresser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ready?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman inquiringly, when his guests had been\r\nwashed, mended, brushed, and brandied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come along, then;\xe2\x80\x99 and the party having traversed several dark\r\npassages, and being joined by Mr. Tupman, who had lingered behind to\r\nsnatch a kiss from Emma, for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry\r\npushings and scratchings, arrived at the parlour door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Welcome,\xe2\x80\x99 said their hospitable host, throwing it open and stepping\r\nforward to announce them, \xe2\x80\x98welcome, gentlemen, to Manor Farm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. AN OLD-FASHIONED CARD-PARTY--THE CLERGYMAN\xe2\x80\x99S VERSES--THE\r\nSTORY OF THE CONVICT\xe2\x80\x99S RETURN\r\n\r\nSeveral guests who were assembled in the old parlour rose to greet Mr.\r\nPickwick and his friends upon their entrance; and during the performance\r\nof the ceremony of introduction, with all due formalities, Mr. Pickwick\r\nhad leisure to observe the appearance, and speculate upon the characters\r\nand pursuits, of the persons by whom he was surrounded--a habit in which\r\nhe, in common with many other great men, delighted to indulge.\r\n\r\nA very old lady, in a lofty cap and faded silk gown--no less a personage\r\nthan Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s mother--occupied the post of honour on the right-hand\r\ncorner of the chimney-piece; and various certificates of her having been\r\nbrought up in the way she should go when young, and of her not having\r\ndeparted from it when old, ornamented the walls, in the form of samplers\r\nof ancient date, worsted landscapes of equal antiquity, and crimson silk\r\ntea-kettle holders of a more modern period. The aunt, the two young\r\nladies, and Mr. Wardle, each vying with the other in paying zealous and\r\nunremitting attentions to the old lady, crowded round her easy-chair,\r\none holding her ear-trumpet, another an orange, and a third a smelling-\r\nbottle, while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the\r\npillows which were arranged for her support. On the opposite side sat a\r\nbald-headed old gentleman, with a good-humoured, benevolent face--the\r\nclergyman of Dingley Dell; and next him sat his wife, a stout, blooming\r\nold lady, who looked as if she were well skilled, not only in the art\r\nand mystery of manufacturing home-made cordials greatly to other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction, but of tasting them occasionally very much to her\r\nown. A little hard-headed, Ripstone pippin-faced man, was conversing\r\nwith a fat old gentleman in one corner; and two or three more old\r\ngentlemen, and two or three more old ladies, sat bolt upright and\r\nmotionless on their chairs, staring very hard at Mr. Pickwick and his\r\nfellow-voyagers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle, at the very top of his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, shaking her head; \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, grandma!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed both the young ladies together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old lady. \xe2\x80\x98Well, it don\xe2\x80\x99t much matter. He don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nfor an old \xe2\x80\x98ooman like me, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, grasping the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nand speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his\r\nbenevolent countenance--\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that nothing delights me\r\nmore than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family,\r\nand looking so young and well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, after a short pause: \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine, I\r\ndare say; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grandma\xe2\x80\x99s rather put out now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Isabella Wardle, in a low\r\ntone; \xe2\x80\x98but she\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you presently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age, and\r\nentered into a general conversation with the other members of the\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Delightful situation this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Delightful!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Messrs. Snodgrass, Tupman, and Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I think it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a better spot o\xe2\x80\x99 ground in all Kent, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hard-\r\nheaded man with the pippin--face; \xe2\x80\x98there ain\xe2\x80\x99t indeed, sir--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 The hard-headed man looked triumphantly round, as if\r\nhe had been very much contradicted by somebody, but had got the better\r\nof him at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a better spot o\xe2\x80\x99 ground in all Kent,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hard-headed\r\nman again, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cept Mullins\xe2\x80\x99s Meadows,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the fat man solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mullins\xe2\x80\x99s Meadows!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated the other, with profound contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mullins\xe2\x80\x99s Meadows,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the fat man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Reg\xe2\x80\x99lar good land that,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed another fat man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so it is, sure-ly,\xe2\x80\x99 said a third fat man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody knows that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the corpulent host.\r\n\r\nThe hard-headed man looked dubiously round, but finding himself in a\r\nminority, assumed a compassionate air and said no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are they talking about?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old lady of one of her\r\ngranddaughters, in a very audible voice; for, like many deaf people, she\r\nnever seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing\r\nwhat she said herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About the land, grandma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What about the land?--Nothing the matter, is there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no. Mr. Miller was saying our land was better than Mullins\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMeadows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How should he know anything about it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old lady\r\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x98Miller\xe2\x80\x99s a conceited coxcomb, and you may tell him I said\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x99 Saying which, the old lady, quite unconscious that she had spoken\r\nabove a whisper, drew herself up, and looked carving-knives at the hard-\r\nheaded delinquent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bustling host, with a natural anxiety to change\r\nthe conversation, \xe2\x80\x98what say you to a rubber, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like it of all things,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98but pray\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make up one on my account.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I assure you, mother\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of a rubber,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old lady, who was much less deaf on this subject than on any other,\r\nreplied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe, Joe!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98Joe--damn that--oh, here he is; put out\r\nthe card-tables.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lethargic youth contrived without any additional rousing to set out\r\ntwo card-tables; the one for Pope Joan, and the other for whist. The\r\nwhist-players were Mr. Pickwick and the old lady, Mr. Miller and the fat\r\ngentleman. The round game comprised the rest of the company.\r\n\r\nThe rubber was conducted with all that gravity of deportment and\r\nsedateness of demeanour which befit the pursuit entitled \xe2\x80\x98whist\xe2\x80\x99--a\r\nsolemn observance, to which, as it appears to us, the title of \xe2\x80\x98game\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhas been very irreverently and ignominiously applied. The round-game\r\ntable, on the other hand, was so boisterously merry as materially to\r\ninterrupt the contemplations of Mr. Miller, who, not being quite so much\r\nabsorbed as he ought to have been, contrived to commit various high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanours, which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman\r\nto a very great extent, and called forth the good-humour of the old lady\r\nin a proportionate degree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said the criminal Miller triumphantly, as he took up the odd\r\ntrick at the conclusion of a hand; \xe2\x80\x98that could not have been played\r\nbetter, I flatter myself; impossible to have made another trick!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miller ought to have trumped the diamond, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nold lady.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ought I, though?\xe2\x80\x99 said the unfortunate, with a doubtful appeal to his\r\npartner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat gentleman, in an awful voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 said the crestfallen Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much use that,\xe2\x80\x99 growled the fat gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two by honours--makes us eight,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another hand. \xe2\x80\x98Can you one?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Double, single, and the rub.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was such luck,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was such cards,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat gentleman.\r\n\r\nA solemn silence; Mr. Pickwick humorous, the old lady serious, the fat\r\ngentleman captious, and Mr. Miller timorous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another double,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, triumphantly making a memorandum of\r\nthe circumstance, by placing one sixpence and a battered halfpenny under\r\nthe candlestick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A double, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite aware of the fact, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat gentleman sharply.\r\n\r\nAnother game, with a similar result, was followed by a revoke from the\r\nunlucky Miller; on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high\r\npersonal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game, when\r\nhe retired into a corner, and remained perfectly mute for one hour and\r\ntwenty-seven minutes; at the end of which time he emerged from his\r\nretirement, and offered Mr. Pickwick a pinch of snuff with the air of a\r\nman who had made up his mind to a Christian forgiveness of injuries\r\nsustained. The old lady\xe2\x80\x99s hearing decidedly improved and the unlucky\r\nMiller felt as much out of his element as a dolphin in a sentry-box.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily. Isabella Wardle and\r\nMr. Trundle \xe2\x80\x98went partners,\xe2\x80\x99 and Emily Wardle and Mr. Snodgrass did the\r\nsame; and even Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint-\r\nstock company of fish and flattery. Old Mr. Wardle was in the very\r\nheight of his jollity; and he was so funny in his management of the\r\nboard, and the old ladies were so sharp after their winnings, that the\r\nwhole table was in a perpetual roar of merriment and laughter. There was\r\none old lady who always had about half a dozen cards to pay for, at\r\nwhich everybody laughed, regularly every round; and when the old lady\r\nlooked cross at having to pay, they laughed louder than ever; on which\r\nthe old lady\xe2\x80\x99s face gradually brightened up, till at last she laughed\r\nlouder than any of them, Then, when the spinster aunt got \xe2\x80\x98matrimony,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe young ladies laughed afresh, and the Spinster aunt seemed disposed\r\nto be pettish; till, feeling Mr. Tupman squeezing her hand under the\r\ntable, she brightened up too, and looked rather knowing, as if matrimony\r\nin reality were not quite so far off as some people thought for;\r\nwhereupon everybody laughed again, and especially old Mr. Wardle, who\r\nenjoyed a joke as much as the youngest. As to Mr. Snodgrass, he did\r\nnothing but whisper poetical sentiments into his partner\xe2\x80\x99s ear, which\r\nmade one old gentleman facetiously sly, about partnerships at cards and\r\npartnerships for life, and caused the aforesaid old gentleman to make\r\nsome remarks thereupon, accompanied with divers winks and chuckles,\r\nwhich made the company very merry and the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nespecially so. And Mr. Winkle came out with jokes which are very well\r\nknown in town, but are not all known in the country; and as everybody\r\nlaughed at them very heartily, and said they were very capital, Mr.\r\nWinkle was in a state of great honour and glory. And the benevolent\r\nclergyman looked pleasantly on; for the happy faces which surrounded the\r\ntable made the good old man feel happy too; and though the merriment was\r\nrather boisterous, still it came from the heart and not from the lips;\r\nand this is the right sort of merriment, after all.\r\n\r\nThe evening glided swiftly away, in these cheerful recreations; and when\r\nthe substantial though homely supper had been despatched, and the little\r\nparty formed a social circle round the fire, Mr. Pickwick thought he had\r\nnever felt so happy in his life, and at no time so much disposed to\r\nenjoy, and make the most of, the passing moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now this,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hospitable host, who was sitting in great state\r\nnext the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair, with her hand fast clasped in his--\xe2\x80\x98this\r\nis just what I like--the happiest moments of my life have been passed at\r\nthis old fireside; and I am so attached to it, that I keep up a blazing\r\nfire here every evening, until it actually grows too hot to bear it.\r\nWhy, my poor old mother, here, used to sit before this fireplace upon\r\nthat little stool when she was a girl; didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe tear which starts unbidden to the eye when the recollection of old\r\ntimes and the happiness of many years ago is suddenly recalled, stole\r\ndown the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s face as she shook her head with a melancholy smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must excuse my talking about this old place, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed\r\nthe host, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x98for I love it dearly, and know no other-\r\n-the old houses and fields seem like living friends to me; and so does\r\nour little church with the ivy, about which, by the bye, our excellent\r\nfriend there made a song when he first came amongst us. Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nhave you anything in your glass?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plenty, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman, whose poetic curiosity had\r\nbeen greatly excited by the last observation of his entertainer. \xe2\x80\x98I beg\r\nyour pardon, but you were talking about the song of the Ivy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must ask our friend opposite about that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host knowingly,\r\nindicating the clergyman by a nod of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I say that I should like to hear you repeat it, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nSnodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, really,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the clergyman, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a very slight affair; and\r\nthe only excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is, that I was a\r\nyoung man at the time. Such as it is, however, you shall hear it, if you\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA murmur of curiosity was of course the reply; and the old gentleman\r\nproceeded to recite, with the aid of sundry promptings from his wife,\r\nthe lines in question. \xe2\x80\x98I call them,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IVY GREEN\r\n\r\nOh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green, That creepeth o\xe2\x80\x99er ruins old! Of\r\nright choice food are his meals, I ween, In his cell so lone and cold.\r\nThe wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed, To pleasure his dainty\r\nwhim; And the mouldering dust that years have made, Is a merry meal for\r\nhim. Creeping where no life is seen, A rare old plant is the Ivy green.\r\n\r\nFast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings, And a staunch old heart\r\nhas he. How closely he twineth, how tight he clings To his friend the\r\nhuge Oak Tree! And slily he traileth along the ground, And his leaves he\r\ngently waves, As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of\r\ndead men\xe2\x80\x99s graves. Creeping where grim death has been, A rare old plant\r\nis the Ivy green.\r\n\r\nWhole ages have fled and their works decayed, And nations have scattered\r\nbeen; But the stout old Ivy shall never fade, From its hale and hearty\r\ngreen. The brave old plant in its lonely days, Shall fatten upon the\r\npast; For the stateliest building man can raise, Is the Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s food at\r\nlast. Creeping on where time has been, A rare old plant is the Ivy\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the old gentleman repeated these lines a second time, to enable\r\nMr. Snodgrass to note them down, Mr. Pickwick perused the lineaments of\r\nhis face with an expression of great interest. The old gentleman having\r\nconcluded his dictation, and Mr. Snodgrass having returned his note-book\r\nto his pocket, Mr. Pickwick said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me, sir, for making the remark on so short an acquaintance; but\r\na gentleman like yourself cannot fail, I should think, to have observed\r\nmany scenes and incidents worth recording, in the course of your\r\nexperience as a minister of the Gospel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have witnessed some certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98but the\r\nincidents and characters have been of a homely and ordinary nature, my\r\nsphere of action being so very limited.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did make some notes, I think, about John Edmunds, did you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninquired Mr. Wardle, who appeared very desirous to draw his friend out,\r\nfor the edification of his new visitors.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman slightly nodded his head in token of assent, and was\r\nproceeding to change the subject, when Mr. Pickwick said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir, but pray, if I may venture to inquire, who was\r\nJohn Edmunds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The very thing I was about to ask,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are fairly in for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the jolly host. \xe2\x80\x98You must satisfy the\r\ncuriosity of these gentlemen, sooner or later; so you had better take\r\nadvantage of this favourable opportunity, and do so at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman smiled good-humouredly as he drew his chair forward--\r\nthe remainder of the party drew their chairs closer together, especially\r\nMr. Tupman and the spinster aunt, who were possibly rather hard of\r\nhearing; and the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s ear-trumpet having been duly adjusted, and\r\nMr. Miller (who had fallen asleep during the recital of the verses)\r\nroused from his slumbers by an admonitory pinch, administered beneath\r\nthe table by his ex-partner the solemn fat man, the old gentleman,\r\nwithout further preface, commenced the following tale, to which we have\r\ntaken the liberty of prefixing the title of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONVICT\xe2\x80\x99S RETURN\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I first settled in this village,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98which\r\nis now just five-and-twenty years ago, the most notorious person among\r\nmy parishioners was a man of the name of Edmunds, who leased a small\r\nfarm near this spot. He was a morose, savage-hearted, bad man; idle and\r\ndissolute in his habits; cruel and ferocious in his disposition. Beyond\r\nthe few lazy and reckless vagabonds with whom he sauntered away his time\r\nin the fields, or sotted in the ale-house, he had not a single friend or\r\nacquaintance; no one cared to speak to the man whom many feared, and\r\nevery one detested--and Edmunds was shunned by all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This man had a wife and one son, who, when I first came here, was about\r\ntwelve years old. Of the acuteness of that woman\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings, of the\r\ngentle and enduring manner in which she bore them, of the agony of\r\nsolicitude with which she reared that boy, no one can form an adequate\r\nconception. Heaven forgive me the supposition, if it be an uncharitable\r\none, but I do firmly and in my soul believe, that the man systematically\r\ntried for many years to break her heart; but she bore it all for her\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and, however strange it may seem to many, for his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo; for brute as he was, and cruelly as he had treated her, she had\r\nloved him once; and the recollection of what he had been to her,\r\nawakened feelings of forbearance and meekness under suffering in her\r\nbosom, to which all God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures, but women, are strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They were poor--they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such\r\ncourses; but the woman\xe2\x80\x99s unceasing and unwearied exertions, early and\r\nlate, morning, noon, and night, kept them above actual want. These\r\nexertions were but ill repaid. People who passed the spot in the\r\nevening--sometimes at a late hour of the night--reported that they had\r\nheard the moans and sobs of a woman in distress, and the sound of blows;\r\nand more than once, when it was past midnight, the boy knocked softly at\r\nthe door of a neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s house, whither he had been sent, to escape the\r\ndrunken fury of his unnatural father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98During the whole of this time, and when the poor creature often bore\r\nabout her marks of ill-usage and violence which she could not wholly\r\nconceal, she was a constant attendant at our little church. Regularly\r\nevery Sunday, morning and afternoon, she occupied the same seat with the\r\nboy at her side; and though they were both poorly dressed--much more so\r\nthan many of their neighbours who were in a lower station--they were\r\nalways neat and clean. Every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoor Mrs. Edmunds\xe2\x80\x9d; and sometimes, when she stopped to exchange a few\r\nwords with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little\r\nrow of elm-trees which leads to the church porch, or lingered behind to\r\ngaze with a mother\xe2\x80\x99s pride and fondness upon her healthy boy, as he\r\nsported before her with some little companions, her careworn face would\r\nlighten up with an expression of heartfelt gratitude; and she would\r\nlook, if not cheerful and happy, at least tranquil and contented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Five or six years passed away; the boy had become a robust and well-\r\ngrown youth. The time that had strengthened the child\xe2\x80\x99s slight frame and\r\nknit his weak limbs into the strength of manhood had bowed his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nform, and enfeebled her steps; but the arm that should have supported\r\nher was no longer locked in hers; the face that should have cheered her,\r\nno more looked upon her own. She occupied her old seat, but there was a\r\nvacant one beside her. The Bible was kept as carefully as ever, the\r\nplaces were found and folded down as they used to be: but there was no\r\none to read it with her; and the tears fell thick and fast upon the\r\nbook, and blotted the words from her eyes. Neighbours were as kind as\r\nthey were wont to be of old, but she shunned their greetings with\r\naverted head. There was no lingering among the old elm-trees now--no\r\ncheering anticipations of happiness yet in store. The desolate woman\r\ndrew her bonnet closer over her face, and walked hurriedly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I tell you that the young man, who, looking back to the earliest\r\nof his childhood\xe2\x80\x99s days to which memory and consciousness extended, and\r\ncarrying his recollection down to that moment, could remember nothing\r\nwhich was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary\r\nprivations suffered by his mother for his sake, with ill-usage, and\r\ninsult, and violence, and all endured for him--shall I tell you, that\r\nhe, with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart, and a sullen,\r\nwilful forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him, had linked\r\nhimself with depraved and abandoned men, and was madly pursuing a\r\nheadlong career, which must bring death to him, and shame to her? Alas\r\nfor human nature! You have anticipated it long since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The measure of the unhappy woman\xe2\x80\x99s misery and misfortune was about to\r\nbe completed. Numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood;\r\nthe perpetrators remained undiscovered, and their boldness increased. A\r\nrobbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of\r\npursuit, and a strictness of search, they had not calculated on. Young\r\nEdmunds was suspected, with three companions. He was apprehended--\r\ncommitted--tried--condemned--to die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wild and piercing shriek from a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice, which resounded\r\nthrough the court when the solemn sentence was pronounced, rings in my\r\nears at this moment. That cry struck a terror to the culprit\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nwhich trial, condemnation--the approach of death itself, had failed to\r\nawaken. The lips which had been compressed in dogged sullenness\r\nthroughout, quivered and parted involuntarily; the face turned ashy pale\r\nas the cold perspiration broke forth from every pore; the sturdy limbs\r\nof the felon trembled, and he staggered in the dock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the first transports of her mental anguish, the suffering mother\r\nthrew herself on her knees at my feet, and fervently sought the Almighty\r\nBeing who had hitherto supported her in all her troubles to release her\r\nfrom a world of woe and misery, and to spare the life of her only child.\r\nA burst of grief, and a violent struggle, such as I hope I may never\r\nhave to witness again, succeeded. I knew that her heart was breaking\r\nfrom that hour; but I never once heard complaint or murmur escape her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a piteous spectacle to see that woman in the prison-yard from\r\nday to day, eagerly and fervently attempting, by affection and entreaty,\r\nto soften the hard heart of her obdurate son. It was in vain. He\r\nremained moody, obstinate, and unmoved. Not even the unlooked-for\r\ncommutation of his sentence to transportation for fourteen years,\r\nsoftened for an instant the sullen hardihood of his demeanour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld\r\nher, was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity. She\r\nfell sick. She dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son\r\nonce more, but her strength failed her, and she sank powerless on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now the boasted coldness and indifference of the young man were\r\ntested indeed; and the retribution that fell heavily upon him nearly\r\ndrove him mad. A day passed away and his mother was not there; another\r\nflew by, and she came not near him; a third evening arrived, and yet he\r\nhad not seen her--, and in four-and-twenty hours he was to be separated\r\nfrom her, perhaps for ever. Oh! how the long-forgotten thoughts of\r\nformer days rushed upon his mind, as he almost ran up and down the\r\nnarrow yard--as if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his\r\nhurrying--and how bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation\r\nrushed upon him, when he heard the truth! His mother, the only parent he\r\nhad ever known, lay ill--it might be, dying--within one mile of the\r\nground he stood on; were he free and unfettered, a few minutes would\r\nplace him by her side. He rushed to the gate, and grasping the iron\r\nrails with the energy of desperation, shook it till it rang again, and\r\nthrew himself against the thick wall as if to force a passage through\r\nthe stone; but the strong building mocked his feeble efforts, and he\r\nbeat his hands together and wept like a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I bore the mother\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness and blessing to her son in prison; and\r\nI carried the solemn assurance of repentance, and his fervent\r\nsupplication for pardon, to her sick-bed. I heard, with pity and\r\ncompassion, the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her\r\ncomfort and support when he returned; but I knew that many months before\r\nhe could reach his place of destination, his mother would be no longer\r\nof this world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was removed by night. A few weeks afterwards the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s soul\r\ntook its flight, I confidently hope, and solemnly believe, to a place of\r\neternal happiness and rest. I performed the burial service over her\r\nremains. She lies in our little churchyard. There is no stone at her\r\ngrave\xe2\x80\x99s head. Her sorrows were known to man; her virtues to God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It had been arranged previously to the convict\xe2\x80\x99s departure, that he\r\nshould write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission, and\r\nthat the letter should be addressed to me. The father had positively\r\nrefused to see his son from the moment of his apprehension; and it was a\r\nmatter of indifference to him whether he lived or died. Many years\r\npassed over without any intelligence of him; and when more than half his\r\nterm of transportation had expired, and I had received no letter, I\r\nconcluded him to be dead, as, indeed, I almost hoped he might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edmunds, however, had been sent a considerable distance up the country\r\non his arrival at the settlement; and to this circumstance, perhaps, may\r\nbe attributed the fact, that though several letters were despatched,\r\nnone of them ever reached my hands. He remained in the same place during\r\nthe whole fourteen years. At the expiration of the term, steadily\r\nadhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother, he\r\nmade his way back to England amidst innumerable difficulties, and\r\nreturned, on foot, to his native place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On a fine Sunday evening, in the month of August, John Edmunds set foot\r\nin the village he had left with shame and disgrace seventeen years\r\nbefore. His nearest way lay through the churchyard. The man\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nswelled as he crossed the stile. The tall old elms, through whose\r\nbranches the declining sun cast here and there a rich ray of light upon\r\nthe shady part, awakened the associations of his earliest days. He\r\npictured himself as he was then, clinging to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and\r\nwalking peacefully to church. He remembered how he used to look up into\r\nher pale face; and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she\r\ngazed upon his features--tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she\r\nstooped to kiss him, and made him weep too, although he little knew then\r\nwhat bitter tears hers were. He thought how often he had run merrily\r\ndown that path with some childish playfellow, looking back, ever and\r\nagain, to catch his mother\xe2\x80\x99s smile, or hear her gentle voice; and then a\r\nveil seemed lifted from his memory, and words of kindness unrequited,\r\nand warnings despised, and promises broken, thronged upon his\r\nrecollection till his heart failed him, and he could bear it no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He entered the church. The evening service was concluded and the\r\ncongregation had dispersed, but it was not yet closed. His steps echoed\r\nthrough the low building with a hollow sound, and he almost feared to be\r\nalone, it was so still and quiet. He looked round him. Nothing was\r\nchanged. The place seemed smaller than it used to be; but there were the\r\nold monuments on which he had gazed with childish awe a thousand times;\r\nthe little pulpit with its faded cushion; the Communion table before\r\nwhich he had so often repeated the Commandments he had reverenced as a\r\nchild, and forgotten as a man. He approached the old seat; it looked\r\ncold and desolate. The cushion had been removed, and the Bible was not\r\nthere. Perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat, or possibly she\r\nhad grown infirm and could not reach the church alone. He dared not\r\nthink of what he feared. A cold feeling crept over him, and he trembled\r\nviolently as he turned away. \xe2\x80\x98An old man entered the porch just as he\r\nreached it. Edmunds started back, for he knew him well; many a time he\r\nhad watched him digging graves in the churchyard. What would he say to\r\nthe returned convict?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old man raised his eyes to the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face, bade him \xe2\x80\x9cgood-\r\nevening,\xe2\x80\x9d and walked slowly on. He had forgotten him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He walked down the hill, and through the village. The weather was warm,\r\nand the people were sitting at their doors, or strolling in their little\r\ngardens as he passed, enjoying the serenity of the evening, and their\r\nrest from labour. Many a look was turned towards him, and many a\r\ndoubtful glance he cast on either side to see whether any knew and\r\nshunned him. There were strange faces in almost every house; in some he\r\nrecognised the burly form of some old schoolfellow--a boy when he last\r\nsaw him--surrounded by a troop of merry children; in others he saw,\r\nseated in an easy-chair at a cottage door, a feeble and infirm old man,\r\nwhom he only remembered as a hale and hearty labourer; but they had all\r\nforgotten him, and he passed on unknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth, casting\r\na rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves, and lengthening the shadows of\r\nthe orchard trees, as he stood before the old house--the home of his\r\ninfancy--to which his heart had yearned with an intensity of affection\r\nnot to be described, through long and weary years of captivity and\r\nsorrow. The paling was low, though he well remembered the time that it\r\nhad seemed a high wall to him; and he looked over into the old garden.\r\nThere were more seeds and gayer flowers than there used to be, but there\r\nwere the old trees still--the very tree under which he had lain a\r\nthousand times when tired of playing in the sun, and felt the soft, mild\r\nsleep of happy boyhood steal gently upon him. There were voices within\r\nthe house. He listened, but they fell strangely upon his ear; he knew\r\nthem not. They were merry too; and he well knew that his poor old mother\r\ncould not be cheerful, and he away. The door opened, and a group of\r\nlittle children bounded out, shouting and romping. The father, with a\r\nlittle boy in his arms, appeared at the door, and they crowded round\r\nhim, clapping their tiny hands, and dragging him out, to join their\r\njoyous sports. The convict thought on the many times he had shrunk from\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s sight in that very place. He remembered how often he had\r\nburied his trembling head beneath the bedclothes, and heard the harsh\r\nword, and the hard stripe, and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s wailing; and though the man\r\nsobbed aloud with agony of mind as he left the spot, his fist was\r\nclenched, and his teeth were set, in a fierce and deadly passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And such was the return to which he had looked through the weary\r\nperspective of many years, and for which he had undergone so much\r\nsuffering! No face of welcome, no look of forgiveness, no house to\r\nreceive, no hand to help him--and this too in the old village. What was\r\nhis loneliness in the wild, thick woods, where man was never seen, to\r\nthis!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He felt that in the distant land of his bondage and infamy, he had\r\nthought of his native place as it was when he left it; and not as it\r\nwould be when he returned. The sad reality struck coldly at his heart,\r\nand his spirit sank within him. He had not courage to make inquiries, or\r\nto present himself to the only person who was likely to receive him with\r\nkindness and compassion. He walked slowly on; and shunning the roadside\r\nlike a guilty man, turned into a meadow he well remembered; and covering\r\nhis face with his hands, threw himself upon the grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him; his\r\ngarments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the new-comer;\r\nand Edmunds raised his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man had moved into a sitting posture. His body was much bent, and\r\nhis face was wrinkled and yellow. His dress denoted him an inmate of the\r\nworkhouse: he had the appearance of being very old, but it looked more\r\nthe effect of dissipation or disease, than the length of years. He was\r\nstaring hard at the stranger, and though his eyes were lustreless and\r\nheavy at first, they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed\r\nexpression after they had been fixed upon him for a short time, until\r\nthey seemed to be starting from their sockets. Edmunds gradually raised\r\nhimself to his knees, and looked more and more earnestly on the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s face. They gazed upon each other in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old man was ghastly pale. He shuddered and tottered to his feet.\r\nEdmunds sprang to his. He stepped back a pace or two. Edmunds advanced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hear you speak,\xe2\x80\x9d said the convict, in a thick, broken voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cStand off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, with a dreadful oath. The convict drew\r\ncloser to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cStand off!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the old man. Furious with terror, he raised his\r\nstick, and struck Edmunds a heavy blow across the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFather--devil!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the convict between his set teeth. He rushed\r\nwildly forward, and clenched the old man by the throat--but he was his\r\nfather; and his arm fell powerless by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields\r\nlike the howl of an evil spirit. His face turned black, the gore rushed\r\nfrom his mouth and nose, and dyed the grass a deep, dark red, as he\r\nstaggered and fell. He had ruptured a blood-vessel, and he was a dead\r\nman before his son could raise him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that corner of the churchyard,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, after a\r\nsilence of a few moments, \xe2\x80\x98in that corner of the churchyard of which I\r\nhave before spoken, there lies buried a man who was in my employment for\r\nthree years after this event, and who was truly contrite, penitent, and\r\nhumbled, if ever man was. No one save myself knew in that man\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime\r\nwho he was, or whence he came--it was John Edmunds, the returned\r\nconvict.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. HOW MR. WINKLE, INSTEAD OF SHOOTING AT THE PIGEON AND\r\nKILLING THE CROW, SHOT AT THE CROW AND WOUNDED THE PIGEON; HOW THE\r\nDINGLEY DELL CRICKET CLUB PLAYED ALL-MUGGLETON, AND HOW ALL-MUGGLETON\r\nDINED AT THE DINGLEY DELL EXPENSE; WITH OTHER INTERESTING AND\r\nINSTRUCTIVE MATTERS\r\n\r\nThe fatiguing adventures of the day or the somniferous influence of the\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s tale operated so strongly on the drowsy tendencies of Mr.\r\nPickwick, that in less than five minutes after he had been shown to his\r\ncomfortable bedroom he fell into a sound and dreamless sleep, from which\r\nhe was only awakened by the morning sun darting his bright beams\r\nreproachfully into the apartment. Mr. Pickwick was no sluggard, and he\r\nsprang like an ardent warrior from his tent-bedstead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pleasant, pleasant country,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the enthusiastic gentleman, as he\r\nopened his lattice window. \xe2\x80\x98Who could live to gaze from day to day on\r\nbricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this?\r\nWho could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the\r\nchimney-pots; nothing redolent of Pan but pan-tiles; no crop but stone\r\ncrop? Who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot? Who, I ask,\r\ncould endure it?\xe2\x80\x99 and, having cross-examined solitude after the most\r\napproved precedents, at considerable length, Mr. Pickwick thrust his\r\nhead out of the lattice and looked around him.\r\n\r\nThe rich, sweet smell of the hay-ricks rose to his chamber window; the\r\nhundred perfumes of the little flower-garden beneath scented the air\r\naround; the deep-green meadows shone in the morning dew that glistened\r\non every leaf as it trembled in the gentle air; and the birds sang as if\r\nevery sparkling drop were to them a fountain of inspiration. Mr.\r\nPickwick fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 was the sound that roused him.\r\n\r\nHe looked to the right, but he saw nobody; his eyes wandered to the\r\nleft, and pierced the prospect; he stared into the sky, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwanted there; and then he did what a common mind would have done at\r\nonce--looked into the garden, and there saw Mr. Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the good-humoured individual, out of breath with his\r\nown anticipations of pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99Beautiful morning, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? Glad to see\r\nyou up so early. Make haste down, and come out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for you here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick needed no second invitation. Ten minutes sufficed for the\r\ncompletion of his toilet, and at the expiration of that time he was by\r\nthe old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick in his turn, seeing that his companion was\r\narmed with a gun, and that another lay ready on the grass; \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nforward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, your friend and I,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the host, \xe2\x80\x98are going out rook-shooting\r\nbefore breakfast. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very good shot, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say he\xe2\x80\x99s a capital one,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98but I\r\nnever saw him aim at anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host, \xe2\x80\x98I wish he\xe2\x80\x99d come. Joe--Joe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy, who under the exciting influence of the morning did not\r\nappear to be more than three parts and a fraction asleep, emerged from\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go up, and call the gentleman, and tell him he\xe2\x80\x99ll find me and Mr.\r\nPickwick in the rookery. Show the gentleman the way there; d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy departed to execute his commission; and the host, carrying both\r\nguns like a second Robinson Crusoe, led the way from the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the place,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, pausing after a few minutes\r\nwalking, in an avenue of trees. The information was unnecessary; for the\r\nincessant cawing of the unconscious rooks sufficiently indicated their\r\nwhereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman laid one gun on the ground, and loaded the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here they are,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; and, as he spoke, the forms of Mr.\r\nTupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr. Winkle appeared in the distance. The fat\r\nboy, not being quite certain which gentleman he was directed to call,\r\nhad with peculiar sagacity, and to prevent the possibility of any\r\nmistake, called them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come along,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the old gentleman, addressing Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98a keen\r\nhand like you ought to have been up long ago, even to such poor work as\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle responded with a forced smile, and took up the spare gun with\r\nan expression of countenance which a metaphysical rook, impressed with a\r\nforeboding of his approaching death by violence, may be supposed to\r\nassume. It might have been keenness, but it looked remarkably like\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman nodded; and two ragged boys who had been marshalled to\r\nthe spot under the direction of the infant Lambert, forthwith commenced\r\nclimbing up two of the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are these lads for?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick abruptly. He was rather\r\nalarmed; for he was not quite certain but that the distress of the\r\nagricultural interest, about which he had often heard a great deal,\r\nmight have compelled the small boys attached to the soil to earn a\r\nprecarious and hazardous subsistence by making marks of themselves for\r\ninexperienced sportsmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only to start the game,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Wardle, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To what?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, in plain English, to frighten the rooks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, is that all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are satisfied?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well. Shall I begin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, glad of any respite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stand aside, then. Now for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy shouted, and shook a branch with a nest on it. Half a dozen\r\nyoung rooks in violent conversation, flew out to ask what the matter\r\nwas. The old gentleman fired by way of reply. Down fell one bird, and\r\noff flew the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take him up, Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThere was a smile upon the youth\xe2\x80\x99s face as he advanced. Indistinct\r\nvisions of rook-pie floated through his imagination. He laughed as he\r\nretired with the bird--it was a plump one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host, reloading his own gun. \xe2\x80\x98Fire away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle advanced, and levelled his gun. Mr. Pickwick and his friends\r\ncowered involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of rooks,\r\nwhich they felt quite certain would be occasioned by the devastating\r\nbarrel of their friend. There was a solemn pause--a shout--a flapping of\r\nwings--a faint click.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t it go?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missed fire,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, who was very pale--probably from\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Odd,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, taking the gun. \xe2\x80\x98Never knew one of them\r\nmiss fire before. Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything of the cap.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBless my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98I declare I forgot the cap!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe slight omission was rectified. Mr. Pickwick crouched again. Mr.\r\nWinkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution; and\r\nMr. Tupman looked out from behind a tree. The boy shouted; four birds\r\nflew out. Mr. Winkle fired. There was a scream as of an individual--not\r\na rook--in corporal anguish. Mr. Tupman had saved the lives of\r\ninnumerable unoffending birds by receiving a portion of the charge in\r\nhis left arm.\r\n\r\nTo describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible. To tell how\r\nMr. Pickwick in the first transports of emotion called Mr. Winkle\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wretch!\xe2\x80\x99 how Mr. Tupman lay prostrate on the ground; and how Mr. Winkle\r\nknelt horror-stricken beside him; how Mr. Tupman called distractedly\r\nupon some feminine Christian name, and then opened first one eye, and\r\nthen the other, and then fell back and shut them both--all this would be\r\nas difficult to describe in detail, as it would be to depict the gradual\r\nrecovering of the unfortunate individual, the binding up of his arm with\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, and the conveying him back by slow degrees\r\nsupported by the arms of his anxious friends.\r\n\r\nThey drew near the house. The ladies were at the garden gate, waiting\r\nfor their arrival and their breakfast. The spinster aunt appeared; she\r\nsmiled, and beckoned them to walk quicker. \xe2\x80\x98Twas evident she knew not of\r\nthe disaster. Poor thing! there are times when ignorance is bliss\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThey approached nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what is the matter with the little old gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99 said Isabella\r\nWardle. The spinster aunt heeded not the remark; she thought it applied\r\nto Mr. Pickwick. In her eyes Tracy Tupman was a youth; she viewed his\r\nyears through a diminishing glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x99 called out the old host, fearful of alarming his\r\ndaughters. The little party had crowded so completely round Mr. Tupman,\r\nthat they could not yet clearly discern the nature of the accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Tupman has met with a little accident; that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe spinster aunt uttered a piercing scream, burst into an hysteric\r\nlaugh, and fell backwards in the arms of her nieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Throw some cold water over her,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the spinster aunt; \xe2\x80\x98I am better now. Bella, Emily--a\r\nsurgeon! Is he wounded?--Is he dead?--Is he--Ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x99 Here the\r\nspinster aunt burst into fit number two, of hysteric laughter\r\ninterspersed with screams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Calm yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, affected almost to tears by this\r\nexpression of sympathy with his sufferings. \xe2\x80\x98Dear, dear madam, calm\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is his voice!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the spinster aunt; and strong symptoms of\r\nfit number three developed themselves forthwith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do not agitate yourself, I entreat you, dearest madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman\r\nsoothingly. \xe2\x80\x98I am very little hurt, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you are not dead!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated the hysterical lady. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, say you\r\nare not dead!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool, Rachael,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Wardle, rather more roughly\r\nthan was consistent with the poetic nature of the scene. \xe2\x80\x98What the\r\ndevil\xe2\x80\x99s the use of his saying he isn\xe2\x80\x99t dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, I am not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman. \xe2\x80\x98I require no assistance but yours.\r\nLet me lean on your arm.\xe2\x80\x99 He added, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Miss Rachael!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe agitated female advanced, and offered her arm. They turned into the\r\nbreakfast parlour. Mr. Tracy Tupman gently pressed her hand to his lips,\r\nand sank upon the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you faint?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the anxious Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman. \xe2\x80\x98It is nothing. I shall be better presently.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nclosed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He sleeps,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the spinster aunt. (His organs of vision had been\r\nclosed nearly twenty seconds.) \xe2\x80\x98Dear--dear--Mr. Tupman!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman jumped up--\xe2\x80\x98Oh, say those words again!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe lady started. \xe2\x80\x98Surely you did not hear them!\xe2\x80\x99 she said bashfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, I did!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman; \xe2\x80\x98repeat them. If you would have me\r\nrecover, repeat them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHush!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady. \xe2\x80\x98My brother.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Tracy Tupman resumed his former\r\nposition; and Mr. Wardle, accompanied by a surgeon, entered the room.\r\n\r\nThe arm was examined, the wound dressed, and pronounced to be a very\r\nslight one; and the minds of the company having been thus satisfied,\r\nthey proceeded to satisfy their appetites with countenances to which an\r\nexpression of cheerfulness was again restored. Mr. Pickwick alone was\r\nsilent and reserved. Doubt and distrust were exhibited in his\r\ncountenance. His confidence in Mr. Winkle had been shaken--greatly\r\nshaken--by the proceedings of the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you a cricketer?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Wardle of the marksman.\r\n\r\nAt any other time, Mr. Winkle would have replied in the affirmative. He\r\nfelt the delicacy of his situation, and modestly replied, \xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was once upon a time,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the host; \xe2\x80\x98but I have given it up now.\r\nI subscribe to the club here, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t play.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The grand match is played to-day, I believe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the host. \xe2\x80\x98Of course you would like to see it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98am delighted to view any sports which\r\nmay be safely indulged in, and in which the impotent effects of\r\nunskilful people do not endanger human life.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick paused, and\r\nlooked steadily on Mr. Winkle, who quailed beneath his leader\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsearching glance. The great man withdrew his eyes after a few minutes,\r\nand added: \xe2\x80\x98Shall we be justified in leaving our wounded friend to the\r\ncare of the ladies?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot leave me in better hands,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite impossible,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore settled that Mr. Tupman should be left at home in\r\ncharge of the females; and that the remainder of the guests, under the\r\nguidance of Mr. Wardle, should proceed to the spot where was to be held\r\nthat trial of skill, which had roused all Muggleton from its torpor, and\r\ninoculated Dingley Dell with a fever of excitement.\r\n\r\nAs their walk, which was not above two miles long, lay through shady\r\nlanes and sequestered footpaths, and as their conversation turned upon\r\nthe delightful scenery by which they were on every side surrounded, Mr.\r\nPickwick was almost inclined to regret the expedition they had used,\r\nwhen he found himself in the main street of the town of Muggleton.\r\n\r\nEverybody whose genius has a topographical bent knows perfectly well\r\nthat Muggleton is a corporate town, with a mayor, burgesses, and\r\nfreemen; and anybody who has consulted the addresses of the mayor to the\r\nfreemen, or the freemen to the mayor, or both to the corporation, or all\r\nthree to Parliament, will learn from thence what they ought to have\r\nknown before, that Muggleton is an ancient and loyal borough, mingling a\r\nzealous advocacy of Christian principles with a devoted attachment to\r\ncommercial rights; in demonstration whereof, the mayor, corporation, and\r\nother inhabitants, have presented at divers times, no fewer than one\r\nthousand four hundred and twenty petitions against the continuance of\r\nnegro slavery abroad, and an equal number against any interference with\r\nthe factory system at home; sixty-eight in favour of the sale of livings\r\nin the Church, and eighty-six for abolishing Sunday trading in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick stood in the principal street of this illustrious town, and\r\ngazed with an air of curiosity, not unmixed with interest, on the\r\nobjects around him. There was an open square for the market-place; and\r\nin the centre of it, a large inn with a sign-post in front, displaying\r\nan object very common in art, but rarely met with in nature--to wit, a\r\nblue lion, with three bow legs in the air, balancing himself on the\r\nextreme point of the centre claw of his fourth foot. There were, within\r\nsight, an auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s and fire-agency office, a corn-factor\xe2\x80\x99s, a linen-\r\ndraper\xe2\x80\x99s, a saddler\xe2\x80\x99s, a distiller\xe2\x80\x99s, a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s, and a shoe-shop--the\r\nlast-mentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of\r\nhats, bonnets, wearing apparel, cotton umbrellas, and useful knowledge.\r\nThere was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front, which\r\nanybody might have known belonged to the attorney; and there was,\r\nmoreover, another red brick house with Venetian blinds, and a large\r\nbrass door-plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to\r\nthe surgeon. A few boys were making their way to the cricket-field; and\r\ntwo or three shopkeepers who were standing at their doors looked as if\r\nthey should like to be making their way to the same spot, as indeed to\r\nall appearance they might have done, without losing any great amount of\r\ncustom thereby. Mr. Pickwick having paused to make these observations,\r\nto be noted down at a more convenient period, hastened to rejoin his\r\nfriends, who had turned out of the main street, and were already within\r\nsight of the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe wickets were pitched, and so were a couple of marquees for the rest\r\nand refreshment of the contending parties. The game had not yet\r\ncommenced. Two or three Dingley Dellers, and All-Muggletonians, were\r\namusing themselves with a majestic air by throwing the ball carelessly\r\nfrom hand to hand; and several other gentlemen dressed like them, in\r\nstraw hats, flannel jackets, and white trousers--a costume in which they\r\nlooked very much like amateur stone-masons--were sprinkled about the\r\ntents, towards one of which Mr. Wardle conducted the party.\r\n\r\nSeveral dozen of \xe2\x80\x98How-are-you\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99 hailed the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s arrival;\r\nand a general raising of the straw hats, and bending forward of the\r\nflannel jackets, followed his introduction of his guests as gentlemen\r\nfrom London, who were extremely anxious to witness the proceedings of\r\nthe day, with which, he had no doubt, they would be greatly delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better step into the marquee, I think, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said one very\r\nstout gentleman, whose body and legs looked like half a gigantic roll of\r\nflannel, elevated on a couple of inflated pillow-cases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll find it much pleasanter, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 urged another stout gentleman,\r\nwho strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This way,\xe2\x80\x99 said the first speaker; \xe2\x80\x98they notch in here--it\xe2\x80\x99s the best\r\nplace in the whole field;\xe2\x80\x99 and the cricketer, panting on before,\r\npreceded them to the tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital game--smart sport--fine exercise--very,\xe2\x80\x99 were the words which\r\nfell upon Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s ear as he entered the tent; and the first\r\nobject that met his eyes was his green-coated friend of the Rochester\r\ncoach, holding forth, to the no small delight and edification of a\r\nselect circle of the chosen of All-Muggleton. His dress was slightly\r\nimproved, and he wore boots; but there was no mistaking him.\r\n\r\nThe stranger recognised his friends immediately; and, darting forward\r\nand seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand, dragged him to a seat with his\r\nusual impetuosity, talking all the while as if the whole of the\r\narrangements were under his especial patronage and direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This way--this way--capital fun--lots of beer--hogsheads; rounds of\r\nbeef--bullocks; mustard--cart-loads; glorious day--down with you--make\r\nyourself at home--glad to see you--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick sat down as he was bid, and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass\r\nalso complied with the directions of their mysterious friend. Mr. Wardle\r\nlooked on in silent wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Wardle--a friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friend of yours!--My dear sir, how are you?--Friend of my friend\xe2\x80\x99s--\r\ngive me your hand, sir\xe2\x80\x99--and the stranger grasped Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s hand with\r\nall the fervour of a close intimacy of many years, and then stepped back\r\na pace or two as if to take a full survey of his face and figure, and\r\nthen shook hands with him again, if possible, more warmly than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; and how came you here?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile in which\r\nbenevolence struggled with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger--\xe2\x80\x98stopping at Crown--Crown at Muggleton--\r\nmet a party--flannel jackets--white trousers--anchovy sandwiches--\r\ndevilled kidney--splendid fellows--glorious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was sufficiently versed in the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s system of\r\nstenography to infer from this rapid and disjointed communication that\r\nhe had, somehow or other, contracted an acquaintance with the All-\r\nMuggletons, which he had converted, by a process peculiar to himself,\r\ninto that extent of good-fellowship on which a general invitation may be\r\neasily founded. His curiosity was therefore satisfied, and putting on\r\nhis spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just\r\ncommencing.\r\n\r\nAll-Muggleton had the first innings; and the interest became intense\r\nwhen Mr. Dumkins and Mr. Podder, two of the most renowned members of\r\nthat most distinguished club, walked, bat in hand, to their respective\r\nwickets. Mr. Luffey, the highest ornament of Dingley Dell, was pitched\r\nto bowl against the redoubtable Dumkins, and Mr. Struggles was selected\r\nto do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered Podder. Several\r\nplayers were stationed, to \xe2\x80\x98look out,\xe2\x80\x99 in different parts of the field,\r\nand each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on\r\neach knee, and stooping very much as if he were \xe2\x80\x98making a back\xe2\x80\x99 for some\r\nbeginner at leap-frog. All the regular players do this sort of thing;--\r\nindeed it is generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out\r\nproperly in any other position.\r\n\r\nThe umpires were stationed behind the wickets; the scorers were prepared\r\nto notch the runs; a breathless silence ensued. Mr. Luffey retired a few\r\npaces behind the wicket of the passive Podder, and applied the ball to\r\nhis right eye for several seconds. Dumkins confidently awaited its\r\ncoming with his eyes fixed on the motions of Luffey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Play!\xe2\x80\x99 suddenly cried the bowler. The ball flew from his hand straight\r\nand swift towards the centre stump of the wicket. The wary Dumkins was\r\non the alert: it fell upon the tip of the bat, and bounded far away over\r\nthe heads of the scouts, who had just stooped low enough to let it fly\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Run--run--another.--Now, then throw her up--up with her--stop there--\r\nanother--no--yes--no--throw her up, throw her up!\xe2\x80\x99--Such were the shouts\r\nwhich followed the stroke; and at the conclusion of which All-Muggleton\r\nhad scored two. Nor was Podder behindhand in earning laurels wherewith\r\nto garnish himself and Muggleton. He blocked the doubtful balls, missed\r\nthe bad ones, took the good ones, and sent them flying to all parts of\r\nthe field. The scouts were hot and tired; the bowlers were changed and\r\nbowled till their arms ached; but Dumkins and Podder remained\r\nunconquered. Did an elderly gentleman essay to stop the progress of the\r\nball, it rolled between his legs or slipped between his fingers. Did a\r\nslim gentleman try to catch it, it struck him on the nose, and bounded\r\npleasantly off with redoubled violence, while the slim gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nfilled with water, and his form writhed with anguish. Was it thrown\r\nstraight up to the wicket, Dumkins had reached it before the ball. In\r\nshort, when Dumkins was caught out, and Podder stumped out, All-\r\nMuggleton had notched some fifty-four, while the score of the Dingley\r\nDellers was as blank as their faces. The advantage was too great to be\r\nrecovered. In vain did the eager Luffey, and the enthusiastic Struggles,\r\ndo all that skill and experience could suggest, to regain the ground\r\nDingley Dell had lost in the contest--it was of no avail; and in an\r\nearly period of the winning game Dingley Dell gave in, and allowed the\r\nsuperior prowess of All-Muggleton.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, meanwhile, had been eating, drinking, and talking, without\r\ncessation. At every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and\r\napproval of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner,\r\nwhich could not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party\r\nconcerned; while at every bad attempt at a catch, and every failure to\r\nstop the ball, he launched his personal displeasure at the head of the\r\ndevoted individual in such denunciations as--\xe2\x80\x98Ah, ah!--stupid\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nbutter-fingers\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Muff\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Humbug\xe2\x80\x99--and so forth--ejaculations which\r\nseemed to establish him in the opinion of all around, as a most\r\nexcellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble\r\ngame of cricket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital game--well played--some strokes admirable,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger,\r\nas both sides crowded into the tent, at the conclusion of the game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have played it, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Wardle, who had been much amused\r\nby his loquacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Played it! Think I have--thousands of times--not here--West Indies--\r\nexciting thing--hot work--very.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It must be rather a warm pursuit in\r\nsuch a climate,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Warm!--red hot--scorching--glowing. Played a match once--single wicket-\r\n-friend the colonel--Sir Thomas Blazo--who should get the greatest\r\nnumber of runs.--Won the toss--first innings--seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock A.M.--six\r\nnatives to look out--went in; kept in--heat intense--natives all\r\nfainted--taken away--fresh half-dozen ordered--fainted also--Blazo\r\nbowling--supported by two natives--couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bowl me out--fainted too--\r\ncleared away the colonel--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give in--faithful attendant--Quanko\r\nSamba--last man left--sun so hot, bat in blisters, ball scorched brown--\r\nfive hundred and seventy runs--rather exhausted--Quanko mustered up last\r\nremaining strength--bowled me out--had a bath, and went out to dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what became of what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired an old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blazo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--the other gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nQuanko Samba?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Quanko--never recovered it--bowled on, on my account--bowled off,\r\non his own--died, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the stranger buried his countenance in a\r\nbrown jug, but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents, we\r\ncannot distinctly affirm. We only know that he paused suddenly, drew a\r\nlong and deep breath, and looked anxiously on, as two of the principal\r\nmembers of the Dingley Dell club approached Mr. Pickwick, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are about to partake of a plain dinner at the Blue Lion, Sir; we\r\nhope you and your friends will join us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOf course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98among our friends we include Mr.--;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhe looked towards the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jingle,\xe2\x80\x99 said that versatile gentleman, taking the hint at once.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jingle--Alfred Jingle, Esq., of No Hall, Nowhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be very happy, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So shall I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Alfred Jingle, drawing one arm through Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s, and another through Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s, as he whispered\r\nconfidentially in the ear of the former gentleman:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Devilish good dinner--cold, but capital--peeped into the room this\r\nmorning--fowls and pies, and all that sort of thing--pleasant fellows\r\nthese--well behaved, too--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere being no further preliminaries to arrange, the company straggled\r\ninto the town in little knots of twos and threes; and within a quarter\r\nof an hour were all seated in the great room of the Blue Lion Inn,\r\nMuggleton--Mr. Dumkins acting as chairman, and Mr. Luffey officiating as\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nThere was a vast deal of talking and rattling of knives and forks, and\r\nplates; a great running about of three ponderous-headed waiters, and a\r\nrapid disappearance of the substantial viands on the table; to each and\r\nevery of which item of confusion, the facetious Mr. Jingle lent the aid\r\nof half-a-dozen ordinary men at least. When everybody had eaten as much\r\nas possible, the cloth was removed, bottles, glasses, and dessert were\r\nplaced on the table; and the waiters withdrew to \xe2\x80\x98clear away,\xe2\x80\x99 or in\r\nother words, to appropriate to their own private use and emolument\r\nwhatever remnants of the eatables and drinkables they could contrive to\r\nlay their hands on.\r\n\r\nAmidst the general hum of mirth and conversation that ensued, there was\r\na little man with a puffy Say-nothing-to-me,-or-I\xe2\x80\x99ll-contradict-you sort\r\nof countenance, who remained very quiet; occasionally looking round him\r\nwhen the conversation slackened, as if he contemplated putting in\r\nsomething very weighty; and now and then bursting into a short cough of\r\ninexpressible grandeur. At length, during a moment of comparative\r\nsilence, the little man called out in a very loud, solemn voice,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Luffey!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEverybody was hushed into a profound stillness as the individual\r\naddressed, replied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish to address a few words to you, Sir, if you will entreat the\r\ngentlemen to fill their glasses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jingle uttered a patronising \xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear,\xe2\x80\x99 which was responded to by\r\nthe remainder of the company; and the glasses having been filled, the\r\nvice-president assumed an air of wisdom in a state of profound\r\nattention; and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Staple.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, rising, \xe2\x80\x98I wish to address what I have to\r\nsay to you and not to our worthy chairman, because our worthy chairman\r\nis in some measure--I may say in a great degree--the subject of what I\r\nhave to say, or I may say to--to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98State,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, to state,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, \xe2\x80\x98I thank my honourable friend, if\r\nhe will allow me to call him so (four hears and one certainly from Mr.\r\nJingle), for the suggestion. Sir, I am a Deller--a Dingley Deller\r\n(cheers). I cannot lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the\r\npopulation of Muggleton; nor, Sir, I will frankly admit, do I covet that\r\nhonour: and I will tell you why, Sir (hear); to Muggleton I will readily\r\nconcede all these honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay\r\nclaim--they are too numerous and too well known to require aid or\r\nrecapitulation from me. But, sir, while we remember that Muggleton has\r\ngiven birth to a Dumkins and a Podder, let us never forget that Dingley\r\nDell can boast a Luffey and a Struggles. (Vociferous cheering.) Let me\r\nnot be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former\r\ngentlemen. Sir, I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this\r\noccasion. (Cheers.) Every gentleman who hears me, is probably acquainted\r\nwith the reply made by an individual, who--to use an ordinary figure of\r\nspeech--\xe2\x80\x9chung out\xe2\x80\x9d in a tub, to the emperor Alexander:--\xe2\x80\x9cif I were not\r\nDiogenes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI would be Alexander.\xe2\x80\x9d I can well imagine these\r\ngentlemen to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were not Dumkins I would be Luffey; if I were\r\nnot Podder I would be Struggles.\xe2\x80\x9d (Enthusiasm.) But, gentlemen of\r\nMuggleton, is it in cricket alone that your fellow-townsmen stand pre-\r\neminent? Have you never heard of Dumkins and determination? Have you\r\nnever been taught to associate Podder with property? (Great applause.)\r\nHave you never, when struggling for your rights, your liberties, and\r\nyour privileges, been reduced, if only for an instant, to misgiving and\r\ndespair? And when you have been thus depressed, has not the name of\r\nDumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out;\r\nand has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it\r\nhad never expired? (Great cheering.) Gentlemen, I beg to surround with a\r\nrich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of \xe2\x80\x9cDumkins and\r\nPodder.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the little man ceased, and here the company commenced a raising of\r\nvoices, and thumping of tables, which lasted with little intermission\r\nduring the remainder of the evening. Other toasts were drunk. Mr. Luffey\r\nand Mr. Struggles, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Jingle, were, each in his turn,\r\nthe subject of unqualified eulogium; and each in due course returned\r\nthanks for the honour.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic as we are in the noble cause to which we have devoted\r\nourselves, we should have felt a sensation of pride which we cannot\r\nexpress, and a consciousness of having done something to merit\r\nimmortality of which we are now deprived, could we have laid the\r\nfaintest outline on these addresses before our ardent readers. Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, as usual, took a great mass of notes, which would no doubt\r\nhave afforded most useful and valuable information, had not the burning\r\neloquence of the words or the feverish influence of the wine made that\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hand so extremely unsteady, as to render his writing nearly\r\nunintelligible, and his style wholly so. By dint of patient\r\ninvestigation, we have been enabled to trace some characters bearing a\r\nfaint resemblance to the names of the speakers; and we can only discern\r\nan entry of a song (supposed to have been sung by Mr. Jingle), in which\r\nthe words \xe2\x80\x98bowl\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98sparkling\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98ruby\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98bright\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98wine\xe2\x80\x99 are frequently\r\nrepeated at short intervals. We fancy, too, that we can discern at the\r\nvery end of the notes, some indistinct reference to \xe2\x80\x98broiled bones\xe2\x80\x99; and\r\nthen the words \xe2\x80\x98cold\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98without\xe2\x80\x99 occur: but as any hypothesis we could\r\nfound upon them must necessarily rest upon mere conjecture, we are not\r\ndisposed to indulge in any of the speculations to which they may give\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nWe will therefore return to Mr. Tupman; merely adding that within some\r\nfew minutes before twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night, the convocation of\r\nworthies of Dingley Dell and Muggleton were heard to sing, with great\r\nfeeling and emphasis, the beautiful and pathetic national air of\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We won\xe2\x80\x99t go home till morning, We won\xe2\x80\x99t go home till morning, We won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo home till morning, Till daylight doth appear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. STRONGLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE POSITION, THAT THE COURSE OF\r\nTRUE LOVE IS NOT A RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThe quiet seclusion of Dingley Dell, the presence of so many of the\r\ngentler sex, and the solicitude and anxiety they evinced in his behalf,\r\nwere all favourable to the growth and development of those softer\r\nfeelings which nature had implanted deep in the bosom of Mr. Tracy\r\nTupman, and which now appeared destined to centre in one lovely object.\r\nThe young ladies were pretty, their manners winning, their dispositions\r\nunexceptionable; but there was a dignity in the air, a touch-me-not-\r\nishness in the walk, a majesty in the eye, of the spinster aunt, to\r\nwhich, at their time of life, they could lay no claim, which\r\ndistinguished her from any female on whom Mr. Tupman had ever gazed.\r\nThat there was something kindred in their nature, something congenial in\r\ntheir souls, something mysteriously sympathetic in their bosoms, was\r\nevident. Her name was the first that rose to Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s lips as he lay\r\nwounded on the grass; and her hysteric laughter was the first sound that\r\nfell upon his ear when he was supported to the house. But had her\r\nagitation arisen from an amiable and feminine sensibility which would\r\nhave been equally irrepressible in any case; or had it been called forth\r\nby a more ardent and passionate feeling, which he, of all men living,\r\ncould alone awaken? These were the doubts which racked his brain as he\r\nlay extended on the sofa; these were the doubts which he determined\r\nshould be at once and for ever resolved.\r\n\r\nIt was evening. Isabella and Emily had strolled out with Mr. Trundle;\r\nthe deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair; the snoring of the fat\r\nboy, penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen;\r\nthe buxom servants were lounging at the side door, enjoying the\r\npleasantness of the hour, and the delights of a flirtation, on first\r\nprinciples, with certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm; and\r\nthere sat the interesting pair, uncared for by all, caring for none, and\r\ndreaming only of themselves; there they sat, in short, like a pair of\r\ncarefully-folded kid gloves--bound up in each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have forgotten my flowers,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Water them now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, in accents of persuasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will take cold in the evening air,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the spinster aunt\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, rising; \xe2\x80\x98it will do me good. Let me accompany\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lady paused to adjust the sling in which the left arm of the youth\r\nwas placed, and taking his right arm led him to the garden.\r\n\r\nThere was a bower at the farther end, with honeysuckle, jessamine, and\r\ncreeping plants--one of those sweet retreats which humane men erect for\r\nthe accommodation of spiders.\r\n\r\nThe spinster aunt took up a large watering-pot which lay in one corner,\r\nand was about to leave the arbour. Mr. Tupman detained her, and drew her\r\nto a seat beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Wardle!\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nThe spinster aunt trembled, till some pebbles which had accidentally\r\nfound their way into the large watering-pot shook like an infant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrattle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Wardle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, \xe2\x80\x98you are an angel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Tupman!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Rachael, blushing as red as the watering-pot\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said the eloquent Pickwickian--\xe2\x80\x98I know it but too well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All women are angels, they say,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the lady playfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what can you be; or to what, without presumption, can I compare\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman. \xe2\x80\x98Where was the woman ever seen who resembled\r\nyou? Where else could I hope to find so rare a combination of excellence\r\nand beauty? Where else could I seek to--Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Tupman paused, and\r\npressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy watering-pot.\r\n\r\nThe lady turned aside her head. \xe2\x80\x98Men are such deceivers,\xe2\x80\x99 she softly\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are, they are,\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Tupman; \xe2\x80\x98but not all men. There\r\nlives at least one being who can never change--one being who would be\r\ncontent to devote his whole existence to your happiness--who lives but\r\nin your eyes--who breathes but in your smiles--who bears the heavy\r\nburden of life itself only for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could such an individual be found--\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he _can_ be found,\xe2\x80\x99 said the ardent Mr. Tupman, interposing. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\n_is_ found. He is here, Miss Wardle.\xe2\x80\x99 And ere the lady was aware of his\r\nintention, Mr. Tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Tupman, rise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99 was the valorous reply. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Rachael!\xe2\x80\x99 He seized her passive\r\nhand, and the watering-pot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his\r\nlips.--\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Rachael! say you love me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Tupman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt, with averted head, \xe2\x80\x98I can hardly\r\nspeak the words; but--but--you are not wholly indifferent to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman no sooner heard this avowal, than he proceeded to do what his\r\nenthusiastic emotions prompted, and what, for aught we know (for we are\r\nbut little acquainted with such matters), people so circumstanced always\r\ndo. He jumped up, and, throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster\r\naunt, imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses, which after a due show of\r\nstruggling and resistance, she received so passively, that there is no\r\ntelling how many more Mr. Tupman might have bestowed, if the lady had\r\nnot given a very unaffected start, and exclaimed in an affrighted tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Tupman, we are observed!--we are discovered!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman looked round. There was the fat boy, perfectly motionless,\r\nwith his large circular eyes staring into the arbour, but without the\r\nslightest expression on his face that the most expert physiognomist\r\ncould have referred to astonishment, curiosity, or any other known\r\npassion that agitates the human breast. Mr. Tupman gazed on the fat boy,\r\nand the fat boy stared at him; and the longer Mr. Tupman observed the\r\nutter vacancy of the fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, the more convinced he became\r\nthat he either did not know, or did not understand, anything that had\r\nbeen going forward. Under this impression, he said with great firmness--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want here, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Supper\xe2\x80\x99s ready, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you just come here, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman, with a piercing\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat boy.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman looked at him very hard again; but there was not a wink in\r\nhis eye, or a curve in his face.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt, and walked towards the\r\nhouse; the fat boy followed behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He knows nothing of what has happened,\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound behind them, as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle.\r\nMr. Tupman turned sharply round. No; it could not have been the fat boy;\r\nthere was not a gleam of mirth, or anything but feeding in his whole\r\nvisage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must have been fast asleep,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not the least doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the spinster aunt.\r\n\r\nThey both laughed heartily.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman was wrong. The fat boy, for once, had not been fast asleep.\r\nHe was awake--wide awake--to what had been going forward.\r\n\r\nThe supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation. The\r\nold lady had gone to bed; Isabella Wardle devoted herself exclusively to\r\nMr. Trundle; the spinster\xe2\x80\x99s attentions were reserved for Mr. Tupman; and\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts appeared to be engrossed by some distant object--\r\npossibly they were with the absent Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nEleven--twelve--one o\xe2\x80\x99clock had struck, and the gentlemen had not\r\narrived. Consternation sat on every face. Could they have been waylaid\r\nand robbed? Should they send men and lanterns in every direction by\r\nwhich they could be supposed likely to have travelled home? or should\r\nthey--Hark! there they were. What could have made them so late? A\r\nstrange voice, too! To whom could it belong? They rushed into the\r\nkitchen, whither the truants had repaired, and at once obtained rather\r\nmore than a glimmering of the real state of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, with his hands in his pockets and his hat cocked\r\ncompletely over his left eye, was leaning against the dresser, shaking\r\nhis head from side to side, and producing a constant succession of the\r\nblandest and most benevolent smiles without being moved thereunto by any\r\ndiscernible cause or pretence whatsoever; old Mr. Wardle, with a highly-\r\ninflamed countenance, was grasping the hand of a strange gentleman\r\nmuttering protestations of eternal friendship; Mr. Winkle, supporting\r\nhimself by the eight-day clock, was feebly invoking destruction upon the\r\nhead of any member of the family who should suggest the propriety of his\r\nretiring for the night; and Mr. Snodgrass had sunk into a chair, with an\r\nexpression of the most abject and hopeless misery that the human mind\r\ncan imagine, portrayed in every lineament of his expressive face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the three ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing the matter,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98We--we\xe2\x80\x99re--all right.--I\r\nsay, Wardle, we\xe2\x80\x99re all right, ain\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the jolly host.--\xe2\x80\x98My dears, here\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nfriend Mr. Jingle--Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s friend, Mr. Jingle, come \xe2\x80\x98pon--little\r\nvisit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is anything the matter with Mr. Snodgrass, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Emily, with\r\ngreat anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing the matter, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98Cricket dinner--\r\nglorious party--capital songs--old port--claret--good--very good--wine,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am--wine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the wine,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mr. Snodgrass, in a broken voice. \xe2\x80\x98It was\r\nthe salmon.\xe2\x80\x99 (Somehow or other, it never is the wine, in these cases.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t they better go to bed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Emma. \xe2\x80\x98Two of the boys\r\nwill carry the gentlemen upstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No living boy shall carry me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick stoutly; and he went\r\non smiling as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Mr. Winkle faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off his hat and dashing it on the\r\nfloor, and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the\r\nkitchen. At this humorous feat he laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s--have--\xe2\x80\x98nother--bottle,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Winkle, commencing in a very\r\nloud key, and ending in a very faint one. His head dropped upon his\r\nbreast; and, muttering his invincible determination not to go to his\r\nbed, and a sanguinary regret that he had not \xe2\x80\x98done for old Tupman\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nthe morning, he fell fast asleep; in which condition he was borne to his\r\napartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the\r\nfat boy, to whose protecting care Mr. Snodgrass shortly afterwards\r\nconfided his own person, Mr. Pickwick accepted the proffered arm of Mr.\r\nTupman and quietly disappeared, smiling more than ever; and Mr. Wardle,\r\nafter taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were\r\nordered for immediate execution, consigned to Mr. Trundle the honour of\r\nconveying him upstairs, and retired, with a very futile attempt to look\r\nimpressively solemn and dignified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a shocking scene!\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dis-gusting!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated both the young ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dreadful--dreadful!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle, looking very grave: he was about a\r\nbottle and a half ahead of any of his companions. \xe2\x80\x98Horrid spectacle--\r\nvery!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a nice man!\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the spinster aunt to Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-looking, too!\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Emily Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, decidedly,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the spinster aunt.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman thought of the widow at Rochester, and his mind was troubled.\r\nThe succeeding half-hour\xe2\x80\x99s conversation was not of a nature to calm his\r\nperturbed spirit. The new visitor was very talkative, and the number of\r\nhis anecdotes was only to be exceeded by the extent of his politeness.\r\nMr. Tupman felt that as Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s popularity increased, he (Tupman)\r\nretired further into the shade. His laughter was forced--his merriment\r\nfeigned; and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets,\r\nhe thought, with horrid delight, on the satisfaction it would afford him\r\nto have Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s head at that moment between the feather bed and the\r\nmattress.\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning, and, although his\r\ncompanions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the\r\nprevious night, exerted himself most successfully to promote the\r\nhilarity of the breakfast-table. So successful were his efforts, that\r\neven the deaf old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes\r\nretailed through the trumpet; and even she condescended to observe to\r\nthe spinster aunt, that \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99 (meaning Jingle) \xe2\x80\x98was an impudent young\r\nfellow:\xe2\x80\x99 a sentiment in which all her relations then and there present\r\nthoroughly coincided.\r\n\r\nIt was the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to the\r\narbour in which Mr. Tupman had already signalised himself, in form and\r\nmanner following: first, the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the old\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door, a close black satin bonnet, a warm cotton shawl,\r\nand a thick stick with a capacious handle; and the old lady, having put\r\non the bonnet and shawl at her leisure, would lean one hand on the stick\r\nand the other on the fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and walk leisurely to the\r\narbour, where the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the\r\nspace of half an hour; at the expiration of which time he would return\r\nand reconduct her to the house.\r\n\r\nThe old lady was very precise and very particular; and as this ceremony\r\nhad been observed for three successive summers without the slightest\r\ndeviation from the accustomed form, she was not a little surprised on\r\nthis particular morning to see the fat boy, instead of leaving the\r\narbour, walk a few paces out of it, look carefully round him in every\r\ndirection, and return towards her with great stealth and an air of the\r\nmost profound mystery.\r\n\r\nThe old lady was timorous--most old ladies are--and her first impression\r\nwas that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous bodily harm\r\nwith the view of possessing himself of her loose coin. She would have\r\ncried for assistance, but age and infirmity had long ago deprived her of\r\nthe power of screaming; she, therefore, watched his motions with\r\nfeelings of intense horror which were in no degree diminished by his\r\ncoming close up to her, and shouting in her ear in an agitated, and as\r\nit seemed to her, a threatening tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missus!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that Mr. Jingle was walking in the garden close to\r\nthe arbour at that moment. He too heard the shouts of \xe2\x80\x98Missus,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nstopped to hear more. There were three reasons for his doing so. In the\r\nfirst place, he was idle and curious; secondly, he was by no means\r\nscrupulous; thirdly, and lastly, he was concealed from view by some\r\nflowering shrubs. So there he stood, and there he listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missus!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 said the trembling old lady. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I have been a good\r\nmistress to you, Joe. You have invariably been treated very kindly. You\r\nhave never had too much to do; and you have always had enough to eat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis last was an appeal to the fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s most sensitive feelings. He\r\nseemed touched, as he replied emphatically--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knows I has.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what can you want to do now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, gaining courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wants to make your flesh creep,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy.\r\n\r\nThis sounded like a very bloodthirsty mode of showing one\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude;\r\nand as the old lady did not precisely understand the process by which\r\nsuch a result was to be attained, all her former horrors returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think I see in this very arbour last night?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless us! What?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old lady, alarmed at the solemn manner\r\nof the corpulent youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The strange gentleman--him as had his arm hurt--a-kissin\xe2\x80\x99 and huggin\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who, Joe? None of the servants, I hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWorser than that,\xe2\x80\x99 roared the fat boy, in the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not one of my grandda\xe2\x80\x99aters?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Worser than that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Worse than that, Joe!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, who had thought this the\r\nextreme limit of human atrocity. \xe2\x80\x98Who was it, Joe? I insist upon\r\nknowing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy looked cautiously round, and having concluded his survey,\r\nshouted in the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s ear--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Rachael.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, in a shrill tone. \xe2\x80\x98Speak louder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Rachael,\xe2\x80\x99 roared the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My da\xe2\x80\x99ater!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe train of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent, communicated\r\na blanc-mange like motion to his fat cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And she suffered him!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old lady. A grin stole over the\r\nfat boy\xe2\x80\x99s features as he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see her a-kissin\xe2\x80\x99 of him agin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Jingle, from his place of concealment, could have beheld the\r\nexpression which the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s face assumed at this communication, the\r\nprobability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his\r\nclose vicinity to the summer-house. He listened attentively. Fragments\r\nof angry sentences such as, \xe2\x80\x98Without my permission!\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98At her time of\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Miserable old \xe2\x80\x98ooman like me\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Might have waited till I was\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x99 and so forth, reached his ears; and then he heard the heels of\r\nthe fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s boots crunching the gravel, as he retired and left the old\r\nlady alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable coincidence perhaps, but it was nevertheless a fact,\r\nthat Mr. Jingle within five minutes of his arrival at Manor Farm on the\r\npreceding night, had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of the\r\nspinster aunt, without delay. He had observation enough to see, that his\r\noff-hand manner was by no means disagreeable to the fair object of his\r\nattack; and he had more than a strong suspicion that she possessed that\r\nmost desirable of all requisites, a small independence. The imperative\r\nnecessity of ousting his rival by some means or other, flashed quickly\r\nupon him, and he immediately resolved to adopt certain proceedings\r\ntending to that end and object, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay. Fielding tells\r\nus that man is fire, and woman tow, and the Prince of Darkness sets a\r\nlight to \xe2\x80\x98em. Mr. Jingle knew that young men, to spinster aunts, are as\r\nlighted gas to gunpowder, and he determined to essay the effect of an\r\nexplosion without loss of time.\r\n\r\nFull of reflections upon this important decision, he crept from his\r\nplace of concealment, and, under cover of the shrubs before mentioned,\r\napproached the house. Fortune seemed determined to favour his design.\r\nMr. Tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side\r\ngate just as he obtained a view of it; and the young ladies, he knew,\r\nhad walked out alone, soon after breakfast. The coast was clear.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast-parlour door was partially open. He peeped in. The\r\nspinster aunt was knitting. He coughed; she looked up and smiled.\r\nHesitation formed no part of Mr. Alfred Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s character. He laid his\r\nfinger on his lips mysteriously, walked in, and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Wardle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle, with affected earnestness, \xe2\x80\x98forgive\r\nintrusion--short acquaintance--no time for ceremony--all discovered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt, rather astonished by the unexpected\r\napparition and somewhat doubtful of Mr. Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s sanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle, in a stage-whisper--\xe2\x80\x98Large boy--dumpling face--\r\nround eyes--rascal!\xe2\x80\x99 Here he shook his head expressively, and the\r\nspinster aunt trembled with agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I presume you allude to Joseph, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, making an effort\r\nto appear composed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--damn that Joe!--treacherous dog, Joe--told the old lady--\r\nold lady furious--wild--raving--arbour--Tupman--kissing and hugging--all\r\nthat sort of thing--eh, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jingle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt, \xe2\x80\x98if you come here, Sir, to insult\r\nme--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all--by no means,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the unabashed Mr. Jingle--\xe2\x80\x98overheard\r\nthe tale--came to warn you of your danger--tender my services--prevent\r\nthe hubbub. Never mind--think it an insult--leave the room\xe2\x80\x99--and he\r\nturned, as if to carry the threat into execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What _shall_ I do!\xe2\x80\x99 said the poor spinster, bursting into tears. \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nbrother will be furious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course he will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle pausing--\xe2\x80\x98outrageous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh, Mr. Jingle, what _can_ I say!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the spinster aunt, in\r\nanother flood of despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say he dreamt it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Jingle coolly.\r\n\r\nA ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this\r\nsuggestion. Mr. Jingle perceived it, and followed up his advantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh!--nothing more easy--blackguard boy--lovely woman--fat boy\r\nhorsewhipped--you believed--end of the matter--all comfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill-\r\ntimed discovery was delightful to the spinster\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, or whether\r\nthe hearing herself described as a \xe2\x80\x98lovely woman\xe2\x80\x99 softened the asperity\r\nof her grief, we know not. She blushed slightly, and cast a grateful\r\nlook on Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\nThat insinuating gentleman sighed deeply, fixed his eyes on the spinster\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s face for a couple of minutes, started melodramatically, and\r\nsuddenly withdrew them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem unhappy, Mr. Jingle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, in a plaintive voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I show my gratitude for your kind interference, by inquiring into\r\nthe cause, with a view, if possible, to its removal?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Jingle, with another start--\xe2\x80\x98removal! remove my\r\nunhappiness, and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the\r\nblessing--who even now contemplates a design upon the affections of the\r\nniece of the creature who--but no; he is my friend; I will not expose\r\nhis vices. Miss Wardle--farewell!\xe2\x80\x99 At the conclusion of this address,\r\nthe most consecutive he was ever known to utter, Mr. Jingle applied to\r\nhis eyes the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed, and turned\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, Mr. Jingle!\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt emphatically. \xe2\x80\x98You have made\r\nan allusion to Mr. Tupman--explain it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Jingle, with a professional (i.e., theatrical) air.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99 and, by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned\r\nfurther, he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jingle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the aunt, \xe2\x80\x98I entreat--I implore you, if there is any\r\ndreadful mystery connected with Mr. Tupman, reveal it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle, fixing his eyes on the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s face--\xe2\x80\x98can I\r\nsee--lovely creature--sacrificed at the shrine--heartless avarice!\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nappeared to be struggling with various conflicting emotions for a few\r\nseconds, and then said in a low voice-- \xe2\x80\x98Tupman only wants your money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wretch!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the spinster, with energetic indignation. (Mr.\r\nJingle\xe2\x80\x99s doubts were resolved. She _had_ money.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More than that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle--\xe2\x80\x98loves another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated the spinster. \xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShort girl--black eyes--niece Emily.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\nNow, if there was one individual in the whole world, of whom the\r\nspinster aunt entertained a mortal and deep-rooted jealousy, it was this\r\nidentical niece. The colour rushed over her face and neck, and she\r\ntossed her head in silence with an air of ineffable contempt. At last,\r\nbiting her thin lips, and bridling up, she said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It can\xe2\x80\x99t be.

The spinster aunt could hardly believe\r\nher eyes. Mr. Tracy Tupman was established at Emily\xe2\x80\x99s side, ogling,\r\nwhispering, and smiling, in opposition to Mr. Snodgrass. Not a word, not\r\na look, not a glance, did he bestow upon his heart\xe2\x80\x99s pride of the\r\nevening before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn that boy!\xe2\x80\x99 thought old Mr. Wardle to himself.--He had heard the\r\nstory from his mother. \xe2\x80\x98Damn that boy! He must have been asleep. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall imagination.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Traitor!\xe2\x80\x99 thought the spinster aunt. \xe2\x80\x98Dear Mr. Jingle was not deceiving\r\nme. Ugh! how I hate the wretch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this\r\napparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of Mr.\r\nTracy Tupman.\r\n\r\nThe time was evening; the scene the garden. There were two figures\r\nwalking in a side path; one was rather short and stout; the other tall\r\nand slim. They were Mr. Tupman and Mr. Jingle. The stout figure\r\ncommenced the dialogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did I do it?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Splendid--capital--couldn\xe2\x80\x99t act better myself--you must repeat the part\r\nto-morrow--every evening till further notice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does Rachael still wish it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course--she don\xe2\x80\x99t like it--but must be done--avert suspicion--afraid\r\nof her brother--says there\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it--only a few days more--when\r\nold folks blinded--crown your happiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any message?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Love--best love--kindest regards--unalterable affection. Can I say\r\nanything for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the unsuspicious Mr. Tupman, fervently\r\ngrasping his \xe2\x80\x98friend\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 hand--\xe2\x80\x98carry my best love--say how hard I find\r\nit to dissemble--say anything that\xe2\x80\x99s kind: but add how sensible I am of\r\nthe necessity of the suggestion she made to me, through you, this\r\nmorning. Say I applaud her wisdom and admire her discretion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI will. Anything more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, only add how ardently I long for the time when I may call her\r\nmine, and all dissimulation may be unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, certainly. Anything more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my friend!\xe2\x80\x99 said poor Mr. Tupman, again grasping the hand of his\r\ncompanion, \xe2\x80\x98receive my warmest thanks for your disinterested kindness;\r\nand forgive me if I have ever, even in thought, done you the injustice\r\nof supposing that you could stand in my way. My dear friend, can I ever\r\nrepay you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Jingle. He stopped short, as if suddenly\r\nrecollecting something, and said--\xe2\x80\x98By the bye--can\xe2\x80\x99t spare ten pounds,\r\ncan you?--very particular purpose--pay you in three days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say I can,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman, in the fulness of his heart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three days, you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only three days--all over then--no more difficulties.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Tupman\r\ncounted the money into his companion\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and he dropped it piece by\r\npiece into his pocket, as they walked towards the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be careful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle--\xe2\x80\x98not a look.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a wink,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a syllable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a whisper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All your attentions to the niece--rather rude, than otherwise, to the\r\naunt--only way of deceiving the old ones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ take care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle internally; and they entered the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening, and on the three\r\nafternoons and evenings next ensuing. On the fourth, the host was in\r\nhigh spirits, for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for\r\nthe charge against Mr. Tupman. So was Mr. Tupman, for Mr. Jingle had\r\ntold him that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis. So was Mr.\r\nPickwick, for he was seldom otherwise. So was not Mr. Snodgrass, for he\r\nhad grown jealous of Mr. Tupman. So was the old lady, for she had been\r\nwinning at whist. So were Mr. Jingle and Miss Wardle, for reasons of\r\nsufficient importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. A DISCOVERY AND A CHASE\r\n\r\nThe supper was ready laid, the chairs were drawn round the table,\r\nbottles, jugs, and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard, and\r\neverything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the\r\nwhole four-and-twenty hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Rachael?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, and Jingle?\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder I haven\xe2\x80\x99t missed him before. Why, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard his voice for two hours at least. Emily, my dear,\r\nring the bell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bell was rung, and the fat boy appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Rachael?\xe2\x80\x99 He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Jingle, then?\xe2\x80\x99 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. Everybody looked surprised.\r\nIt was late--past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Mr. Tupman laughed in his sleeve. They\r\nwere loitering somewhere, talking about him. Ha, ha! capital notion\r\nthat--funny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, after a short pause. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll turn up\r\npresently, I dare say. I never wait supper for anybody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excellent rule, that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick--\xe2\x80\x98admirable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; and down they sat.\r\n\r\nThere was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table, and Mr. Pickwick\r\nwas supplied with a plentiful portion of it. He had raised his fork to\r\nhis lips, and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the\r\nreception of a piece of beef, when the hum of many voices suddenly arose\r\nin the kitchen. He paused, and laid down his fork. Mr. Wardle paused\r\ntoo, and insensibly released his hold of the carving-knife, which\r\nremained inserted in the beef. He looked at Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Pickwick\r\nlooked at him.\r\n\r\nHeavy footsteps were heard in the passage; the parlour door was suddenly\r\nburst open; and the man who had cleaned Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s boots on his\r\nfirst arrival, rushed into the room, followed by the fat boy and all the\r\ndomestics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What the devil\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of this?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The kitchen chimney ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-fire, is it, Emma?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor, grandma! No,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed both the young ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 roared the master of the house.\r\n\r\nThe man gasped for breath, and faintly ejaculated--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone, mas\xe2\x80\x99r!--gone right clean off, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 (At this juncture\r\nMr. Tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork, and to turn very\r\npale.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s gone?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mus\xe2\x80\x99r Jingle and Miss Rachael, in a po\xe2\x80\x99-chay, from Blue Lion,\r\nMuggleton. I was there; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop \xe2\x80\x98em; so I run off to tell\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I paid his expenses!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, jumping up frantically. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot ten pounds of mine!--stop him!--he\xe2\x80\x99s swindled me!--I won\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!-\r\n-I\xe2\x80\x99ll have justice, Pickwick!--I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand it!\xe2\x80\x99 and with sundry\r\nincoherent exclamations of the like nature, the unhappy gentleman spun\r\nround and round the apartment, in a transport of frenzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord preserve us!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, eyeing the extraordinary\r\ngestures of his friend with terrified surprise. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone mad! What\r\nshall we do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDo!\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout old host, who regarded only the last words of the\r\nsentence. \xe2\x80\x98Put the horse in the gig! I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chaise at the Lion, and\r\nfollow \xe2\x80\x98em instantly. Where?\xe2\x80\x99--he exclaimed, as the man ran out to\r\nexecute the commission--\xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99s that villain, Joe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I am! but I hain\xe2\x80\x99t a willin,\xe2\x80\x99 replied a voice. It was the fat\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me get at him, Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wardle, as he rushed at the ill-\r\nstarred youth. \xe2\x80\x98He was bribed by that scoundrel, Jingle, to put me on a\r\nwrong scent, by telling a cock-and-bull story of my sister and your\r\nfriend Tupman!\xe2\x80\x99 (Here Mr. Tupman sank into a chair.) \xe2\x80\x98Let me get at\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed all the women, above whose exclamations the\r\nblubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t be held!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the old man. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Winkle, take your hands off.\r\nMr. Pickwick, let me go, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful sight, in that moment of turmoil and confusion, to\r\nbehold the placid and philosophical expression of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nalbeit somewhat flushed with exertion, as he stood with his arms firmly\r\nclasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host, thus\r\nrestraining the impetuosity of his passion, while the fat boy was\r\nscratched, and pulled, and pushed from the room by all the females\r\ncongregated therein. He had no sooner released his hold, than the man\r\nentered to announce that the gig was ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him go alone!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the females. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll kill somebody!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a good fellow, Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host, grasping his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Emma, give Mr. Pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck--make haste. Look\r\nafter your grandmother, girls; she has fainted away. Now then, are you\r\nready?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and chin having been hastily enveloped in a large\r\nshawl, his hat having been put on his head, and his greatcoat thrown\r\nover his arm, he replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThey jumped into the gig. \xe2\x80\x98Give her her head, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the host; and\r\naway they went, down the narrow lanes; jolting in and out of the cart-\r\nruts, and bumping up against the hedges on either side, as if they would\r\ngo to pieces every moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How much are they ahead?\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Wardle, as they drove up to the door\r\nof the Blue Lion, round which a little crowd had collected, late as it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not above three-quarters of an hour,\xe2\x80\x99 was everybody\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chaise-and-four directly!--out with \xe2\x80\x98em! Put up the gig afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, boys!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the landlord--\xe2\x80\x98chaise-and-four out--make haste--look\r\nalive there!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAway ran the hostlers and the boys. The lanterns glimmered, as the men\r\nran to and fro; the horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the\r\nyard; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house; and all\r\nwas noise and bustle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then!--is that chaise coming out to-night?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coming down the yard now, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the hostler.\r\n\r\nOut came the chaise--in went the horses--on sprang the boys--in got the\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mind--the seven-mile stage in less than half an hour!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Off with you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boys applied whip and spur, the waiters shouted, the hostlers\r\ncheered, and away they went, fast and furiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty situation,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick, when he had had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime for reflection. \xe2\x80\x98Pretty situation for the general chairman of the\r\nPickwick Club. Damp chaise--strange horses--fifteen miles an hour--and\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor the first three or four miles, not a word was spoken by either of\r\nthe gentlemen, each being too much immersed in his own reflections to\r\naddress any observations to his companion. When they had gone over that\r\nmuch ground, however, and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to\r\ndo their work in really good style, Mr. Pickwick became too much\r\nexhilarated with the rapidity of the motion, to remain any longer\r\nperfectly mute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re sure to catch them, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking up at the moon, which was\r\nshining brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the worse,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98for they\xe2\x80\x99ll have had all the\r\nadvantage of the moonlight to get the start of us, and we shall lose it.\r\nIt will have gone down in another hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say it will,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his friend dryly.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s temporary excitement began to sober down a little, as he\r\nreflected upon the inconveniences and dangers of the expedition in which\r\nhe had so thoughtlessly embarked. He was roused by a loud shouting of\r\nthe post-boy on the leader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoe!\xe2\x80\x99 went the first boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yo-yo-yo-yoe!\xe2\x80\x99 went the second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yo-yo-yo-yoe!\xe2\x80\x99 chimed in old Wardle himself, most lustily, with his\r\nhead and half his body out of the coach window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yo-yo-yo-yoe!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Pickwick, taking up the burden of the cry,\r\nthough he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object. And\r\namidst the yo-yoing of the whole four, the chaise stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a gate here,\xe2\x80\x99 replied old Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98We shall hear something of\r\nthe fugitives.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of five minutes, consumed in incessant knocking and\r\nshouting, an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the\r\nturnpike-house, and opened the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long is it since a post-chaise went through here?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nWardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know. It worn\xe2\x80\x99t a long time ago, nor it worn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nshort time ago--just between the two, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has any chaise been by at all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a chay by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long ago, my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98an hour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I dare say it might be,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or two hours?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the post--boy on the wheeler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if it was,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the old man doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drive on, boys,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the testy old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t waste any more\r\ntime with that old idiot!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Idiot!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old man with a grin, as he stood in the middle of\r\nthe road with the gate half-closed, watching the chaise which rapidly\r\ndiminished in the increasing distance. \xe2\x80\x98No--not much o\xe2\x80\x99 that either;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve lost ten minutes here, and gone away as wise as you came, arter\r\nall. If every man on the line as has a guinea give him, earns it half as\r\nwell, you won\xe2\x80\x99t catch t\xe2\x80\x99other chay this side Mich\xe2\x80\x99lmas, old short-and-\r\nfat.\xe2\x80\x99 And with another prolonged grin, the old man closed the gate, re-\r\nentered his house, and bolted the door after him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the chaise proceeded, without any slackening of pace, towards\r\nthe conclusion of the stage. The moon, as Wardle had foretold, was\r\nrapidly on the wane; large tiers of dark, heavy clouds, which had been\r\ngradually overspreading the sky for some time past, now formed one black\r\nmass overhead; and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then\r\nagainst the windows of the chaise, seemed to warn the travellers of the\r\nrapid approach of a stormy night. The wind, too, which was directly\r\nagainst them, swept in furious gusts down the narrow road, and howled\r\ndismally through the trees which skirted the pathway. Mr. Pickwick drew\r\nhis coat closer about him, coiled himself more snugly up into the corner\r\nof the chaise, and fell into a sound sleep, from which he was only\r\nawakened by the stopping of the vehicle, the sound of the hostler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbell, and a loud cry of \xe2\x80\x98Horses on directly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut here another delay occurred. The boys were sleeping with such\r\nmysterious soundness, that it took five minutes a-piece to wake them.\r\nThe hostler had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable, and even\r\nwhen that was found, two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the\r\nwrong horses, and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through\r\nafresh. Had Mr. Pickwick been alone, these multiplied obstacles would\r\nhave completely put an end to the pursuit at once, but old Wardle was\r\nnot to be so easily daunted; and he laid about him with such hearty\r\ngood-will, cuffing this man, and pushing that; strapping a buckle here,\r\nand taking in a link there, that the chaise was ready in a much shorter\r\ntime than could reasonably have been expected, under so many\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThey resumed their journey; and certainly the prospect before them was\r\nby no means encouraging. The stage was fifteen miles long, the night was\r\ndark, the wind high, and the rain pouring in torrents. It was impossible\r\nto make any great way against such obstacles united; it was hard upon\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock already; and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to\r\nthe end of the stage. Here, however, an object presented itself, which\r\nrekindled their hopes, and reanimated their drooping spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When did this chaise come in?\xe2\x80\x99 cried old Wardle, leaping out of his own\r\nvehicle, and pointing to one covered with wet mud, which was standing in\r\nthe yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a quarter of an hour ago, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the hostler, to whom the\r\nquestion was addressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lady and gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Wardle, almost breathless with\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tall gentleman--dress-coat--long legs--thin body?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elderly lady--thin face--rather skinny--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By heavens, it\xe2\x80\x99s the couple, Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would have been here before,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hostler, \xe2\x80\x98but they broke a\r\ntrace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis them!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98it is, by Jove! Chaise-and-four instantly! We\r\nshall catch them yet before they reach the next stage. A guinea a-piece,\r\nboys-be alive there--bustle about--there\xe2\x80\x99s good fellows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd with such admonitions as these, the old gentleman ran up and down\r\nthe yard, and bustled to and fro, in a state of excitement which\r\ncommunicated itself to Mr. Pickwick also; and under the influence of\r\nwhich, that gentleman got himself into complicated entanglements with\r\nharness, and mixed up with horses and wheels of chaises, in the most\r\nsurprising manner, firmly believing that by so doing he was materially\r\nforwarding the preparations for their resuming their journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jump in--jump in!\xe2\x80\x99 cried old Wardle, climbing into the chaise, pulling\r\nup the steps, and slamming the door after him. \xe2\x80\x98Come along! Make haste!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd before Mr. Pickwick knew precisely what he was about, he felt\r\nhimself forced in at the other door, by one pull from the old gentleman\r\nand one push from the hostler; and off they were again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! we are moving now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman exultingly. They were\r\nindeed, as was sufficiently testified to Mr. Pickwick, by his constant\r\ncollision either with the hard wood-work of the chaise, or the body of\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold up!\xe2\x80\x99 said the stout old Mr. Wardle, as Mr. Pickwick dived head\r\nforemost into his capacious waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never did feel such a jolting in my life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his companion, \xe2\x80\x98it will soon be over. Steady,\r\nsteady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick planted himself into his own corner, as firmly as he could;\r\nand on whirled the chaise faster than ever.\r\n\r\nThey had travelled in this way about three miles, when Mr. Wardle, who\r\nhad been looking out of the Window for two or three minutes, suddenly\r\ndrew in his face, covered with splashes, and exclaimed in breathless\r\neagerness--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here they are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick thrust his head out of his window. Yes: there was a chaise-\r\nand-four, a short distance before them, dashing along at full gallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on, go on,\xe2\x80\x99 almost shrieked the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Two guineas a-piece,\r\nboys--don\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x98em gain on us--keep it up--keep it up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed; and\r\nthose in Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s galloped furiously behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see his head,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the choleric old man; \xe2\x80\x98damme, I see his\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So do I\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s he.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was not mistaken. The countenance of Mr. Jingle, completely\r\ncoated with mud thrown up by the wheels, was plainly discernible at the\r\nwindow of his chaise; and the motion of his arm, which was waving\r\nviolently towards the postillions, denoted that he was encouraging them\r\nto increased exertion.\r\n\r\nThe interest was intense. Fields, trees, and hedges, seemed to rush past\r\nthem with the velocity of a whirlwind, so rapid was the pace at which\r\nthey tore along. They were close by the side of the first chaise.\r\nJingle\xe2\x80\x99s voice could be plainly heard, even above the din of the wheels,\r\nurging on the boys. Old Mr. Wardle foamed with rage and excitement. He\r\nroared out scoundrels and villains by the dozen, clenched his fist and\r\nshook it expressively at the object of his indignation; but Mr. Jingle\r\nonly answered with a contemptuous smile, and replied to his menaces by a\r\nshout of triumph, as his horses, answering the increased application of\r\nwhip and spur, broke into a faster gallop, and left the pursuers behind.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had just drawn in his head, and Mr. Wardle, exhausted with\r\nshouting, had done the same, when a tremendous jolt threw them forward\r\nagainst the front of the vehicle. There was a sudden bump--a loud crash-\r\n-away rolled a wheel, and over went the chaise.\r\n\r\nAfter a very few seconds of bewilderment and confusion, in which nothing\r\nbut the plunging of horses, and breaking of glass could be made out, Mr.\r\nPickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the\r\nchaise; and as soon as he had gained his feet, extricated his head from\r\nthe skirts of his greatcoat, which materially impeded the usefulness of\r\nhis spectacles, the full disaster of the case met his view.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Wardle without a hat, and his clothes torn in several places,\r\nstood by his side, and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at\r\ntheir feet. The post-boys, who had succeeded in cutting the traces, were\r\nstanding, disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding, by the\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 heads. About a hundred yards in advance was the other chaise,\r\nwhich had pulled up on hearing the crash. The postillions, each with a\r\nbroad grin convulsing his countenance, were viewing the adverse party\r\nfrom their saddles, and Mr. Jingle was contemplating the wreck from the\r\ncoach window, with evident satisfaction. The day was just breaking, and\r\nthe whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the shameless Jingle, \xe2\x80\x98anybody damaged?--elderly\r\ngentlemen--no light weights--dangerous work--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a rascal,\xe2\x80\x99 roared Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jingle; and then he added, with a knowing wink, and a\r\njerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise--\xe2\x80\x98I say--she\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nwell--desires her compliments--begs you won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself--love to\r\n_Tuppy_--won\xe2\x80\x99t you get up behind?--drive on, boys.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe postillions resumed their proper attitudes, and away rattled the\r\nchaise, Mr. Jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the\r\ncoach window.\r\n\r\nNothing in the whole adventure, not even the upset, had disturbed the\r\ncalm and equable current of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s temper. The villainy,\r\nhowever, which could first borrow money of his faithful follower, and\r\nthen abbreviate his name to \xe2\x80\x98Tuppy,\xe2\x80\x99 was more than he could patiently\r\nbear. He drew his breath hard, and coloured up to the very tips of his\r\nspectacles, as he said, slowly and emphatically--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If ever I meet that man again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s all very well; but while we\r\nstand talking here, they\xe2\x80\x99ll get their licence, and be married in\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paused, bottled up his vengeance, and corked it down. \xe2\x80\x98How\r\nfar is it to the next stage?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Wardle, of one of the boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Six mile, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Tom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rayther better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rayther better nor six mile, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98we must walk it, Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No help for it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that truly great man.\r\n\r\nSo sending forward one of the boys on horseback, to procure a fresh\r\nchaise and horses, and leaving the other behind to take care of the\r\nbroken one, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Wardle set manfully forward on the\r\nwalk, first tying their shawls round their necks, and slouching down\r\ntheir hats to escape as much as possible from the deluge of rain, which\r\nafter a slight cessation had again begun to pour heavily down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. CLEARING UP ALL DOUBTS (IF ANY EXISTED) OF THE\r\nDISINTERESTEDNESS OF MR. A. JINGLE\xe2\x80\x99S CHARACTER\r\n\r\nThere are in London several old inns, once the headquarters of\r\ncelebrated coaches in the days when coaches performed their journeys in\r\na graver and more solemn manner than they do in these times; but which\r\nhave now degenerated into little more than the abiding and booking-\r\nplaces of country wagons. The reader would look in vain for any of these\r\nancient hostelries, among the Golden Crosses and Bull and Mouths, which\r\nrear their stately fronts in the improved streets of London. If he would\r\nlight upon any of these old places, he must direct his steps to the\r\nobscurer quarters of the town, and there in some secluded nooks he will\r\nfind several, still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness, amidst\r\nthe modern innovations which surround them.\r\n\r\nIn the Borough especially, there still remain some half-dozen old inns,\r\nwhich have preserved their external features unchanged, and which have\r\nescaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of\r\nprivate speculation. Great, rambling queer old places they are, with\r\ngalleries, and passages, and staircases, wide enough and antiquated\r\nenough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories, supposing we\r\nshould ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any, and\r\nthat the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable\r\nveracious legends connected with old London Bridge, and its adjacent\r\nneighbourhood on the Surrey side.\r\n\r\nIt was in the yard of one of these inns--of no less celebrated a one\r\nthan the White Hart--that a man was busily employed in brushing the dirt\r\noff a pair of boots, early on the morning succeeding the events narrated\r\nin the last chapter. He was habited in a coarse, striped waistcoat, with\r\nblack calico sleeves, and blue glass buttons; drab breeches and\r\nleggings. A bright red handkerchief was wound in a very loose and\r\nunstudied style round his neck, and an old white hat was carelessly\r\nthrown on one side of his head. There were two rows of boots before him,\r\none cleaned and the other dirty, and at every addition he made to the\r\nclean row, he paused from his work, and contemplated its results with\r\nevident satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual\r\ncharacteristics of a large coach inn. Three or four lumbering wagons,\r\neach with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy, about the height of\r\nthe second-floor window of an ordinary house, were stowed away beneath a\r\nlofty roof which extended over one end of the yard; and another, which\r\nwas probably to commence its journey that morning, was drawn out into\r\nthe open space. A double tier of bedroom galleries, with old clumsy\r\nbalustrades, ran round two sides of the straggling area, and a double\r\nrow of bells to correspond, sheltered from the weather by a little\r\nsloping roof, hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee-room. Two\r\nor three gigs and chaise-carts were wheeled up under different little\r\nsheds and pent-houses; and the occasional heavy tread of a cart-horse,\r\nor rattling of a chain at the farther end of the yard, announced to\r\nanybody who cared about the matter, that the stable lay in that\r\ndirection. When we add that a few boys in smock-frocks were lying asleep\r\non heavy packages, wool-packs, and other articles that were scattered\r\nabout on heaps of straw, we have described as fully as need be the\r\ngeneral appearance of the yard of the White Hart Inn, High Street,\r\nBorough, on the particular morning in question.\r\n\r\nA loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a\r\nsmart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery, who, after tapping at\r\none of the doors, and receiving a request from within, called over the\r\nbalustrades--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man with the white hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number twenty-two wants his boots.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask number twenty-two, vether he\xe2\x80\x99ll have \xe2\x80\x98em now, or vait till he gets\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl coaxingly, \xe2\x80\x98the gentleman\r\nwants his boots directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you _are_ a nice young \xe2\x80\x98ooman for a musical party, you are,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe boot-cleaner. \xe2\x80\x98Look at these here boots--eleven pair o\xe2\x80\x99 boots; and\r\none shoe as belongs to number six, with the wooden leg. The eleven boots\r\nis to be called at half-past eight and the shoe at nine. Who\xe2\x80\x99s number\r\ntwenty-two, that\xe2\x80\x99s to put all the others out? No, no; reg\xe2\x80\x99lar rotation,\r\nas Jack Ketch said, ven he tied the men up. Sorry to keep you a-waitin\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nSir, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to you directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaying which, the man in the white hat set to work upon a top-boot with\r\nincreased assiduity.\r\n\r\nThere was another loud ring; and the bustling old landlady of the White\r\nHart made her appearance in the opposite gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the landlady, \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99s that lazy, idle--why, Sam--oh, there\r\nyou are; why don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be gen-teel to answer, till you\xe2\x80\x99d done talking,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam\r\ngruffly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, clean these shoes for number seventeen directly, and take \xe2\x80\x98em to\r\nprivate sitting-room, number five, first floor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe landlady flung a pair of lady\xe2\x80\x99s shoes into the yard, and bustled\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number five,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, as he picked up the shoes, and taking a piece\r\nof chalk from his pocket, made a memorandum of their destination on the\r\nsoles--\xe2\x80\x98Lady\xe2\x80\x99s shoes and private sittin\xe2\x80\x99-room! I suppose she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nin the vagin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She came in early this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the girl, who was still leaning\r\nover the railing of the gallery, \xe2\x80\x98with a gentleman in a hackney-coach,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s him as wants his boots, and you\xe2\x80\x99d better do \xe2\x80\x98em, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with great indignation,\r\nsingling out the boots in question from the heap before him. \xe2\x80\x98For all I\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x99d he was one o\xe2\x80\x99 the regular threepennies. Private room! and a lady\r\ntoo! If he\xe2\x80\x99s anything of a gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, he\xe2\x80\x99s vurth a shillin\xe2\x80\x99 a day, let\r\nalone the arrands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStimulated by this inspiring reflection, Mr. Samuel brushed away with\r\nsuch hearty good-will, that in a few minutes the boots and shoes, with a\r\npolish which would have struck envy to the soul of the amiable Mr.\r\nWarren (for they used Day & Martin at the White Hart), had arrived at\r\nthe door of number five.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in,\xe2\x80\x99 said a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, in reply to Sam\xe2\x80\x99s rap at the door. Sam\r\nmade his best bow, and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman\r\nseated at breakfast. Having officiously deposited the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s boots\r\nright and left at his feet, and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s shoes right and left at hers,\r\nhe backed towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boots,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, closing the door, and keeping his hand on the knob of\r\nthe lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know--what\xe2\x80\x99s a-name--Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Churchyard, Sir; low archway on the carriage side, bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nat one corner, hotel on the other, and two porters in the middle as\r\ntouts for licences.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Touts for licences!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Touts for licences,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Two coves in vhite aprons--touches\r\ntheir hats ven you walk in--\xe2\x80\x9cLicence, Sir, licence?\xe2\x80\x9d Queer sort, them,\r\nand their mas\xe2\x80\x99rs, too, sir--Old Bailey Proctors--and no mistake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do they do?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do!

My father, Sir, wos\r\na coachman. A widower he wos, and fat enough for anything--uncommon fat,\r\nto be sure. His missus dies, and leaves him four hundred pound.

I\r\ndes-say--I never said nothing to her, but she\xe2\x80\x99ll have me, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nlicence was made out, and she _did_ have him, and what\xe2\x80\x99s more she\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nhim now; and I never had any of the four hundred pound, worse luck. Beg\r\nyour pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, when he had concluded, \xe2\x80\x98but wen I gets on\r\nthis here grievance, I runs on like a new barrow with the wheel\r\ngreased.\xe2\x80\x99 Having said which, and having paused for an instant to see\r\nwhether he was wanted for anything more, Sam left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half-past nine--just the time--off at once;\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, whom\r\nwe need hardly introduce as Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Time--for what?\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt coquettishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Licence, dearest of angels--give notice at the church--call you mine,\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x99--said Mr. Jingle, and he squeezed the spinster aunt\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The licence!\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The licence,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Jingle--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In hurry, post-haste for a licence, In hurry, ding dong I come back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How you run on,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Run on--nothing to the hours, days, weeks, months, years, when we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nunited--run on--they\xe2\x80\x99ll fly on--bolt--mizzle--steam-engine--thousand-\r\nhorse power--nothing to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t--can\xe2\x80\x99t we be married before to-morrow morning?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible--can\xe2\x80\x99t be--notice at the church--leave the licence to-day--\r\nceremony come off to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI am so terrified, lest my brother should discover us!\xe2\x80\x99 said Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Discover--nonsense--too much shaken by the break-down--besides--extreme\r\ncaution--gave up the post-chaise--walked on--took a hackney-coach--came\r\nto the Borough--last place in the world that he\xe2\x80\x99d look in--ha! ha!--\r\ncapital notion that--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be long,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster affectionately, as Mr. Jingle stuck\r\nthe pinched-up hat on his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Long away from you?--Cruel charmer,\xe2\x80\x99 and Mr. Jingle skipped playfully\r\nup to the spinster aunt, imprinted a chaste kiss upon her lips, and\r\ndanced out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear man!\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster, as the door closed after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rum old girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle, as he walked down the passage.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to reflect upon the perfidy of our species; and we will\r\nnot, therefore, pursue the thread of Mr. Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s meditations, as he\r\nwended his way to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons. It will be sufficient for our\r\npurpose to relate, that escaping the snares of the dragons in white\r\naprons, who guard the entrance to that enchanted region, he reached the\r\nvicar-general\xe2\x80\x99s office in safety and having procured a highly flattering\r\naddress on parchment, from the Archbishop of Canterbury, to his \xe2\x80\x98trusty\r\nand well-beloved Alfred Jingle and Rachael Wardle, greeting,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncarefully deposited the mystic document in his pocket, and retraced his\r\nsteps in triumph to the Borough.\r\n\r\nHe was yet on his way to the White Hart, when two plump gentleman and\r\none thin one entered the yard, and looked round in search of some\r\nauthorised person of whom they could make a few inquiries. Mr. Samuel\r\nWeller happened to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of\r\npainted tops, the personal property of a farmer who was refreshing\r\nhimself with a slight lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a\r\npot or two of porter, after the fatigues of the Borough market; and to\r\nhim the thin gentleman straightway advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said the thin gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re one o\xe2\x80\x99 the adwice gratis order,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Sam, \xe2\x80\x98or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe so wery fond o\xe2\x80\x99 me all at once.\xe2\x80\x99 But he only said--\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said the thin gentleman, with a conciliatory hem--\xe2\x80\x98have you\r\ngot many people stopping here now? Pretty busy. Eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam stole a look at the inquirer. He was a little high-dried man, with a\r\ndark squeezed-up face, and small, restless, black eyes, that kept\r\nwinking and twinkling on each side of his little inquisitive nose, as if\r\nthey were playing a perpetual game of peep-bo with that feature. He was\r\ndressed all in black, with boots as shiny as his eyes, a low white\r\nneckcloth, and a clean shirt with a frill to it. A gold watch-chain, and\r\nseals, depended from his fob. He carried his black kid gloves _in_ his\r\nhands, and not ON them; and as he spoke, thrust his wrists beneath his\r\ncoat tails, with the air of a man who was in the habit of propounding\r\nsome regular posers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty busy, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, wery well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98we shan\xe2\x80\x99t be bankrupts, and we\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t make our fort\xe2\x80\x99ns. We eats our biled mutton without capers, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care for horse-radish ven ve can get beef.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a wag, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My eldest brother was troubled with that complaint,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98it may\r\nbe catching--I used to sleep with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a curious old house of yours,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, looking\r\nround him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99d sent word you was a-coming, we\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 had it repaired;\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nthe imperturbable Sam.\r\n\r\nThe little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses, and a\r\nshort consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen.\r\nAt its conclusion, the little man took a pinch of snuff from an oblong\r\nsilver box, and was apparently on the point of renewing the\r\nconversation, when one of the plump gentlemen, who in addition to a\r\nbenevolent countenance, possessed a pair of spectacles, and a pair of\r\nblack gaiters, interfered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact of the matter is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the benevolent gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98that my\r\nfriend here (pointing to the other plump gentleman) will give you half a\r\nguinea, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll answer one or two--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my dear sir--my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, \xe2\x80\x98pray, allow me--\r\nmy dear Sir, the very first principle to be observed in these cases, is\r\nthis: if you place the matter in the hands of a professional man, you\r\nmust in no way interfere in the progress of the business; you must\r\nrepose implicit confidence in him. Really, Mr.--\xe2\x80\x99 He turned to the other\r\nplump gentleman, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I forget your friend\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle, for it was no other than that jolly\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Pickwick--really Mr. Pickwick, my dear Sir, excuse me--I shall be\r\nhappy to receive any private suggestions of yours, as AMICUS CURIAE, but\r\nyou must see the impropriety of your interfering with my conduct in this\r\ncase, with such an AD CAPTANDUM argument as the offer of half a guinea.\r\nReally, my dear Sir, really;\xe2\x80\x99 and the little man took an argumentative\r\npinch of snuff, and looked very profound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My only wish, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98was to bring this very\r\nunpleasant matter to as speedy a close as possible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite right--quite right,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With which view,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I made use of the argument\r\nwhich my experience of men has taught me is the most likely to succeed\r\nin any case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, \xe2\x80\x98very good, very good, indeed; but you\r\nshould have suggested it to me. My dear sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite certain you\r\ncannot be ignorant of the extent of confidence which must be placed in\r\nprofessional men. If any authority can be necessary on such a point, my\r\ndear sir, let me refer you to the well-known case in Barnwell and--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind George Barnwell,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Sam, who had remained a\r\nwondering listener during this short colloquy; \xe2\x80\x98everybody knows what\r\nsort of a case his was, tho\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s always been my opinion, mind you, that\r\nthe young \xe2\x80\x98ooman deserved scragging a precious sight more than he did.\r\nHows\xe2\x80\x99ever, that\xe2\x80\x99s neither here nor there. You want me to accept of half\r\na guinea. Wery well, I\xe2\x80\x99m agreeable: I can\xe2\x80\x99t say no fairer than that, can\r\nI, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 (Mr. Pickwick smiled.) Then the next question is, what the\r\ndevil do you want with me, as the man said, wen he see the ghost?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We want to know--\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my dear sir--my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the busy little man.\r\n\r\nMr. Wardle shrugged his shoulders, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We want to know,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man solemnly; \xe2\x80\x98and we ask the\r\nquestion of you, in order that we may not awaken apprehensions inside--\r\nwe want to know who you\xe2\x80\x99ve got in this house at present?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who there is in the house!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, in whose mind the inmates were\r\nalways represented by that particular article of their costume, which\r\ncame under his immediate superintendence. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a vooden leg in\r\nnumber six; there\xe2\x80\x99s a pair of Hessians in thirteen; there\xe2\x80\x99s two pair of\r\nhalves in the commercial; there\xe2\x80\x99s these here painted tops in the\r\nsnuggery inside the bar; and five more tops in the coffee-room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing more?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a bit,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, suddenly recollecting himself. \xe2\x80\x98Yes; there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na pair of Vellingtons a good deal worn, and a pair o\xe2\x80\x99 lady\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, in\r\nnumber five.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of shoes?\xe2\x80\x99 hastily inquired Wardle, who, together with Mr.\r\nPickwick, had been lost in bewilderment at the singular catalogue of\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Country make,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any maker\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Muggleton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is them,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98By heavens, we\xe2\x80\x99ve found them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98The Vellingtons has gone to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, for a licence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re in time,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Show us the room; not a moment is to\r\nbe lost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, my dear sir--pray,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man; \xe2\x80\x98caution, caution.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\ndrew from his pocket a red silk purse, and looked very hard at Sam as he\r\ndrew out a sovereign.\r\n\r\nSam grinned expressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show us into the room at once, without announcing us,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam threw the painted tops into a corner, and led the way through a dark\r\npassage, and up a wide staircase. He paused at the end of a second\r\npassage, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here it is,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the attorney, as he deposited the money on the\r\nhand of their guide.\r\n\r\nThe man stepped forward for a few paces, followed by the two friends and\r\ntheir legal adviser. He stopped at a door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this the room?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the little gentleman.\r\n\r\nSam nodded assent.\r\n\r\nOld Wardle opened the door; and the whole three walked into the room\r\njust as Mr. Jingle, who had that moment returned, had produced the\r\nlicence to the spinster aunt.\r\n\r\nThe spinster uttered a loud shriek, and throwing herself into a chair,\r\ncovered her face with her hands. Mr. Jingle crumpled up the licence, and\r\nthrust it into his coat pocket. The unwelcome visitors advanced into the\r\nmiddle of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--you are a nice rascal, arn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Wardle, breathless\r\nwith passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, laying his hat on the\r\ntable, \xe2\x80\x98pray, consider--pray. Defamation of character: action for\r\ndamages. Calm yourself, my dear sir, pray--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dare you drag my sister from my house?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man.\r\n\r\nAy--ay--very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98you may ask that. How\r\ndare you, sir?--eh, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who the devil are you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Jingle, in so fierce a tone, that\r\nthe little gentleman involuntarily fell back a step or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is he, you scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s my lawyer, Mr.\r\nPerker, of Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. Perker, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have this fellow prosecuted--\r\nindicted--I\xe2\x80\x99ll--I\xe2\x80\x99ll--I\xe2\x80\x99ll ruin him. And you,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Wardle,\r\nturning abruptly round to his sister--\xe2\x80\x98you, Rachael, at a time of life\r\nwhen you ought to know better, what do you mean by running away with a\r\nvagabond, disgracing your family, and making yourself miserable? Get on\r\nyour bonnet and come back. Call a hackney-coach there, directly, and\r\nbring this lady\xe2\x80\x99s bill, d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear--d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCert\xe2\x80\x99nly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, who had answered Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s violent ringing\r\nof the bell with a degree of celerity which must have appeared\r\nmarvellous to anybody who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that his eye had been applied to\r\nthe outside of the keyhole during the whole interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get on your bonnet,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do nothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98Leave the room, Sir--no business\r\nhere--lady\xe2\x80\x99s free to act as she pleases--more than one-and-twenty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More than one-and-twenty!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Wardle contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x98More than\r\none-and-forty!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spinster aunt, her indignation getting the better of\r\nher determination to faint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re fifty if you\xe2\x80\x99re an hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the spinster aunt uttered a loud shriek, and became senseless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A glass of water,\xe2\x80\x99 said the humane Mr. Pickwick, summoning the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A glass of water!\xe2\x80\x99 said the passionate Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Bring a bucket, and\r\nthrow it all over her; it\xe2\x80\x99ll do her good, and she richly deserves it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ugh, you brute!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated the kind-hearted landlady. \xe2\x80\x98Poor dear.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nwith sundry ejaculations of \xe2\x80\x98Come now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear--drink a little of\r\nthis--it\xe2\x80\x99ll do you good--don\xe2\x80\x99t give way so--there\xe2\x80\x99s a love,\xe2\x80\x99 etc. etc.,\r\nthe landlady, assisted by a chambermaid, proceeded to vinegar the\r\nforehead, beat the hands, titillate the nose, and unlace the stays of\r\nthe spinster aunt, and to administer such other restoratives as are\r\nusually applied by compassionate females to ladies who are endeavouring\r\nto ferment themselves into hysterics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coach is ready, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, appearing at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come along,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry her downstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this proposition, the hysterics came on with redoubled violence.\r\n\r\nThe landlady was about to enter a very violent protest against this\r\nproceeding, and had already given vent to an indignant inquiry whether\r\nMr. Wardle considered himself a lord of the creation, when Mr. Jingle\r\ninterposed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boots,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98get me an officer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, stay,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mr. Perker. \xe2\x80\x98Consider, Sir, consider.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll not consider,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s her own mistress--see who\r\ndares to take her away--unless she wishes it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ be taken away,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the spinster aunt. \xe2\x80\x98I _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ wish\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 (Here there was a frightful relapse.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, in a low tone, taking Mr. Wardle and\r\nMr. Pickwick apart--\xe2\x80\x98my dear Sir, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a very awkward situation.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a distressing case--very; I never knew one more so; but really, my\r\ndear sir, really we have no power to control this lady\xe2\x80\x99s actions. I\r\nwarned you before we came, my dear sir, that there was nothing to look\r\nto but a compromise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What kind of compromise would you recommend?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, my dear Sir, our friend\xe2\x80\x99s in an unpleasant position--very much so.\r\nWe must be content to suffer some pecuniary loss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll suffer any, rather than submit to this disgrace, and let her, fool\r\nas she is, be made miserable for life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rather think it can be done,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bustling little man. \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nJingle, will you step with us into the next room for a moment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jingle assented, and the quartette walked into an empty apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, as he carefully closed the door, \xe2\x80\x98is\r\nthere no way of accommodating this matter--step this way, sir, for a\r\nmoment--into this window, Sir, where we can be alone--there, sir, there,\r\npray sit down, sir. Now, my dear Sir, between you and I, we know very\r\nwell, my dear Sir, that you have run off with this lady for the sake of\r\nher money. Don\xe2\x80\x99t frown, Sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t frown; I say, between you and I, _we_\r\nknow it. We are both men of the world, and WE know very well that our\r\nfriends here, are not--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s face gradually relaxed; and something distantly resembling\r\na wink quivered for an instant in his left eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, observing the impression he\r\nhad made. \xe2\x80\x98Now, the fact is, that beyond a few hundreds, the lady has\r\nlittle or nothing till the death of her mother--fine old lady, my dear\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Old_,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle briefly but emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the attorney, with a slight cough. \xe2\x80\x98You are right, my\r\ndear Sir, she is rather old. She comes of an old family though, my dear\r\nSir; old in every sense of the word. The founder of that family came\r\ninto Kent when Julius Caesar invaded Britain;--only one member of it,\r\nsince, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lived to eighty-five, and he was beheaded by one of\r\nthe Henrys. The old lady is not seventy-three now, my dear Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nlittle man paused, and took a pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear sir--you don\xe2\x80\x99t take snuff!--ah! so much the better--\r\nexpensive habit--well, my dear Sir, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fine young man, man of the\r\nworld--able to push your fortune, if you had capital, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you comprehend me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not quite.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think--now, my dear Sir, I put it to you don\xe2\x80\x99t you think--\r\nthat fifty pounds and liberty would be better than Miss Wardle and\r\nexpectation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t do--not half enough!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated the little attorney, seizing him\r\nby the button. \xe2\x80\x98Good round sum--a man like you could treble it in no\r\ntime--great deal to be done with fifty pounds, my dear Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More to be done with a hundred and fifty,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Jingle coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear Sir, we won\xe2\x80\x99t waste time in splitting straws,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed\r\nthe little man, \xe2\x80\x98say--say--seventy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go away, my dear sir--pray don\xe2\x80\x99t hurry,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eighty; come: I\xe2\x80\x99ll write you a cheque at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear Sir, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, still detaining him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98just tell me what _will_ do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Expensive affair,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98Money out of pocket--posting, nine\r\npounds; licence, three--that\xe2\x80\x99s twelve--compensation, a hundred--hundred\r\nand twelve--breach of honour--and loss of the lady--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear Sir, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, with a knowing look,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98never mind the last two items. That\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred and twelve--say a\r\nhundred--come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And twenty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, I\xe2\x80\x99ll write you a cheque,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man; and down he\r\nsat at the table for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it payable the day after to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man,\r\nwith a look towards Mr. Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98and we can get the lady away,\r\nmeanwhile.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Wardle sullenly nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A hundred,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And twenty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give it him,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98and let him go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cheque was written by the little gentleman, and pocketed by Mr.\r\nJingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, leave this house instantly!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98that nothing should have induced me to\r\nmake this compromise--not even a regard for my family--if I had not\r\nknown that the moment you got any money in that pocket of yours, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngo to the devil faster, if possible, than you would without it--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the little man again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be quiet, Perker,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Leave the room, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Off directly,\xe2\x80\x99 said the unabashed Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98Bye bye, Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf any dispassionate spectator could have beheld the countenance of the\r\nillustrious man, whose name forms the leading feature of the title of\r\nthis work, during the latter part of this conversation, he would have\r\nbeen almost induced to wonder that the indignant fire which flashed from\r\nhis eyes did not melt the glasses of his spectacles--so majestic was his\r\nwrath. His nostrils dilated, and his fists clenched involuntarily, as he\r\nheard himself addressed by the villain. But he restrained himself again-\r\n-he did not pulverise him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the hardened traitor, tossing the licence at Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s feet; \xe2\x80\x98get the name altered--take home the lady--do for\r\nTuppy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was a philosopher, but philosophers are only men in armour,\r\nafter all. The shaft had reached him, penetrated through his\r\nphilosophical harness, to his very heart. In the frenzy of his rage, he\r\nhurled the inkstand madly forward, and followed it up himself. But Mr.\r\nJingle had disappeared, and he found himself caught in the arms of Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo,\xe2\x80\x99 said that eccentric functionary, \xe2\x80\x98furniter\xe2\x80\x99s cheap where you\r\ncome from, Sir. Self-acting ink, that \xe2\x80\x98ere; it\xe2\x80\x99s wrote your mark upon\r\nthe wall, old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n. Hold still, Sir; wot\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 runnin\xe2\x80\x99 arter\r\na man as has made his lucky, and got to t\xe2\x80\x99other end of the Borough by\r\nthis time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s mind, like those of all truly great men, was open to\r\nconviction. He was a quick and powerful reasoner; and a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreflection sufficed to remind him of the impotency of his rage. It\r\nsubsided as quickly as it had been roused. He panted for breath, and\r\nlooked benignantly round upon his friends.\r\n\r\nShall we tell the lamentations that ensued when Miss Wardle found\r\nherself deserted by the faithless Jingle? Shall we extract Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s masterly description of that heartrending scene? His note-\r\nbook, blotted with the tears of sympathising humanity, lies open before\r\nus; one word, and it is in the printer\xe2\x80\x99s hands. But, no! we will be\r\nresolute! We will not wring the public bosom, with the delineation of\r\nsuch suffering!\r\n\r\nSlowly and sadly did the two friends and the deserted lady return next\r\nday in the Muggleton heavy coach. Dimly and darkly had the sombre\r\nshadows of a summer\xe2\x80\x99s night fallen upon all around, when they again\r\nreached Dingley Dell, and stood within the entrance to Manor Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. INVOLVING ANOTHER JOURNEY, AND AN ANTIQUARIAN DISCOVERY;\r\nRECORDING MR. PICKWICK\xe2\x80\x99S DETERMINATION TO BE PRESENT AT AN ELECTION; AND\r\nCONTAINING A MANUSCRIPT OF THE OLD CLERGYMAN\xe2\x80\x99S\r\n\r\nA night of quiet and repose in the profound silence of Dingley Dell, and\r\nan hour\xe2\x80\x99s breathing of its fresh and fragrant air on the ensuing\r\nmorning, completely recovered Mr. Pickwick from the effects of his late\r\nfatigue of body and anxiety of mind. That illustrious man had been\r\nseparated from his friends and followers for two whole days; and it was\r\nwith a degree of pleasure and delight, which no common imagination can\r\nadequately conceive, that he stepped forward to greet Mr. Winkle and Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, as he encountered those gentlemen on his return from his\r\nearly walk. The pleasure was mutual; for who could ever gaze on Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s beaming face without experiencing the sensation? But still a\r\ncloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not\r\nbut be sensible of, and was wholly at a loss to account for. There was a\r\nmysterious air about them both, as unusual as it was alarming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, when he had grasped his followers by the\r\nhand, and exchanged warm salutations of welcome--\xe2\x80\x98how is Tupman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed, made no\r\nreply. He turned away his head, and appeared absorbed in melancholy\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Snodgrass,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick earnestly, \xe2\x80\x98how is our friend--he is not\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass; and a tear trembled on his sentimental\r\neyelid, like a rain-drop on a window-frame--\xe2\x80\x98no; he is not ill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick stopped, and gazed on each of his friends in turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winkle--Snodgrass,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98what does this mean? Where is\r\nour friend? What has happened? Speak--I conjure, I entreat--nay, I\r\ncommand you, speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a solemnity--a dignity--in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s manner, not to be\r\nwithstood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is gone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Gone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We can only guess, from that communication,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Snodgrass,\r\ntaking a letter from his pocket, and placing it in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yesterday morning, when a letter was received from Mr. Wardle, stating\r\nthat you would be home with his sister at night, the melancholy which\r\nhad hung over our friend during the whole of the previous day, was\r\nobserved to increase. He shortly afterwards disappeared: he was missing\r\nduring the whole day, and in the evening this letter was brought by the\r\nhostler from the Crown, at Muggleton. It had been left in his charge in\r\nthe morning, with a strict injunction that it should not be delivered\r\nuntil night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick opened the epistle. It was in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand-writing,\r\nand these were its contents:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR PICKWICK,--_You_, my dear friend, are placed far beyond the\r\nreach of many mortal frailties and weaknesses which ordinary people\r\ncannot overcome. You do not know what it is, at one blow, to be deserted\r\nby a lovely and fascinating creature, and to fall a victim to the\r\nartifices of a villain, who had the grin of cunning beneath the mask of\r\nfriendship. I hope you never may.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any letter addressed to me at the Leather Bottle, Cobham, Kent, will be\r\nforwarded--supposing I still exist. I hasten from the sight of that\r\nworld, which has become odious to me. Should I hasten from it\r\naltogether, pity--forgive me. Life, my dear Pickwick, has become\r\ninsupportable to me. The spirit which burns within us, is a porter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknot, on which to rest the heavy load of worldly cares and troubles; and\r\nwhen that spirit fails us, the burden is too heavy to be borne. We sink\r\nbeneath it. You may tell Rachael--Ah, that name!--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98TRACY TUPMAN.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must leave this place directly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as he refolded\r\nthe note. \xe2\x80\x98It would not have been decent for us to remain here, under\r\nany circumstances, after what has happened; and now we are bound to\r\nfollow in search of our friend.\xe2\x80\x99 And so saying, he led the way to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHis intention was rapidly communicated. The entreaties to remain were\r\npressing, but Mr. Pickwick was inflexible. Business, he said, required\r\nhis immediate attendance.\r\n\r\nThe old clergyman was present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not really going?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, taking Mr. Pickwick aside.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick reiterated his former determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98is a little manuscript, which I\r\nhad hoped to have the pleasure of reading to you myself. I found it on\r\nthe death of a friend of mine--a medical man, engaged in our county\r\nlunatic asylum--among a variety of papers, which I had the option of\r\ndestroying or preserving, as I thought proper. I can hardly believe that\r\nthe manuscript is genuine, though it certainly is not in my friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. However, whether it be the genuine production of a maniac, or\r\nfounded upon the ravings of some unhappy being (which I think more\r\nprobable), read it, and judge for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick received the manuscript, and parted from the benevolent old\r\ngentleman with many expressions of good-will and esteem.\r\n\r\nIt was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of Manor Farm,\r\nfrom whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness. Mr.\r\nPickwick kissed the young ladies--we were going to say, as if they were\r\nhis own daughters, only, as he might possibly have infused a little more\r\nwarmth into the salutation, the comparison would not be quite\r\nappropriate--hugged the old lady with filial cordiality; and patted the\r\nrosy cheeks of the female servants in a most patriarchal manner, as he\r\nslipped into the hands of each some more substantial expression of his\r\napproval. The exchange of cordialities with their fine old host and Mr.\r\nTrundle was even more hearty and prolonged; and it was not until Mr.\r\nSnodgrass had been several times called for, and at last emerged from a\r\ndark passage followed soon after by Emily (whose bright eyes looked\r\nunusually dim), that the three friends were enabled to tear themselves\r\nfrom their friendly entertainers. Many a backward look they gave at the\r\nfarm, as they walked slowly away; and many a kiss did Mr. Snodgrass waft\r\nin the air, in acknowledgment of something very like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandkerchief, which was waved from one of the upper windows, until a\r\nturn of the lane hid the old house from their sight.\r\n\r\nAt Muggleton they procured a conveyance to Rochester. By the time they\r\nreached the last-named place, the violence of their grief had\r\nsufficiently abated to admit of their making a very excellent early\r\ndinner; and having procured the necessary information relative to the\r\nroad, the three friends set forward again in the afternoon to walk to\r\nCobham.\r\n\r\nA delightful walk it was; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June, and\r\ntheir way lay through a deep and shady wood, cooled by the light wind\r\nwhich gently rustled the thick foliage, and enlivened by the songs of\r\nthe birds that perched upon the boughs. The ivy and the moss crept in\r\nthick clusters over the old trees, and the soft green turf overspread\r\nthe ground like a silken mat. They emerged upon an open park, with an\r\nancient hall, displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s time. Long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on\r\nevery side; large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass; and\r\noccasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground, with the speed of\r\nthe shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny\r\nlandscape like a passing breath of summer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him--\xe2\x80\x98if this were the place\r\nto which all who are troubled with our friend\xe2\x80\x99s complaint came, I fancy\r\ntheir old attachment to this world would very soon return.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And really,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick, after half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s walking had\r\nbrought them to the village, \xe2\x80\x98really, for a misanthrope\xe2\x80\x99s choice, this\r\nis one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I ever\r\nmet with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn this opinion also, both Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass expressed their\r\nconcurrence; and having been directed to the Leather Bottle, a clean and\r\ncommodious village ale-house, the three travellers entered, and at once\r\ninquired for a gentleman of the name of Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show the gentlemen into the parlour, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said the landlady.\r\n\r\nA stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage, and the\r\nthree friends entered a long, low-roofed room, furnished with a large\r\nnumber of high-backed leather-cushioned chairs, of fantastic shapes, and\r\nembellished with a great variety of old portraits and roughly-coloured\r\nprints of some antiquity. At the upper end of the room was a table, with\r\na white cloth upon it, well covered with a roast fowl, bacon, ale, and\r\net ceteras; and at the table sat Mr. Tupman, looking as unlike a man who\r\nhad taken his leave of the world, as possible.\r\n\r\nOn the entrance of his friends, that gentleman laid down his knife and\r\nfork, and with a mournful air advanced to meet them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not expect to see you here,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as he grasped Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, sitting down, and wiping from his forehead the\r\nperspiration which the walk had engendered. \xe2\x80\x98Finish your dinner, and\r\nwalk out with me. I wish to speak to you alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman did as he was desired; and Mr. Pickwick having refreshed\r\nhimself with a copious draught of ale, waited his friend\xe2\x80\x99s leisure. The\r\ndinner was quickly despatched, and they walked out together.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour, their forms might have been seen pacing the churchyard\r\nto and fro, while Mr. Pickwick was engaged in combating his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution. Any repetition of his arguments would be useless; for what\r\nlanguage could convey to them that energy and force which their great\r\noriginator\xe2\x80\x99s manner communicated? Whether Mr. Tupman was already tired\r\nof retirement, or whether he was wholly unable to resist the eloquent\r\nappeal which was made to him, matters not, he did _not _ resist it at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It mattered little to him,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98where he dragged out the\r\nmiserable remainder of his days; and since his friend laid so much\r\nstress upon his humble companionship, he was willing to share his\r\nadventures.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick smiled; they shook hands, and walked back to rejoin their\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Mr. Pickwick made that immortal discovery,\r\nwhich has been the pride and boast of his friends, and the envy of every\r\nantiquarian in this or any other country. They had passed the door of\r\ntheir inn, and walked a little way down the village, before they\r\nrecollected the precise spot in which it stood. As they turned back, Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s eye fell upon a small broken stone, partially buried in the\r\nground, in front of a cottage door. He paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is very strange,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is strange?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman, staring eagerly at every object\r\nnear him, but the right one. \xe2\x80\x98God bless me, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment, occasioned\r\nby seeing Mr. Pickwick, in his enthusiasm for discovery, fall on his\r\nknees before the little stone, and commence wiping the dust off it with\r\nhis pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is an inscription here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can discern,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, rubbing away with all his\r\nmight, and gazing intently through his spectacles--\xe2\x80\x98I can discern a\r\ncross, and a 13, and then a T. This is important,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr.\r\nPickwick, starting up. \xe2\x80\x98This is some very old inscription, existing\r\nperhaps long before the ancient alms-houses in this place. It must not\r\nbe lost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe tapped at the cottage door. A labouring man opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know how this stone came here, my friend?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the\r\nbenevolent Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I doan\xe2\x80\x99t, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man civilly. \xe2\x80\x98It was here long afore I\r\nwas born, or any on us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--you--are not particularly attached to it, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, trembling with anxiety. \xe2\x80\x98You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind selling it, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! but who\xe2\x80\x99d buy it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the man, with an expression of face\r\nwhich he probably meant to be very cunning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you ten shillings for it, at once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nyou would take it up for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the village may be easily imagined, when (the little\r\nstone having been raised with one wrench of a spade) Mr. Pickwick, by\r\ndint of great personal exertion, bore it with his own hands to the inn,\r\nand after having carefully washed it, deposited it on the table.\r\n\r\nThe exultation and joy of the Pickwickians knew no bounds, when their\r\npatience and assiduity, their washing and scraping, were crowned with\r\nsuccess. The stone was uneven and broken, and the letters were\r\nstraggling and irregular, but the following fragment of an inscription\r\nwas clearly to be deciphered:--\r\n\r\n\r\n[cross]  B I L S T U M P S H I S. M. ARK\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled with delight, as he sat and gloated over\r\nthe treasure he had discovered. He had attained one of the greatest\r\nobjects of his ambition. In a county known to abound in the remains of\r\nthe early ages; in a village in which there still existed some memorials\r\nof the olden time, he--he, the chairman of the Pickwick Club--had\r\ndiscovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable\r\nantiquity, which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned\r\nmen who had preceded him. He could hardly trust the evidence of his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This--this,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98determines me. We return to town to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-morrow!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed his admiring followers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98This treasure must be at once deposited\r\nwhere it can be thoroughly investigated and properly understood. I have\r\nanother reason for this step. In a few days, an election is to take\r\nplace for the borough of Eatanswill, at which Mr. Perker, a gentleman\r\nwhom I lately met, is the agent of one of the candidates. We will\r\nbehold, and minutely examine, a scene so interesting to every\r\nEnglishman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will,\xe2\x80\x99 was the animated cry of three voices.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick looked round him. The attachment and fervour of his\r\nfollowers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him. He was their\r\nleader, and he felt it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\nThis proposition, like the other, was received with unanimous applause.\r\nHaving himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box,\r\npurchased from the landlady for the purpose, he placed himself in an\r\narm-chair, at the head of the table; and the evening was devoted to\r\nfestivity and conversation.\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock--a late hour for the little village of\r\nCobham--when Mr. Pickwick retired to the bedroom which had been prepared\r\nfor his reception. He threw open the lattice window, and setting his\r\nlight upon the table, fell into a train of meditation on the hurried\r\nevents of the two preceding days.\r\n\r\nThe hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation; Mr.\r\nPickwick was roused by the church clock striking twelve. The first\r\nstroke of the hour sounded solemnly in his ear, but when the bell ceased\r\nthe stillness seemed insupportable--he almost felt as if he had lost a\r\ncompanion. He was nervous and excited; and hastily undressing himself\r\nand placing his light in the chimney, got into bed.\r\n\r\nEvery one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind, in which a\r\nsensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against an inability to\r\nsleep. It was Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s condition at this moment: he tossed first\r\non one side and then on the other; and perseveringly closed his eyes as\r\nif to coax himself to slumber. It was of no use. Whether it was the\r\nunwonted exertion he had undergone, or the heat, or the brandy-and-\r\nwater, or the strange bed--whatever it was, his thoughts kept reverting\r\nvery uncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs, and the old stories\r\nto which they had given rise in the course of the evening. After half an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s tumbling about, he came to the unsatisfactory conclusion, that it\r\nwas of no use trying to sleep; so he got up and partially dressed\r\nhimself. Anything, he thought, was better than lying there fancying all\r\nkinds of horrors. He looked out of the window--it was very dark. He\r\nwalked about the room--it was very lonely.\r\n\r\nHe had taken a few turns from the door to the window, and from the\r\nwindow to the door, when the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript for the first time\r\nentered his head. It was a good thought. If it failed to interest him,\r\nit might send him to sleep. He took it from his coat pocket, and drawing\r\na small table towards his bedside, trimmed the light, put on his\r\nspectacles, and composed himself to read. It was a strange handwriting,\r\nand the paper was much soiled and blotted. The title gave him a sudden\r\nstart, too; and he could not avoid casting a wistful glance round the\r\nroom. Reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings,\r\nhowever, he trimmed the light again, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nA MADMAN\xe2\x80\x99S MANUSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes!--a madman\xe2\x80\x99s! How that word would have struck to my heart, many\r\nyears ago! How it would have roused the terror that used to come upon me\r\nsometimes, sending the blood hissing and tingling through my veins, till\r\nthe cold dew of fear stood in large drops upon my skin, and my knees\r\nknocked together with fright! I like it now though. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fine name.\r\nShow me the monarch whose angry frown was ever feared like the glare of\r\na madman\xe2\x80\x99s eye--whose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngripe. Ho! ho! It\xe2\x80\x99s a grand thing to be mad! to be peeped at like a wild\r\nlion through the iron bars--to gnash one\xe2\x80\x99s teeth and howl, through the\r\nlong still night, to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and\r\ntwine among the straw, transported with such brave music. Hurrah for the\r\nmadhouse! Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a rare place!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember days when I was afraid of being mad; when I used to start\r\nfrom my sleep, and fall upon my knees, and pray to be spared from the\r\ncurse of my race; when I rushed from the sight of merriment or\r\nhappiness, to hide myself in some lonely place, and spend the weary\r\nhours in watching the progress of the fever that was to consume my\r\nbrain. I knew that madness was mixed up with my very blood, and the\r\nmarrow of my bones! that one generation had passed away without the\r\npestilence appearing among them, and that I was the first in whom it\r\nwould revive. I knew it must be so: that so it always had been, and so\r\nit ever would be: and when I cowered in some obscure corner of a crowded\r\nroom, and saw men whisper, and point, and turn their eyes towards me, I\r\nknew they were telling each other of the doomed madman; and I slunk away\r\nagain to mope in solitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did this for years; long, long years they were. The nights here are\r\nlong sometimes--very long; but they are nothing to the restless nights,\r\nand dreadful dreams I had at that time. It makes me cold to remember\r\nthem. Large dusky forms with sly and jeering faces crouched in the\r\ncorners of the room, and bent over my bed at night, tempting me to\r\nmadness. They told me in low whispers, that the floor of the old house\r\nin which my father died, was stained with his own blood, shed by his own\r\nhand in raging madness. I drove my fingers into my ears, but they\r\nscreamed into my head till the room rang with it, that in one generation\r\nbefore him the madness slumbered, but that his grandfather had lived for\r\nyears with his hands fettered to the ground, to prevent his tearing\r\nhimself to pieces. I knew they told the truth--I knew it well. I had\r\nfound it out years before, though they had tried to keep it from me. Ha!\r\nha! I was too cunning for them, madman as they thought me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At last it came upon me, and I wondered how I could ever have feared\r\nit. I could go into the world now, and laugh and shout with the best\r\namong them. I knew I was mad, but they did not even suspect it. How I\r\nused to hug myself with delight, when I thought of the fine trick I was\r\nplaying them after their old pointing and leering, when I was not mad,\r\nbut only dreading that I might one day become so! And how I used to\r\nlaugh for joy, when I was alone, and thought how well I kept my secret,\r\nand how quickly my kind friends would have fallen from me, if they had\r\nknown the truth. I could have screamed with ecstasy when I dined alone\r\nwith some fine roaring fellow, to think how pale he would have turned,\r\nand how fast he would have run, if he had known that the dear friend who\r\nsat close to him, sharpening a bright, glittering knife, was a madman\r\nwith all the power, and half the will, to plunge it in his heart. Oh, it\r\nwas a merry life!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Riches became mine, wealth poured in upon me, and I rioted in pleasures\r\nenhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousness of my well-kept\r\nsecret. I inherited an estate. The law--the eagle-eyed law itself--had\r\nbeen deceived, and had handed over disputed thousands to a madman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. Where was the wit of the sharp-sighted men of sound mind? Where\r\nthe dexterity of the lawyers, eager to discover a flaw? The madman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncunning had overreached them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had money. How I was courted! I spent it profusely. How I was\r\npraised! How those three proud, overbearing brothers humbled themselves\r\nbefore me! The old, white-headed father, too--such deference--such\r\nrespect--such devoted friendship--he worshipped me! The old man had a\r\ndaughter, and the young men a sister; and all the five were poor. I was\r\nrich; and when I married the girl, I saw a smile of triumph play upon\r\nthe faces of her needy relatives, as they thought of their well-planned\r\nscheme, and their fine prize. It was for me to smile. To smile! To laugh\r\noutright, and tear my hair, and roll upon the ground with shrieks of\r\nmerriment. They little thought they had married her to a madman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay. If they had known it, would they have saved her? A sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness against her husband\xe2\x80\x99s gold. The lightest feather I blow into\r\nthe air, against the gay chain that ornaments my body!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In one thing I was deceived with all my cunning. If I had not been mad-\r\n-for though we madmen are sharp-witted enough, we get bewildered\r\nsometimes--I should have known that the girl would rather have been\r\nplaced, stiff and cold in a dull leaden coffin, than borne an envied\r\nbride to my rich, glittering house. I should have known that her heart\r\nwas with the dark-eyed boy whose name I once heard her breathe in her\r\ntroubled sleep; and that she had been sacrificed to me, to relieve the\r\npoverty of the old, white-headed man and the haughty brothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember forms or faces now, but I know the girl was beautiful.\r\nI know she was; for in the bright moonlight nights, when I start up from\r\nmy sleep, and all is quiet about me, I see, standing still and\r\nmotionless in one corner of this cell, a slight and wasted figure with\r\nlong black hair, which, streaming down her back, stirs with no earthly\r\nwind, and eyes that fix their gaze on me, and never wink or close. Hush!\r\nthe blood chills at my heart as I write it down--that form is _her\xe2\x80\x99s_;\r\nthe face is very pale, and the eyes are glassy bright; but I know them\r\nwell. That figure never moves; it never frowns and mouths as others do,\r\nthat fill this place sometimes; but it is much more dreadful to me, even\r\nthan the spirits that tempted me many years ago--it comes fresh from the\r\ngrave; and is so very death-like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For nearly a year I saw that face grow paler; for nearly a year I saw\r\nthe tears steal down the mournful cheeks, and never knew the cause. I\r\nfound it out at last though. They could not keep it from me long. She\r\nhad never liked me; I had never thought she did: she despised my wealth,\r\nand hated the splendour in which she lived; but I had not expected that.\r\nShe loved another. This I had never thought of. Strange feelings came\r\nover me, and thoughts, forced upon me by some secret power, whirled\r\nround and round my brain. I did not hate her, though I hated the boy she\r\nstill wept for. I pitied--yes, I pitied--the wretched life to which her\r\ncold and selfish relations had doomed her. I knew that she could not\r\nlive long; but the thought that before her death she might give birth to\r\nsome ill-fated being, destined to hand down madness to its offspring,\r\ndetermined me. I resolved to kill her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For many weeks I thought of poison, and then of drowning, and then of\r\nfire. A fine sight, the grand house in flames, and the madman\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nsmouldering away to cinders. Think of the jest of a large reward, too,\r\nand of some sane man swinging in the wind for a deed he never did, and\r\nall through a madman\xe2\x80\x99s cunning! I thought often of this, but I gave it\r\nup at last. Oh! the pleasure of stropping the razor day after day,\r\nfeeling the sharp edge, and thinking of the gash one stroke of its thin,\r\nbright edge would make!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At last the old spirits who had been with me so often before whispered\r\nin my ear that the time was come, and thrust the open razor into my\r\nhand. I grasped it firmly, rose softly from the bed, and leaned over my\r\nsleeping wife. Her face was buried in her hands. I withdrew them softly,\r\nand they fell listlessly on her bosom. She had been weeping; for the\r\ntraces of the tears were still wet upon her cheek. Her face was calm and\r\nplacid; and even as I looked upon it, a tranquil smile lighted up her\r\npale features. I laid my hand softly on her shoulder. She started--it\r\nwas only a passing dream. I leaned forward again. She screamed, and\r\nwoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One motion of my hand, and she would never again have uttered cry or\r\nsound. But I was startled, and drew back. Her eyes were fixed on mine. I\r\nknew not how it was, but they cowed and frightened me; and I quailed\r\nbeneath them. She rose from the bed, still gazing fixedly and steadily\r\non me. I trembled; the razor was in my hand, but I could not move. She\r\nmade towards the door. As she neared it, she turned, and withdrew her\r\neyes from my face. The spell was broken. I bounded forward, and clutched\r\nher by the arm. Uttering shriek upon shriek, she sank upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I could have killed her without a struggle; but the house was\r\nalarmed. I heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs. I replaced the\r\nrazor in its usual drawer, unfastened the door, and called loudly for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They came, and raised her, and placed her on the bed. She lay bereft of\r\nanimation for hours; and when life, look, and speech returned, her\r\nsenses had deserted her, and she raved wildly and furiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctors were called in--great men who rolled up to my door in easy\r\ncarriages, with fine horses and gaudy servants. They were at her bedside\r\nfor weeks. They had a great meeting and consulted together in low and\r\nsolemn voices in another room. One, the cleverest and most celebrated\r\namong them, took me aside, and bidding me prepare for the worst, told\r\nme--me, the madman!--that my wife was mad. He stood close beside me at\r\nan open window, his eyes looking in my face, and his hand laid upon my\r\narm. With one effort, I could have hurled him into the street beneath.\r\nIt would have been rare sport to have done it; but my secret was at\r\nstake, and I let him go. A few days after, they told me I must place her\r\nunder some restraint: I must provide a keeper for her. I! I went into\r\nthe open fields where none could hear me, and laughed till the air\r\nresounded with my shouts!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She died next day. The white-headed old man followed her to the grave,\r\nand the proud brothers dropped a tear over the insensible corpse of her\r\nwhose sufferings they had regarded in her lifetime with muscles of iron.\r\nAll this was food for my secret mirth, and I laughed behind the white\r\nhandkerchief which I held up to my face, as we rode home, till the tears\r\ncame into my eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But though I had carried my object and killed her, I was restless and\r\ndisturbed, and I felt that before long my secret must be known. I could\r\nnot hide the wild mirth and joy which boiled within me, and made me when\r\nI was alone, at home, jump up and beat my hands together, and dance\r\nround and round, and roar aloud. When I went out, and saw the busy\r\ncrowds hurrying about the streets; or to the theatre, and heard the\r\nsound of music, and beheld the people dancing, I felt such glee, that I\r\ncould have rushed among them, and torn them to pieces limb from limb,\r\nand howled in transport. But I ground my teeth, and struck my feet upon\r\nthe floor, and drove my sharp nails into my hands. I kept it down; and\r\nno one knew I was a madman yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember--though it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the last things I can remember: for now\r\nI mix up realities with my dreams, and having so much to do, and being\r\nalways hurried here, have no time to separate the two, from some strange\r\nconfusion in which they get involved--I remember how I let it out at\r\nlast. Ha! ha! I think I see their frightened looks now, and feel the\r\nease with which I flung them from me, and dashed my clenched fist into\r\ntheir white faces, and then flew like the wind, and left them screaming\r\nand shouting far behind. The strength of a giant comes upon me when I\r\nthink of it. There--see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious\r\nwrench. I could snap it like a twig, only there are long galleries here\r\nwith many doors--I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could find my way along them; and even\r\nif I could, I know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and\r\nbarred. They know what a clever madman I have been, and they are proud\r\nto have me here, to show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see: yes, I had been out. It was late at night when I reached\r\nhome, and found the proudest of the three proud brothers waiting to see\r\nme--urgent business he said: I recollect it well. I hated that man with\r\nall a madman\xe2\x80\x99s hate. Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear\r\nhim. They told me he was there. I ran swiftly upstairs. He had a word to\r\nsay to me. I dismissed the servants. It was late, and we were alone\r\ntogether--for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I kept my eyes carefully from him at first, for I knew what he little\r\nthought--and I gloried in the knowledge--that the light of madness\r\ngleamed from them like fire. We sat in silence for a few minutes. He\r\nspoke at last. My recent dissipation, and strange remarks, made so soon\r\nafter his sister\xe2\x80\x99s death, were an insult to her memory. Coupling\r\ntogether many circumstances which had at first escaped his observation,\r\nhe thought I had not treated her well. He wished to know whether he was\r\nright in inferring that I meant to cast a reproach upon her memory, and\r\na disrespect upon her family. It was due to the uniform he wore, to\r\ndemand this explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This man had a commission in the army--a commission, purchased with my\r\nmoney, and his sister\xe2\x80\x99s misery! This was the man who had been foremost\r\nin the plot to ensnare me, and grasp my wealth. This was the man who had\r\nbeen the main instrument in forcing his sister to wed me; well knowing\r\nthat her heart was given to that puling boy. Due to his uniform! The\r\nlivery of his degradation! I turned my eyes upon him--I could not help\r\nit--but I spoke not a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze. He was a\r\nbold man, but the colour faded from his face, and he drew back his\r\nchair. I dragged mine nearer to him; and I laughed--I was very merry\r\nthen--I saw him shudder. I felt the madness rising within me. He was\r\nafraid of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou were very fond of your sister when she was alive,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He looked uneasily round him, and I saw his hand grasp the back of his\r\nchair; but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou villain,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI found you out: I discovered your hellish\r\nplots against me; I know her heart was fixed on some one else before you\r\ncompelled her to marry me. I know it--I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He jumped suddenly from his chair, brandished it aloft, and bid me\r\nstand back--for I took care to be getting closer to him all the time I\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I screamed rather than talked, for I felt tumultuous passions eddying\r\nthrough my veins, and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear\r\nhis heart out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, starting up, and rushing upon him; \xe2\x80\x9cI killed her. I\r\nam a madman. Down with you. Blood, blood! I will have it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I turned aside with one blow the chair he hurled at me in his terror,\r\nand closed with him; and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a fine struggle that; for he was a tall, strong man, fighting\r\nfor his life; and I, a powerful madman, thirsting to destroy him. I knew\r\nno strength could equal mine, and I was right. Right again, though a\r\nmadman! His struggles grew fainter. I knelt upon his chest, and clasped\r\nhis brawny throat firmly with both hands. His face grew purple; his eyes\r\nwere starting from his head, and with protruded tongue, he seemed to\r\nmock me. I squeezed the tighter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise, and a crowd of\r\npeople rushed forward, crying aloud to each other to secure the madman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My secret was out; and my only struggle now was for liberty and\r\nfreedom. I gained my feet before a hand was on me, threw myself among my\r\nassailants, and cleared my way with my strong arm, as if I bore a\r\nhatchet in my hand, and hewed them down before me. I gained the door,\r\ndropped over the banisters, and in an instant was in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Straight and swift I ran, and no one dared to stop me. I heard the\r\nnoise of the feet behind, and redoubled my speed. It grew fainter and\r\nfainter in the distance, and at length died away altogether; but on I\r\nbounded, through marsh and rivulet, over fence and wall, with a wild\r\nshout which was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me on\r\nevery side, and swelled the sound, till it pierced the air. I was borne\r\nupon the arms of demons who swept along upon the wind, and bore down\r\nbank and hedge before them, and spun me round and round with a rustle\r\nand a speed that made my head swim, until at last they threw me from\r\nthem with a violent shock, and I fell heavily upon the earth. When I\r\nwoke I found myself here--here in this gray cell, where the sunlight\r\nseldom comes, and the moon steals in, in rays which only serve to show\r\nthe dark shadows about me, and that silent figure in its old corner.\r\nWhen I lie awake, I can sometimes hear strange shrieks and cries from\r\ndistant parts of this large place. What they are, I know not; but they\r\nneither come from that pale form, nor does it regard them. For from the\r\nfirst shades of dusk till the earliest light of morning, it still stands\r\nmotionless in the same place, listening to the music of my iron chain,\r\nand watching my gambols on my straw bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the end of the manuscript was written, in another hand, this note:--\r\n\r\n[The unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above, was a melancholy\r\ninstance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life,\r\nand excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired.\r\nThe thoughtless riot, dissipation, and debauchery of his younger days\r\nproduced fever and delirium. The first effects of the latter was the\r\nstrange delusion, founded upon a well-known medical theory, strongly\r\ncontended for by some, and as strongly contested by others, that an\r\nhereditary madness existed in his family. This produced a settled gloom,\r\nwhich in time developed a morbid insanity, and finally terminated in\r\nraving madness. There is every reason to believe that the events he\r\ndetailed, though distorted in the description by his diseased\r\nimagination, really happened. It is only matter of wonder to those who\r\nwere acquainted with the vices of his early career, that his passions,\r\nwhen no longer controlled by reason, did not lead him to the commission\r\nof still more frightful deeds.]\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s candle was just expiring in the socket, as he concluded\r\nthe perusal of the old clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript; and when the light went\r\nsuddenly out, without any previous flicker by way of warning, it\r\ncommunicated a very considerable start to his excited frame. Hastily\r\nthrowing off such articles of clothing as he had put on when he rose\r\nfrom his uneasy bed, and casting a fearful glance around, he once more\r\nscrambled hastily between the sheets, and soon fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber, when he awoke, and the\r\nmorning was far advanced. The gloom which had oppressed him on the\r\nprevious night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the\r\nlandscape, and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the\r\nmorning itself. After a hearty breakfast, the four gentlemen sallied\r\nforth to walk to Gravesend, followed by a man bearing the stone in its\r\ndeal box. They reached the town about one o\xe2\x80\x99clock (their luggage they\r\nhad directed to be forwarded to the city, from Rochester), and being\r\nfortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach, arrived in\r\nLondon in sound health and spirits, on that same afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe next three or four days were occupied with the preparations which\r\nwere necessary for their journey to the borough of Eatanswill. As any\r\nreferences to that most important undertaking demands a separate\r\nchapter, we may devote the few lines which remain at the close of this,\r\nto narrate, with great brevity, the history of the antiquarian\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the Transactions of the Club, then, that Mr. Pickwick\r\nlectured upon the discovery at a General Club Meeting, convened on the\r\nnight succeeding their return, and entered into a variety of ingenious\r\nand erudite speculations on the meaning of the inscription. It also\r\nappears that a skilful artist executed a faithful delineation of the\r\ncuriosity, which was engraven on stone, and presented to the Royal\r\nAntiquarian Society, and other learned bodies: that heart-burnings and\r\njealousies without number were created by rival controversies which were\r\npenned upon the subject; and that Mr. Pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet,\r\ncontaining ninety-six pages of very small print, and twenty-seven\r\ndifferent readings of the inscription: that three old gentlemen cut off\r\ntheir eldest sons with a shilling a-piece for presuming to doubt the\r\nantiquity of the fragment; and that one enthusiastic individual cut\r\nhimself off prematurely, in despair at being unable to fathom its\r\nmeaning: that Mr. Pickwick was elected an honorary member of seventeen\r\nnative and foreign societies, for making the discovery: that none of the\r\nseventeen could make anything of it; but that all the seventeen agreed\r\nit was very extraordinary.\r\n\r\nMr. Blotton, indeed--and the name will be doomed to the undying contempt\r\nof those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime--Mr. Blotton, we\r\nsay, with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds, presumed to\r\nstate a view of the case, as degrading as ridiculous. Mr. Blotton, with\r\na mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of Pickwick,\r\nactually undertook a journey to Cobham in person, and on his return,\r\nsarcastically observed in an oration at the club, that he had seen the\r\nman from whom the stone was purchased; that the man presumed the stone\r\nto be ancient, but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription--\r\ninasmuch as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in\r\nan idle mood, and to display letters intended to bear neither more or\r\nless than the simple construction of--\xe2\x80\x98BILL STUMPS, HIS MARK\xe2\x80\x99; and that\r\nMr. Stumps, being little in the habit of original composition, and more\r\naccustomed to be guided by the sound of words than by the strict rules\r\nof orthography, had omitted the concluding \xe2\x80\x98L\xe2\x80\x99 of his Christian name.\r\n\r\nThe Pickwick Club (as might have been expected from so enlightened an\r\ninstitution) received this statement with the contempt it deserved,\r\nexpelled the presumptuous and ill-conditioned Blotton from the society,\r\nand voted Mr. Pickwick a pair of gold spectacles, in token of their\r\nconfidence and approbation: in return for which, Mr. Pickwick caused a\r\nportrait of himself to be painted, and hung up in the club room.\r\n\r\nMr. Blotton was ejected but not conquered. He also wrote a pamphlet,\r\naddressed to the seventeen learned societies, native and foreign,\r\ncontaining a repetition of the statement he had already made, and rather\r\nmore than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned\r\nsocieties were so many \xe2\x80\x98humbugs.\xe2\x80\x99 Hereupon, the virtuous indignation of\r\nthe seventeen learned societies being roused, several fresh pamphlets\r\nappeared; the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native\r\nlearned societies; the native learned societies translated the pamphlets\r\nof the foreign learned societies into English; the foreign learned\r\nsocieties translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into\r\nall sorts of languages; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific\r\ndiscussion so well known to all men, as the Pickwick controversy.\r\n\r\nBut this base attempt to injure Mr. Pickwick recoiled upon the head of\r\nits calumnious author. The seventeen learned societies unanimously voted\r\nthe presumptuous Blotton an ignorant meddler, and forthwith set to work\r\nupon more treatises than ever. And to this day the stone remains, an\r\nillegible monument of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s greatness, and a lasting trophy to\r\nthe littleness of his enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. DESCRIPTIVE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PROCEEDING ON THE PART OF\r\nMR. PICKWICK; NO LESS AN EPOCH IN HIS LIFE, THAN IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s apartments in Goswell Street, although on a limited\r\nscale, were not only of a very neat and comfortable description, but\r\npeculiarly adapted for the residence of a man of his genius and\r\nobservation. His sitting-room was the first-floor front, his bedroom the\r\nsecond-floor front; and thus, whether he were sitting at his desk in his\r\nparlour, or standing before the dressing-glass in his dormitory, he had\r\nan equal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all the numerous\r\nphases it exhibits, in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare.\r\nHis landlady, Mrs. Bardell--the relict and sole executrix of a deceased\r\ncustom-house officer--was a comely woman of bustling manners and\r\nagreeable appearance, with a natural genius for cooking, improved by\r\nstudy and long practice, into an exquisite talent. There were no\r\nchildren, no servants, no fowls. The only other inmates of the house\r\nwere a large man and a small boy; the first a lodger, the second a\r\nproduction of Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s. The large man was always home precisely at\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, at which hour he regularly condensed himself into\r\nthe limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour; and the\r\ninfantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell were\r\nexclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters.\r\nCleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house; and in it Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s will was law.\r\n\r\nTo any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the\r\nestablishment, and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s mind, his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to\r\nthat which had been fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill would have\r\nbeen most mysterious and unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro\r\nwith hurried steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals of\r\nabout three minutes each, constantly referred to his watch, and\r\nexhibited many other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him.\r\nIt was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation,\r\nbut what that something was, not even Mrs. Bardell had been enabled to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bardell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable female\r\napproached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your little boy is a very long time gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why it\xe2\x80\x99s a good long way to the Borough, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mrs.\r\nBardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98very true; so it is.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick relapsed\r\ninto silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bardell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people, than to keep\r\none?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98La, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, colouring up to the very border\r\nof her cap, as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle\r\nin the eyes of her lodger; \xe2\x80\x98La, Mr. Pickwick, what a question!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, but do you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That depends,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster very near to\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s elbow which was planted on the table. \xe2\x80\x98That depends a\r\ngood deal upon the person, you know, Mr. Pickwick; and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsaving and careful person, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s very true,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98but the person I have in my eye\r\n(here he looked very hard at Mrs. Bardell) I think possesses these\r\nqualities; and has, moreover, a considerable knowledge of the world, and\r\na great deal of sharpness, Mrs. Bardell, which may be of material use to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98La, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising to her cap-\r\nborder again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as was his wont in\r\nspeaking of a subject which interested him--\xe2\x80\x98I do, indeed; and to tell\r\nyou the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made up my mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll think it very strange now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the amiable Mr. Pickwick, with\r\na good-humoured glance at his companion, \xe2\x80\x98that I never consulted you\r\nabout this matter, and never even mentioned it, till I sent your little\r\nboy out this morning--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long worshipped Mr.\r\nPickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at once, raised to a\r\npinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared\r\nto aspire. Mr. Pickwick was going to propose--a deliberate plan, too--\r\nsent her little boy to the Borough, to get him out of the way--how\r\nthoughtful--how considerate!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98what do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, trembling with agitation, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nvery kind, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll save you a good deal of trouble, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I never thought anything of the trouble, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs.\r\nBardell; \xe2\x80\x98and, of course, I should take more trouble to please you then,\r\nthan ever; but it is so kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to have so much\r\nconsideration for my loneliness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I never thought of that. When I am\r\nin town, you\xe2\x80\x99ll always have somebody to sit with you. To be sure, so you\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I ought to be a very happy woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your little boy--\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless his heart!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a maternal sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He, too, will have a companion,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98a lively one,\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll teach him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, more tricks in a week than he would\r\never learn in a year.\xe2\x80\x99 And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you dear--\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you kind, good, playful dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell; and without more\r\nado, she rose from her chair, and flung her arms round Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck, with a cataract of tears and a chorus of sobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bardell, my\r\ngood woman--dear me, what a situation--pray consider.--Mrs. Bardell,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t--if anybody should come--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, let them come,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Bardell frantically; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nleave you--dear, kind, good soul;\xe2\x80\x99 and, with these words, Mrs. Bardell\r\nclung the tighter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mercy upon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, \xe2\x80\x98I hear\r\nsomebody coming up the stairs. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good creature,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99 But entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing; for Mrs.\r\nBardell had fainted in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s arms; and before he could gain\r\ntime to deposit her on a chair, Master Bardell entered the room,\r\nushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless. He stood with his\r\nlovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his\r\nfriends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation.\r\nThey, in their turn, stared at him; and Master Bardell, in his turn,\r\nstared at everybody.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the\r\nperplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained\r\nin exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of\r\nthe lady was restored, had it not been for a most beautiful and touching\r\nexpression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in\r\na tight suit of corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very\r\nconsiderable size, he at first stood at the door astounded and\r\nuncertain; but by degrees, the impression that his mother must have\r\nsuffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind, and\r\nconsidering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling and\r\nsemi-earthly kind of howling, and butting forward with his head,\r\ncommenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs,\r\nwith such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm, and the violence\r\nof his excitement, allowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take this little villain away,\xe2\x80\x99 said the agonised Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 said the three tongue-tied Pickwickians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick pettishly. \xe2\x80\x98Take away the boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(Here Mr. Winkle carried the interesting boy, screaming and struggling,\r\nto the farther end of the apartment.) \xe2\x80\x98Now help me, lead this woman\r\ndownstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I am better now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me lead you downstairs,\xe2\x80\x99 said the ever-gallant Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir--thank you;\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Bardell hysterically. And\r\ndownstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot conceive,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick when his friend returned--\xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncannot conceive what has been the matter with that woman. I had merely\r\nannounced to her my intention of keeping a man-servant, when she fell\r\ninto the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found her. Very\r\nextraordinary thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said his three friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly, and\r\nlooked dubiously at each other.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked their\r\nincredulity. They evidently suspected him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is a man in the passage now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the man I spoke to you about,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I sent for him\r\nto the Borough this morning. Have the goodness to call him up,\r\nSnodgrass.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith\r\npresented himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh--you remember me, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, with a patronising wink. \xe2\x80\x98Queer start\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98ere, but he was one too many for you, warn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Up to snuff and a\r\npinch or two over--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind that matter now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick hastily; \xe2\x80\x98I want to\r\nspeak to you about something else. Sit down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. And down he sat without further bidding,\r\nhaving previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t a wery good \xe2\x80\x98un to look at,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98but it\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nastonishin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98un to wear; and afore the brim went, it was a wery handsome\r\ntile. Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever it\xe2\x80\x99s lighter without it, that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, and every\r\nhole lets in some air, that\xe2\x80\x99s another--wentilation gossamer I calls it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nOn the delivery of this sentiment, Mr. Weller smiled agreeably upon the\r\nassembled Pickwickians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now with regard to the matter on which I, with the concurrence of these\r\ngentlemen, sent for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the pint, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Sam; \xe2\x80\x98out vith it, as the father said\r\nto his child, when he swallowed a farden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We want to know, in the first place,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98whether you\r\nhave any reason to be discontented with your present situation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Afore I answers that \xe2\x80\x98ere question, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nshould like to know, in the first place, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\npurwide me with a better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA sunbeam of placid benevolence played on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s features as he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I have half made up my mind to engage you myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you, though?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick nodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wages?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Twelve pounds a year,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clothes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two suits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Work?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To attend upon me; and travel about with me and these gentlemen here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take the bill down,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam emphatically. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m let to a single\r\ngentleman, and the terms is agreed upon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You accept the situation?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98If the clothes fits me half as well as the\r\nplace, they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can get a character of course?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask the landlady o\xe2\x80\x99 the White Hart about that, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you come this evening?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll get into the clothes this minute, if they\xe2\x80\x99re here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with\r\ngreat alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call at eight this evening,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98and if the inquiries\r\nare satisfactory, they shall be provided.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith the single exception of one amiable indiscretion, in which an\r\nassistant housemaid had equally participated, the history of Mr.\r\nWeller\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was so very blameless, that Mr. Pickwick felt fully\r\njustified in closing the engagement that very evening. With the\r\npromptness and energy which characterised not only the public\r\nproceedings, but all the private actions of this extraordinary man, he\r\nat once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s new and second-hand clothes are provided, and the\r\ntroublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with;\r\nand before night had closed in, Mr. Weller was furnished with a grey\r\ncoat with the P. C. button, a black hat with a cockade to it, a pink\r\nstriped waistcoat, light breeches and gaiters, and a variety of other\r\nnecessaries, too numerous to recapitulate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said that suddenly-transformed individual, as he took his seat\r\non the outside of the Eatanswill coach next morning; \xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m meant to be a footman, or a groom, or a gamekeeper, or a seedsman. I\r\nlooks like a sort of compo of every one on \xe2\x80\x98em. Never mind; there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nchange of air, plenty to see, and little to do; and all this suits my\r\ncomplaint uncommon; so long life to the Pickvicks, says I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. SOME ACCOUNT OF EATANSWILL; OF THE STATE OF PARTIES\r\nTHEREIN; AND OF THE ELECTION OF A MEMBER TO SERVE IN PARLIAMENT FOR THAT\r\nANCIENT, LOYAL, AND PATRIOTIC BOROUGH\r\n\r\nWe will frankly acknowledge that, up to the period of our being first\r\nimmersed in the voluminous papers of the Pickwick Club, we had never\r\nheard of Eatanswill; we will with equal candour admit that we have in\r\nvain searched for proof of the actual existence of such a place at the\r\npresent day. Knowing the deep reliance to be placed on every note and\r\nstatement of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s, and not presuming to set up our\r\nrecollection against the recorded declarations of that great man, we\r\nhave consulted every authority, bearing upon the subject, to which we\r\ncould possibly refer. We have traced every name in schedules A and B,\r\nwithout meeting with that of Eatanswill; we have minutely examined every\r\ncorner of the pocket county maps issued for the benefit of society by\r\nour distinguished publishers, and the same result has attended our\r\ninvestigation. We are therefore led to believe that Mr. Pickwick, with\r\nthat anxious desire to abstain from giving offence to any, and with\r\nthose delicate feelings for which all who knew him well know he was so\r\neminently remarkable, purposely substituted a fictitious designation,\r\nfor the real name of the place in which his observations were made. We\r\nare confirmed in this belief by a little circumstance, apparently slight\r\nand trivial in itself, but when considered in this point of view, not\r\nundeserving of notice. In Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s note-book, we can just trace an\r\nentry of the fact, that the places of himself and followers were booked\r\nby the Norwich coach; but this entry was afterwards lined through, as if\r\nfor the purpose of concealing even the direction in which the borough is\r\nsituated. We will not, therefore, hazard a guess upon the subject, but\r\nwill at once proceed with this history, content with the materials which\r\nits characters have provided for us.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the Eatanswill people, like the people of many\r\nother small towns, considered themselves of the utmost and most mighty\r\nimportance, and that every man in Eatanswill, conscious of the weight\r\nthat attached to his example, felt himself bound to unite, heart and\r\nsoul, with one of the two great parties that divided the town--the Blues\r\nand the Buffs. Now the Blues lost no opportunity of opposing the Buffs,\r\nand the Buffs lost no opportunity of opposing the Blues; and the\r\nconsequence was, that whenever the Buffs and Blues met together at\r\npublic meeting, town-hall, fair, or market, disputes and high words\r\narose between them. With these dissensions it is almost superfluous to\r\nsay that everything in Eatanswill was made a party question. If the\r\nBuffs proposed to new skylight the market-place, the Blues got up public\r\nmeetings, and denounced the proceeding; if the Blues proposed the\r\nerection of an additional pump in the High Street, the Buffs rose as one\r\nman and stood aghast at the enormity. There were Blue shops and Buff\r\nshops, Blue inns and Buff inns--there was a Blue aisle and a Buff aisle\r\nin the very church itself.\r\n\r\nOf course it was essentially and indispensably necessary that each of\r\nthese powerful parties should have its chosen organ and representative:\r\nand, accordingly, there were two newspapers in the town--the Eatanswill\r\n_Gazette_ and the Eatanswill _Independent_; the former advocating Blue\r\nprinciples, and the latter conducted on grounds decidedly Buff. Fine\r\nnewspapers they were. Such leading articles, and such spirited attacks!-\r\n-\xe2\x80\x99Our worthless contemporary, the _Gazette_\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98That disgraceful and\r\ndastardly journal, the _Independent_\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98That false and scurrilous print,\r\nthe _Independent_\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98That vile and slanderous calumniator, the\r\n_Gazette_;\xe2\x80\x99 these, and other spirit-stirring denunciations, were strewn\r\nplentifully over the columns of each, in every number, and excited\r\nfeelings of the most intense delight and indignation in the bosoms of\r\nthe townspeople.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, with his usual foresight and sagacity, had chosen a\r\npeculiarly desirable moment for his visit to the borough. Never was such\r\na contest known. The Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, was the\r\nBlue candidate; and Horatio Fizkin, Esq., of Fizkin Lodge, near\r\nEatanswill, had been prevailed upon by his friends to stand forward on\r\nthe Buff interest. The _Gazette_ warned the electors of Eatanswill that\r\nthe eyes not only of England, but of the whole civilised world, were\r\nupon them; and the _Independent_ imperatively demanded to know, whether\r\nthe constituency of Eatanswill were the grand fellows they had always\r\ntaken them for, or base and servile tools, undeserving alike of the name\r\nof Englishmen and the blessings of freedom. Never had such a commotion\r\nagitated the town before.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening when Mr. Pickwick and his companions,\r\nassisted by Sam, dismounted from the roof of the Eatanswill coach. Large\r\nblue silk flags were flying from the windows of the Town Arms Inn, and\r\nbills were posted in every sash, intimating, in gigantic letters, that\r\nthe Honourable Samuel Slumkey\xe2\x80\x99s committee sat there daily. A crowd of\r\nidlers were assembled in the road, looking at a hoarse man in the\r\nbalcony, who was apparently talking himself very red in the face in Mr.\r\nSlumkey\xe2\x80\x99s behalf; but the force and point of whose arguments were\r\nsomewhat impaired by the perpetual beating of four large drums which Mr.\r\nFizkin\xe2\x80\x99s committee had stationed at the street corner. There was a busy\r\nlittle man beside him, though, who took off his hat at intervals and\r\nmotioned to the people to cheer, which they regularly did, most\r\nenthusiastically; and as the red-faced gentleman went on talking till he\r\nwas redder in the face than ever, it seemed to answer his purpose quite\r\nas well as if anybody had heard him.\r\n\r\nThe Pickwickians had no sooner dismounted than they were surrounded by a\r\nbranch mob of the honest and independent, who forthwith set up three\r\ndeafening cheers, which being responded to by the main body (for it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot at all necessary for a crowd to know what they are cheering about),\r\nswelled into a tremendous roar of triumph, which stopped even the red-\r\nfaced man in the balcony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the mob, in conclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One cheer more,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the little fugleman in the balcony, and out\r\nshouted the mob again, as if lungs were cast-iron, with steel works.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Slumkey for ever!\xe2\x80\x99 roared the honest and independent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Slumkey for ever!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No Fizkin!\xe2\x80\x99 roared the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 And then there was\r\nanother roaring, like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has\r\nrung the bell for the cold meat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is Slumkey?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, in the same tone. \xe2\x80\x98Hush. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nany questions. It\xe2\x80\x99s always best on these occasions to do what the mob\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But suppose there are two mobs?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shout with the largest,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nVolumes could not have said more.\r\n\r\nThey entered the house, the crowd opening right and left to let them\r\npass, and cheering vociferously. The first object of consideration was\r\nto secure quarters for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can we have beds here?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, summoning the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man; \xe2\x80\x98afraid we\xe2\x80\x99re full, sir--I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ninquire, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Away he went for that purpose, and presently returned, to\r\nask whether the gentleman were \xe2\x80\x98Blue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs neither Mr. Pickwick nor his companions took any vital interest in\r\nthe cause of either candidate, the question was rather a difficult one\r\nto answer. In this dilemma Mr. Pickwick bethought himself of his new\r\nfriend, Mr. Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know a gentleman of the name of Perker?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir; Honourable Mr. Samuel Slumkey\xe2\x80\x99s agent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is Blue, I think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then _we_ are Blue,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; but observing that the man\r\nlooked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement, he gave him\r\nhis card, and desired him to present it to Mr. Perker forthwith, if he\r\nshould happen to be in the house. The waiter retired; and reappearing\r\nalmost immediately with a request that Mr. Pickwick would follow him,\r\nled the way to a large room on the first floor, where, seated at a long\r\ntable covered with books and papers, was Mr. Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--ah, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, advancing to meet him; \xe2\x80\x98very\r\nhappy to see you, my dear Sir, very. Pray sit down. So you have carried\r\nyour intention into effect. You have come down here to see an election--\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Spirited contest, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nlike to see sturdy patriotism, on whatever side it is called forth--and\r\nso it\xe2\x80\x99s a spirited contest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, \xe2\x80\x98very much so indeed. We have opened all\r\nthe public-houses in the place, and left our adversary nothing but the\r\nbeer-shops--masterly stroke of policy that, my dear Sir, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 The little\r\nman smiled complacently, and took a large pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what are the probabilities as to the result of the contest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, doubtful, my dear Sir; rather doubtful as yet,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the little\r\nman. \xe2\x80\x98Fizkin\xe2\x80\x99s people have got three-and-thirty voters in the lock-up\r\ncoach-house at the White Hart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the coach-house!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, considerably astonished by this\r\nsecond stroke of policy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They keep \xe2\x80\x98em locked up there till they want \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the little\r\nman. \xe2\x80\x98The effect of that is, you see, to prevent our getting at them;\r\nand even if we could, it would be of no use, for they keep them very\r\ndrunk on purpose. Smart fellow Fizkin\xe2\x80\x99s agent--very smart fellow\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick stared, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are pretty confident, though,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Perker, sinking his voice\r\nalmost to a whisper. \xe2\x80\x98We had a little tea-party here, last night--five-\r\nand-forty women, my dear sir--and gave every one of \xe2\x80\x98em a green parasol\r\nwhen she went away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A parasol!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fact, my dear Sir, fact. Five-and-forty green parasols, at seven and\r\nsixpence a-piece. All women like finery--extraordinary the effect of\r\nthose parasols. Secured all their husbands, and half their brothers--\r\nbeats stockings, and flannel, and all that sort of thing hollow. My\r\nidea, my dear Sir, entirely. Hail, rain, or sunshine, you can\xe2\x80\x99t walk\r\nhalf a dozen yards up the street, without encountering half a dozen\r\ngreen parasols.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth, which was only\r\nchecked by the entrance of a third party.\r\n\r\nThis was a tall, thin man, with a sandy-coloured head inclined to\r\nbaldness, and a face in which solemn importance was blended with a look\r\nof unfathomable profundity. He was dressed in a long brown surtout, with\r\na black cloth waistcoat, and drab trousers. A double eyeglass dangled at\r\nhis waistcoat; and on his head he wore a very low-crowned hat with a\r\nbroad brim. The new-comer was introduced to Mr. Pickwick as Mr. Pott,\r\nthe editor of the Eatanswill _Gazette_. After a few preliminary remarks,\r\nMr. Pott turned round to Mr. Pickwick, and said with solemnity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This contest excites great interest in the metropolis, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe it does,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To which I have reason to know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, looking towards Mr. Perker\r\nfor corroboration--\xe2\x80\x98to which I have reason to know that my article of\r\nlast Saturday in some degree contributed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the least doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The press is a mighty engine, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick yielded his fullest assent to the proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I trust, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, \xe2\x80\x98that I have never abused the enormous\r\npower I wield. I trust, sir, that I have never pointed the noble\r\ninstrument which is placed in my hands, against the sacred bosom of\r\nprivate life, or the tender breast of individual reputation; I trust,\r\nsir, that I have devoted my energies to--to endeavours--humble they may\r\nbe, humble I know they are--to instil those principles of--which--are--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the editor of the Eatanswill _Gazette_, appearing to ramble, Mr.\r\nPickwick came to his relief, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott--\xe2\x80\x98what, Sir, let me ask you as an impartial\r\nman, is the state of the public mind in London, with reference to my\r\ncontest with the _Independent_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Greatly excited, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Perker, with a look of\r\nslyness which was very likely accidental.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The contest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, \xe2\x80\x98shall be prolonged so long as I have health\r\nand strength, and that portion of talent with which I am gifted. From\r\nthat contest, Sir, although it may unsettle men\xe2\x80\x99s minds and excite their\r\nfeelings, and render them incapable for the discharge of the everyday\r\nduties of ordinary life; from that contest, sir, I will never shrink,\r\ntill I have set my heel upon the Eatanswill _Independent_. I wish the\r\npeople of London, and the people of this country to know, sir, that they\r\nmay rely upon me--that I will not desert them, that I am resolved to\r\nstand by them, Sir, to the last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYour conduct is most noble, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; and he grasped the\r\nhand of the magnanimous Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are, sir, I perceive, a man of sense and talent,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott,\r\nalmost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nmost happy, sir, to make the acquaintance of such a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98feel deeply honoured by this expression of\r\nyour opinion. Allow me, sir, to introduce you to my fellow-travellers,\r\nthe other corresponding members of the club I am proud to have founded.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be delighted,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick withdrew, and returning with his friends, presented them in\r\ndue form to the editor of the Eatanswill _Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my dear Pott,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mr. Perker, \xe2\x80\x98the question is, what are\r\nwe to do with our friends here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We can stop in this house, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a spare bed in the house, my dear sir--not a single bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Extremely awkward,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said his fellow-voyagers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have an idea upon this subject,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, \xe2\x80\x98which I think may be\r\nvery successfully adopted. They have two beds at the Peacock, and I can\r\nboldly say, on behalf of Mrs. Pott, that she will be delighted to\r\naccommodate Mr. Pickwick and any one of his friends, if the other two\r\ngentlemen and their servant do not object to shifting, as they best can,\r\nat the Peacock.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter repeated pressings on the part of Mr. Pott, and repeated\r\nprotestations on that of Mr. Pickwick that he could not think of\r\nincommoding or troubling his amiable wife, it was decided that it was\r\nthe only feasible arrangement that could be made. So it _was _made; and\r\nafter dinner together at the Town Arms, the friends separated, Mr.\r\nTupman and Mr. Snodgrass repairing to the Peacock, and Mr. Pickwick and\r\nMr. Winkle proceeding to the mansion of Mr. Pott; it having been\r\npreviously arranged that they should all reassemble at the Town Arms in\r\nthe morning, and accompany the Honourable Samuel Slumkey\xe2\x80\x99s procession to\r\nthe place of nomination.\r\n\r\nMr. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s domestic circle was limited to himself and his wife. All men\r\nwhom mighty genius has raised to a proud eminence in the world, have\r\nusually some little weakness which appears the more conspicuous from the\r\ncontrast it presents to their general character. If Mr. Pott had a\r\nweakness, it was, perhaps, that he was rather too submissive to the\r\nsomewhat contemptuous control and sway of his wife. We do not feel\r\njustified in laying any particular stress upon the fact, because on the\r\npresent occasion all Mrs. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s most winning ways were brought into\r\nrequisition to receive the two gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick--Mr. Pickwick of London.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pott received Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s paternal grasp of the hand with\r\nenchanting sweetness; and Mr. Winkle, who had not been announced at all,\r\nsidled and bowed, unnoticed, in an obscure corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98P. my dear\xe2\x80\x99--said Mrs. Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray introduce the other gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg a thousand pardons,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott. \xe2\x80\x98Permit me, Mrs. Pott, Mr.--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Mr. Pott; and the ceremony of introduction was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We owe you many apologies, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98for disturbing\r\nyour domestic arrangements at so short a notice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg you won\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the feminine Pott, with\r\nvivacity. \xe2\x80\x98It is a high treat to me, I assure you, to see any new faces;\r\nliving as I do, from day to day, and week to week, in this dull place,\r\nand seeing nobody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pott archly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody but you,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mrs. Pott, with asperity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said the host in explanation of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlament, \xe2\x80\x98that we are in some measure cut off from many enjoyments and\r\npleasures of which we might otherwise partake. My public station, as\r\neditor of the Eatanswill _Gazette_, the position which that paper holds\r\nin the country, my constant immersion in the vortex of politics--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98P. my dear--\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mrs. Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My life--\xe2\x80\x99 said the editor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish, my dear, you would endeavour to find some topic of conversation\r\nin which these gentlemen might take some rational interest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, with great humility, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick does\r\ntake an interest in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s well for him if he can,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott emphatically; \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nwearied out of my life with your politics, and quarrels with the\r\n_Independent_, and nonsense. I am quite astonished, P., at your making\r\nsuch an exhibition of your absurdity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear--\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, nonsense, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott. \xe2\x80\x98Do you play ecarte,\r\nSir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be very happy to learn under your tuition,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, draw that little table into this window, and let me get out\r\nof hearing of those prosy politics.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jane,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, to the servant who brought in candles, \xe2\x80\x98go down\r\ninto the office, and bring me up the file of the _Gazette_ for eighteen\r\nhundred and twenty-six. I\xe2\x80\x99ll read you,\xe2\x80\x99 added the editor, turning to Mr.\r\nPickwick--\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll just read you a few of the leaders I wrote at that time\r\nupon the Buff job of appointing a new tollman to the turnpike here; I\r\nrather think they\xe2\x80\x99ll amuse you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to hear them very much indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nUp came the file, and down sat the editor, with Mr. Pickwick at his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWe have in vain pored over the leaves of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s note-book, in\r\nthe hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful\r\ncompositions. We have every reason to believe that he was perfectly\r\nenraptured with the vigour and freshness of the style; indeed Mr. Winkle\r\nhas recorded the fact that his eyes were closed, as if with excess of\r\npleasure, during the whole time of their perusal.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of supper put a stop both to the game of ecarte, and\r\nthe recapitulation of the beauties of the Eatanswill _Gazette_. Mrs.\r\nPott was in the highest spirits and the most agreeable humour. Mr.\r\nWinkle had already made considerable progress in her good opinion, and\r\nshe did not hesitate to inform him, confidentially, that Mr. Pickwick\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x98a delightful old dear.\xe2\x80\x99 These terms convey a familiarity of\r\nexpression, in which few of those who were intimately acquainted with\r\nthat colossal-minded man, would have presumed to indulge. We have\r\npreserved them, nevertheless, as affording at once a touching and a\r\nconvincing proof of the estimation in which he was held by every class\r\nof society, and the ease with which he made his way to their hearts and\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nIt was a late hour of the night--long after Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass\r\nhad fallen asleep in the inmost recesses of the Peacock--when the two\r\nfriends retired to rest. Slumber soon fell upon the senses of Mr.\r\nWinkle, but his feelings had been excited, and his admiration roused;\r\nand for many hours after sleep had rendered him insensible to earthly\r\nobjects, the face and figure of the agreeable Mrs. Pott presented\r\nthemselves again and again to his wandering imagination.\r\n\r\nThe noise and bustle which ushered in the morning were sufficient to\r\ndispel from the mind of the most romantic visionary in existence, any\r\nassociations but those which were immediately connected with the\r\nrapidly-approaching election. The beating of drums, the blowing of horns\r\nand trumpets, the shouting of men, and tramping of horses, echoed and\r\nre-echoed through the streets from the earliest dawn of day; and an\r\noccasional fight between the light skirmishers of either party at once\r\nenlivened the preparations, and agreeably diversified their character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as his valet appeared at his bedroom\r\ndoor, just as he was concluding his toilet; \xe2\x80\x98all alive to-day, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Reg\xe2\x80\x99lar game, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98our people\xe2\x80\x99s a-collecting down\r\nat the Town Arms, and they\xe2\x80\x99re a-hollering themselves hoarse already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98do they seem devoted to their party, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never see such dewotion in my life, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Energetic, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Uncommon,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98I never see men eat and drink so much afore. I\r\nwonder they ain\xe2\x80\x99t afeer\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\x99 bustin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the mistaken kindness of the gentry here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery likely,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine, fresh, hearty fellows they seem,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, glancing\r\nfrom the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery fresh,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98me and the two waiters at the Peacock has\r\nbeen a-pumpin\xe2\x80\x99 over the independent woters as supped there last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pumping over independent voters!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said his attendant, \xe2\x80\x98every man slept vere he fell down; we\r\ndragged \xe2\x80\x98em out, one by one, this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, and put \xe2\x80\x98em under the pump,\r\nand they\xe2\x80\x99re in reg\xe2\x80\x99lar fine order now. Shillin\xe2\x80\x99 a head the committee\r\npaid for that \xe2\x80\x98ere job.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can such things be!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the astonished Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord bless your heart, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98why where was you half\r\nbaptised?--that\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing?\xe2\x80\x99said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 at all, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his attendant. \xe2\x80\x98The night afore the last\r\nday o\xe2\x80\x99 the last election here, the opposite party bribed the barmaid at\r\nthe Town Arms, to hocus the brandy-and-water of fourteen unpolled\r\nelectors as was a-stoppin\xe2\x80\x99 in the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by \xe2\x80\x9chocussing\xe2\x80\x9d brandy-and-water?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Puttin\xe2\x80\x99 laud\xe2\x80\x99num in it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Blessed if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t send \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nall to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over. They took\r\none man up to the booth, in a truck, fast asleep, by way of experiment,\r\nbut it was no go--they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t poll him; so they brought him back, and\r\nput him to bed again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStrange practices, these,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; half speaking to himself\r\nand half addressing Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not half so strange as a miraculous circumstance as happened to my own\r\nfather, at an election time, in this wery place, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was that?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, he drove a coach down here once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99lection time came\r\non, and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from London.\r\nNight afore he was going to drive up, committee on t\xe2\x80\x99 other side sends\r\nfor him quietly, and away he goes vith the messenger, who shows him in;-\r\n-large room--lots of gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n--heaps of papers, pens and ink, and all\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98ere. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n in the chair, \xe2\x80\x9cglad to\r\nsee you, sir; how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWery well, thank \xe2\x80\x98ee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says my\r\nfather; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty middlin,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.--\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well,\r\nthank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n; \xe2\x80\x9csit down, Mr. Weller--pray sit\r\ndown, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d So my father sits down, and he and the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n looks wery\r\nhard at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember me?\xe2\x80\x9d said the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n.--\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay I do,\xe2\x80\x9d says my father.--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know you,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cknow\xe2\x80\x99d you when you was a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says my father.--\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s wery odd,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWery,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nmy father.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have a bad mem\xe2\x80\x99ry, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n.--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is a wery bad \xe2\x80\x98un,\xe2\x80\x9d says my father.--\xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n. So then they pours him out a glass of wine, and\r\ngammons him about his driving, and gets him into a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar good humour,\r\nand at last shoves a twenty-pound note into his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wery bad\r\nroad between this and London,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n.--\xe2\x80\x9cHere and there it\r\nis a heavy road,\xe2\x80\x9d says my father.--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98Specially near the canal, I\r\nthink,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n.--\xe2\x80\x9cNasty bit that \xe2\x80\x98ere,\xe2\x80\x9d says my father.--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a wery good whip, and\r\ncan do what you like with your horses, we know. We\xe2\x80\x99re all wery fond o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou, Mr. Weller, so in case you should have an accident when you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nbringing these here woters down, and should tip \xe2\x80\x98em over into the canal\r\nvithout hurtin\xe2\x80\x99 of \xe2\x80\x98em, this is for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.--\xe2\x80\x9cGen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re wery kind,\xe2\x80\x9d says my father, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll drink your health in\r\nanother glass of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; vich he did, and then buttons up the\r\nmoney, and bows himself out. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Sam,\r\nwith a look of inexpressible impudence at his master, \xe2\x80\x98that on the wery\r\nday as he came down with them woters, his coach _was _upset on that \xe2\x80\x98ere\r\nwery spot, and ev\xe2\x80\x99ry man on \xe2\x80\x98em was turned into the canal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And got out again?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam very slowly, \xe2\x80\x98I rather think one old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n was\r\nmissin\xe2\x80\x99; I know his hat was found, but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t quite certain whether his\r\nhead was in it or not. But what I look at is the hex-traordinary and\r\nwonderful coincidence, that arter what that gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n said, my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoach should be upset in that wery place, and on that wery day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is, no doubt, a very extraordinary circumstance indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick. \xe2\x80\x98But brush my hat, Sam, for I hear Mr. Winkle calling me to\r\nbreakfast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words Mr. Pickwick descended to the parlour, where he found\r\nbreakfast laid, and the family already assembled. The meal was hastily\r\ndespatched; each of the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s hats was decorated with an enormous\r\nblue favour, made up by the fair hands of Mrs. Pott herself; and as Mr.\r\nWinkle had undertaken to escort that lady to a house-top, in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the hustings, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Pott repaired\r\nalone to the Town Arms, from the back window of which, one of Mr.\r\nSlumkey\xe2\x80\x99s committee was addressing six small boys and one girl, whom he\r\ndignified, at every second sentence, with the imposing title of \xe2\x80\x98Men of\r\nEatanswill,\xe2\x80\x99 whereat the six small boys aforesaid cheered prodigiously.\r\n\r\nThe stable-yard exhibited unequivocal symptoms of the glory and strength\r\nof the Eatanswill Blues. There was a regular army of blue flags, some\r\nwith one handle, and some with two, exhibiting appropriate devices, in\r\ngolden characters four feet high, and stout in proportion. There was a\r\ngrand band of trumpets, bassoons, and drums, marshalled four abreast,\r\nand earning their money, if ever men did, especially the drum-beaters,\r\nwho were very muscular. There were bodies of constables with blue\r\nstaves, twenty committee-men with blue scarfs, and a mob of voters with\r\nblue cockades. There were electors on horseback and electors afoot.\r\nThere was an open carriage-and-four, for the Honourable Samuel Slumkey;\r\nand there were four carriage-and-pair, for his friends and supporters;\r\nand the flags were rustling, and the band was playing, and the\r\nconstables were swearing, and the twenty committee-men were squabbling,\r\nand the mob were shouting, and the horses were backing, and the post-\r\nboys perspiring; and everybody, and everything, then and there\r\nassembled, was for the special use, behoof, honour, and renown, of the\r\nHonourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, one of the candidates for\r\nthe representation of the borough of Eatanswill, in the Commons House of\r\nParliament of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nLoud and long were the cheers, and mighty was the rustling of one of the\r\nblue flags, with \xe2\x80\x98Liberty of the Press\xe2\x80\x99 inscribed thereon, when the\r\nsandy head of Mr. Pott was discerned in one of the windows, by the mob\r\nbeneath; and tremendous was the enthusiasm when the Honourable Samuel\r\nSlumkey himself, in top-boots, and a blue neckerchief, advanced and\r\nseized the hand of the said Pott, and melodramatically testified by\r\ngestures to the crowd, his ineffaceable obligations to the Eatanswill\r\n_Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is everything ready?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey to Mr. Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 was the little man\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing has been omitted, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing has been left undone, my dear sir--nothing whatever. There are\r\ntwenty washed men at the street door for you to shake hands with; and\r\nsix children in arms that you\xe2\x80\x99re to pat on the head, and inquire the age\r\nof; be particular about the children, my dear sir--it has always a great\r\neffect, that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, perhaps, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cautious little man, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps if\r\nyou could--I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say it\xe2\x80\x99s indispensable--but if you could\r\nmanage to kiss one of \xe2\x80\x98em, it would produce a very great impression on\r\nthe crowd.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have as good an effect if the proposer or seconder did\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I am afraid it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the agent; \xe2\x80\x98if it were done by\r\nyourself, my dear Sir, I think it would make you very popular.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, with a resigned air,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98then it must be done. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Arrange the procession,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the twenty committee-men.\r\n\r\nAmidst the cheers of the assembled throng, the band, and the constables,\r\nand the committee-men, and the voters, and the horsemen, and the\r\ncarriages, took their places--each of the two-horse vehicles being\r\nclosely packed with as many gentlemen as could manage to stand upright\r\nin it; and that assigned to Mr. Perker, containing Mr. Pickwick, Mr.\r\nTupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and about half a dozen of the committee besides.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waited for the\r\nHonourable Samuel Slumkey to step into his carriage. Suddenly the crowd\r\nset up a great cheering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has come out,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mr. Perker, greatly excited; the more so\r\nas their position did not enable them to see what was going forward.\r\n\r\nAnother cheer, much louder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has shaken hands with the men,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the little agent.\r\n\r\nAnother cheer, far more vehement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has patted the babies on the head,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Perker, trembling with\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nA roar of applause that rent the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has kissed one of \xe2\x80\x98em!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the delighted little man.\r\n\r\nA second roar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has kissed another,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped the excited manager.\r\n\r\nA third roar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s kissing \xe2\x80\x98em all!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the enthusiastic little gentleman, and\r\nhailed by the deafening shouts of the multitude, the procession moved\r\non.\r\n\r\nHow or by what means it became mixed up with the other procession, and\r\nhow it was ever extricated from the confusion consequent thereupon, is\r\nmore than we can undertake to describe, inasmuch as Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hat\r\nwas knocked over his eyes, nose, and mouth, by one poke of a Buff flag-\r\nstaff, very early in the proceedings. He describes himself as being\r\nsurrounded on every side, when he could catch a glimpse of the scene, by\r\nangry and ferocious countenances, by a vast cloud of dust, and by a\r\ndense crowd of combatants. He represents himself as being forced from\r\nthe carriage by some unseen power, and being personally engaged in a\r\npugilistic encounter; but with whom, or how, or why, he is wholly unable\r\nto state. He then felt himself forced up some wooden steps by the\r\npersons from behind; and on removing his hat, found himself surrounded\r\nby his friends, in the very front of the left hand side of the hustings.\r\nThe right was reserved for the Buff party, and the centre for the mayor\r\nand his officers; one of whom--the fat crier of Eatanswill--was ringing\r\nan enormous bell, by way of commanding silence, while Mr. Horatio\r\nFizkin, and the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, with their hands upon their\r\nhearts, were bowing with the utmost affability to the troubled sea of\r\nheads that inundated the open space in front; and from whence arose a\r\nstorm of groans, and shouts, and yells, and hootings, that would have\r\ndone honour to an earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, pulling his friend by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, putting on his spectacles, which he had\r\nfortunately kept in his pocket hitherto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, \xe2\x80\x98on the top of that house.\xe2\x80\x99 And there, sure\r\nenough, in the leaden gutter of a tiled roof, were Mr. Winkle and Mrs.\r\nPott, comfortably seated in a couple of chairs, waving their\r\nhandkerchiefs in token of recognition--a compliment which Mr. Pickwick\r\nreturned by kissing his hand to the lady.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings had not yet commenced; and as an inactive crowd is\r\ngenerally disposed to be jocose, this very innocent action was\r\nsufficient to awaken their facetiousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you wicked old rascal,\xe2\x80\x99 cried one voice, \xe2\x80\x98looking arter the girls,\r\nare you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you wenerable sinner,\xe2\x80\x99 cried another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Putting on his spectacles to look at a married \xe2\x80\x98ooman!\xe2\x80\x99 said a third.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see him a-winkin\xe2\x80\x99 at her, with his wicked old eye,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted a fourth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look arter your wife, Pott,\xe2\x80\x99 bellowed a fifth--and then there was a\r\nroar of laughter.\r\n\r\nAs these taunts were accompanied with invidious comparisons between Mr.\r\nPickwick and an aged ram, and several witticisms of the like nature; and\r\nas they moreover rather tended to convey reflections upon the honour of\r\nan innocent lady, Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s indignation was excessive; but as\r\nsilence was proclaimed at the moment, he contented himself by scorching\r\nthe mob with a look of pity for their misguided minds, at which they\r\nlaughed more boisterously than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence!\xe2\x80\x99 roared the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s attendants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whiffin, proclaim silence,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mayor, with an air of pomp\r\nbefitting his lofty station. In obedience to this command the crier\r\nperformed another concerto on the bell, whereupon a gentleman in the\r\ncrowd called out \xe2\x80\x98Muffins\xe2\x80\x99; which occasioned another laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mayor, at as loud a pitch as he could possibly\r\nforce his voice to--\xe2\x80\x98gentlemen. Brother electors of the borough of\r\nEatanswill. We are met here to-day for the purpose of choosing a\r\nrepresentative in the room of our late--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the mayor was interrupted by a voice in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suc-cess to the mayor!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the voice, \xe2\x80\x98and may he never desert the\r\nnail and sarspan business, as he got his money by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis allusion to the professional pursuits of the orator was received\r\nwith a storm of delight, which, with a bell-accompaniment, rendered the\r\nremainder of his speech inaudible, with the exception of the concluding\r\nsentence, in which he thanked the meeting for the patient attention with\r\nwhich they heard him throughout--an expression of gratitude which\r\nelicited another burst of mirth, of about a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nNext, a tall, thin gentleman, in a very stiff white neckerchief, after\r\nbeing repeatedly desired by the crowd to \xe2\x80\x98send a boy home, to ask\r\nwhether he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t left his voice under the pillow,\xe2\x80\x99 begged to nominate a\r\nfit and proper person to represent them in Parliament. And when he said\r\nit was Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, near Eatanswill, the\r\nFizkinites applauded, and the Slumkeyites groaned, so long, and so\r\nloudly, that both he and the seconder might have sung comic songs in\r\nlieu of speaking, without anybody\xe2\x80\x99s being a bit the wiser.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, having had their innings, a\r\nlittle choleric, pink-faced man stood forward to propose another fit and\r\nproper person to represent the electors of Eatanswill in Parliament; and\r\nvery swimmingly the pink-faced gentleman would have got on, if he had\r\nnot been rather too choleric to entertain a sufficient perception of the\r\nfun of the crowd. But after a very few sentences of figurative\r\neloquence, the pink-faced gentleman got from denouncing those who\r\ninterrupted him in the mob, to exchanging defiances with the gentlemen\r\non the hustings; whereupon arose an uproar which reduced him to the\r\nnecessity of expressing his feelings by serious pantomime, which he did,\r\nand then left the stage to his seconder, who delivered a written speech\r\nof half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s length, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be stopped, because he had sent\r\nit all to the Eatanswill _Gazette_, and the Eatanswill _Gazette_ had\r\nalready printed it, every word.\r\n\r\nThen Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, near Eatanswill,\r\npresented himself for the purpose of addressing the electors; which he\r\nno sooner did, than the band employed by the Honourable Samuel Slumkey,\r\ncommenced performing with a power to which their strength in the morning\r\nwas a trifle; in return for which, the Buff crowd belaboured the heads\r\nand shoulders of the Blue crowd; on which the Blue crowd endeavoured to\r\ndispossess themselves of their very unpleasant neighbours the Buff\r\ncrowd; and a scene of struggling, and pushing, and fighting, succeeded,\r\nto which we can no more do justice than the mayor could, although he\r\nissued imperative orders to twelve constables to seize the ringleaders,\r\nwho might amount in number to two hundred and fifty, or thereabouts. At\r\nall these encounters, Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, and his\r\nfriends, waxed fierce and furious; until at last Horatio Fizkin,\r\nEsquire, of Fizkin Lodge, begged to ask his opponent, the Honourable\r\nSamuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, whether that band played by his\r\nconsent; which question the Honourable Samuel Slumkey declining to\r\nanswer, Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, shook his fist in the\r\ncountenance of the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall; upon\r\nwhich the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, his blood being up, defied Horatio\r\nFizkin, Esquire, to mortal combat. At this violation of all known rules\r\nand precedents of order, the mayor commanded another fantasia on the\r\nbell, and declared that he would bring before himself, both Horatio\r\nFizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, and the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of\r\nSlumkey Hall, and bind them over to keep the peace. Upon this terrific\r\ndenunciation, the supporters of the two candidates interfered, and after\r\nthe friends of each party had quarrelled in pairs, for three-quarters of\r\nan hour, Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, touched his hat to the Honourable\r\nSamuel Slumkey; the Honourable Samuel Slumkey touched his to Horatio\r\nFizkin, Esquire; the band was stopped; the crowd were partially quieted;\r\nand Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, was permitted to proceed.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of the two candidates, though differing in every other\r\nrespect, afforded a beautiful tribute to the merit and high worth of the\r\nelectors of Eatanswill. Both expressed their opinion that a more\r\nindependent, a more enlightened, a more public-spirited, a more noble-\r\nminded, a more disinterested set of men than those who had promised to\r\nvote for him, never existed on earth; each darkly hinted his suspicions\r\nthat the electors in the opposite interest had certain swinish and\r\nbesotted infirmities which rendered them unfit for the exercise of the\r\nimportant duties they were called upon to discharge. Fizkin expressed\r\nhis readiness to do anything he was wanted: Slumkey, his determination\r\nto do nothing that was asked of him. Both said that the trade, the\r\nmanufactures, the commerce, the prosperity of Eatanswill, would ever be\r\ndearer to their hearts than any earthly object; and each had it in his\r\npower to state, with the utmost confidence, that he was the man who\r\nwould eventually be returned.\r\n\r\nThere was a show of hands; the mayor decided in favour of the Honourable\r\nSamuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall. Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin\r\nLodge, demanded a poll, and a poll was fixed accordingly. Then a vote of\r\nthanks was moved to the mayor for his able conduct in the chair; and the\r\nmayor, devoutly wishing that he had had a chair to display his able\r\nconduct in (for he had been standing during the whole proceedings),\r\nreturned thanks. The processions reformed, the carriages rolled slowly\r\nthrough the crowd, and its members screeched and shouted after them as\r\ntheir feelings or caprice dictated.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time of the polling, the town was in a perpetual fever\r\nof excitement. Everything was conducted on the most liberal and\r\ndelightful scale. Excisable articles were remarkably cheap at all the\r\npublic-houses; and spring vans paraded the streets for the accommodation\r\nof voters who were seized with any temporary dizziness in the head--an\r\nepidemic which prevailed among the electors, during the contest, to a\r\nmost alarming extent, and under the influence of which they might\r\nfrequently be seen lying on the pavements in a state of utter\r\ninsensibility. A small body of electors remained unpolled on the very\r\nlast day. They were calculating and reflecting persons, who had not yet\r\nbeen convinced by the arguments of either party, although they had\r\nfrequent conferences with each. One hour before the close of the poll,\r\nMr. Perker solicited the honour of a private interview with these\r\nintelligent, these noble, these patriotic men. It was granted. His\r\narguments were brief but satisfactory. They went in a body to the poll;\r\nand when they returned, the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall,\r\nwas returned also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. COMPRISING A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AT THE\r\nPEACOCK ASSEMBLED; AND A TALE TOLD BY A BAGMAN\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to turn from contemplating the strife and turmoil of\r\npolitical existence, to the peaceful repose of private life. Although in\r\nreality no great partisan of either side, Mr. Pickwick was sufficiently\r\nfired with Mr. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm, to apply his whole time and attention\r\nto the proceedings, of which the last chapter affords a description\r\ncompiled from his own memoranda. Nor while he was thus occupied was Mr.\r\nWinkle idle, his whole time being devoted to pleasant walks and short\r\ncountry excursions with Mrs. Pott, who never failed, when such an\r\nopportunity presented itself, to seek some relief from the tedious\r\nmonotony she so constantly complained of. The two gentlemen being thus\r\ncompletely domesticated in the editor\xe2\x80\x99s house, Mr. Tupman and Mr.\r\nSnodgrass were in a great measure cast upon their own resources. Taking\r\nbut little interest in public affairs, they beguiled their time chiefly\r\nwith such amusements as the Peacock afforded, which were limited to a\r\nbagatelle-board in the first floor, and a sequestered skittle-ground in\r\nthe back yard. In the science and nicety of both these recreations,\r\nwhich are far more abstruse than ordinary men suppose, they were\r\ngradually initiated by Mr. Weller, who possessed a perfect knowledge of\r\nsuch pastimes. Thus, notwithstanding that they were in a great measure\r\ndeprived of the comfort and advantage of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s society, they\r\nwere still enabled to beguile the time, and to prevent its hanging\r\nheavily on their hands.\r\n\r\nIt was in the evening, however, that the Peacock presented attractions\r\nwhich enabled the two friends to resist even the invitations of the\r\ngifted, though prosy, Pott. It was in the evening that the \xe2\x80\x98commercial\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x99 was filled with a social circle, whose characters and manners it\r\nwas the delight of Mr. Tupman to observe; whose sayings and doings it\r\nwas the habit of Mr. Snodgrass to note down.\r\n\r\nMost people know what sort of places commercial rooms usually are. That\r\nof the Peacock differed in no material respect from the generality of\r\nsuch apartments; that is to say, it was a large, bare-looking room, the\r\nfurniture of which had no doubt been better when it was newer, with a\r\nspacious table in the centre, and a variety of smaller dittos in the\r\ncorners; an extensive assortment of variously shaped chairs, and an old\r\nTurkey carpet, bearing about the same relative proportion to the size of\r\nthe room, as a lady\xe2\x80\x99s pocket-handkerchief might to the floor of a watch-\r\nbox. The walls were garnished with one or two large maps; and several\r\nweather-beaten rough greatcoats, with complicated capes, dangled from a\r\nlong row of pegs in one corner. The mantel-shelf was ornamented with a\r\nwooden inkstand, containing one stump of a pen and half a wafer; a road-\r\nbook and directory; a county history minus the cover; and the mortal\r\nremains of a trout in a glass coffin. The atmosphere was redolent of\r\ntobacco-smoke, the fumes of which had communicated a rather dingy hue to\r\nthe whole room, and more especially to the dusty red curtains which\r\nshaded the windows. On the sideboard a variety of miscellaneous articles\r\nwere huddled together, the most conspicuous of which were some very\r\ncloudy fish-sauce cruets, a couple of driving-boxes, two or three whips,\r\nand as many travelling shawls, a tray of knives and forks, and the\r\nmustard.\r\n\r\nHere it was that Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were seated on the evening\r\nafter the conclusion of the election, with several other temporary\r\ninmates of the house, smoking and drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, gents,\xe2\x80\x99 said a stout, hale personage of about forty, with only\r\none eye--a very bright black eye, which twinkled with a roguish\r\nexpression of fun and good-humour, \xe2\x80\x98our noble selves, gents. I always\r\npropose that toast to the company, and drink Mary to myself. Eh, Mary!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get along with you, you wretch,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hand-maiden, obviously not\r\nill-pleased with the compliment, however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go away, Mary,\xe2\x80\x99 said the black-eyed man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me alone, imperence,\xe2\x80\x99 said the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said the one-eyed man, calling after the girl as she left\r\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll step out by and by, Mary. Keep your spirits up, dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHere he went through the not very difficult process of winking upon the\r\ncompany with his solitary eye, to the enthusiastic delight of an elderly\r\npersonage with a dirty face and a clay pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rum creeters is women,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dirty-faced man, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! no mistake about that,\xe2\x80\x99 said a very red-faced man, behind a cigar.\r\n\r\nAfter this little bit of philosophy there was another pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s rummer things than women in this world though, mind you,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe man with the black eye, slowly filling a large Dutch pipe, with a\r\nmost capacious bowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you married?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the dirty-faced man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t say I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought not.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the dirty-faced man fell into ecstasies of mirth\r\nat his own retort, in which he was joined by a man of bland voice and\r\nplacid countenance, who always made it a point to agree with everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Women, after all, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the enthusiastic Mr. Snodgrass, \xe2\x80\x98are\r\nthe great props and comforts of our existence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So they are,\xe2\x80\x99 said the placid gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When they\xe2\x80\x99re in a good humour,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the dirty-faced man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that\xe2\x80\x99s very true,\xe2\x80\x99 said the placid one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I repudiate that qualification,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, whose thoughts\r\nwere fast reverting to Emily Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98I repudiate it with disdain--with\r\nindignation. Show me the man who says anything against women, as women,\r\nand I boldly declare he is not a man.\xe2\x80\x99 And Mr. Snodgrass took his cigar\r\nfrom his mouth, and struck the table violently with his clenched fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s good sound argument,\xe2\x80\x99 said the placid man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Containing a position which I deny,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted he of the dirty\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a very great deal of truth in what you observe\r\ntoo, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the placid gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your health, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bagman with the lonely eye, bestowing an\r\napproving nod on Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass acknowledged the compliment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always like to hear a good argument,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the bagman, \xe2\x80\x98a sharp\r\none, like this: it\xe2\x80\x99s very improving; but this little argument about\r\nwomen brought to my mind a story I have heard an old uncle of mine tell,\r\nthe recollection of which, just now, made me say there were rummer\r\nthings than women to be met with, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to hear that same story,\xe2\x80\x99 said the red-faced man with the\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should you?\xe2\x80\x99 was the only reply of the bagman, who continued to smoke\r\nwith great vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So should I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, speaking for the first time. He was\r\nalways anxious to increase his stock of experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should _you_? Well then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell it. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the roguish eye, making that organ look\r\nmore roguish than ever. \xe2\x80\x98If you say it\xe2\x80\x99s true, of course I shall,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, upon that understanding I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the traveller.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ever hear of the great commercial house of Bilson & Slum? But\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter though, whether you did or not, because they retired\r\nfrom business long since. It\xe2\x80\x99s eighty years ago, since the circumstance\r\nhappened to a traveller for that house, but he was a particular friend\r\nof my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s; and my uncle told the story to me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a queer name; but\r\nhe used to call it\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAGMAN\xe2\x80\x99S STORY\r\n\r\nand he used to tell it, something in this way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One winter\xe2\x80\x99s evening, about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, just as it began to grow\r\ndusk, a man in a gig might have been seen urging his tired horse along\r\nthe road which leads across Marlborough Downs, in the direction of\r\nBristol. I say he might have been seen, and I have no doubt he would\r\nhave been, if anybody but a blind man had happened to pass that way; but\r\nthe weather was so bad, and the night so cold and wet, that nothing was\r\nout but the water, and so the traveller jogged along in the middle of\r\nthe road, lonesome and dreary enough. If any bagman of that day could\r\nhave caught sight of the little neck-or-nothing sort of gig, with a\r\nclay-coloured body and red wheels, and the vixenish, ill tempered, fast-\r\ngoing bay mare, that looked like a cross between a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s horse and a\r\ntwopenny post-office pony, he would have known at once, that this\r\ntraveller could have been no other than Tom Smart, of the great house of\r\nBilson and Slum, Cateaton Street, City. However, as there was no bagman\r\nto look on, nobody knew anything at all about the matter; and so Tom\r\nSmart and his clay-coloured gig with the red wheels, and the vixenish\r\nmare with the fast pace, went on together, keeping the secret among\r\nthem, and nobody was a bit the wiser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world, than\r\nMarlborough Downs when it blows hard; and if you throw in beside, a\r\ngloomy winter\xe2\x80\x99s evening, a miry and sloppy road, and a pelting fall of\r\nheavy rain, and try the effect, by way of experiment, in your own proper\r\nperson, you will experience the full force of this observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wind blew--not up the road or down it, though that\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough,\r\nbut sheer across it, sending the rain slanting down like the lines they\r\nused to rule in the copy-books at school, to make the boys slope well.\r\nFor a moment it would die away, and the traveller would begin to delude\r\nhimself into the belief that, exhausted with its previous fury, it had\r\nquietly laid itself down to rest, when, whoo! he could hear it growling\r\nand whistling in the distance, and on it would come rushing over the\r\nhill-tops, and sweeping along the plain, gathering sound and strength as\r\nit drew nearer, until it dashed with a heavy gust against horse and man,\r\ndriving the sharp rain into their ears, and its cold damp breath into\r\ntheir very bones; and past them it would scour, far, far away, with a\r\nstunning roar, as if in ridicule of their weakness, and triumphant in\r\nthe consciousness of its own strength and power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The bay mare splashed away, through the mud and water, with drooping\r\nears; now and then tossing her head as if to express her disgust at this\r\nvery ungentlemanly behaviour of the elements, but keeping a good pace\r\nnotwithstanding, until a gust of wind, more furious than any that had\r\nyet assailed them, caused her to stop suddenly and plant her four feet\r\nfirmly against the ground, to prevent her being blown over. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nspecial mercy that she did this, for if she _had _been blown over, the\r\nvixenish mare was so light, and the gig was so light, and Tom Smart such\r\na light weight into the bargain, that they must infallibly have all gone\r\nrolling over and over together, until they reached the confines of\r\nearth, or until the wind fell; and in either case the probability is,\r\nthat neither the vixenish mare, nor the clay-coloured gig with the red\r\nwheels, nor Tom Smart, would ever have been fit for service again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, damn my straps and whiskers,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom Smart (Tom sometimes had\r\nan unpleasant knack of swearing)--\xe2\x80\x9cdamn my straps and whiskers,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nTom, \xe2\x80\x9cif this ain\xe2\x80\x99t pleasant, blow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll very likely ask me why, as Tom Smart had been pretty well blown\r\nalready, he expressed this wish to be submitted to the same process\r\nagain. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say--all I know is, that Tom Smart said so--or at least\r\nhe always told my uncle he said so, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just the same thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Blow me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom Smart; and the mare neighed as if she were\r\nprecisely of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Cheer up, old girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, patting the bay mare on the neck with\r\nthe end of his whip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do pushing on, such a night as this; the\r\nfirst house we come to we\xe2\x80\x99ll put up at, so the faster you go the sooner\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s over. Soho, old girl--gently--gently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whether the vixenish mare was sufficiently well acquainted with the\r\ntones of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s voice to comprehend his meaning, or whether she found it\r\ncolder standing still than moving on, of course I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. But I can\r\nsay that Tom had no sooner finished speaking, than she pricked up her\r\nears, and started forward at a speed which made the clay-coloured gig\r\nrattle until you would have supposed every one of the red spokes were\r\ngoing to fly out on the turf of Marlborough Downs; and even Tom, whip as\r\nhe was, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop or check her pace, until she drew up of her own\r\naccord, before a roadside inn on the right-hand side of the way, about\r\nhalf a quarter of a mile from the end of the Downs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom cast a hasty glance at the upper part of the house as he threw the\r\nreins to the hostler, and stuck the whip in the box. It was a strange\r\nold place, built of a kind of shingle, inlaid, as it were, with cross-\r\nbeams, with gabled-topped windows projecting completely over the\r\npathway, and a low door with a dark porch, and a couple of steep steps\r\nleading down into the house, instead of the modern fashion of half a\r\ndozen shallow ones leading up to it. It was a comfortable-looking place\r\nthough, for there was a strong, cheerful light in the bar window, which\r\nshed a bright ray across the road, and even lighted up the hedge on the\r\nother side; and there was a red flickering light in the opposite window,\r\none moment but faintly discernible, and the next gleaming strongly\r\nthrough the drawn curtains, which intimated that a rousing fire was\r\nblazing within. Marking these little evidences with the eye of an\r\nexperienced traveller, Tom dismounted with as much agility as his half-\r\nfrozen limbs would permit, and entered the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In less than five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time, Tom was ensconced in the room opposite\r\nthe bar--the very room where he had imagined the fire blazing--before a\r\nsubstantial, matter-of-fact, roaring fire, composed of something short\r\nof a bushel of coals, and wood enough to make half a dozen decent\r\ngooseberry bushes, piled half-way up the chimney, and roaring and\r\ncrackling with a sound that of itself would have warmed the heart of any\r\nreasonable man. This was comfortable, but this was not all; for a\r\nsmartly-dressed girl, with a bright eye and a neat ankle, was laying a\r\nvery clean white cloth on the table; and as Tom sat with his slippered\r\nfeet on the fender, and his back to the open door, he saw a charming\r\nprospect of the bar reflected in the glass over the chimney-piece, with\r\ndelightful rows of green bottles and gold labels, together with jars of\r\npickles and preserves, and cheeses and boiled hams, and rounds of beef,\r\narranged on shelves in the most tempting and delicious array. Well, this\r\nwas comfortable too; but even this was not all--for in the bar, seated\r\nat tea at the nicest possible little table, drawn close up before the\r\nbrightest possible little fire, was a buxom widow of somewhere about\r\neight-and-forty or thereabouts, with a face as comfortable as the bar,\r\nwho was evidently the landlady of the house, and the supreme ruler over\r\nall these agreeable possessions. There was only one drawback to the\r\nbeauty of the whole picture, and that was a tall man--a very tall man--\r\nin a brown coat and bright basket buttons, and black whiskers and wavy\r\nblack hair, who was seated at tea with the widow, and who it required no\r\ngreat penetration to discover was in a fair way of persuading her to be\r\na widow no longer, but to confer upon him the privilege of sitting down\r\nin that bar, for and during the whole remainder of the term of his\r\nnatural life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom Smart was by no means of an irritable or envious disposition, but\r\nsomehow or other the tall man with the brown coat and the bright basket\r\nbuttons did rouse what little gall he had in his composition, and did\r\nmake him feel extremely indignant, the more especially as he could now\r\nand then observe, from his seat before the glass, certain little\r\naffectionate familiarities passing between the tall man and the widow,\r\nwhich sufficiently denoted that the tall man was as high in favour as he\r\nwas in size. Tom was fond of hot punch--I may venture to say he was\r\n_very_ fond of hot punch--and after he had seen the vixenish mare well\r\nfed and well littered down, and had eaten every bit of the nice little\r\nhot dinner which the widow tossed up for him with her own hands, he just\r\nordered a tumbler of it by way of experiment. Now, if there was one\r\nthing in the whole range of domestic art, which the widow could\r\nmanufacture better than another, it was this identical article; and the\r\nfirst tumbler was adapted to Tom Smart\xe2\x80\x99s taste with such peculiar\r\nnicety, that he ordered a second with the least possible delay. Hot\r\npunch is a pleasant thing, gentlemen--an extremely pleasant thing under\r\nany circumstances--but in that snug old parlour, before the roaring\r\nfire, with the wind blowing outside till every timber in the old house\r\ncreaked again, Tom Smart found it perfectly delightful. He ordered\r\nanother tumbler, and then another--I am not quite certain whether he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t order another after that--but the more he drank of the hot punch,\r\nthe more he thought of the tall man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cConfound his impudence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat business has he in\r\nthat snug bar? Such an ugly villain too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the widow had\r\nany taste, she might surely pick up some better fellow than that.\xe2\x80\x9d Here\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s eye wandered from the glass on the chimney-piece to the glass on\r\nthe table; and as he felt himself becoming gradually sentimental, he\r\nemptied the fourth tumbler of punch and ordered a fifth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom Smart, gentlemen, had always been very much attached to the public\r\nline. It had been long his ambition to stand in a bar of his own, in a\r\ngreen coat, knee-cords, and tops. He had a great notion of taking the\r\nchair at convivial dinners, and he had often thought how well he could\r\npreside in a room of his own in the talking way, and what a capital\r\nexample he could set to his customers in the drinking department. All\r\nthese things passed rapidly through Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mind as he sat drinking the\r\nhot punch by the roaring fire, and he felt very justly and properly\r\nindignant that the tall man should be in a fair way of keeping such an\r\nexcellent house, while he, Tom Smart, was as far off from it as ever.\r\nSo, after deliberating over the two last tumblers, whether he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nperfect right to pick a quarrel with the tall man for having contrived\r\nto get into the good graces of the buxom widow, Tom Smart at last\r\narrived at the satisfactory conclusion that he was a very ill-used and\r\npersecuted individual, and had better go to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Up a wide and ancient staircase the smart girl preceded Tom, shading\r\nthe chamber candle with her hand, to protect it from the currents of air\r\nwhich in such a rambling old place might have found plenty of room to\r\ndisport themselves in, without blowing the candle out, but which did\r\nblow it out nevertheless--thus affording Tom\xe2\x80\x99s enemies an opportunity of\r\nasserting that it was he, and not the wind, who extinguished the candle,\r\nand that while he pretended to be blowing it alight again, he was in\r\nfact kissing the girl. Be this as it may, another light was obtained,\r\nand Tom was conducted through a maze of rooms, and a labyrinth of\r\npassages, to the apartment which had been prepared for his reception,\r\nwhere the girl bade him good-night and left him alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a good large room with big closets, and a bed which might have\r\nserved for a whole boarding-school, to say nothing of a couple of oaken\r\npresses that would have held the baggage of a small army; but what\r\nstruck Tom\xe2\x80\x99s fancy most was a strange, grim-looking, high backed chair,\r\ncarved in the most fantastic manner, with a flowered damask cushion, and\r\nthe round knobs at the bottom of the legs carefully tied up in red\r\ncloth, as if it had got the gout in its toes. Of any other queer chair,\r\nTom would only have thought it was a queer chair, and there would have\r\nbeen an end of the matter; but there was something about this particular\r\nchair, and yet he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what it was, so odd and so unlike any\r\nother piece of furniture he had ever seen, that it seemed to fascinate\r\nhim. He sat down before the fire, and stared at the old chair for half\r\nan hour.--Damn the chair, it was such a strange old thing, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake his eyes off it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, slowly undressing himself, and staring at the old\r\nchair all the while, which stood with a mysterious aspect by the\r\nbedside, \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such a rum concern as that in my days. Very odd,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Tom, who had got rather sage with the hot punch--\xe2\x80\x9cvery odd.\xe2\x80\x9d Tom\r\nshook his head with an air of profound wisdom, and looked at the chair\r\nagain. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make anything of it though, so he got into bed,\r\ncovered himself up warm, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In about half an hour, Tom woke up with a start, from a confused dream\r\nof tall men and tumblers of punch; and the first object that presented\r\nitself to his waking imagination was the queer chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t look at it any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom to himself, and he squeezed his\r\neyelids together, and tried to persuade himself he was going to sleep\r\nagain. No use; nothing but queer chairs danced before his eyes, kicking\r\nup their legs, jumping over each other\xe2\x80\x99s backs, and playing all kinds of\r\nantics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I may as well see one real chair, as two or three complete sets of\r\nfalse ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, bringing out his head from under the bedclothes.\r\nThere it was, plainly discernible by the light of the fire, looking as\r\nprovoking as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom gazed at the chair; and, suddenly as he looked at it, a most\r\nextraordinary change seemed to come over it. The carving of the back\r\ngradually assumed the lineaments and expression of an old, shrivelled\r\nhuman face; the damask cushion became an antique, flapped waistcoat; the\r\nround knobs grew into a couple of feet, encased in red cloth slippers;\r\nand the whole chair looked like a very ugly old man, of the previous\r\ncentury, with his arms akimbo. Tom sat up in bed, and rubbed his eyes to\r\ndispel the illusion. No. The chair was an ugly old gentleman; and what\r\nwas more, he was winking at Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom was naturally a headlong, careless sort of dog, and he had had five\r\ntumblers of hot punch into the bargain; so, although he was a little\r\nstartled at first, he began to grow rather indignant when he saw the old\r\ngentleman winking and leering at him with such an impudent air. At\r\nlength he resolved that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it; and as the old face still\r\nkept winking away as fast as ever, Tom said, in a very angry tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil are you winking at me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I like it, Tom Smart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chair; or the old gentleman,\r\nwhichever you like to call him. He stopped winking though, when Tom\r\nspoke, and began grinning like a superannuated monkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know my name, old nut-cracker face?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tom Smart,\r\nrather staggered; though he pretended to carry it off so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not the way to\r\naddress solid Spanish mahogany. Damme, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t treat me with less\r\nrespect if I was veneered.\xe2\x80\x9d When the old gentleman said this, he looked\r\nso fierce that Tom began to grow frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to treat you with any disrespect, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in a\r\nmuch humbler tone than he had spoken in at first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps not--perhaps not. Tom--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSir--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI know everything about you, Tom; everything. You\xe2\x80\x99re very poor, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how came you to know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re much too fond of\r\npunch, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom Smart was just on the point of protesting that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tasted a\r\ndrop since his last birthday, but when his eye encountered that of the\r\nold gentleman he looked so knowing that Tom blushed, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthe widow\xe2\x80\x99s a fine woman--remarkably\r\nfine woman--eh, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d Here the old fellow screwed up his eyes, cocked up\r\none of his wasted little legs, and looked altogether so unpleasantly\r\namorous, that Tom was quite disgusted with the levity of his behaviour--\r\nat his time of life, too!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI am her guardian, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAre you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI knew her mother, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old fellow: \xe2\x80\x9cand her grandmother.\r\nShe was very fond of me--made me this waistcoat, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDid she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old fellow, lifting up one of the red cloth\r\nmufflers; \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, Tom. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to have it known\r\nthat she was so much attached to me. It might occasion some\r\nunpleasantness in the family.\xe2\x80\x9d When the old rascal said this, he looked\r\nso extremely impertinent, that, as Tom Smart afterwards declared, he\r\ncould have sat upon him without remorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI have been a great favourite among the women in my time, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe profligate old debauchee; \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of fine women have sat in my lap\r\nfor hours together. What do you think of that, you dog, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d The old\r\ngentleman was proceeding to recount some other exploits of his youth,\r\nwhen he was seized with such a violent fit of creaking that he was\r\nunable to proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cJust serves you right, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Tom Smart; but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a good deal troubled with this now. I\r\nam getting old, Tom, and have lost nearly all my nails. I have had an\r\noperation performed, too--a small piece let into my back--and I found it\r\na severe trial, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you did, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. Tom! I want\r\nyou to marry the widow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMe, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBless your reverend locks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom (he had a few scattered horse-\r\nhairs left)--\xe2\x80\x9cbless your reverend locks, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have me.\xe2\x80\x9d And Tom\r\nsighed involuntarily, as he thought of the bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else in the wind. A tall man--a\r\nconfoundedly tall man--with black whiskers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cshe will never have him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you stood in the bar, old gentleman, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntell another story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe kissing behind the door, and all that sort of thing, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe old gentleman. And here he gave another impudent look, which made\r\nTom very wroth, because as you all know, gentlemen, to hear an old\r\nfellow, who ought to know better, talking about these things, is very\r\nunpleasant--nothing more so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI know all about that, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen it\r\ndone very often in my time, Tom, between more people than I should like\r\nto mention to you; but it never came to anything after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have seen some queer things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, with an inquisitive\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou may say that, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old fellow, with a very\r\ncomplicated wink. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the last of my family, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\ngentleman, with a melancholy sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a large one?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThere were twelve of us, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cfine,\r\nstraight-backed, handsome fellows as you\xe2\x80\x99d wish to see. None of your\r\nmodern abortions--all with arms, and with a degree of polish, though I\r\nsay it that should not, which it would have done your heart good to\r\nbehold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s become of the others, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tom Smart--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old gentleman applied his elbow to his eye as he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cGone,\r\nTom, gone. We had hard service, Tom, and they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t all my\r\nconstitution. They got rheumatic about the legs and arms, and went into\r\nkitchens and other hospitals; and one of \xe2\x80\x98em, with long service and hard\r\nusage, positively lost his senses--he got so crazy that he was obliged\r\nto be burnt. Shocking thing that, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old fellow paused for a few minutes, apparently struggling with his\r\nfeelings of emotion, and then said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, Tom, I am wandering from the point. This tall man, Tom, is a\r\nrascally adventurer. The moment he married the widow, he would sell off\r\nall the furniture, and run away. What would be the consequence? She\r\nwould be deserted and reduced to ruin, and I should catch my death of\r\ncold in some broker\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cOf you, Tom, I entertain\r\na very different opinion; for I well know that if you once settled\r\nyourself in a public-house, you would never leave it, as long as there\r\nwas anything to drink within its walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you for your good opinion, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom\r\nSmart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the old gentleman, in a dictatorial tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nshall have her, and he shall not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to prevent it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThis disclosure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9che is already married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I prove it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, starting half out of bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old gentleman untucked his arm from his side, and having pointed to\r\none of the oaken presses, immediately replaced it, in its old position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe little thinks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in the right-hand\r\npocket of a pair of trousers in that press, he has left a letter,\r\nentreating him to return to his disconsolate wife, with six--mark me,\r\nTom--six babes, and all of them small ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the old gentleman solemnly uttered these words, his features grew\r\nless and less distinct, and his figure more shadowy. A film came over\r\nTom Smart\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. The old man seemed gradually blending into the chair,\r\nthe damask waistcoat to resolve into a cushion, the red slippers to\r\nshrink into little red cloth bags. The light faded gently away, and Tom\r\nSmart fell back on his pillow, and dropped asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Morning aroused Tom from the lethargic slumber, into which he had\r\nfallen on the disappearance of the old man. He sat up in bed, and for\r\nsome minutes vainly endeavoured to recall the events of the preceding\r\nnight. Suddenly they rushed upon him. He looked at the chair; it was a\r\nfantastic and grim-looking piece of furniture, certainly, but it must\r\nhave been a remarkably ingenious and lively imagination, that could have\r\ndiscovered any resemblance between it and an old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, old boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. He was bolder in the daylight--most\r\nmen are.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The chair remained motionless, and spoke not a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMiserable morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. No. The chair would not be drawn into\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhich press did you point to?--you can tell me that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. Devil\r\na word, gentlemen, the chair would say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not much trouble to open it, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, getting out of\r\nbed very deliberately. He walked up to one of the presses. The key was\r\nin the lock; he turned it, and opened the door. There was a pair of\r\ntrousers there. He put his hand into the pocket, and drew forth the\r\nidentical letter the old gentleman had described!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cQueer sort of thing, this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart, looking first at the chair\r\nand then at the press, and then at the letter, and then at the chair\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cVery queer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. But, as there was nothing in either, to\r\nlessen the queerness, he thought he might as well dress himself, and\r\nsettle the tall man\xe2\x80\x99s business at once--just to put him out of his\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom surveyed the rooms he passed through, on his way downstairs, with\r\nthe scrutinising eye of a landlord; thinking it not impossible, that\r\nbefore long, they and their contents would be his property. The tall man\r\nwas standing in the snug little bar, with his hands behind him, quite at\r\nhome. He grinned vacantly at Tom. A casual observer might have supposed\r\nhe did it, only to show his white teeth; but Tom Smart thought that a\r\nconsciousness of triumph was passing through the place where the tall\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s mind would have been, if he had had any. Tom laughed in his face;\r\nand summoned the landlady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart, closing the door of the little\r\nparlour as the widow entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you take for breakfast,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom was thinking how he should open the case, so he made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice ham,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, \xe2\x80\x9cand a beautiful cold larded\r\nfowl. Shall I send \xe2\x80\x98em in, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These words roused Tom from his reflections. His admiration of the\r\nwidow increased as she spoke. Thoughtful creature! Comfortable provider!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that gentleman in the bar, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is Jinkins, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, slightly blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a tall man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very fine man, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the widow, \xe2\x80\x9cand a very nice\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything more you want, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the widow, rather\r\npuzzled by Tom\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, will you have the kindness to sit\r\ndown for one moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The widow looked much amazed, but she sat down, and Tom sat down too,\r\nclose beside her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it happened, gentlemen--indeed my\r\nuncle used to tell me that Tom Smart said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how it happened\r\neither--but somehow or other the palm of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s hand fell upon the back\r\nof the widow\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and remained there while he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart--he had always a great notion of\r\ncommitting the amiable--\xe2\x80\x9cmy dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you deserve a very excellent\r\nhusband--you do indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLor, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow--as well she might; Tom\xe2\x80\x99s mode of commencing\r\nthe conversation being rather unusual, not to say startling; the fact of\r\nhis never having set eyes upon her before the previous night being taken\r\ninto consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cLor, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI scorn to flatter, my dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart. \xe2\x80\x9cYou deserve a\r\nvery admirable husband, and whoever he is, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a very lucky man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n As Tom said this, his eye involuntarily wandered from the widow\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nto the comfort around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The widow looked more puzzled than ever, and made an effort to rise.\r\nTom gently pressed her hand, as if to detain her, and she kept her seat.\r\nWidows, gentlemen, are not usually timorous, as my uncle used to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I am very much obliged to you, Sir, for your good opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the buxom landlady, half laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cand if ever I marry again--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d_If_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart, looking very shrewdly out of the right-hand\r\ncorner of his left eye. \xe2\x80\x9c_If_--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, laughing outright this time, \xe2\x80\x9c_when _I do, I\r\nhope I shall have as good a husband as you describe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cJinkins, to wit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLor, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cI know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure nobody who knows him, knows anything bad of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwidow, bridling up at the mysterious air with which Tom had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHem!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The widow began to think it was high time to cry, so she took out her\r\nhandkerchief, and inquired whether Tom wished to insult her, whether he\r\nthought it like a gentleman to take away the character of another\r\ngentleman behind his back, why, if he had got anything to say, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay it to the man, like a man, instead of terrifying a poor weak woman\r\nin that way; and so forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say it to him fast enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9conly I want you to hear it\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the widow, looking intently in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll astonish you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, putting his hand in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is, that he wants money,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that already,\r\nand you needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, nonsense, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Tom Smart, \xe2\x80\x9cI want money. \xe2\x80\x98Tain\xe2\x80\x99t that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, what can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the poor widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart. He slowly drew forth the letter,\r\nand unfolded it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t scream?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the widow; \xe2\x80\x9clet me see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t go fainting away, or any of that nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the widow hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t run out, and blow him up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99ll do all\r\nthat for you. You had better not exert yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, \xe2\x80\x9clet me see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tom Smart; and, with these words, he placed the\r\nletter in the widow\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, I have heard my uncle say, that Tom Smart said the widow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlamentations when she heard the disclosure would have pierced a heart of\r\nstone. Tom was certainly very tender-hearted, but they pierced his, to\r\nthe very core. The widow rocked herself to and fro, and wrung her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the deception and villainy of the man!\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFrightful, my dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am; but compose yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t compose myself,\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the widow. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never find\r\nanyone else I can love so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes you will, my dear soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Smart, letting fall a shower\r\nof the largest-sized tears, in pity for the widow\xe2\x80\x99s misfortunes. Tom\r\nSmart, in the energy of his compassion, had put his arm round the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s waist; and the widow, in a passion of grief, had clasped Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. She looked up in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s face, and smiled through her tears. Tom\r\nlooked down in hers, and smiled through his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never could find out, gentlemen, whether Tom did or did not kiss the\r\nwidow at that particular moment. He used to tell my uncle he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but\r\nI have my doubts about it. Between ourselves, gentlemen, I rather think\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At all events, Tom kicked the very tall man out at the front door half\r\nan hour later, and married the widow a month after. And he used to drive\r\nabout the country, with the clay-coloured gig with the red wheels, and\r\nthe vixenish mare with the fast pace, till he gave up business many\r\nyears afterwards, and went to France with his wife; and then the old\r\nhouse was pulled down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to ask you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the inquisitive old gentleman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what became of the chair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the one-eyed bagman, \xe2\x80\x98it was observed to creak very much\r\non the day of the wedding; but Tom Smart couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say for certain\r\nwhether it was with pleasure or bodily infirmity. He rather thought it\r\nwas the latter, though, for it never spoke afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody believed the story, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99 said the dirty-faced man,\r\nrefilling his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except Tom\xe2\x80\x99s enemies,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the bagman. \xe2\x80\x98Some of \xe2\x80\x98em said Tom\r\ninvented it altogether; and others said he was drunk and fancied it, and\r\ngot hold of the wrong trousers by mistake before he went to bed. But\r\nnobody ever minded what _they _said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom Smart said it was all true?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your uncle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They must have been very nice men, both of \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dirty-faced\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, they were,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the bagman; \xe2\x80\x98very nice men indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. IN WHICH IS GIVEN A FAITHFUL PORTRAITURE OF TWO\r\nDISTINGUISHED PERSONS; AND AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC BREAKFAST\r\nIN THEIR HOUSE AND GROUNDS: WHICH PUBLIC BREAKFAST LEADS TO THE\r\nRECOGNITION OF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE, AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANOTHER\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s conscience had been somewhat reproaching him for his\r\nrecent neglect of his friends at the Peacock; and he was just on the\r\npoint of walking forth in quest of them, on the third morning after the\r\nelection had terminated, when his faithful valet put into his hand a\r\ncard, on which was engraved the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Leo Hunter THE DEN. EATANSWILL.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Person\xe2\x80\x99s a-waitin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, epigrammatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does the person want me, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wants you partickler; and no one else \xe2\x80\x98ll do, as the devil\xe2\x80\x99s private\r\nsecretary said ven he fetched avay Doctor Faustus,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_He_. Is it a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A wery good imitation o\xe2\x80\x99 one, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this is a lady\xe2\x80\x99s card,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Given me by a gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, howsoever,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and he\xe2\x80\x99s a-waitin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin the drawing-room--said he\xe2\x80\x99d rather wait all day, than not see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, on hearing this determination, descended to the drawing-\r\nroom, where sat a grave man, who started up on his entrance, and said,\r\nwith an air of profound respect:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, I presume?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Allow me, Sir, the honour of grasping your hand. Permit me, Sir, to\r\nshake it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grave man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. The stranger shook the extended hand,\r\nand then continued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have heard of your fame, sir. The noise of your antiquarian\r\ndiscussion has reached the ears of Mrs. Leo Hunter--my wife, sir; I am\r\nMr. Leo Hunter\xe2\x80\x99--the stranger paused, as if he expected that Mr.\r\nPickwick would be overcome by the disclosure; but seeing that he\r\nremained perfectly calm, proceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My wife, sir--Mrs. Leo Hunter--is proud to number among her\r\nacquaintance all those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their\r\nworks and talents. Permit me, sir, to place in a conspicuous part of the\r\nlist the name of Mr. Pickwick, and his brother-members of the club that\r\nderives its name from him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be extremely happy to make the acquaintance of such a lady,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You _shall _make it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grave man. \xe2\x80\x98To-morrow morning, sir,\r\nwe give a public breakfast--a _fete champetre_--to a great number of\r\nthose who have rendered themselves celebrated by their works and\r\ntalents. Permit Mrs. Leo Hunter, Sir, to have the gratification of\r\nseeing you at the Den.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Leo Hunter has many of these breakfasts, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the new\r\nacquaintance--\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cfeasts of reason,\xe2\x80\x9d sir, \xe2\x80\x9cand flows of soul,\xe2\x80\x9d as somebody\r\nwho wrote a sonnet to Mrs. Leo Hunter on her breakfasts, feelingly and\r\noriginally observed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was _he_ celebrated for his works and talents?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the grave man, \xe2\x80\x98all Mrs. Leo Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintances are; it is her ambition, sir, to have no other\r\nacquaintance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a very noble ambition,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I inform Mrs. Leo Hunter, that that remark fell from your lips,\r\nsir, she will indeed be proud,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grave man. \xe2\x80\x98You have a\r\ngentleman in your train, who has produced some beautiful little poems, I\r\nthink, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend Mr. Snodgrass has a great taste for poetry,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So has Mrs. Leo Hunter, Sir. She dotes on poetry, sir. She adores it; I\r\nmay say that her whole soul and mind are wound up, and entwined with it.\r\nShe has produced some delightful pieces, herself, sir. You may have met\r\nwith her \xe2\x80\x9cOde to an Expiring Frog,\xe2\x80\x9d sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You astonish me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Leo Hunter. \xe2\x80\x98It created an immense\r\nsensation. It was signed with an \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x9d and eight stars, and appeared\r\noriginally in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s magazine. It commenced--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCan I view thee panting, lying On thy stomach, without sighing; Can I\r\nunmoved see thee dying On a log Expiring frog!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beautiful!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Leo Hunter; \xe2\x80\x98so simple.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The next verse is still more touching. Shall I repeat it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It runs thus,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grave man, still more gravely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSay, have fiends in shape of boys, With wild halloo, and brutal noise,\r\nHunted thee from marshy joys, With a dog, Expiring frog!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Finely expressed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All point, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Leo Hunter; \xe2\x80\x98but you shall hear Mrs. Leo\r\nHunter repeat it. She can do justice to it, Sir. She will repeat it, in\r\ncharacter, Sir, to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In character!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As Minerva. But I forgot--it\xe2\x80\x99s a fancy-dress _dejeune_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, glancing at his own figure--\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t, sir; can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Leo Hunter. \xe2\x80\x98Solomon Lucas, the Jew\r\nin the High Street, has thousands of fancy-dresses. Consider, Sir, how\r\nmany appropriate characters are open for your selection. Plato, Zeno,\r\nEpicurus, Pythagoras--all founders of clubs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but as I cannot put myself in\r\ncompetition with those great men, I cannot presume to wear their\r\ndresses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe grave man considered deeply, for a few seconds, and then said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On reflection, Sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it would not afford Mrs. Leo\r\nHunter greater pleasure, if her guests saw a gentleman of your celebrity\r\nin his own costume, rather than in an assumed one. I may venture to\r\npromise an exception in your case, sir--yes, I am quite certain that, on\r\nbehalf of Mrs. Leo Hunter, I may venture to do so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I shall have great pleasure in\r\ncoming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I waste your time, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grave man, as if suddenly\r\nrecollecting himself. \xe2\x80\x98I know its value, sir. I will not detain you. I\r\nmay tell Mrs. Leo Hunter, then, that she may confidently expect you and\r\nyour distinguished friends? Good-morning, Sir, I am proud to have beheld\r\nso eminent a personage--not a step sir; not a word.\xe2\x80\x99 And without giving\r\nMr. Pickwick time to offer remonstrance or denial, Mr. Leo Hunter\r\nstalked gravely away.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick took up his hat, and repaired to the Peacock, but Mr.\r\nWinkle had conveyed the intelligence of the fancy-ball there, before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s going,\xe2\x80\x99 were the first words with which he saluted his\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As Apollo,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98Only Pott objects to the tunic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is right. He is quite right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; so she\xe2\x80\x99s going to wear a white satin gown with gold spangles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly know what she\xe2\x80\x99s meant for; will they?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nSnodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course they will,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle indignantly. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll see her\r\nlyre, won\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True; I forgot that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall go as a bandit,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a sudden start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a bandit,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Tupman, mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, gazing with solemn sternness\r\nat his friend--\xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, Mr. Tupman, that it is your\r\nintention to put yourself into a green velvet jacket, with a two-inch\r\ntail?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such _is_ my intention, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman warmly. \xe2\x80\x98And why not,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, considerably excited--\xe2\x80\x98because you\r\nare too old, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too old!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And if any further ground of objection be wanting,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98you are too fat, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, his face suffused with a crimson glow, \xe2\x80\x98this is\r\nan insult.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x98it is not half the\r\ninsult to you, that your appearance in my presence in a green velvet\r\njacket, with a two-inch tail, would be to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re another!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman advanced a step or two, and glared at Mr. Pickwick. Mr.\r\nPickwick returned the glare, concentrated into a focus by means of his\r\nspectacles, and breathed a bold defiance. Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle\r\nlooked on, petrified at beholding such a scene between two such men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, after a short pause, speaking in a low, deep\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x98you have called me old.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And fat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I reiterate the charge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a fearful pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My attachment to your person, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, speaking in a\r\nvoice tremulous with emotion, and tucking up his wristbands meanwhile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98is great--very great--but upon that person, I must take summary\r\nvengeance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come on, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. Stimulated by the exciting nature\r\nof the dialogue, the heroic man actually threw himself into a paralytic\r\nattitude, confidently supposed by the two bystanders to have been\r\nintended as a posture of defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass, suddenly recovering the power of\r\nspeech, of which intense astonishment had previously bereft him, and\r\nrushing between the two, at the imminent hazard of receiving an\r\napplication on the temple from each--\xe2\x80\x98what! Mr. Pickwick, with the eyes\r\nof the world upon you! Mr. Tupman! who, in common with us all, derives a\r\nlustre from his undying name! For shame, gentlemen; for shame.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe unwonted lines which momentary passion had ruled in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclear and open brow, gradually melted away, as his young friend spoke,\r\nlike the marks of a black-lead pencil beneath the softening influence of\r\nindia-rubber. His countenance had resumed its usual benign expression,\r\nere he concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been hasty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98very hasty. Tupman; your hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dark shadow passed from Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s face, as he warmly grasped the\r\nhand of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been hasty, too,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98the fault was mine. You will wear\r\nthe green velvet jacket?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To oblige me, you will,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly settled that Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, should all wear fancy-dresses. Thus Mr. Pickwick was led by\r\nthe very warmth of his own good feelings to give his consent to a\r\nproceeding from which his better judgment would have recoiled--a more\r\nstriking illustration of his amiable character could hardly have been\r\nconceived, even if the events recorded in these pages had been wholly\r\nimaginary.\r\n\r\nMr. Leo Hunter had not exaggerated the resources of Mr. Solomon Lucas.\r\nHis wardrobe was extensive--very extensive--not strictly classical\r\nperhaps, not quite new, nor did it contain any one garment made\r\nprecisely after the fashion of any age or time, but everything was more\r\nor less spangled; and what can be prettier than spangles! It may be\r\nobjected that they are not adapted to the daylight, but everybody knows\r\nthat they would glitter if there were lamps; and nothing can be clearer\r\nthan that if people give fancy-balls in the day-time, and the dresses do\r\nnot show quite as well as they would by night, the fault lies solely\r\nwith the people who give the fancy-balls, and is in no wise chargeable\r\non the spangles. Such was the convincing reasoning of Mr. Solomon Lucas;\r\nand influenced by such arguments did Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr.\r\nSnodgrass engage to array themselves in costumes which his taste and\r\nexperience induced him to recommend as admirably suited to the occasion.\r\n\r\nA carriage was hired from the Town Arms, for the accommodation of the\r\nPickwickians, and a chariot was ordered from the same repository, for\r\nthe purpose of conveying Mr. and Mrs. Pott to Mrs. Leo Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s grounds,\r\nwhich Mr. Pott, as a delicate acknowledgment of having received an\r\ninvitation, had already confidently predicted in the Eatanswill\r\n_Gazette_ \xe2\x80\x98would present a scene of varied and delicious enchantment--a\r\nbewildering coruscation of beauty and talent--a lavish and prodigal\r\ndisplay of hospitality--above all, a degree of splendour softened by the\r\nmost exquisite taste; and adornment refined with perfect harmony and the\r\nchastest good keeping--compared with which, the fabled gorgeousness of\r\nEastern fairyland itself would appear to be clothed in as many dark and\r\nmurky colours, as must be the mind of the splenetic and unmanly being\r\nwho could presume to taint with the venom of his envy, the preparations\r\nmade by the virtuous and highly distinguished lady at whose shrine this\r\nhumble tribute of admiration was offered.\xe2\x80\x99 This last was a piece of\r\nbiting sarcasm against the _Independent_, who, in consequence of not\r\nhaving been invited at all, had been, through four numbers, affecting to\r\nsneer at the whole affair, in his very largest type, with all the\r\nadjectives in capital letters.\r\n\r\nThe morning came: it was a pleasant sight to behold Mr. Tupman in full\r\nbrigand\xe2\x80\x99s costume, with a very tight jacket, sitting like a pincushion\r\nover his back and shoulders, the upper portion of his legs incased in\r\nthe velvet shorts, and the lower part thereof swathed in the complicated\r\nbandages to which all brigands are peculiarly attached. It was pleasing\r\nto see his open and ingenuous countenance, well mustachioed and corked,\r\nlooking out from an open shirt collar; and to contemplate the sugar-loaf\r\nhat, decorated with ribbons of all colours, which he was compelled to\r\ncarry on his knee, inasmuch as no known conveyance with a top to it,\r\nwould admit of any man\xe2\x80\x99s carrying it between his head and the roof.\r\nEqually humorous and agreeable was the appearance of Mr. Snodgrass in\r\nblue satin trunks and cloak, white silk tights and shoes, and Grecian\r\nhelmet, which everybody knows (and if they do not, Mr. Solomon Lucas\r\ndid) to have been the regular, authentic, everyday costume of a\r\ntroubadour, from the earliest ages down to the time of their final\r\ndisappearance from the face of the earth. All this was pleasant, but\r\nthis was as nothing compared with the shouting of the populace when the\r\ncarriage drew up, behind Mr. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s chariot, which chariot itself drew\r\nup at Mr. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s door, which door itself opened, and displayed the great\r\nPott accoutred as a Russian officer of justice, with a tremendous knout\r\nin his hand--tastefully typical of the stern and mighty power of the\r\nEatanswill _Gazette_, and the fearful lashings it bestowed on public\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass from the passage, when\r\nthey beheld the walking allegory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick was heard to exclaim, from the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hoo-roar Pott!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted the populace. Amid these salutations, Mr. Pott,\r\nsmiling with that kind of bland dignity which sufficiently testified\r\nthat he felt his power, and knew how to exert it, got into the chariot.\r\n\r\nThen there emerged from the house, Mrs. Pott, who would have looked very\r\nlike Apollo if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a gown on, conducted by Mr. Winkle, who,\r\nin his light-red coat could not possibly have been mistaken for anything\r\nbut a sportsman, if he had not borne an equal resemblance to a general\r\npostman. Last of all came Mr. Pickwick, whom the boys applauded as loud\r\nas anybody, probably under the impression that his tights and gaiters\r\nwere some remnants of the dark ages; and then the two vehicles proceeded\r\ntowards Mrs. Leo Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s; Mr. Weller (who was to assist in waiting)\r\nbeing stationed on the box of that in which his master was seated.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the men, women, boys, girls, and babies, who were assembled\r\nto see the visitors in their fancy-dresses, screamed with delight and\r\necstasy, when Mr. Pickwick, with the brigand on one arm, and the\r\ntroubadour on the other, walked solemnly up the entrance. Never were\r\nsuch shouts heard as those which greeted Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to fix the\r\nsugar-loaf hat on his head, by way of entering the garden in style.\r\n\r\nThe preparations were on the most delightful scale; fully realising the\r\nprophetic Pott\xe2\x80\x99s anticipations about the gorgeousness of Eastern\r\nfairyland, and at once affording a sufficient contradiction to the\r\nmalignant statements of the reptile _Independent_. The grounds were more\r\nthan an acre and a quarter in extent, and they were filled with people!\r\nNever was such a blaze of beauty, and fashion, and literature. There was\r\nthe young lady who \xe2\x80\x98did\xe2\x80\x99 the poetry in the Eatanswill _Gazette_, in the\r\ngarb of a sultana, leaning upon the arm of the young gentleman who \xe2\x80\x98did\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe review department, and who was appropriately habited in a field-\r\nmarshal\xe2\x80\x99s uniform--the boots excepted. There were hosts of these\r\ngeniuses, and any reasonable person would have thought it honour enough\r\nto meet them. But more than these, there were half a dozen lions from\r\nLondon--authors, real authors, who had written whole books, and printed\r\nthem afterwards--and here you might see \xe2\x80\x98em, walking about, like\r\nordinary men, smiling, and talking--aye, and talking pretty considerable\r\nnonsense too, no doubt with the benign intention of rendering themselves\r\nintelligible to the common people about them. Moreover, there was a band\r\nof music in pasteboard caps; four something-ean singers in the costume\r\nof their country, and a dozen hired waiters in the costume of _their\r\n_country--and very dirty costume too. And above all, there was Mrs. Leo\r\nHunter in the character of Minerva, receiving the company, and\r\noverflowing with pride and gratification at the notion of having called\r\nsuch distinguished individuals together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said a servant, as that gentleman approached the\r\npresiding goddess, with his hat in his hand, and the brigand and\r\ntroubadour on either arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Where!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter, starting up, in an affected\r\nrapture of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible that I have really the gratification of beholding Mr.\r\nPickwick himself!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mrs. Leo Hunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No other, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, bowing very low. \xe2\x80\x98Permit me to\r\nintroduce my friends--Mr. Tupman--Mr. Winkle--Mr. Snodgrass--to the\r\nauthoress of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Expiring Frog.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery few people but those who have tried it, know what a difficult\r\nprocess it is to bow in green velvet smalls, and a tight jacket, and\r\nhigh-crowned hat; or in blue satin trunks and white silks, or knee-cords\r\nand top-boots that were never made for the wearer, and have been fixed\r\nupon him without the remotest reference to the comparative dimensions of\r\nhimself and the suit. Never were such distortions as Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s frame\r\nunderwent in his efforts to appear easy and graceful--never was such\r\ningenious posturing, as his fancy-dressed friends exhibited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leo Hunter, \xe2\x80\x98I must make you promise not to\r\nstir from my side the whole day. There are hundreds of people here, that\r\nI must positively introduce you to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very kind, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the first place, here are my little girls; I had almost forgotten\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x99 said Minerva, carelessly pointing towards a couple of full-grown\r\nyoung ladies, of whom one might be about twenty, and the other a year or\r\ntwo older, and who were dressed in very juvenile costumes--whether to\r\nmake them look young, or their mamma younger, Mr. Pickwick does not\r\ndistinctly inform us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as the juveniles turned\r\naway, after being presented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are very like their mamma, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, majestically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you naughty man,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter, playfully tapping the\r\neditor\xe2\x80\x99s arm with her fan (Minerva with a fan!).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why now, my dear Mrs. Hunter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, who was trumpeter in\r\nordinary at the Den, \xe2\x80\x98you know that when your picture was in the\r\nexhibition of the Royal Academy, last year, everybody inquired whether\r\nit was intended for you, or your youngest daughter; for you were so much\r\nalike that there was no telling the difference between you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and if they did, why need you repeat it, before strangers?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs. Leo Hunter, bestowing another tap on the slumbering lion of the\r\nEatanswill _Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Count, count,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed Mrs. Leo Hunter to a well-whiskered individual\r\nin a foreign uniform, who was passing by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you want me?\xe2\x80\x99 said the count, turning back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to introduce two very clever people to each other,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nLeo Hunter. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, I have great pleasure in introducing you to\r\nCount Smorltork.\xe2\x80\x99 She added in a hurried whisper to Mr. Pickwick--\xe2\x80\x98The\r\nfamous foreigner--gathering materials for his great work on England--\r\nhem!--Count Smorltork, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick saluted the count with all the reverence due to so great a\r\nman, and the count drew forth a set of tablets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What you say, Mrs. Hunt?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the count, smiling graciously on the\r\ngratified Mrs. Leo Hunter, \xe2\x80\x98Pig Vig or Big Vig--what you call--lawyer--\r\neh? I see--that is it. Big Vig\xe2\x80\x99--and the count was proceeding to enter\r\nMr. Pickwick in his tablets, as a gentleman of the long robe, who\r\nderived his name from the profession to which he belonged, when Mrs. Leo\r\nHunter interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, count,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, \xe2\x80\x98Pick-wick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, ah, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the count. \xe2\x80\x98Peek--christian name; Weeks--\r\nsurname; good, ver good. Peek Weeks. How you do, Weeks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite well, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, with all his usual\r\naffability. \xe2\x80\x98Have you been long in England?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Long--ver long time--fortnight--more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you stay here long?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will have enough to do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick smiling, \xe2\x80\x98to gather all\r\nthe materials you want in that time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh, they are gathered,\xe2\x80\x99 said the count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are here,\xe2\x80\x99 added the count, tapping his forehead significantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Large book at home--full of notes--music, picture, science, potry,\r\npoltic; all tings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The word politics, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98comprises in itself, a\r\ndifficult study of no inconsiderable magnitude.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the count, drawing out the tablets again, \xe2\x80\x98ver good--fine\r\nwords to begin a chapter. Chapter forty-seven. Poltics. The word poltic\r\nsurprises by himself--\xe2\x80\x99 And down went Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s remark, in Count\r\nSmorltork\xe2\x80\x99s tablets, with such variations and additions as the count\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexuberant fancy suggested, or his imperfect knowledge of the language\r\noccasioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Count,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leo Hunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Hunt,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Mr. Snodgrass, a friend of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s, and a poet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the count, bringing out the tablets once more. \xe2\x80\x98Head,\r\npotry--chapter, literary friends--name, Snowgrass; ver good. Introduced\r\nto Snowgrass--great poet, friend of Peek Weeks--by Mrs. Hunt, which\r\nwrote other sweet poem--what is that name?--Fog--Perspiring Fog--ver\r\ngood--ver good indeed.\xe2\x80\x99 And the count put up his tablets, and with\r\nsundry bows and acknowledgments walked away, thoroughly satisfied that\r\nhe had made the most important and valuable additions to his stock of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wonderful man, Count Smorltork,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leo Hunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sound philosopher,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clear-headed, strong-minded person,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nA chorus of bystanders took up the shout of Count Smorltork\xe2\x80\x99s praise,\r\nshook their heads sagely, and unanimously cried, \xe2\x80\x98Very!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the enthusiasm in Count Smorltork\xe2\x80\x99s favour ran very high, his praises\r\nmight have been sung until the end of the festivities, if the four\r\nsomething-ean singers had not ranged themselves in front of a small\r\napple-tree, to look picturesque, and commenced singing their national\r\nsongs, which appeared by no means difficult of execution, inasmuch as\r\nthe grand secret seemed to be, that three of the something-ean singers\r\nshould grunt, while the fourth howled. This interesting performance\r\nhaving concluded amidst the loud plaudits of the whole company, a boy\r\nforthwith proceeded to entangle himself with the rails of a chair, and\r\nto jump over it, and crawl under it, and fall down with it, and do\r\neverything but sit upon it, and then to make a cravat of his legs, and\r\ntie them round his neck, and then to illustrate the ease with which a\r\nhuman being can be made to look like a magnified toad--all which feats\r\nyielded high delight and satisfaction to the assembled spectators. After\r\nwhich, the voice of Mrs. Pott was heard to chirp faintly forth,\r\nsomething which courtesy interpreted into a song, which was all very\r\nclassical, and strictly in character, because Apollo was himself a\r\ncomposer, and composers can very seldom sing their own music or anybody\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s, either. This was succeeded by Mrs. Leo Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of\r\nher far-famed \xe2\x80\x98Ode to an Expiring Frog,\xe2\x80\x99 which was encored once, and\r\nwould have been encored twice, if the major part of the guests, who\r\nthought it was high time to get something to eat, had not said that it\r\nwas perfectly shameful to take advantage of Mrs. Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s good nature.\r\nSo although Mrs. Leo Hunter professed her perfect willingness to recite\r\nthe ode again, her kind and considerate friends wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of it on\r\nany account; and the refreshment room being thrown open, all the people\r\nwho had ever been there before, scrambled in with all possible despatch-\r\n-Mrs. Leo Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s usual course of proceedings being, to issue cards for\r\na hundred, and breakfast for fifty, or in other words to feed only the\r\nvery particular lions, and let the smaller animals take care of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is Mr. Pott?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leo Hunter, as she placed the aforesaid\r\nlions around her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the editor, from the remotest end of the room; far\r\nbeyond all hope of food, unless something was done for him by the\r\nhostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come up here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott, in the most obliging voice--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you give yourself a great deal of unnecessary trouble, Mrs. Hunter.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll do very well there, won\xe2\x80\x99t you--dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly--love,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the unhappy Pott, with a grim smile. Alas for\r\nthe knout! The nervous arm that wielded it, with such a gigantic force\r\non public characters, was paralysed beneath the glance of the imperious\r\nMrs. Pott.\r\n\r\nMrs. Leo Hunter looked round her in triumph. Count Smorltork was busily\r\nengaged in taking notes of the contents of the dishes; Mr. Tupman was\r\ndoing the honours of the lobster salad to several lionesses, with a\r\ndegree of grace which no brigand ever exhibited before; Mr. Snodgrass\r\nhaving cut out the young gentleman who cut up the books for the\r\nEatanswill _Gazette_, was engaged in an impassioned argument with the\r\nyoung lady who did the poetry; and Mr. Pickwick was making himself\r\nuniversally agreeable. Nothing seemed wanting to render the select\r\ncircle complete, when Mr. Leo Hunter--whose department on these\r\noccasions, was to stand about in doorways, and talk to the less\r\nimportant people--suddenly called out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear; here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Charles Fitz-Marshall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leo Hunter, \xe2\x80\x98how anxiously I have been expecting\r\nhim. Pray make room, to let Mr. Fitz-Marshall pass. Tell Mr. Fitz-\r\nMarshall, my dear, to come up to me directly, to be scolded for coming\r\nso late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coming, my dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 cried a voice, \xe2\x80\x98as quick as I can--crowds of\r\npeople--full room--hard work--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s knife and fork fell from his hand. He stared across the\r\ntable at Mr. Tupman, who had dropped his knife and fork, and was looking\r\nas if he were about to sink into the ground without further notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the voice, as its owner pushed his way among the last five-\r\nand-twenty Turks, officers, cavaliers, and Charles the Seconds, that\r\nremained between him and the table, \xe2\x80\x98regular mangle--Baker\xe2\x80\x99s patent--not\r\na crease in my coat, after all this squeezing--might have \xe2\x80\x9cgot up my\r\nlinen\xe2\x80\x9d as I came along--ha! ha! not a bad idea, that--queer thing to\r\nhave it mangled when it\xe2\x80\x99s upon one, though--trying process--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these broken words, a young man dressed as a naval officer made his\r\nway up to the table, and presented to the astonished Pickwickians the\r\nidentical form and features of Mr. Alfred Jingle.\r\n\r\nThe offender had barely time to take Mrs. Leo Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s proffered hand,\r\nwhen his eyes encountered the indignant orbs of Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98Quite forgot--no directions to postillion--give\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em at once--back in a minute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The servant, or Mr. Hunter will do it in a moment, Mr. Fitz-Marshall,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mrs. Leo Hunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no--I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it--shan\xe2\x80\x99t be long--back in no time,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jingle.\r\nWith these words he disappeared among the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to ask you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the excited Mr. Pickwick,\r\nrising from his seat, \xe2\x80\x98who that young man is, and where he resides?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a gentleman of fortune, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leo Hunter, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nwhom I very much want to introduce you. The count will be delighted with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick hastily. \xe2\x80\x98His residence--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is at present at the Angel at Bury.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At Bury?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At Bury St. Edmunds, not many miles from here. But dear me, Mr.\r\nPickwick, you are not going to leave us; surely Mr. Pickwick you cannot\r\nthink of going so soon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut long before Mrs. Leo Hunter had finished speaking, Mr. Pickwick had\r\nplunged through the throng, and reached the garden, whither he was\r\nshortly afterwards joined by Mr. Tupman, who had followed his friend\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s of no use,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman. \xe2\x80\x98He has gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98and I will follow him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Follow him! Where?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To the Angel at Bury,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, speaking very quickly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do we know whom he is deceiving there? He deceived a worthy man\r\nonce, and we were the innocent cause. He shall not do it again, if I can\r\nhelp it; I\xe2\x80\x99ll expose him! Sam! Where\xe2\x80\x99s my servant?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here you are, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, emerging from a sequestered spot,\r\nwhere he had been engaged in discussing a bottle of Madeira, which he\r\nhad abstracted from the breakfast-table an hour or two before. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour servant, Sir. Proud o\xe2\x80\x99 the title, as the living skellinton said,\r\nven they show\xe2\x80\x99d him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Follow me instantly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Tupman, if I stay at Bury,\r\nyou can join me there, when I write. Till then, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRemonstrances were useless. Mr. Pickwick was roused, and his mind was\r\nmade up. Mr. Tupman returned to his companions; and in another hour had\r\ndrowned all present recollection of Mr. Alfred Jingle, or Mr. Charles\r\nFitz-Marshall, in an exhilarating quadrille and a bottle of champagne.\r\nBy that time, Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller, perched on the outside of a\r\nstage-coach, were every succeeding minute placing a less and less\r\ndistance between themselves and the good old town of Bury St. Edmunds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. TOO FULL OF ADVENTURE TO BE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED\r\n\r\nThere is no month in the whole year in which nature wears a more\r\nbeautiful appearance than in the month of August. Spring has many\r\nbeauties, and May is a fresh and blooming month, but the charms of this\r\ntime of year are enhanced by their contrast with the winter season.\r\nAugust has no such advantage. It comes when we remember nothing but\r\nclear skies, green fields, and sweet-smelling flowers--when the\r\nrecollection of snow, and ice, and bleak winds, has faded from our minds\r\nas completely as they have disappeared from the earth--and yet what a\r\npleasant time it is! Orchards and cornfields ring with the hum of\r\nlabour; trees bend beneath the thick clusters of rich fruit which bow\r\ntheir branches to the ground; and the corn, piled in graceful sheaves,\r\nor waving in every light breath that sweeps above it, as if it wooed the\r\nsickle, tinges the landscape with a golden hue. A mellow softness\r\nappears to hang over the whole earth; the influence of the season seems\r\nto extend itself to the very wagon, whose slow motion across the well-\r\nreaped field is perceptible only to the eye, but strikes with no harsh\r\nsound upon the ear.\r\n\r\nAs the coach rolls swiftly past the fields and orchards which skirt the\r\nroad, groups of women and children, piling the fruit in sieves, or\r\ngathering the scattered ears of corn, pause for an instant from their\r\nlabour, and shading the sun-burned face with a still browner hand, gaze\r\nupon the passengers with curious eyes, while some stout urchin, too\r\nsmall to work, but too mischievous to be left at home, scrambles over\r\nthe side of the basket in which he has been deposited for security, and\r\nkicks and screams with delight. The reaper stops in his work, and stands\r\nwith folded arms, looking at the vehicle as it whirls past; and the\r\nrough cart-horses bestow a sleepy glance upon the smart coach team,\r\nwhich says as plainly as a horse\xe2\x80\x99s glance can, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine to\r\nlook at, but slow going, over a heavy field, is better than warm work\r\nlike that, upon a dusty road, after all.\xe2\x80\x99 You cast a look behind you, as\r\nyou turn a corner of the road. The women and children have resumed their\r\nlabour; the reaper once more stoops to his work; the cart-horses have\r\nmoved on; and all are again in motion.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a scene like this, was not lost upon the well-regulated\r\nmind of Mr. Pickwick. Intent upon the resolution he had formed, of\r\nexposing the real character of the nefarious Jingle, in any quarter in\r\nwhich he might be pursuing his fraudulent designs, he sat at first\r\ntaciturn and contemplative, brooding over the means by which his purpose\r\ncould be best attained. By degrees his attention grew more and more\r\nattracted by the objects around him; and at last he derived as much\r\nenjoyment from the ride, as if it had been undertaken for the\r\npleasantest reason in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Delightful prospect, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beats the chimbley-pots, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you have hardly seen anything but chimney-pots and bricks and\r\nmortar all your life, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I worn\xe2\x80\x99t always a boots, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with a shake of the\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x98I wos a vaginer\xe2\x80\x99s boy, once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When was that?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I wos first pitched neck and crop into the world, to play at leap-\r\nfrog with its troubles,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I wos a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s boy at\r\nstartin\xe2\x80\x99; then a vaginer\xe2\x80\x99s, then a helper, then a boots. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s servant. I shall be a gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n myself one of these days,\r\nperhaps, with a pipe in my mouth, and a summer-house in the back-garden.\r\nWho knows? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised for one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite a philosopher, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It runs in the family, I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s wery much in that line now. If my mother-in-law blows him up,\r\nhe whistles. She flies in a passion, and breaks his pipe; he steps out,\r\nand gets another. Then she screams wery loud, and falls into \xe2\x80\x98sterics;\r\nand he smokes wery comfortably till she comes to agin. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphilosophy, Sir, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very good substitute for it, at all events,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick,\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x98It must have been of great service to you, in the course of\r\nyour rambling life, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Service, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam. \xe2\x80\x98You may say that. Arter I run away from\r\nthe carrier, and afore I took up with the vaginer, I had unfurnished\r\nlodgin\xe2\x80\x99s for a fortnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfurnished lodgings?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--the dry arches of Waterloo Bridge. Fine sleeping-place--vithin ten\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk of all the public offices--only if there is any objection\r\nto it, it is that the sitivation\xe2\x80\x99s rayther too airy. I see some queer\r\nsights there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAh, I suppose you did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with an air of considerable\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sights, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98as \xe2\x80\x98ud penetrate your benevolent\r\nheart, and come out on the other side. You don\xe2\x80\x99t see the reg\xe2\x80\x99lar\r\nwagrants there; trust \xe2\x80\x98em, they knows better than that. Young beggars,\r\nmale and female, as hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a rise in their profession, takes up\r\ntheir quarters there sometimes; but it\xe2\x80\x99s generally the worn-out,\r\nstarving, houseless creeturs as roll themselves in the dark corners o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthem lonesome places--poor creeturs as ain\xe2\x80\x99t up to the twopenny rope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And pray, Sam, what is the twopenny rope?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The twopenny rope, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98is just a cheap lodgin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhouse, where the beds is twopence a night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do they call a bed a rope for?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless your innocence, sir, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Ven the lady\r\nand gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n as keeps the hot-el first begun business, they used to\r\nmake the beds on the floor; but this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do at no price, \xe2\x80\x98cos\r\ninstead o\xe2\x80\x99 taking a moderate twopenn\xe2\x80\x99orth o\xe2\x80\x99 sleep, the lodgers used to\r\nlie there half the day. So now they has two ropes, \xe2\x80\x98bout six foot apart,\r\nand three from the floor, which goes right down the room; and the beds\r\nare made of slips of coarse sacking, stretched across \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98the adwantage o\xe2\x80\x99 the plan\xe2\x80\x99s hobvious. At six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock every mornin\xe2\x80\x99 they let\xe2\x80\x99s go the ropes at one end, and down falls\r\nthe lodgers. Consequence is, that being thoroughly waked, they get up\r\nwery quietly, and walk away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, suddenly breaking off in his\r\nloquacious discourse. \xe2\x80\x98Is this Bury St. Edmunds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nThe coach rattled through the well-paved streets of a handsome little\r\ntown, of thriving and cleanly appearance, and stopped before a large inn\r\nsituated in a wide open street, nearly facing the old abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking up. \xe2\x80\x98Is the Angel! We alight\r\nhere, Sam. But some caution is necessary. Order a private room, and do\r\nnot mention my name. You understand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right as a trivet, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, with a wink of\r\nintelligence; and having dragged Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s portmanteau from the\r\nhind boot, into which it had been hastily thrown when they joined the\r\ncoach at Eatanswill, Mr. Weller disappeared on his errand. A private\r\nroom was speedily engaged; and into it Mr. Pickwick was ushered without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98the first thing to be done is to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOrder dinner, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s wery late, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking at his watch. \xe2\x80\x98You are right,\r\nSam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And if I might adwise, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d just have a good\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s rest arterwards, and not begin inquiring arter this here deep\r\n\xe2\x80\x98un till the mornin\xe2\x80\x99. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 so refreshen\xe2\x80\x99 as sleep, sir, as\r\nthe servant girl said afore she drank the egg-cupful of laudanum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you are right, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98But I must first\r\nascertain that he is in the house, and not likely to go away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave that to me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Let me order you a snug little\r\ndinner, and make my inquiries below while it\xe2\x80\x99s a-getting ready; I could\r\nworm ev\xe2\x80\x99ry secret out O\xe2\x80\x99 the boots\xe2\x80\x99s heart, in five minutes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDo so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; and Mr. Weller at once retired.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour, Mr. Pickwick was seated at a very satisfactory dinner;\r\nand in three-quarters Mr. Weller returned with the intelligence that Mr.\r\nCharles Fitz-Marshall had ordered his private room to be retained for\r\nhim, until further notice. He was going to spend the evening at some\r\nprivate house in the neighbourhood, had ordered the boots to sit up\r\nuntil his return, and had taken his servant with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 argued Mr. Weller, when he had concluded his report, \xe2\x80\x98if I\r\ncan get a talk with this here servant in the mornin\xe2\x80\x99, he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me all\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you know that?\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless your heart, sir, servants always do,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, ah, I forgot that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you can arrange what\xe2\x80\x99s best to be done, sir, and we can act\r\naccordingly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs it appeared that this was the best arrangement that could be made, it\r\nwas finally agreed upon. Mr. Weller, by his master\xe2\x80\x99s permission, retired\r\nto spend the evening in his own way; and was shortly afterwards elected,\r\nby the unanimous voice of the assembled company, into the taproom chair,\r\nin which honourable post he acquitted himself so much to the\r\nsatisfaction of the gentlemen-frequenters, that their roars of laughter\r\nand approbation penetrated to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and shortened the\r\nterm of his natural rest by at least three hours.\r\n\r\nEarly on the ensuing morning, Mr. Weller was dispelling all the feverish\r\nremains of the previous evening\xe2\x80\x99s conviviality, through the\r\ninstrumentality of a halfpenny shower-bath (having induced a young\r\ngentleman attached to the stable department, by the offer of that coin,\r\nto pump over his head and face, until he was perfectly restored), when\r\nhe was attracted by the appearance of a young fellow in mulberry-\r\ncoloured livery, who was sitting on a bench in the yard, reading what\r\nappeared to be a hymn-book, with an air of deep abstraction, but who\r\noccasionally stole a glance at the individual under the pump, as if he\r\ntook some interest in his proceedings, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a rum \xe2\x80\x98un to look at, you are!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Weller, the first\r\ntime his eyes encountered the glance of the stranger in the mulberry\r\nsuit, who had a large, sallow, ugly face, very sunken eyes, and a\r\ngigantic head, from which depended a quantity of lank black hair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a rum \xe2\x80\x98un!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Weller; and thinking this, he went on\r\nwashing himself, and thought no more about him.\r\n\r\nStill the man kept glancing from his hymn-book to Sam, and from Sam to\r\nhis hymn-book, as if he wanted to open a conversation. So at last, Sam,\r\nby way of giving him an opportunity, said with a familiar nod--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you, governor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am happy to say, I am pretty well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, speaking with\r\ngreat deliberation, and closing the book. \xe2\x80\x98I hope you are the same,\r\nSir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, if I felt less like a walking brandy-bottle I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be quite\r\nso staggery this mornin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Are you stoppin\xe2\x80\x99 in this house,\r\nold \xe2\x80\x98un?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe mulberry man replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was it you worn\xe2\x80\x99t one of us, last night?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, scrubbing\r\nhis face with the towel. \xe2\x80\x98You seem one of the jolly sort--looks as\r\nconwivial as a live trout in a lime basket,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Weller, in an\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was out last night with my master,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller, colouring up very red with\r\nsudden excitement, and the friction of the towel combined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fitz-Marshall,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mulberry man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give us your hand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, advancing; \xe2\x80\x98I should like to know\r\nyou. I like your appearance, old fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that is very strange,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mulberry man, with great\r\nsimplicity of manner. \xe2\x80\x98I like yours so much, that I wanted to speak to\r\nyou, from the very first moment I saw you under the pump.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDid you though?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word. Now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that curious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery sing\xe2\x80\x99ler,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, inwardly congratulating himself upon the\r\nsoftness of the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s your name, my patriarch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Job.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a wery good name it is; only one I know that ain\xe2\x80\x99t got a nickname\r\nto it. What\xe2\x80\x99s the other name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Trotter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98What is yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam bore in mind his master\xe2\x80\x99s caution, and replied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name\xe2\x80\x99s Walker; my master\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x99s Wilkins. Will you take a drop o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsomethin\xe2\x80\x99 this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, Mr. Trotter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter acquiesced in this agreeable proposal; and having deposited\r\nhis book in his coat pocket, accompanied Mr. Weller to the tap, where\r\nthey were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound, formed\r\nby mixing together, in a pewter vessel, certain quantities of British\r\nHollands and the fragrant essence of the clove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what sort of a place have you got?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, as he filled his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s glass, for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, smacking his lips, \xe2\x80\x98very bad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, indeed. Worse than that, my master\xe2\x80\x99s going to be married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and worse than that, too, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to run away with an immense\r\nrich heiress, from boarding-school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a dragon!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, refilling his companion\xe2\x80\x99s glass. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s some\r\nboarding-school in this town, I suppose, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 Now, although this\r\nquestion was put in the most careless tone imaginable, Mr. Job Trotter\r\nplainly showed by gestures that he perceived his new friend\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to\r\ndraw forth an answer to it. He emptied his glass, looked mysteriously at\r\nhis companion, winked both of his small eyes, one after the other, and\r\nfinally made a motion with his arm, as if he were working an imaginary\r\npump-handle; thereby intimating that he (Mr. Trotter) considered himself\r\nas undergoing the process of being pumped by Mr. Samuel Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trotter, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s not to be told to\r\neverybody. That is a secret--a great secret, Mr. Walker.\xe2\x80\x99 As the\r\nmulberry man said this, he turned his glass upside down, by way of\r\nreminding his companion that he had nothing left wherewith to slake his\r\nthirst. Sam observed the hint; and feeling the delicate manner in which\r\nit was conveyed, ordered the pewter vessel to be refilled, whereat the\r\nsmall eyes of the mulberry man glistened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should rather suspect it was,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mulberry man, sipping his\r\nliquor, with a complacent face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose your mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s wery rich?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter smiled, and holding his glass in his left hand, gave four\r\ndistinct slaps on the pockets of his mulberry indescribables with his\r\nright, as if to intimate that his master might have done the same\r\nwithout alarming anybody much by the chinking of coin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s the game, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe mulberry man nodded significantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, old feller,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nif you let your master take in this here young lady, you\xe2\x80\x99re a precious\r\nrascal?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job Trotter, turning upon his companion a\r\ncountenance of deep contrition, and groaning slightly, \xe2\x80\x98I know that, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is that preys upon my mind. But what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98di-wulge to the missis, and give up your master.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99d believe me?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job Trotter. \xe2\x80\x98The young lady\xe2\x80\x99s considered\r\nthe very picture of innocence and discretion. She\xe2\x80\x99d deny it, and so\r\nwould my master. Who\xe2\x80\x99d believe me? I should lose my place, and get\r\nindicted for a conspiracy, or some such thing; that\xe2\x80\x99s all I should take\r\nby my motion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s somethin\xe2\x80\x99 in that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, ruminating; \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s somethin\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I knew any respectable gentleman who would take the matter up,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Mr. Trotter. \xe2\x80\x98I might have some hope of preventing the\r\nelopement; but there\xe2\x80\x99s the same difficulty, Mr. Walker, just the same. I\r\nknow no gentleman in this strange place; and ten to one if I did,\r\nwhether he would believe my story.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come this way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, suddenly jumping up, and grasping the\r\nmulberry man by the arm. \xe2\x80\x98My mas\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99s the man you want, I see.\xe2\x80\x99 And after\r\na slight resistance on the part of Job Trotter, Sam led his newly-found\r\nfriend to the apartment of Mr. Pickwick, to whom he presented him,\r\ntogether with a brief summary of the dialogue we have just repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry to betray my master, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job Trotter, applying\r\nto his eyes a pink checked pocket-handkerchief about six inches square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The feeling does you a great deal of honour,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but it is your duty, nevertheless.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it is my duty, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, with great emotion. \xe2\x80\x98We should\r\nall try to discharge our duty, Sir, and I humbly endeavour to discharge\r\nmine, Sir; but it is a hard trial to betray a master, Sir, whose clothes\r\nyou wear, and whose bread you eat, even though he is a scoundrel, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a very good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, much affected; \xe2\x80\x98an\r\nhonest fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Sam, who had witnessed Mr. Trotter\xe2\x80\x99s tears with\r\nconsiderable impatience, \xe2\x80\x98blow this \xe2\x80\x98ere water-cart bis\xe2\x80\x99ness. It won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo no good, this won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to find that you\r\nhave so little respect for this young man\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His feelin\xe2\x80\x99s is all wery well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98and as\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re so wery fine, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity he should lose \xe2\x80\x98em, I think he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter keep \xe2\x80\x98em in his own buzzum, than let \xe2\x80\x98em ewaporate in hot water,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98specially as they do no good. Tears never yet wound up a clock, or\r\nworked a steam ingin\xe2\x80\x99. The next time you go out to a smoking party,\r\nyoung fellow, fill your pipe with that \xe2\x80\x98ere reflection; and for the\r\npresent just put that bit of pink gingham into your pocket. \xe2\x80\x98Tain\xe2\x80\x99t so\r\nhandsome that you need keep waving it about, as if you was a tight-rope\r\ndancer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My man is in the right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, accosting Job, \xe2\x80\x98although\r\nhis mode of expressing his opinion is somewhat homely, and occasionally\r\nincomprehensible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is, sir, very right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trotter, \xe2\x80\x98and I will give way no\r\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Now, where is this boarding-school?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a large, old, red brick house, just outside the town, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Job Trotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick--\xe2\x80\x98when is this villainous design to be\r\ncarried into execution--when is this elopement to take place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-night, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-night!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This very night, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job Trotter. \xe2\x80\x98That is what alarms me so\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Instant measures must be taken,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I will see the\r\nlady who keeps the establishment immediately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, \xe2\x80\x98but that course of proceeding will\r\nnever do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My master, sir, is a very artful man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know he is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he has so wound himself round the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s heart, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed\r\nJob, \xe2\x80\x98that she would believe nothing to his prejudice, if you went down\r\non your bare knees, and swore it; especially as you have no proof but\r\nthe word of a servant, who, for anything she knows (and my master would\r\nbe sure to say so), was discharged for some fault, and does this in\r\nrevenge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What had better be done, then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing but taking him in the very act of eloping, will convince the\r\nold lady, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All them old cats _will _run their heads agin milestones,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr.\r\nWeller, in a parenthesis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this taking him in the very act of elopement, would be a very\r\ndifficult thing to accomplish, I fear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trotter, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 reflection.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it might be very easily done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Trotter, \xe2\x80\x98my master and I, being in the confidence of\r\nthe two servants, will be secreted in the kitchen at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. When\r\nthe family have retired to rest, we shall come out of the kitchen, and\r\nthe young lady out of her bedroom. A post-chaise will be waiting, and\r\naway we go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the\r\ngarden behind, alone--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Why alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it very natural,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, \xe2\x80\x98that the old lady wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike such an unpleasant discovery to be made before more persons than\r\ncan possibly be helped. The young lady, too, sir--consider her\r\nfeelings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98The consideration evinces your\r\ndelicacy of feeling. Go on; you are very right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, I have been thinking that if you were waiting in the back\r\ngarden alone, and I was to let you in, at the door which opens into it,\r\nfrom the end of the passage, at exactly half-past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, you\r\nwould be just in the very moment of time to assist me in frustrating the\r\ndesigns of this bad man, by whom I have been unfortunately ensnared.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHere Mr. Trotter sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself on that account,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98if he had\r\none grain of the delicacy of feeling which distinguishes you, humble as\r\nyour station is, I should have some hopes of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJob Trotter bowed low; and in spite of Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s previous\r\nremonstrance, the tears again rose to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never see such a feller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98Blessed if I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot a main in his head as is always turned on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with great severity, \xe2\x80\x98hold your tongue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this plan,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, after deep meditation. \xe2\x80\x98Why\r\ncannot I communicate with the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s friends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because they live one hundred miles from here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Job\r\nTrotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a clincher,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then this garden,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98How am I to get into it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wall is very low, sir, and your servant will give you a leg up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy servant will give me a leg up,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Pickwick mechanically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will be sure to be near this door that you speak of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot mistake it, Sir; it\xe2\x80\x99s the only one that opens into the\r\ngarden. Tap at it when you hear the clock strike, and I will open it\r\ninstantly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the plan,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but as I see no other, and\r\nas the happiness of this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s whole life is at stake, I adopt\r\nit. I shall be sure to be there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus, for the second time, did Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s innate good-feeling\r\ninvolve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have\r\nstood aloof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the name of the house?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Westgate House, Sir. You turn a little to the right when you get to the\r\nend of the town; it stands by itself, some little distance off the high\r\nroad, with the name on a brass plate on the gate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I observed it once before, when I was\r\nin this town. You may depend upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter made another bow, and turned to depart, when Mr. Pickwick\r\nthrust a guinea into his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a fine fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98and I admire your goodness\r\nof heart. No thanks. Remember--eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no fear of my forgetting it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job Trotter. With\r\nthese words he left the room, followed by Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 said the latter, \xe2\x80\x98not a bad notion that \xe2\x80\x98ere crying. I\xe2\x80\x99d cry\r\nlike a rain-water spout in a shower on such good terms. How do you do\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It comes from the heart, Mr. Walker,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job solemnly. \xe2\x80\x98Good-\r\nmorning, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a soft customer, you are; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got it all out o\xe2\x80\x99 you, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought Mr. Weller, as Job walked away.\r\n\r\nWe cannot state the precise nature of the thoughts which passed through\r\nMr. Trotter\xe2\x80\x99s mind, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were.\r\n\r\nThe day wore on, evening came, and at a little before ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Sam\r\nWeller reported that Mr. Jingle and Job had gone out together, that\r\ntheir luggage was packed up, and that they had ordered a chaise. The\r\nplot was evidently in execution, as Mr. Trotter had foretold.\r\n\r\nHalf-past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock arrived, and it was time for Mr. Pickwick to issue\r\nforth on his delicate errand. Resisting Sam\xe2\x80\x99s tender of his greatcoat,\r\nin order that he might have no encumbrance in scaling the wall, he set\r\nforth, followed by his attendant.\r\n\r\nThere was a bright moon, but it was behind the clouds. It was a fine dry\r\nnight, but it was most uncommonly dark. Paths, hedges, fields, houses,\r\nand trees, were enveloped in one deep shade. The atmosphere was hot and\r\nsultry, the summer lightning quivered faintly on the verge of the\r\nhorizon, and was the only sight that varied the dull gloom in which\r\neverything was wrapped--sound there was none, except the distant barking\r\nof some restless house-dog.\r\n\r\nThey found the house, read the brass plate, walked round the wall, and\r\nstopped at that portion of it which divided them from the bottom of the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will return to the inn, Sam, when you have assisted me over,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery well, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you will sit up, till I return.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take hold of my leg; and, when I say \xe2\x80\x9cOver,\xe2\x80\x9d raise me gently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving settled these preliminaries, Mr. Pickwick grasped the top of the\r\nwall, and gave the word \xe2\x80\x98Over,\xe2\x80\x99 which was literally obeyed. Whether his\r\nbody partook in some degree of the elasticity of his mind, or whether\r\nMr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s notions of a gentle push were of a somewhat rougher\r\ndescription than Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s, the immediate effect of his assistance\r\nwas to jerk that immortal gentleman completely over the wall on to the\r\nbed beneath, where, after crushing three gooseberry-bushes and a rose-\r\ntree, he finally alighted at full length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t hurt yourself, I hope, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, in a loud whisper, as\r\nsoon as he had recovered from the surprise consequent upon the\r\nmysterious disappearance of his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not hurt _myself_, Sam, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, from\r\nthe other side of the wall, \xe2\x80\x98but I rather think that _you _have hurt\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, rising, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but a few\r\nscratches. Go away, or we shall be overheard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith stealthy steps Sam Weller departed, leaving Mr. Pickwick alone in\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nLights occasionally appeared in the different windows of the house, or\r\nglanced from the staircases, as if the inmates were retiring to rest.\r\nNot caring to go too near the door, until the appointed time, Mr.\r\nPickwick crouched into an angle of the wall, and awaited its arrival.\r\n\r\nIt was a situation which might well have depressed the spirits of many a\r\nman. Mr. Pickwick, however, felt neither depression nor misgiving. He\r\nknew that his purpose was in the main a good one, and he placed implicit\r\nreliance on the high-minded Job. It was dull, certainly; not to say\r\ndreary; but a contemplative man can always employ himself in meditation.\r\nMr. Pickwick had meditated himself into a doze, when he was roused by\r\nthe chimes of the neighbouring church ringing out the hour--half-past\r\neleven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the time,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick, getting cautiously on his feet.\r\nHe looked up at the house. The lights had disappeared, and the shutters\r\nwere closed--all in bed, no doubt. He walked on tiptoe to the door, and\r\ngave a gentle tap. Two or three minutes passing without any reply, he\r\ngave another tap rather louder, and then another rather louder than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAt length the sound of feet was audible upon the stairs, and then the\r\nlight of a candle shone through the keyhole of the door. There was a\r\ngood deal of unchaining and unbolting, and the door was slowly opened.\r\n\r\nNow the door opened outwards; and as the door opened wider and wider,\r\nMr. Pickwick receded behind it, more and more. What was his astonishment\r\nwhen he just peeped out, by way of caution, to see that the person who\r\nhad opened it was--not Job Trotter, but a servant-girl with a candle in\r\nher hand! Mr. Pickwick drew in his head again, with the swiftness\r\ndisplayed by that admirable melodramatic performer, Punch, when he lies\r\nin wait for the flat-headed comedian with the tin box of music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must have been the cat, Sarah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, addressing herself to\r\nsome one in the house. \xe2\x80\x98Puss, puss, puss,--tit, tit, tit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut no animal being decoyed by these blandishments, the girl slowly\r\nclosed the door, and re-fastened it; leaving Mr. Pickwick drawn up\r\nstraight against the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is very curious,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98They are sitting up\r\nbeyond their usual hour, I suppose. Extremely unfortunate, that they\r\nshould have chosen this night, of all others, for such a purpose--\r\nexceedingly.\xe2\x80\x99 And with these thoughts, Mr. Pickwick cautiously retired\r\nto the angle of the wall in which he had been before ensconced; waiting\r\nuntil such time as he might deem it safe to repeat the signal.\r\n\r\nHe had not been here five minutes, when a vivid flash of lightning was\r\nfollowed by a loud peal of thunder that crashed and rolled away in the\r\ndistance with a terrific noise--then came another flash of lightning,\r\nbrighter than the other, and a second peal of thunder louder than the\r\nfirst; and then down came the rain, with a force and fury that swept\r\neverything before it.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was perfectly aware that a tree is a very dangerous\r\nneighbour in a thunderstorm. He had a tree on his right, a tree on his\r\nleft, a third before him, and a fourth behind. If he remained where he\r\nwas, he might fall the victim of an accident; if he showed himself in\r\nthe centre of the garden, he might be consigned to a constable. Once or\r\ntwice he tried to scale the wall, but having no other legs this time,\r\nthan those with which Nature had furnished him, the only effect of his\r\nstruggles was to inflict a variety of very unpleasant gratings on his\r\nknees and shins, and to throw him into a state of the most profuse\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a dreadful situation,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, pausing to wipe his brow\r\nafter this exercise. He looked up at the house--all was dark. They must\r\nbe gone to bed now. He would try the signal again.\r\n\r\nHe walked on tiptoe across the moist gravel, and tapped at the door. He\r\nheld his breath, and listened at the key-hole. No reply: very odd.\r\nAnother knock. He listened again. There was a low whispering inside, and\r\nthen a voice cried--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not Job,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick, hastily drawing himself straight\r\nup against the wall again. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely had time to form this conclusion, when a window above\r\nstairs was thrown up, and three or four female voices repeated the\r\nquery--\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick dared not move hand or foot. It was clear that the whole\r\nestablishment was roused. He made up his mind to remain where he was,\r\nuntil the alarm had subsided; and then by a supernatural effort, to get\r\nover the wall, or perish in the attempt.\r\n\r\nLike all Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s determinations, this was the best that could be\r\nmade under the circumstances; but, unfortunately, it was founded upon\r\nthe assumption that they would not venture to open the door again. What\r\nwas his discomfiture, when he heard the chain and bolts withdrawn, and\r\nsaw the door slowly opening, wider and wider! He retreated into the\r\ncorner, step by step; but do what he would, the interposition of his own\r\nperson, prevented its being opened to its utmost width.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 screamed a numerous chorus of treble voices from the\r\nstaircase inside, consisting of the spinster lady of the establishment,\r\nthree teachers, five female servants, and thirty boarders, all half-\r\ndressed and in a forest of curl-papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Mr. Pickwick didn\xe2\x80\x99t say who was there: and then the burden of\r\nthe chorus changed into--\xe2\x80\x98Lor! I am so frightened.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cook,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady abbess, who took care to be on the top stair, the\r\nvery last of the group--\xe2\x80\x98cook, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go a little way into the\r\ngarden?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPlease, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like,\xe2\x80\x99 responded the cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor, what a stupid thing that cook is!\xe2\x80\x99 said the thirty boarders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cook,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady abbess, with great dignity; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me, if\r\nyou please. I insist upon your looking into the garden immediately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the cook began to cry, and the housemaid said it was \xe2\x80\x98a shame!\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nwhich partisanship she received a month\xe2\x80\x99s warning on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you hear, cook?\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady abbess, stamping her foot\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear your missis, cook?\xe2\x80\x99 said the three teachers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an impudent thing that cook is!\xe2\x80\x99 said the thirty boarders.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate cook, thus strongly urged, advanced a step or two, and\r\nholding her candle just where it prevented her from seeing at all,\r\ndeclared there was nothing there, and it must have been the wind. The\r\ndoor was just going to be closed in consequence, when an inquisitive\r\nboarder, who had been peeping between the hinges, set up a fearful\r\nscreaming, which called back the cook and housemaid, and all the more\r\nadventurous, in no time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with Miss Smithers?\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady abbess, as the\r\naforesaid Miss Smithers proceeded to go into hysterics of four young\r\nlady power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor, Miss Smithers, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other nine-and-twenty boarders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, the man--the man--behind the door!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed Miss Smithers.\r\n\r\nThe lady abbess no sooner heard this appalling cry, than she retreated\r\nto her own bedroom, double-locked the door, and fainted away\r\ncomfortably. The boarders, and the teachers, and the servants, fell back\r\nupon the stairs, and upon each other; and never was such a screaming,\r\nand fainting, and struggling beheld. In the midst of the tumult, Mr.\r\nPickwick emerged from his concealment, and presented himself amongst\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ladies--dear ladies,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh. he says we\xe2\x80\x99re dear,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the oldest and ugliest teacher. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, the\r\nwretch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ladies,\xe2\x80\x99 roared Mr. Pickwick, rendered desperate by the danger of his\r\nsituation. \xe2\x80\x98Hear me. I am no robber. I want the lady of the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, what a ferocious monster!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed another teacher. \xe2\x80\x98He wants Miss\r\nTomkins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere there was a general scream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ring the alarm bell, somebody!\xe2\x80\x99 cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t--don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Look at me. Do I look like a\r\nrobber! My dear ladies--you may bind me hand and leg, or lock me up in a\r\ncloset, if you like. Only hear what I have got to say--only hear me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you come in our garden?\xe2\x80\x99 faltered the housemaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call the lady of the house, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her everything,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, exerting his lungs to the utmost pitch. \xe2\x80\x98Call her--only be\r\nquiet, and call her, and you shall hear everything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt might have been Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, or it might have been his\r\nmanner, or it might have been the temptation--irresistible to a female\r\nmind--of hearing something at present enveloped in mystery, that reduced\r\nthe more reasonable portion of the establishment (some four individuals)\r\nto a state of comparative quiet. By them it was proposed, as a test of\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s sincerity, that he should immediately submit to personal\r\nrestraint; and that gentleman having consented to hold a conference with\r\nMiss Tomkins, from the interior of a closet in which the day boarders\r\nhung their bonnets and sandwich-bags, he at once stepped into it, of his\r\nown accord, and was securely locked in. This revived the others; and\r\nMiss Tomkins having been brought to, and brought down, the conference\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you do in my garden, man?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Tomkins, in a faint\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I came to warn you that one of your young ladies was going to elope to-\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, from the interior of the closet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elope!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Tomkins, the three teachers, the thirty\r\nboarders, and the five servants. \xe2\x80\x98Who with?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYour friend, Mr. Charles Fitz-Marshall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_My_ friend! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any such person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr. Jingle, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never heard the name in my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, I have been deceived, and deluded,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nbeen the victim of a conspiracy--a foul and base conspiracy. Send to the\r\nAngel, my dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. Send to the Angel for Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s manservant, I implore you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must be respectable--he keeps a manservant,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Tomkins to\r\nthe writing and ciphering governess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion, Miss Tomkins,\xe2\x80\x99 said the writing and ciphering\r\ngoverness, \xe2\x80\x98that his manservant keeps him, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a madman, Miss\r\nTomkins, and the other\xe2\x80\x99s his keeper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you are very right, Miss Gwynn,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Miss Tomkins. \xe2\x80\x98Let\r\ntwo of the servants repair to the Angel, and let the others remain here,\r\nto protect us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo two of the servants were despatched to the Angel in search of Mr.\r\nSamuel Weller; and the remaining three stopped behind to protect Miss\r\nTomkins, and the three teachers, and the thirty boarders. And Mr.\r\nPickwick sat down in the closet, beneath a grove of sandwich-bags, and\r\nawaited the return of the messengers, with all the philosophy and\r\nfortitude he could summon to his aid.\r\n\r\nAn hour and a half elapsed before they came back, and when they did\r\ncome, Mr. Pickwick recognised, in addition to the voice of Mr. Samuel\r\nWeller, two other voices, the tones of which struck familiarly on his\r\near; but whose they were, he could not for the life of him call to mind.\r\n\r\nA very brief conversation ensued. The door was unlocked. Mr. Pickwick\r\nstepped out of the closet, and found himself in the presence of the\r\nwhole establishment of Westgate House, Mr Samuel Weller, and--old\r\nWardle, and his destined son-in-law, Mr. Trundle!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, running forward and grasping\r\nWardle\xe2\x80\x99s hand, \xe2\x80\x98my dear friend, pray, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, explain to this\r\nlady the unfortunate and dreadful situation in which I am placed. You\r\nmust have heard it from my servant; say, at all events, my dear fellow,\r\nthat I am neither a robber nor a madman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have said so, my dear friend. I have said so already,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nWardle, shaking the right hand of his friend, while Mr. Trundle shook\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And whoever says, or has said, he is,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller, stepping\r\nforward, \xe2\x80\x98says that which is not the truth, but so far from it, on the\r\ncontrary, quite the rewerse. And if there\xe2\x80\x99s any number o\xe2\x80\x99 men on these\r\nhere premises as has said so, I shall be wery happy to give \xe2\x80\x98em all a\r\nwery convincing proof o\xe2\x80\x99 their being mistaken, in this here wery room,\r\nif these wery respectable ladies \xe2\x80\x98ll have the goodness to retire, and\r\norder \xe2\x80\x98em up, one at a time.\xe2\x80\x99 Having delivered this defiance with great\r\nvolubility, Mr. Weller struck his open palm emphatically with his\r\nclenched fist, and winked pleasantly on Miss Tomkins, the intensity of\r\nwhose horror at his supposing it within the bounds of possibility that\r\nthere could be any men on the premises of Westgate House Establishment\r\nfor Young Ladies, it is impossible to describe.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s explanation having already been partially made, was soon\r\nconcluded. But neither in the course of his walk home with his friends,\r\nnor afterwards when seated before a blazing fire at the supper he so\r\nmuch needed, could a single observation be drawn from him. He seemed\r\nbewildered and amazed. Once, and only once, he turned round to Mr.\r\nWardle, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you come here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Trundle and I came down here, for some good shooting on the first,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98We arrived to-night, and were astonished to hear from\r\nyour servant that you were here too. But I am glad you are,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nold fellow, slapping him on the back--\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you are. We shall have\r\na jovial party on the first, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll give Winkle another chance--eh,\r\nold boy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick made no reply, he did not even ask after his friends at\r\nDingley Dell, and shortly afterwards retired for the night, desiring Sam\r\nto fetch his candle when he rung.\r\n\r\nThe bell did ring in due course, and Mr. Weller presented himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking out from under the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paused, and Mr. Weller snuffed the candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick again, as if with a desperate effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is that Trotter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Job, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With his master, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friend or master, or whatever he is, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone with him,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nWeller. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a pair on \xe2\x80\x98em, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jingle suspected my design, and set that fellow on you, with this\r\nstory, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, half choking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just that, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was all false, of course?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Reg\xe2\x80\x99lar do, sir; artful dodge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll escape us quite so easily the next time, Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whenever I meet that Jingle again, wherever it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nraising himself in bed, and indenting his pillow with a tremendous blow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll inflict personal chastisement on him, in addition to the exposure\r\nhe so richly merits. I will, or my name is not Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And venever I catches hold o\xe2\x80\x99 that there melan-cholly chap with the\r\nblack hair,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98if I don\xe2\x80\x99t bring some real water into his eyes,\r\nfor once in a way, my name ain\xe2\x80\x99t Weller. Good-night, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. SHOWING THAT AN ATTACK OF RHEUMATISM, IN SOME CASES, ACTS\r\nAS A QUICKENER TO INVENTIVE GENIUS\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Mr. Pickwick, though able to sustain a very\r\nconsiderable amount of exertion and fatigue, was not proof against such\r\na combination of attacks as he had undergone on the memorable night,\r\nrecorded in the last chapter. The process of being washed in the night\r\nair, and rough-dried in a closet, is as dangerous as it is peculiar. Mr.\r\nPickwick was laid up with an attack of rheumatism.\r\n\r\nBut although the bodily powers of the great man were thus impaired, his\r\nmental energies retained their pristine vigour. His spirits were\r\nelastic; his good-humour was restored. Even the vexation consequent upon\r\nhis recent adventure had vanished from his mind; and he could join in\r\nthe hearty laughter, which any allusion to it excited in Mr. Wardle,\r\nwithout anger and without embarrassment. Nay, more. During the two days\r\nMr. Pickwick was confined to bed, Sam was his constant attendant. On the\r\nfirst, he endeavoured to amuse his master by anecdote and conversation;\r\non the second, Mr. Pickwick demanded his writing-desk, and pen and ink,\r\nand was deeply engaged during the whole day. On the third, being able to\r\nsit up in his bedchamber, he despatched his valet with a message to Mr.\r\nWardle and Mr. Trundle, intimating that if they would take their wine\r\nthere, that evening, they would greatly oblige him. The invitation was\r\nmost willingly accepted; and when they were seated over their wine, Mr.\r\nPickwick, with sundry blushes, produced the following little tale, as\r\nhaving been \xe2\x80\x98edited\xe2\x80\x99 by himself, during his recent indisposition, from\r\nhis notes of Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s unsophisticated recital.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH CLERK A TALE OF TRUE LOVE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once upon a time, in a very small country town, at a considerable\r\ndistance from London, there lived a little man named Nathaniel Pipkin,\r\nwho was the parish clerk of the little town, and lived in a little house\r\nin the little High Street, within ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from the little\r\nchurch; and who was to be found every day, from nine till four, teaching\r\na little learning to the little boys. Nathaniel Pipkin was a harmless,\r\ninoffensive, good-natured being, with a turned-up nose, and rather\r\nturned-in legs, a cast in his eye, and a halt in his gait; and he\r\ndivided his time between the church and his school, verily believing\r\nthat there existed not, on the face of the earth, so clever a man as the\r\ncurate, so imposing an apartment as the vestry-room, or so well-ordered\r\na seminary as his own. Once, and only once, in his life, Nathaniel\r\nPipkin had seen a bishop--a real bishop, with his arms in lawn sleeves,\r\nand his head in a wig. He had seen him walk, and heard him talk, at a\r\nconfirmation, on which momentous occasion Nathaniel Pipkin was so\r\novercome with reverence and awe, when the aforesaid bishop laid his hand\r\non his head, that he fainted right clean away, and was borne out of\r\nchurch in the arms of the beadle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This was a great event, a tremendous era, in Nathaniel Pipkin\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\nand it was the only one that had ever occurred to ruffle the smooth\r\ncurrent of his quiet existence, when happening one fine afternoon, in a\r\nfit of mental abstraction, to raise his eyes from the slate on which he\r\nwas devising some tremendous problem in compound addition for an\r\noffending urchin to solve, they suddenly rested on the blooming\r\ncountenance of Maria Lobbs, the only daughter of old Lobbs, the great\r\nsaddler over the way. Now, the eyes of Mr. Pipkin had rested on the\r\npretty face of Maria Lobbs many a time and oft before, at church and\r\nelsewhere; but the eyes of Maria Lobbs had never looked so bright, the\r\ncheeks of Maria Lobbs had never looked so ruddy, as upon this particular\r\noccasion. No wonder then, that Nathaniel Pipkin was unable to take his\r\neyes from the countenance of Miss Lobbs; no wonder that Miss Lobbs,\r\nfinding herself stared at by a young man, withdrew her head from the\r\nwindow out of which she had been peeping, and shut the casement and\r\npulled down the blind; no wonder that Nathaniel Pipkin, immediately\r\nthereafter, fell upon the young urchin who had previously offended, and\r\ncuffed and knocked him about to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. All this was very\r\nnatural, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing at all to wonder at about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It _is_ matter of wonder, though, that anyone of Mr. Nathaniel Pipkin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nretiring disposition, nervous temperament, and most particularly\r\ndiminutive income, should from this day forth, have dared to aspire to\r\nthe hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old Lobbs--of old\r\nLobbs, the great saddler, who could have bought up the whole village at\r\none stroke of his pen, and never felt the outlay--old Lobbs, who was\r\nwell known to have heaps of money, invested in the bank at the nearest\r\nmarket town--who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible\r\ntreasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big keyhole, over\r\nthe chimney-piece in the back parlour--and who, it was well known, on\r\nfestive occasions garnished his board with a real silver teapot, cream-\r\newer, and sugar-basin, which he was wont, in the pride of his heart, to\r\nboast should be his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s property when she found a man to her\r\nmind. I repeat it, to be matter of profound astonishment and intense\r\nwonder, that Nathaniel Pipkin should have had the temerity to cast his\r\neyes in this direction. But love is blind; and Nathaniel had a cast in\r\nhis eye; and perhaps these two circumstances, taken together, prevented\r\nhis seeing the matter in its proper light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, if old Lobbs had entertained the most remote or distant idea of\r\nthe state of the affections of Nathaniel Pipkin, he would just have\r\nrazed the school-room to the ground, or exterminated its master from the\r\nsurface of the earth, or committed some other outrage and atrocity of an\r\nequally ferocious and violent description; for he was a terrible old\r\nfellow, was Lobbs, when his pride was injured, or his blood was up.\r\nSwear! Such trains of oaths would come rolling and pealing over the way,\r\nsometimes, when he was denouncing the idleness of the bony apprentice\r\nwith the thin legs, that Nathaniel Pipkin would shake in his shoes with\r\nhorror, and the hair of the pupils\xe2\x80\x99 heads would stand on end with\r\nfright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! Day after day, when school was over, and the pupils gone, did\r\nNathaniel Pipkin sit himself down at the front window, and, while he\r\nfeigned to be reading a book, throw sidelong glances over the way in\r\nsearch of the bright eyes of Maria Lobbs; and he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sat there many\r\ndays, before the bright eyes appeared at an upper window, apparently\r\ndeeply engaged in reading too. This was delightful, and gladdening to\r\nthe heart of Nathaniel Pipkin. It was something to sit there for hours\r\ntogether, and look upon that pretty face when the eyes were cast down;\r\nbut when Maria Lobbs began to raise her eyes from her book, and dart\r\ntheir rays in the direction of Nathaniel Pipkin, his delight and\r\nadmiration were perfectly boundless. At last, one day when he knew old\r\nLobbs was out, Nathaniel Pipkin had the temerity to kiss his hand to\r\nMaria Lobbs; and Maria Lobbs, instead of shutting the window, and\r\npulling down the blind, kissed _hers _to him, and smiled. Upon which\r\nNathaniel Pipkin determined, that, come what might, he would develop the\r\nstate of his feelings, without further delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A prettier foot, a gayer heart, a more dimpled face, or a smarter form,\r\nnever bounded so lightly over the earth they graced, as did those of\r\nMaria Lobbs, the old saddler\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. There was a roguish twinkle in\r\nher sparkling eyes, that would have made its way to far less susceptible\r\nbosoms than that of Nathaniel Pipkin; and there was such a joyous sound\r\nin her merry laugh, that the sternest misanthrope must have smiled to\r\nhear it. Even old Lobbs himself, in the very height of his ferocity,\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist the coaxing of his pretty daughter; and when she, and\r\nher cousin Kate--an arch, impudent-looking, bewitching little person--\r\nmade a dead set upon the old man together, as, to say the truth, they\r\nvery often did, he could have refused them nothing, even had they asked\r\nfor a portion of the countless and inexhaustible treasures, which were\r\nhidden from the light, in the iron safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nathaniel Pipkin\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat high within him, when he saw this\r\nenticing little couple some hundred yards before him one summer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevening, in the very field in which he had many a time strolled about\r\ntill night-time, and pondered on the beauty of Maria Lobbs. But though\r\nhe had often thought then, how briskly he would walk up to Maria Lobbs\r\nand tell her of his passion if he could only meet her, he felt, now that\r\nshe was unexpectedly before him, all the blood in his body mounting to\r\nhis face, manifestly to the great detriment of his legs, which, deprived\r\nof their usual portion, trembled beneath him. When they stopped to\r\ngather a hedge flower, or listen to a bird, Nathaniel Pipkin stopped\r\ntoo, and pretended to be absorbed in meditation, as indeed he really\r\nwas; for he was thinking what on earth he should ever do, when they\r\nturned back, as they inevitably must in time, and meet him face to face.\r\nBut though he was afraid to make up to them, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to lose\r\nsight of them; so when they walked faster he walked faster, when they\r\nlingered he lingered, and when they stopped he stopped; and so they\r\nmight have gone on, until the darkness prevented them, if Kate had not\r\nlooked slyly back, and encouragingly beckoned Nathaniel to advance.\r\nThere was something in Kate\xe2\x80\x99s manner that was not to be resisted, and so\r\nNathaniel Pipkin complied with the invitation; and after a great deal of\r\nblushing on his part, and immoderate laughter on that of the wicked\r\nlittle cousin, Nathaniel Pipkin went down on his knees on the dewy\r\ngrass, and declared his resolution to remain there for ever, unless he\r\nwere permitted to rise the accepted lover of Maria Lobbs. Upon this, the\r\nmerry laughter of Miss Lobbs rang through the calm evening air--without\r\nseeming to disturb it, though; it had such a pleasant sound--and the\r\nwicked little cousin laughed more immoderately than before, and\r\nNathaniel Pipkin blushed deeper than ever. At length, Maria Lobbs being\r\nmore strenuously urged by the love-worn little man, turned away her\r\nhead, and whispered her cousin to say, or at all events Kate did say,\r\nthat she felt much honoured by Mr. Pipkin\xe2\x80\x99s addresses; that her hand and\r\nheart were at her father\xe2\x80\x99s disposal; but that nobody could be insensible\r\nto Mr. Pipkin\xe2\x80\x99s merits. As all this was said with much gravity, and as\r\nNathaniel Pipkin walked home with Maria Lobbs, and struggled for a kiss\r\nat parting, he went to bed a happy man, and dreamed all night long, of\r\nsoftening old Lobbs, opening the strong box, and marrying Maria.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Nathaniel Pipkin saw old Lobbs go out upon his old gray\r\npony, and after a great many signs at the window from the wicked little\r\ncousin, the object and meaning of which he could by no means understand,\r\nthe bony apprentice with the thin legs came over to say that his master\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming home all night, and that the ladies expected Mr. Pipkin to\r\ntea, at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely. How the lessons were got through that\r\nday, neither Nathaniel Pipkin nor his pupils knew any more than you do;\r\nbut they were got through somehow, and, after the boys had gone,\r\nNathaniel Pipkin took till full six o\xe2\x80\x99clock to dress himself to his\r\nsatisfaction. Not that it took long to select the garments he should\r\nwear, inasmuch as he had no choice about the matter; but the putting of\r\nthem on to the best advantage, and the touching of them up previously,\r\nwas a task of no inconsiderable difficulty or importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was a very snug little party, consisting of Maria Lobbs and her\r\ncousin Kate, and three or four romping, good-humoured, rosy-cheeked\r\ngirls. Nathaniel Pipkin had ocular demonstration of the fact, that the\r\nrumours of old Lobbs\xe2\x80\x99s treasures were not exaggerated. There were the\r\nreal solid silver teapot, cream-ewer, and sugar-basin, on the table, and\r\nreal silver spoons to stir the tea with, and real china cups to drink it\r\nout of, and plates of the same, to hold the cakes and toast in. The only\r\neye-sore in the whole place was another cousin of Maria Lobbs\xe2\x80\x99s, and a\r\nbrother of Kate, whom Maria Lobbs called \xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d and who seemed to keep\r\nMaria Lobbs all to himself, up in one corner of the table. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndelightful thing to see affection in families, but it may be carried\r\nrather too far, and Nathaniel Pipkin could not help thinking that Maria\r\nLobbs must be very particularly fond of her relations, if she paid as\r\nmuch attention to all of them as to this individual cousin. After tea,\r\ntoo, when the wicked little cousin proposed a game at blind man\xe2\x80\x99s buff,\r\nit somehow or other happened that Nathaniel Pipkin was nearly always\r\nblind, and whenever he laid his hand upon the male cousin, he was sure\r\nto find that Maria Lobbs was not far off. And though the wicked little\r\ncousin and the other girls pinched him, and pulled his hair, and pushed\r\nchairs in his way, and all sorts of things, Maria Lobbs never seemed to\r\ncome near him at all; and once--once--Nathaniel Pipkin could have sworn\r\nhe heard the sound of a kiss, followed by a faint remonstrance from\r\nMaria Lobbs, and a half-suppressed laugh from her female friends. All\r\nthis was odd--very odd--and there is no saying what Nathaniel Pipkin\r\nmight or might not have done, in consequence, if his thoughts had not\r\nbeen suddenly directed into a new channel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The circumstance which directed his thoughts into a new channel was a\r\nloud knocking at the street door, and the person who made this loud\r\nknocking at the street door was no other than old Lobbs himself, who had\r\nunexpectedly returned, and was hammering away, like a coffin-maker; for\r\nhe wanted his supper. The alarming intelligence was no sooner\r\ncommunicated by the bony apprentice with the thin legs, than the girls\r\ntripped upstairs to Maria Lobbs\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and the male cousin and\r\nNathaniel Pipkin were thrust into a couple of closets in the sitting-\r\nroom, for want of any better places of concealment; and when Maria Lobbs\r\nand the wicked little cousin had stowed them away, and put the room to\r\nrights, they opened the street door to old Lobbs, who had never left off\r\nknocking since he first began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now it did unfortunately happen that old Lobbs being very hungry was\r\nmonstrous cross. Nathaniel Pipkin could hear him growling away like an\r\nold mastiff with a sore throat; and whenever the unfortunate apprentice\r\nwith the thin legs came into the room, so surely did old Lobbs commence\r\nswearing at him in a most Saracenic and ferocious manner, though\r\napparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by\r\nthe discharge of a few superfluous oaths. At length some supper, which\r\nhad been warming up, was placed on the table, and then old Lobbs fell\r\nto, in regular style; and having made clear work of it in no time,\r\nkissed his daughter, and demanded his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nature had placed Nathaniel Pipkin\xe2\x80\x99s knees in very close juxtaposition,\r\nbut when he heard old Lobbs demand his pipe, they knocked together, as\r\nif they were going to reduce each other to powder; for, depending from a\r\ncouple of hooks, in the very closet in which he stood, was a large,\r\nbrown-stemmed, silver-bowled pipe, which pipe he himself had seen in the\r\nmouth of old Lobbs, regularly every afternoon and evening, for the last\r\nfive years. The two girls went downstairs for the pipe, and upstairs for\r\nthe pipe, and everywhere but where they knew the pipe was, and old Lobbs\r\nstormed away meanwhile, in the most wonderful manner. At last he thought\r\nof the closet, and walked up to it. It was of no use a little man like\r\nNathaniel Pipkin pulling the door inwards, when a great strong fellow\r\nlike old Lobbs was pulling it outwards. Old Lobbs gave it one tug, and\r\nopen it flew, disclosing Nathaniel Pipkin standing bolt upright inside,\r\nand shaking with apprehension from head to foot. Bless us! what an\r\nappalling look old Lobbs gave him, as he dragged him out by the collar,\r\nand held him at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what the devil do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Lobbs, in a fearful\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nathaniel Pipkin could make no reply, so old Lobbs shook him backwards\r\nand forwards, for two or three minutes, by way of arranging his ideas\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d roared Lobbs; \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have come after\r\nmy daughter, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Lobbs merely said this as a sneer: for he did not believe that\r\nmortal presumption could have carried Nathaniel Pipkin so far. What was\r\nhis indignation, when that poor man replied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did, Mr. Lobbs, I did come after your daughter. I love her, Mr.\r\nLobbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you snivelling, wry-faced, puny villain,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped old Lobbs,\r\nparalysed by the atrocious confession; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you mean by that? Say\r\nthis to my face! Damme, I\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is by no means improbable that old Lobbs would have carried his\r\nthreat into execution, in the excess of his rage, if his arm had not\r\nbeen stayed by a very unexpected apparition: to wit, the male cousin,\r\nwho, stepping out of his closet, and walking up to old Lobbs, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot allow this harmless person, Sir, who has been asked here, in\r\nsome girlish frolic, to take upon himself, in a very noble manner, the\r\nfault (if fault it is) which I am guilty of, and am ready to avow. I\r\nlove your daughter, sir; and I came here for the purpose of meeting\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Lobbs opened his eyes very wide at this, but not wider than\r\nNathaniel Pipkin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou did?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lobbs, at last finding breath to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I forbade you this house, long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou did, or I should not have been here, clandestinely, to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to record it of old Lobbs, but I think he would have struck\r\nthe cousin, if his pretty daughter, with her bright eyes swimming in\r\ntears, had not clung to his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop him, Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cif he has the will to\r\nstrike me, let him. I would not hurt a hair of his gray head, for the\r\nriches of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old man cast down his eyes at this reproof, and they met those of\r\nhis daughter. I have hinted once or twice before, that they were very\r\nbright eyes, and, though they were tearful now, their influence was by\r\nno means lessened. Old Lobbs turned his head away, as if to avoid being\r\npersuaded by them, when, as fortune would have it, he encountered the\r\nface of the wicked little cousin, who, half afraid for her brother, and\r\nhalf laughing at Nathaniel Pipkin, presented as bewitching an expression\r\nof countenance, with a touch of slyness in it, too, as any man, old or\r\nyoung, need look upon. She drew her arm coaxingly through the old man\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand whispered something in his ear; and do what he would, old Lobbs\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help breaking out into a smile, while a tear stole down his\r\ncheek at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Five minutes after this, the girls were brought down from the bedroom\r\nwith a great deal of giggling and modesty; and while the young people\r\nwere making themselves perfectly happy, old Lobbs got down the pipe, and\r\nsmoked it; and it was a remarkable circumstance about that particular\r\npipe of tobacco, that it was the most soothing and delightful one he\r\never smoked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nathaniel Pipkin thought it best to keep his own counsel, and by so\r\ndoing gradually rose into high favour with old Lobbs, who taught him to\r\nsmoke in time; and they used to sit out in the garden on the fine\r\nevenings, for many years afterwards, smoking and drinking in great\r\nstate. He soon recovered the effects of his attachment, for we find his\r\nname in the parish register, as a witness to the marriage of Maria Lobbs\r\nto her cousin; and it also appears, by reference to other documents,\r\nthat on the night of the wedding he was incarcerated in the village\r\ncage, for having, in a state of extreme intoxication, committed sundry\r\nexcesses in the streets, in all of which he was aided and abetted by the\r\nbony apprentice with the thin legs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. BRIEFLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF TWO POINTS; FIRST, THE POWER OF\r\nHYSTERICS, AND, SECONDLY, THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES\r\n\r\nFor two days after the _dejeune _at Mrs. Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s, the Pickwickians\r\nremained at Eatanswill, anxiously awaiting the arrival of some\r\nintelligence from their revered leader. Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass\r\nwere once again left to their own means of amusement; for Mr. Winkle, in\r\ncompliance with a most pressing invitation, continued to reside at Mr.\r\nPott\xe2\x80\x99s house, and to devote his time to the companionship of his amiable\r\nlady. Nor was the occasional society of Mr. Pott himself wanting to\r\ncomplete their felicity. Deeply immersed in the intensity of his\r\nspeculations for the public weal and the destruction of the\r\n_Independent_, it was not the habit of that great man to descend from\r\nhis mental pinnacle to the humble level of ordinary minds. On this\r\noccasion, however, and as if expressly in compliment to any follower of\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s, he unbent, relaxed, stepped down from his pedestal, and\r\nwalked upon the ground, benignly adapting his remarks to the\r\ncomprehension of the herd, and seeming in outward form, if not in\r\nspirit, to be one of them.\r\n\r\nSuch having been the demeanour of this celebrated public character\r\ntowards Mr. Winkle, it will be readily imagined that considerable\r\nsurprise was depicted on the countenance of the latter gentleman, when,\r\nas he was sitting alone in the breakfast-room, the door was hastily\r\nthrown open, and as hastily closed, on the entrance of Mr. Pott, who,\r\nstalking majestically towards him, and thrusting aside his proffered\r\nhand, ground his teeth, as if to put a sharper edge on what he was about\r\nto utter, and exclaimed, in a saw-like voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serpent!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Winkle, starting from his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serpent, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Pott, raising his voice, and then suddenly\r\ndepressing it: \xe2\x80\x98I said, serpent, sir--make the most of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen you have parted with a man at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, on terms\r\nof the utmost good-fellowship, and he meets you again, at half-past\r\nnine, and greets you as a serpent, it is not unreasonable to conclude\r\nthat something of an unpleasant nature has occurred meanwhile. So Mr.\r\nWinkle thought. He returned Mr. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s gaze of stone, and in compliance\r\nwith that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s request, proceeded to make the most he could of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98serpent.\xe2\x80\x99 The most, however, was nothing at all; so, after a\r\nprofound silence of some minutes\xe2\x80\x99 duration, he said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serpent, Sir! Serpent, Mr. Pott! What can you mean, Sir?--this is\r\npleasantry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pleasantry, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Pott, with a motion of the hand, indicative\r\nof a strong desire to hurl the Britannia metal teapot at the head of the\r\nvisitor. \xe2\x80\x98Pleasantry, sir!--But--no, I will be calm; I will be calm,\r\nSir;\xe2\x80\x99 in proof of his calmness, Mr. Pott flung himself into a chair, and\r\nfoamed at the mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_DEAR _Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pott. \xe2\x80\x98How dare you address me, as dear Sir, Sir?\r\nHow dare you look me in the face and do it, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir, if you come to that,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98how dare you\r\nlook me in the face, and call me a serpent, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you are one,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prove it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle warmly. \xe2\x80\x98Prove it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor, as he\r\ndrew from his pocket the _Independent_ of that morning; and laying his\r\nfinger on a particular paragraph, threw the journal across the table to\r\nMr. Winkle.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman took it up, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our obscure and filthy contemporary, in some disgusting observations on\r\nthe recent election for this borough, has presumed to violate the\r\nhallowed sanctity of private life, and to refer in a manner not to be\r\nmisunderstood, to the personal affairs of our late candidate--aye, and\r\nnotwithstanding his base defeat, we will add, our future member, Mr.\r\nFizkin. What does our dastardly contemporary mean? What would the\r\nruffian say, if we, setting at naught, like him, the decencies of social\r\nintercourse, were to raise the curtain which happily conceals _His_\r\nprivate life from general ridicule, not to say from general execration?\r\nWhat, if we were even to point out, and comment on, facts and\r\ncircumstances, which are publicly notorious, and beheld by every one but\r\nour mole-eyed contemporary--what if we were to print the following\r\neffusion, which we received while we were writing the commencement of\r\nthis article, from a talented fellow-townsman and correspondent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLINES TO A BRASS POT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh Pott! if you\xe2\x80\x99d known How false she\xe2\x80\x99d have grown, When you heard the\r\nmarriage bells tinkle; You\xe2\x80\x99d have done then, I vow, What you cannot help\r\nnow,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott solemnly--\xe2\x80\x98what rhymes to \xe2\x80\x9ctinkle,\xe2\x80\x9d villain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What rhymes to tinkle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott, whose entrance at the moment\r\nforestalled the reply. \xe2\x80\x98What rhymes to tinkle? Why, Winkle, I should\r\nconceive.\xe2\x80\x99 Saying this, Mrs. Pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed\r\nPickwickian, and extended her hand towards him. The agitated young man\r\nwould have accepted it, in his confusion, had not Pott indignantly\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Back, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--back!\xe2\x80\x99 said the editor. \xe2\x80\x98Take his hand before my very\r\nface!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. P.!\xe2\x80\x99 said his astonished lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wretched woman, look here,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the husband. \xe2\x80\x98Look here, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLines to a Brass Pot.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBrass Pot\xe2\x80\x9d; that\xe2\x80\x99s me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. \xe2\x80\x9cFalse _she\xe2\x80\x99d_\r\nhave grown\xe2\x80\x9d; that\xe2\x80\x99s you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--you.\xe2\x80\x99 With this ebullition of rage,\r\nwhich was not unaccompanied with something like a tremble, at the\r\nexpression of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s face, Mr. Pott dashed the current number of the\r\nEatanswill _Independent_ at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the astonished Mrs. Pott, stooping to pick up\r\nthe paper. \xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pott winced beneath the contemptuous gaze of his wife. He had made a\r\ndesperate struggle to screw up his courage, but it was fast coming\r\nunscrewed again.\r\n\r\nThere appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence, \xe2\x80\x98Upon my\r\nword, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 when it comes to be read; but the tone of voice in which it\r\nwas delivered, and the look that accompanied it, both seeming to bear\r\nreference to some revenge to be thereafter visited upon the head of\r\nPott, produced their effect upon him. The most unskilful observer could\r\nhave detected in his troubled countenance, a readiness to resign his\r\nWellington boots to any efficient substitute who would have consented to\r\nstand in them at that moment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pott read the paragraph, uttered a loud shriek, and threw herself\r\nat full length on the hearth-rug, screaming, and tapping it with the\r\nheels of her shoes, in a manner which could leave no doubt of the\r\npropriety of her feelings on the occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the terrified Pott, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I believed it;--I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbut the unfortunate man\xe2\x80\x99s voice was drowned in the screaming of his\r\npartner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Pott, let me entreat you, my dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to compose yourself,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Winkle; but the shrieks and tappings were louder, and more\r\nfrequent than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t consider your\r\nown health, consider me, my dear. We shall have a crowd round the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x99 But the more strenuously Mr. Pott entreated, the more vehemently\r\nthe screams poured forth.\r\n\r\nVery fortunately, however, attached to Mrs. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s person was a\r\nbodyguard of one, a young lady whose ostensible employment was to\r\npreside over her toilet, but who rendered herself useful in a variety of\r\nways, and in none more so than in the particular department of\r\nconstantly aiding and abetting her mistress in every wish and\r\ninclination opposed to the desires of the unhappy Pott. The screams\r\nreached this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s ears in due course, and brought her into the\r\nroom with a speed which threatened to derange, materially, the very\r\nexquisite arrangement of her cap and ringlets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear, dear mistress!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the bodyguard, kneeling\r\nfrantically by the side of the prostrate Mrs. Pott. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear\r\nmistress, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your master--your brutal master,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the patient.\r\n\r\nPott was evidently giving way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bodyguard reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x98I know he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the\r\ndeath on you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Poor dear thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gave way more. The opposite party followed up the attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me--don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me, Goodwin,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mrs. Pott,\r\nclutching at the wrist of the said Goodwin with an hysteric jerk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re the only person that\xe2\x80\x99s kind to me, Goodwin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this affecting appeal, Goodwin got up a little domestic tragedy of\r\nher own, and shed tears copiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--never,\xe2\x80\x99 said Goodwin. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir, you should be careful--\r\nyou should indeed; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what harm you may do missis; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nsorry for it one day, I know--I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe unlucky Pott looked timidly on, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Goodwin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott, in a soft voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Goodwin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you only knew how I have loved that man--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself by recollecting it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bodyguard.\r\n\r\nPott looked very frightened. It was time to finish him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 sobbed Mrs. Pott, \xe2\x80\x98now, after all, to be treated in this way;\r\nto be reproached and insulted in the presence of a third party, and that\r\nparty almost a stranger. But I will not submit to it! Goodwin,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Mrs. Pott, raising herself in the arms of her attendant, \xe2\x80\x98my\r\nbrother, the lieutenant, shall interfere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be separated, Goodwin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would certainly serve him right, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Goodwin.\r\n\r\nWhatever thoughts the threat of a separation might have awakened in Mr.\r\nPott\xe2\x80\x99s mind, he forbore to give utterance to them, and contented himself\r\nby saying, with great humility:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, will you hear me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA fresh train of sobs was the only reply, as Mrs. Pott grew more\r\nhysterical, requested to be informed why she was ever born, and required\r\nsundry other pieces of information of a similar description.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Pott, \xe2\x80\x98do not give way to these sensitive\r\nfeelings. I never believed that the paragraph had any foundation, my\r\ndear--impossible. I was only angry, my dear--I may say outrageous--with\r\nthe _Independent_ people for daring to insert it; that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pott\r\ncast an imploring look at the innocent cause of the mischief, as if to\r\nentreat him to say nothing about the serpent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what steps, sir, do you mean to take to obtain redress?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired\r\nMr. Winkle, gaining courage as he saw Pott losing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Goodwin,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mrs. Pott, \xe2\x80\x98does he mean to horsewhip the editor\r\nof the _Independent_--does he, Goodwin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, hush, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; pray keep yourself quiet,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the bodyguard. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndare say he will, if you wish it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, as his wife evinced decided symptoms of going\r\noff again. \xe2\x80\x98Of course I shall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When, Goodwin--when?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott, still undecided about the going\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Immediately, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott; \xe2\x80\x98before the day is out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Goodwin,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mrs. Pott, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way of meeting the\r\nslander, and setting me right with the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Goodwin. \xe2\x80\x98No man as is a man, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, could\r\nrefuse to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, as the hysterics were still hovering about, Mr. Pott said once more\r\nthat he would do it; but Mrs. Pott was so overcome at the bare idea of\r\nhaving ever been suspected, that she was half a dozen times on the very\r\nverge of a relapse, and most unquestionably would have gone off, had it\r\nnot been for the indefatigable efforts of the assiduous Goodwin, and\r\nrepeated entreaties for pardon from the conquered Pott; and finally,\r\nwhen that unhappy individual had been frightened and snubbed down to his\r\nproper level, Mrs. Pott recovered, and they went to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not allow this base newspaper slander to shorten your stay\r\nhere, Mr. Winkle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott, smiling through the traces of her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, actuated, as he spoke, by a wish that his\r\nvisitor would choke himself with the morsel of dry toast which he was\r\nraising to his lips at the moment, and so terminate his stay\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98but a letter has been received\r\nfrom Mr. Pickwick--so I learn by a note from Mr. Tupman, which was\r\nbrought up to my bedroom door, this morning--in which he requests us to\r\njoin him at Bury to-day; and we are to leave by the coach at noon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you will come back?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite sure?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pott, stealing a tender look at her\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast passed off in silence, for each of the party was brooding\r\nover his, or her, own personal grievances. Mrs. Pott was regretting the\r\nloss of a beau; Mr. Pott his rash pledge to horsewhip the _Independent_;\r\nMr. Winkle his having innocently placed himself in so awkward a\r\nsituation. Noon approached, and after many adieux and promises to\r\nreturn, he tore himself away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he ever comes back, I\xe2\x80\x99ll poison him,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pott, as he turned\r\ninto the little back office where he prepared his thunderbolts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I ever do come back, and mix myself up with these people again,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought Mr. Winkle, as he wended his way to the Peacock, \xe2\x80\x98I shall\r\ndeserve to be horsewhipped myself--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friends were ready, the coach was nearly so, and in half an hour\r\nthey were proceeding on their journey, along the road over which Mr.\r\nPickwick and Sam had so recently travelled, and of which, as we have\r\nalready said something, we do not feel called upon to extract Mr.\r\nSnodgrass\xe2\x80\x99s poetical and beautiful description.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller was standing at the door of the Angel, ready to receive them,\r\nand by that gentleman they were ushered to the apartment of Mr.\r\nPickwick, where, to the no small surprise of Mr. Winkle and Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, and the no small embarrassment of Mr. Tupman, they found old\r\nWardle and Trundle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, grasping Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t hang\r\nback, or look sentimental about it; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, old fellow. For\r\nher sake, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d had her; for your own, I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad you have\r\nnot. A young fellow like you will do better one of these days, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 With\r\nthis conclusion, Wardle slapped Mr. Tupman on the back, and laughed\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and how are you, my fine fellows?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman,\r\nshaking hands with Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass at the same time. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave just been telling Pickwick that we must have you all down at\r\nChristmas. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a wedding--a real wedding this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A wedding!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass, turning very pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, a wedding. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x99 said the good-humoured old\r\nman; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s only Trundle there, and Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, is that all?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, relieved from a painful doubt\r\nwhich had fallen heavily on his breast. \xe2\x80\x98Give you joy, Sir. How is Joe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Sleepy as ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your mother, and the clergyman, and all of \xe2\x80\x98em?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, with an effort--\xe2\x80\x98where is--_she_, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\nturned away his head, and covered his eyes with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_She_!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, with a knowing shake of the head. \xe2\x80\x98Do\r\nyou mean my single relative--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman, by a nod, intimated that his question applied to the\r\ndisappointed Rachael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone away,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s living at a\r\nrelation\xe2\x80\x99s, far enough off. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see the girls, so I let\r\nher go. But come! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the dinner. You must be hungry after your ride.\r\nI am, without any ride at all; so let us fall to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmple justice was done to the meal; and when they were seated round the\r\ntable, after it had been disposed of, Mr. Pickwick, to the intense\r\nhorror and indignation of his followers, related the adventure he had\r\nundergone, and the success which had attended the base artifices of the\r\ndiabolical Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the attack of rheumatism which I caught in that garden,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x98renders me lame at this moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, too, have had something of an adventure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, with a\r\nsmile; and, at the request of Mr. Pickwick, he detailed the malicious\r\nlibel of the Eatanswill _Independent_, and the consequent excitement of\r\ntheir friend, the editor.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s brow darkened during the recital. His friends observed\r\nit, and, when Mr. Winkle had concluded, maintained a profound silence.\r\nMr. Pickwick struck the table emphatically with his clenched fist, and\r\nspoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not a wonderful circumstance,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that we seem\r\ndestined to enter no man\xe2\x80\x99s house without involving him in some degree of\r\ntrouble? Does it not, I ask, bespeak the indiscretion, or, worse than\r\nthat, the blackness of heart--that I should say so!--of my followers,\r\nthat, beneath whatever roof they locate, they disturb the peace of mind\r\nand happiness of some confiding female? Is it not, I say--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick would in all probability have gone on for some time, had\r\nnot the entrance of Sam, with a letter, caused him to break off in his\r\neloquent discourse. He passed his handkerchief across his forehead, took\r\noff his spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again; and his voice had\r\nrecovered its wonted softness of tone when he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you there, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Called at the post-office just now, and found this here letter, as has\r\nlaid there for two days,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s sealed vith a vafer,\r\nand directed in round hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know this hand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, opening the letter. \xe2\x80\x98Mercy\r\non us! what\xe2\x80\x99s this? It must be a jest; it--it--can\xe2\x80\x99t be true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 was the general inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody dead, is there?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, alarmed at the horror in Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s countenance.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick made no reply, but, pushing the letter across the table,\r\nand desiring Mr. Tupman to read it aloud, fell back in his chair with a\r\nlook of vacant astonishment quite alarming to behold.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman, with a trembling voice, read the letter, of which the\r\nfollowing is a copy:--\r\n\r\nFreeman\xe2\x80\x99s Court, Cornhill, August 28th, 1827.\r\n\r\nBardell against Pickwick.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHaving been instructed by Mrs. Martha Bardell to commence an action\r\nagainst you for a breach of promise of marriage, for which the plaintiff\r\nlays her damages at fifteen hundred pounds, we beg to inform you that a\r\nwrit has been issued against you in this suit in the Court of Common\r\nPleas; and request to know, by return of post, the name of your attorney\r\nin London, who will accept service thereof.\r\n\r\nWe are, Sir, Your obedient servants, Dodson & Fogg.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Pickwick.\r\n\r\nThere was something so impressive in the mute astonishment with which\r\neach man regarded his neighbour, and every man regarded Mr. Pickwick,\r\nthat all seemed afraid to speak. The silence was at length broken by Mr.\r\nTupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dodson and Fogg,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bardell and Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peace of mind and happiness of confiding females,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mr. Winkle,\r\nwith an air of abstraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, at length recovering the power\r\nof speech; \xe2\x80\x98a base conspiracy between these two grasping attorneys,\r\nDodson and Fogg. Mrs. Bardell would never do it;--she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the heart\r\nto do it;--she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case to do it. Ridiculous--ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOf her heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x98you should certainly be the\r\nbest judge. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to discourage you, but I should certainly say\r\nthat, of her case, Dodson and Fogg are far better judges than any of us\r\ncan be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a vile attempt to extort money,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, with a short, dry cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who ever heard me address her in any way but that in which a lodger\r\nwould address his landlady?\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, with great\r\nvehemence. \xe2\x80\x98Who ever saw me with her? Not even my friends here--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except on one occasion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick changed colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s important. There was nothing\r\nsuspicious then, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman glanced timidly at his leader. \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98there was\r\nnothing suspicious; but--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it happened, mind--she\r\ncertainly was reclining in his arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gracious powers!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, as the recollection of the\r\nscene in question struck forcibly upon him; \xe2\x80\x98what a dreadful instance of\r\nthe force of circumstances! So she was--so she was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And our friend was soothing her anguish,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, rather\r\nmaliciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. So I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98for a case in which there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing suspicious,\r\nthis looks rather queer--eh, Pickwick? Ah, sly dog--sly dog!\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\nlaughed till the glasses on the sideboard rang again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a dreadful conjunction of appearances!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick,\r\nresting his chin upon his hands. \xe2\x80\x98Winkle--Tupman--I beg your pardon for\r\nthe observations I made just now. We are all the victims of\r\ncircumstances, and I the greatest.\xe2\x80\x99 With this apology Mr. Pickwick\r\nburied his head in his hands, and ruminated; while Wardle measured out a\r\nregular circle of nods and winks, addressed to the other members of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it explained, though,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, raising his head\r\nand hammering the table. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll see this Dodson and Fogg! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to\r\nLondon to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re too lame.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, next day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next day is the first of September, and you\xe2\x80\x99re pledged to ride out with\r\nus, as far as Sir Geoffrey Manning\xe2\x80\x99s grounds at all events, and to meet\r\nus at lunch, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take the field.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, the day after,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98Thursday.--Sam!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take two places outside to London, on Thursday morning, for yourself\r\nand me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery well, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller left the room, and departed slowly on his errand, with his\r\nhands in his pocket and his eyes fixed on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rum feller, the hemperor,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, as he walked slowly up the\r\nstreet. \xe2\x80\x98Think o\xe2\x80\x99 his makin\xe2\x80\x99 up to that \xe2\x80\x98ere Mrs. Bardell--vith a little\r\nboy, too! Always the vay vith these here old \xe2\x80\x98uns howsoever, as is such\r\nsteady goers to look at. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it, though--I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it!\xe2\x80\x99 Moralising in this strain, Mr. Samuel\r\nWeller bent his steps towards the booking-office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. A PLEASANT DAY WITH AN UNPLEASANT TERMINATION\r\n\r\nThe birds, who, happily for their own peace of mind and personal\r\ncomfort, were in blissful ignorance of the preparations which had been\r\nmaking to astonish them, on the first of September, hailed it, no doubt,\r\nas one of the pleasantest mornings they had seen that season. Many a\r\nyoung partridge who strutted complacently among the stubble, with all\r\nthe finicking coxcombry of youth, and many an older one who watched his\r\nlevity out of his little round eye, with the contemptuous air of a bird\r\nof wisdom and experience, alike unconscious of their approaching doom,\r\nbasked in the fresh morning air with lively and blithesome feelings, and\r\na few hours afterwards were laid low upon the earth. But we grow\r\naffecting: let us proceed.\r\n\r\nIn plain commonplace matter-of-fact, then, it was a fine morning--so\r\nfine that you would scarcely have believed that the few months of an\r\nEnglish summer had yet flown by. Hedges, fields, and trees, hill and\r\nmoorland, presented to the eye their ever-varying shades of deep rich\r\ngreen; scarce a leaf had fallen, scarce a sprinkle of yellow mingled\r\nwith the hues of summer, warned you that autumn had begun. The sky was\r\ncloudless; the sun shone out bright and warm; the songs of birds, the\r\nhum of myriads of summer insects, filled the air; and the cottage\r\ngardens, crowded with flowers of every rich and beautiful tint,\r\nsparkled, in the heavy dew, like beds of glittering jewels. Everything\r\nbore the stamp of summer, and none of its beautiful colour had yet faded\r\nfrom the die.\r\n\r\nSuch was the morning, when an open carriage, in which were three\r\nPickwickians (Mr. Snodgrass having preferred to remain at home), Mr.\r\nWardle, and Mr. Trundle, with Sam Weller on the box beside the driver,\r\npulled up by a gate at the roadside, before which stood a tall, raw-\r\nboned gamekeeper, and a half-booted, leather-legginged boy, each bearing\r\na bag of capacious dimensions, and accompanied by a brace of pointers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Winkle to Wardle, as the man let down the steps,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98they don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose we\xe2\x80\x99re going to kill game enough to fill those bags,\r\ndo they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fill them!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed old Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Bless you, yes! You shall fill one,\r\nand I the other; and when we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with them, the pockets of our\r\nshooting-jackets will hold as much more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle dismounted without saying anything in reply to this\r\nobservation; but he thought within himself, that if the party remained\r\nin the open air, till he had filled one of the bags, they stood a\r\nconsiderable chance of catching colds in their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hi, Juno, lass-hi, old girl; down, Daph, down,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, caressing\r\nthe dogs. \xe2\x80\x98Sir Geoffrey still in Scotland, of course, Martin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe tall gamekeeper replied in the affirmative, and looked with some\r\nsurprise from Mr. Winkle, who was holding his gun as if he wished his\r\ncoat pocket to save him the trouble of pulling the trigger, to Mr.\r\nTupman, who was holding his as if he was afraid of it--as there is no\r\nearthly reason to doubt he really was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friends are not much in the way of this sort of thing yet, Martin,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Wardle, noticing the look. \xe2\x80\x98Live and learn, you know. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ngood shots one of these days. I beg my friend Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, though;\r\nhe has had some practice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle smiled feebly over his blue neckerchief in acknowledgment of\r\nthe compliment, and got himself so mysteriously entangled with his gun,\r\nin his modest confusion, that if the piece had been loaded, he must\r\ninevitably have shot himself dead upon the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t handle your piece in that \xe2\x80\x98ere way, when you come to have\r\nthe charge in it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the tall gamekeeper gruffly; \xe2\x80\x98or I\xe2\x80\x99m damned\r\nif you won\xe2\x80\x99t make cold meat of some on us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, thus admonished, abruptly altered his position, and in so\r\ndoing, contrived to bring the barrel into pretty smart contact with Mr.\r\nWeller\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, picking up his hat, which had been knocked off, and\r\nrubbing his temple. \xe2\x80\x98Hollo, sir! if you comes it this vay, you\xe2\x80\x99ll fill\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99 them bags, and something to spare, at one fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the leather-legginged boy laughed very heartily, and then tried to\r\nlook as if it was somebody else, whereat Mr. Winkle frowned\r\nmajestically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did you tell the boy to meet us with the snack, Martin?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired\r\nWardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Side of One-tree Hill, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not Sir Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s land, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sir; but it\xe2\x80\x99s close by it. It\xe2\x80\x99s Captain Boldwig\xe2\x80\x99s land; but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be nobody to interrupt us, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a fine bit of turf\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said old Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Now the sooner we\xe2\x80\x99re off the better. Will\r\nyou join us at twelve, then, Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was particularly desirous to view the sport, the more\r\nespecially as he was rather anxious in respect of Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s life and\r\nlimbs. On so inviting a morning, too, it was very tantalising to turn\r\nback, and leave his friends to enjoy themselves. It was, therefore, with\r\na very rueful air that he replied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I suppose I must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t the gentleman a shot, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the long gamekeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98and he\xe2\x80\x99s lame besides.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should very much like to go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick--\xe2\x80\x98very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause of commiseration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a barrow t\xe2\x80\x99other side the hedge,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy. \xe2\x80\x98If the\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s servant would wheel along the paths, he could keep nigh us,\r\nand we could lift it over the stiles, and that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wery thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, who was a party interested, inasmuch\r\nas he ardently longed to see the sport. \xe2\x80\x98The wery thing. Well said,\r\nSmallcheek; I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it out in a minute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut here a difficulty arose. The long gamekeeper resolutely protested\r\nagainst the introduction into a shooting party, of a gentleman in a\r\nbarrow, as a gross violation of all established rules and precedents.\r\n\r\nIt was a great objection, but not an insurmountable one. The gamekeeper\r\nhaving been coaxed and feed, and having, moreover, eased his mind by\r\n\xe2\x80\x98punching\xe2\x80\x99 the head of the inventive youth who had first suggested the\r\nuse of the machine, Mr. Pickwick was placed in it, and off the party\r\nset; Wardle and the long gamekeeper leading the way, and Mr. Pickwick in\r\nthe barrow, propelled by Sam, bringing up the rear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, when they had got half across the first\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t suffer this barrow to be moved another step,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, resolutely, \xe2\x80\x98unless Winkle carries that gun of his in a\r\ndifferent manner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How _am_ I to carry it?\xe2\x80\x99 said the wretched Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Carry it with the muzzle to the ground,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s so unsportsmanlike,\xe2\x80\x99 reasoned Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether it\xe2\x80\x99s unsportsmanlike or not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nPickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I am not going to be shot in a wheel-barrow, for the sake of\r\nappearances, to please anybody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99ll put that \xe2\x80\x98ere charge into somebody afore he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndone,\xe2\x80\x99 growled the long man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well--I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said poor Winkle, turning his gun-stock\r\nuppermost--\xe2\x80\x98there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anythin\xe2\x80\x99 for a quiet life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller; and on they went again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, after they had gone a few yards farther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What now?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That gun of Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s is not safe: I know it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? What! not safe?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, in a tone of great alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not as you are carrying it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry to\r\nmake any further objection, but I cannot consent to go on, unless you\r\ncarry it as Winkle does his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you had better, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the long gamekeeper, \xe2\x80\x98or you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nquite as likely to lodge the charge in yourself as in anything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman, with the most obliging haste, placed his piece in the\r\nposition required, and the party moved on again; the two amateurs\r\nmarching with reversed arms, like a couple of privates at a royal\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nThe dogs suddenly came to a dead stop, and the party advancing\r\nstealthily a single pace, stopped too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the dogs\xe2\x80\x99 legs?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98How\r\nqueer they\xe2\x80\x99re standing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle softly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, they\xe2\x80\x99re making\r\na point?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Making a point!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, staring about him, as if he expected\r\nto discover some particular beauty in the landscape, which the sagacious\r\nanimals were calling special attention to. \xe2\x80\x98Making a point! What are\r\nthey pointing at?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep your eyes open,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, not heeding the question in the\r\nexcitement of the moment. \xe2\x80\x98Now then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp whirring noise, that made Mr. Winkle start back as if\r\nhe had been shot himself. Bang, bang, went a couple of guns--the smoke\r\nswept quickly away over the field, and curled into the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are they!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, in a state of the highest excitement,\r\nturning round and round in all directions. \xe2\x80\x98Where are they? Tell me when\r\nto fire. Where are they--where are they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are they!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, taking up a brace of birds which the dogs\r\nhad deposited at his feet. \xe2\x80\x98Why, here they are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; I mean the others,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bewildered Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Far enough off, by this time,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle, coolly reloading his\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall very likely be up with another covey in five minutes,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe long gamekeeper. \xe2\x80\x98If the gentleman begins to fire now, perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\njust get the shot out of the barrel by the time they rise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 roared Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, compassionating his follower\xe2\x80\x99s confusion and\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 So, by way of indemnification, Mr. Weller\r\ncontorted his features from behind the wheel-barrow, for the exclusive\r\namusement of the boy with the leggings, who thereupon burst into a\r\nboisterous laugh, and was summarily cuffed by the long gamekeeper, who\r\nwanted a pretext for turning round, to hide his own merriment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo, old fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle to Mr. Tupman; \xe2\x80\x98you fired that time, at\r\nall events.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman, with conscious pride. \xe2\x80\x98I let it off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hit something next time, if you look sharp. Very\r\neasy, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman. \xe2\x80\x98How it hurts one\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\nthough. It nearly knocked me backwards. I had no idea these small\r\nfirearms kicked so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to it in time.\r\nNow then--all ready--all right with the barrow there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come along, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold hard, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, raising the barrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aye, aye,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick; and on they went, as briskly as need\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep that barrow back now,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wardle, when it had been hoisted over\r\na stile into another field, and Mr. Pickwick had been deposited in it\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, pausing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98follow me softly, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ntoo late this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never fear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98Are they pointing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; not now. Quietly now, quietly.\xe2\x80\x99 On they crept, and very quietly\r\nthey would have advanced, if Mr. Winkle, in the performance of some very\r\nintricate evolutions with his gun, had not accidentally fired, at the\r\nmost critical moment, over the boy\xe2\x80\x99s head, exactly in the very spot\r\nwhere the tall man\xe2\x80\x99s brain would have been, had he been there instead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what on earth did you do that for?\xe2\x80\x99 said old Wardle, as the birds\r\nflew unharmed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never saw such a gun in my life,\xe2\x80\x99 replied poor Mr. Winkle, looking at\r\nthe lock, as if that would do any good. \xe2\x80\x98It goes off of its own accord.\r\nIt _will _do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will do it!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Wardle, with something of irritation in his manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish it would kill something of its own accord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll do that afore long, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the tall man, in a low,\r\nprophetic voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that observation, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle,\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, Sir, never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the long gamekeeper; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nfamily myself, sir; and this here boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother will get something\r\nhandsome from Sir Geoffrey, if he\xe2\x80\x99s killed on his land. Load again, Sir,\r\nload again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take away his gun,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick from the barrow, horror-stricken\r\nat the long man\xe2\x80\x99s dark insinuations. \xe2\x80\x98Take away his gun, do you hear,\r\nsomebody?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNobody, however, volunteered to obey the command; and Mr. Winkle, after\r\ndarting a rebellious glance at Mr. Pickwick, reloaded his gun, and\r\nproceeded onwards with the rest.\r\n\r\nWe are bound, on the authority of Mr. Pickwick, to state, that Mr.\r\nTupman\xe2\x80\x99s mode of proceeding evinced far more of prudence and\r\ndeliberation, than that adopted by Mr. Winkle. Still, this by no means\r\ndetracts from the great authority of the latter gentleman, on all\r\nmatters connected with the field; because, as Mr. Pickwick beautifully\r\nobserves, it has somehow or other happened, from time immemorial, that\r\nmany of the best and ablest philosophers, who have been perfect lights\r\nof science in matters of theory, have been wholly unable to reduce them\r\nto practice.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s process, like many of our most sublime discoveries, was\r\nextremely simple. With the quickness and penetration of a man of genius,\r\nhe had at once observed that the two great points to be attained were--\r\nfirst, to discharge his piece without injury to himself, and, secondly,\r\nto do so, without danger to the bystanders--obviously, the best thing to\r\ndo, after surmounting the difficulty of firing at all, was to shut his\r\neyes firmly, and fire into the air.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, after performing this feat, Mr. Tupman, on opening his\r\neyes, beheld a plump partridge in the act of falling, wounded, to the\r\nground. He was on the point of congratulating Mr. Wardle on his\r\ninvariable success, when that gentleman advanced towards him, and\r\ngrasped him warmly by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tupman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98you singled out that particular\r\nbird?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman--\xe2\x80\x98no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98I saw you do it--I observed you pick him out--I\r\nnoticed you, as you raised your piece to take aim; and I will say this,\r\nthat the best shot in existence could not have done it more beautifully.\r\nYou are an older hand at this than I thought you, Tupman; you have been\r\nout before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was in vain for Mr. Tupman to protest, with a smile of self-denial,\r\nthat he never had. The very smile was taken as evidence to the contrary;\r\nand from that time forth his reputation was established. It is not the\r\nonly reputation that has been acquired as easily, nor are such fortunate\r\ncircumstances confined to partridge-shooting.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Winkle flashed, and blazed, and smoked away, without\r\nproducing any material results worthy of being noted down; sometimes\r\nexpending his charge in mid-air, and at others sending it skimming along\r\nso near the surface of the ground as to place the lives of the two dogs\r\non a rather uncertain and precarious tenure. As a display of fancy-\r\nshooting, it was extremely varied and curious; as an exhibition of\r\nfiring with any precise object, it was, upon the whole, perhaps a\r\nfailure. It is an established axiom, that \xe2\x80\x98every bullet has its billet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIf it apply in an equal degree to shot, those of Mr. Winkle were\r\nunfortunate foundlings, deprived of their natural rights, cast loose\r\nupon the world, and billeted nowhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, walking up to the side of the barrow, and wiping\r\nthe streams of perspiration from his jolly red face; \xe2\x80\x98smoking day, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. The sun is tremendously hot, even\r\nto me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you must feel it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98pretty hot. It\xe2\x80\x99s past twelve, though.\r\nYou see that green hill there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the place where we are to lunch; and, by Jove, there\xe2\x80\x99s the boy\r\nwith the basket, punctual as clockwork!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So he is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, brightening up. \xe2\x80\x98Good boy, that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngive him a shilling, presently. Now, then, Sam, wheel away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold on, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, invigorated with the prospect of\r\nrefreshments. \xe2\x80\x98Out of the vay, young leathers. If you walley my precious\r\nlife don\xe2\x80\x99t upset me, as the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n said to the driver when they was\r\na-carryin\xe2\x80\x99 him to Tyburn.\xe2\x80\x99 And quickening his pace to a sharp run, Mr.\r\nWeller wheeled his master nimbly to the green hill, shot him dexterously\r\nout by the very side of the basket, and proceeded to unpack it with the\r\nutmost despatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Weal pie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, soliloquising, as he arranged the eatables\r\non the grass. \xe2\x80\x98Wery good thing is weal pie, when you know the lady as\r\nmade it, and is quite sure it ain\xe2\x80\x99t kittens; and arter all though,\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x99s the odds, when they\xe2\x80\x99re so like weal that the wery piemen\r\nthemselves don\xe2\x80\x99t know the difference?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t they, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not they, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat. \xe2\x80\x98I lodged in the\r\nsame house vith a pieman once, sir, and a wery nice man he was--reg\xe2\x80\x99lar\r\nclever chap, too--make pies out o\xe2\x80\x99 anything, he could. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a number o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncats you keep, Mr. Brooks,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, when I\xe2\x80\x99d got intimate with him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI do--a good many,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be wery fond o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncats,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cOther people is,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, a-winkin\xe2\x80\x99 at me; \xe2\x80\x9cthey ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin season till the winter though,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cNot in season!\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cfruits is in, cats is out.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says I. \xe2\x80\x9cMean!\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cThat I\xe2\x80\x99ll never be a party to the combination\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the butchers, to keep up the price o\xe2\x80\x99 meat,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says he, a-squeezing my hand wery hard, and vispering in my ear--\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmention this here agin--but it\xe2\x80\x99s the seasonin\xe2\x80\x99 as does it. They\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nmade o\xe2\x80\x99 them noble animals,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, a-pointin\xe2\x80\x99 to a wery nice little\r\ntabby kitten, \xe2\x80\x9cand I seasons \xe2\x80\x98em for beefsteak, weal or kidney, \xe2\x80\x98cording\r\nto the demand. And more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI can make a weal a beef-\r\nsteak, or a beef-steak a kidney, or any one on \xe2\x80\x98em a mutton, at a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x99s notice, just as the market changes, and appetites wary!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must have been a very ingenious young man, that, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, with a slight shudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just was, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, continuing his occupation of\r\nemptying the basket, \xe2\x80\x98and the pies was beautiful. Tongue--, well that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na wery good thing when it ain\xe2\x80\x99t a woman\xe2\x80\x99s. Bread--knuckle o\xe2\x80\x99 ham,\r\nreg\xe2\x80\x99lar picter--cold beef in slices, wery good. What\xe2\x80\x99s in them stone\r\njars, young touch-and-go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beer in this one,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy, taking from his shoulder a couple\r\nof large stone bottles, fastened together by a leathern strap--\xe2\x80\x98cold\r\npunch in t\xe2\x80\x99other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a wery good notion of a lunch it is, take it altogether,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller, surveying his arrangement of the repast with great satisfaction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, \xe2\x80\x9cfall on,\xe2\x80\x9d as the English said to the French when they\r\nfixed bagginets.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt needed no second invitation to induce the party to yield full justice\r\nto the meal; and as little pressing did it require to induce Mr. Weller,\r\nthe long gamekeeper, and the two boys, to station themselves on the\r\ngrass, at a little distance, and do good execution upon a decent\r\nproportion of the viands. An old oak afforded a pleasant shelter to the\r\ngroup, and a rich prospect of arable and meadow land, intersected with\r\nluxuriant hedges, and richly ornamented with wood, lay spread out before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is delightful--thoroughly delightful!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; the skin\r\nof whose expressive countenance was rapidly peeling off, with exposure\r\nto the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is--so it is, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Come; a glass of\r\npunch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; the satisfaction of whose\r\ncountenance, after drinking it, bore testimony to the sincerity of the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, smacking his lips. \xe2\x80\x98Very good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nanother. Cool; very cool. Come, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick,\r\nstill retaining his hold upon the jar, \xe2\x80\x98a toast. Our friends at Dingley\r\nDell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with loud acclamations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I shall do, to get up my shooting again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWinkle, who was eating bread and ham with a pocket-knife. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a\r\nstuffed partridge on the top of a post, and practise at it, beginning at\r\na short distance, and lengthening it by degrees. I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncapital practice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know a gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99man, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98as did that, and begun at\r\ntwo yards; but he never tried it on agin; for he blowed the bird right\r\nclean away at the first fire, and nobody ever seed a feather on him\r\narterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have the goodness to reserve your anecdotes till they are called for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Weller winked the eye which was not concealed by the beer-can\r\nhe was raising to his lips, with such exquisite facetiousness, that the\r\ntwo boys went into spontaneous convulsions, and even the long man\r\ncondescended to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that certainly is most capital cold punch,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nlooking earnestly at the stone bottle; \xe2\x80\x98and the day is extremely warm,\r\nand--Tupman, my dear friend, a glass of punch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With the greatest delight,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman; and having drank that\r\nglass, Mr. Pickwick took another, just to see whether there was any\r\norange peel in the punch, because orange peel always disagreed with him;\r\nand finding that there was not, Mr. Pickwick took another glass to the\r\nhealth of their absent friend, and then felt himself imperatively called\r\nupon to propose another in honour of the punch-compounder, unknown.\r\n\r\nThis constant succession of glasses produced considerable effect upon\r\nMr. Pickwick; his countenance beamed with the most sunny smiles,\r\nlaughter played around his lips, and good-humoured merriment twinkled in\r\nhis eye. Yielding by degrees to the influence of the exciting liquid,\r\nrendered more so by the heat, Mr. Pickwick expressed a strong desire to\r\nrecollect a song which he had heard in his infancy, and the attempt\r\nproving abortive, sought to stimulate his memory with more glasses of\r\npunch, which appeared to have quite a contrary effect; for, from\r\nforgetting the words of the song, he began to forget how to articulate\r\nany words at all; and finally, after rising to his legs to address the\r\ncompany in an eloquent speech, he fell into the barrow, and fast asleep,\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe basket having been repacked, and it being found perfectly impossible\r\nto awaken Mr. Pickwick from his torpor, some discussion took place\r\nwhether it would be better for Mr. Weller to wheel his master back\r\nagain, or to leave him where he was, until they should all be ready to\r\nreturn. The latter course was at length decided on; and as the further\r\nexpedition was not to exceed an hour\xe2\x80\x99s duration, and as Mr. Weller\r\nbegged very hard to be one of the party, it was determined to leave Mr.\r\nPickwick asleep in the barrow, and to call for him on their return. So\r\naway they went, leaving Mr. Pickwick snoring most comfortably in the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Pickwick would have continued to snore in the shade until his\r\nfriends came back, or, in default thereof, until the shades of evening\r\nhad fallen on the landscape, there appears no reasonable cause to doubt;\r\nalways supposing that he had been suffered to remain there in peace. But\r\nhe was _not _suffered to remain there in peace. And this was what\r\nprevented him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boldwig was a little fierce man in a stiff black neckerchief and\r\nblue surtout, who, when he did condescend to walk about his property,\r\ndid it in company with a thick rattan stick with a brass ferrule, and a\r\ngardener and sub-gardener with meek faces, to whom (the gardeners, not\r\nthe stick) Captain Boldwig gave his orders with all due grandeur and\r\nferocity; for Captain Boldwig\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s sister had married a marquis, and\r\nthe captain\xe2\x80\x99s house was a villa, and his land \xe2\x80\x98grounds,\xe2\x80\x99 and it was all\r\nvery high, and mighty, and great.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had not been asleep half an hour when little Captain\r\nBoldwig, followed by the two gardeners, came striding along as fast as\r\nhis size and importance would let him; and when he came near the oak\r\ntree, Captain Boldwig paused and drew a long breath, and looked at the\r\nprospect as if he thought the prospect ought to be highly gratified at\r\nhaving him to take notice of it; and then he struck the ground\r\nemphatically with his stick, and summoned the head-gardener.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hunt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain Boldwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gardener.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Roll this place to-morrow morning--do you hear, Hunt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And take care that you keep this place in good order--do you hear,\r\nHunt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And remind me to have a board done about trespassers, and spring guns,\r\nand all that sort of thing, to keep the common people out. Do you hear,\r\nHunt; do you hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll not forget it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other man, advancing, with his hand\r\nto his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Wilkins, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain Boldwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir--but I think there have been trespassers here\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha!\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain, scowling around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir--they have been dining here, I think, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, damn their audacity, so they have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain Boldwig, as the\r\ncrumbs and fragments that were strewn upon the grass met his eye. \xe2\x80\x98They\r\nhave actually been devouring their food here. I wish I had the vagabonds\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain, clenching the thick stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I had the vagabonds here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins, \xe2\x80\x98but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what? Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 roared the captain; and following the timid glance of\r\nWilkins, his eyes encountered the wheel-barrow and Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who are you, you rascal?\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain, administering several pokes\r\nto Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s body with the thick stick. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cold punch,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mr. Pickwick, as he sank to sleep again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Captain Boldwig.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he say his name was?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Punch, I think, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wilkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s his impudence--that\xe2\x80\x99s his confounded impudence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain\r\nBoldwig. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s only feigning to be asleep now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain, in a\r\nhigh passion. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s drunk; he\xe2\x80\x99s a drunken plebeian. Wheel him away,\r\nWilkins, wheel him away directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhere shall I wheel him to, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Wilkins, with great timidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wheel him to the devil,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Captain Boldwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain.\r\n\r\nWilkins stopped accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wheel him,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain--\xe2\x80\x98wheel him to the pound; and let us see\r\nwhether he calls himself Punch when he comes to himself. He shall not\r\nbully me--he shall not bully me. Wheel him away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAway Mr. Pickwick was wheeled in compliance with this imperious mandate;\r\nand the great Captain Boldwig, swelling with indignation, proceeded on\r\nhis walk.\r\n\r\nInexpressible was the astonishment of the little party when they\r\nreturned, to find that Mr. Pickwick had disappeared, and taken the\r\nwheel-barrow with him. It was the most mysterious and unaccountable\r\nthing that was ever heard of. For a lame man to have got upon his legs\r\nwithout any previous notice, and walked off, would have been most\r\nextraordinary; but when it came to his wheeling a heavy barrow before\r\nhim, by way of amusement, it grew positively miraculous. They searched\r\nevery nook and corner round, together and separately; they shouted,\r\nwhistled, laughed, called--and all with the same result. Mr. Pickwick\r\nwas not to be found. After some hours of fruitless search, they arrived\r\nat the unwelcome conclusion that they must go home without him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Pickwick had been wheeled to the Pound, and safely\r\ndeposited therein, fast asleep in the wheel-barrow, to the immeasurable\r\ndelight and satisfaction not only of all the boys in the village, but\r\nthree-fourths of the whole population, who had gathered round, in\r\nexpectation of his waking. If their most intense gratification had been\r\nawakened by seeing him wheeled in, how many hundredfold was their joy\r\nincreased when, after a few indistinct cries of \xe2\x80\x98Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 he sat up in the\r\nbarrow, and gazed with indescribable astonishment on the faces before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA general shout was of course the signal of his having woke up; and his\r\ninvoluntary inquiry of \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 occasioned another, louder\r\nthan the first, if possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a game!\xe2\x80\x99 roared the populace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where am I?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the pound,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the mob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How came I here? What was I doing? Where was I brought from?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoldwig! Captain Boldwig!\xe2\x80\x99 was the only reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me out,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s my servant? Where are my\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no friends. Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 Then there came a turnip, then a\r\npotato, and then an egg; with a few other little tokens of the playful\r\ndisposition of the many-headed.\r\n\r\nHow long this scene might have lasted, or how much Mr. Pickwick might\r\nhave suffered, no one can tell, had not a carriage, which was driving\r\nswiftly by, suddenly pulled up, from whence there descended old Wardle\r\nand Sam Weller, the former of whom, in far less time than it takes to\r\nwrite it, if not to read it, had made his way to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nand placed him in the vehicle, just as the latter had concluded the\r\nthird and last round of a single combat with the town-beadle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Run to the justice\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99 cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, run avay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, jumping up on the box. \xe2\x80\x98Give my\r\ncompliments--Mr. Veller\xe2\x80\x99s compliments--to the justice, and tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nspiled his beadle, and that, if he\xe2\x80\x99ll swear in a new \xe2\x80\x98un, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back\r\nagain to-morrow and spile him. Drive on, old feller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give directions for the commencement of an action for false\r\nimprisonment against this Captain Boldwig, directly I get to London,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Pickwick, as soon as the carriage turned out of the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We were trespassing, it seems,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring the action.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, by--\xe2\x80\x99 But as there was a humorous expression in Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nMr. Pickwick checked himself, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because,\xe2\x80\x99 said old Wardle, half-bursting with laughter, \xe2\x80\x98because they\r\nmight turn on some of us, and say we had taken too much cold punch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDo what he would, a smile would come into Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s face; the smile\r\nextended into a laugh; the laugh into a roar; the roar became general.\r\nSo, to keep up their good-humour, they stopped at the first roadside\r\ntavern they came to, and ordered a glass of brandy-and-water all round,\r\nwith a magnum of extra strength for Mr. Samuel Weller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. SHOWING HOW DODSON AND FOGG WERE MEN OF BUSINESS, AND THEIR\r\nCLERKS MEN OF PLEASURE; AND HOW AN AFFECTING INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE\r\nBETWEEN MR. WELLER AND HIS LONG-LOST PARENT; SHOWING ALSO WHAT CHOICE\r\nSPIRITS ASSEMBLED AT THE MAGPIE AND STUMP, AND WHAT A CAPITAL CHAPTER\r\nTHE NEXT ONE WILL BE\r\n\r\nIn the ground-floor front of a dingy house, at the very farthest end of\r\nFreeman\xe2\x80\x99s Court, Cornhill, sat the four clerks of Messrs. Dodson & Fogg,\r\ntwo of his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys of the courts of King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench and Common\r\nPleas at Westminster, and solicitors of the High Court of Chancery--the\r\naforesaid clerks catching as favourable glimpses of heaven\xe2\x80\x99s light and\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s sun, in the course of their daily labours, as a man might hope\r\nto do, were he placed at the bottom of a reasonably deep well; and\r\nwithout the opportunity of perceiving the stars in the day-time, which\r\nthe latter secluded situation affords.\r\n\r\nThe clerks\xe2\x80\x99 office of Messrs. Dodson & Fogg was a dark, mouldy, earthy-\r\nsmelling room, with a high wainscotted partition to screen the clerks\r\nfrom the vulgar gaze, a couple of old wooden chairs, a very loud-ticking\r\nclock, an almanac, an umbrella-stand, a row of hat-pegs, and a few\r\nshelves, on which were deposited several ticketed bundles of dirty\r\npapers, some old deal boxes with paper labels, and sundry decayed stone\r\nink bottles of various shapes and sizes. There was a glass door leading\r\ninto the passage which formed the entrance to the court, and on the\r\nouter side of this glass door, Mr. Pickwick, closely followed by Sam\r\nWeller, presented himself on the Friday morning succeeding the\r\noccurrence of which a faithful narration is given in the last chapter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in, can\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x99 cried a voice from behind the partition, in reply\r\nto Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s gentle tap at the door. And Mr. Pickwick and Sam\r\nentered accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Dodson or Mr. Fogg at home, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, gently,\r\nadvancing, hat in hand, towards the partition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Dodson ain\xe2\x80\x99t at home, and Mr. Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s particularly engaged,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nthe voice; and at the same time the head to which the voice belonged,\r\nwith a pen behind its ear, looked over the partition, and at Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\nIt was a ragged head, the sandy hair of which, scrupulously parted on\r\none side, and flattened down with pomatum, was twisted into little semi-\r\ncircular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes,\r\nand garnished with a very dirty shirt collar, and a rusty black stock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Dodson ain\xe2\x80\x99t at home, and Mr. Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s particularly engaged,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe man to whom the head belonged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When will Mr. Dodson be back, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will it be long before Mr. Fogg is disengaged, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation, while\r\nanother clerk, who was mixing a Seidlitz powder, under cover of the lid\r\nof his desk, laughed approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. There was no reply; so Mr.\r\nPickwick sat down unbidden, and listened to the loud ticking of the\r\nclock and the murmured conversation of the clerks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was a game, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said one of the gentlemen, in a brown coat\r\nand brass buttons, inky drabs, and bluchers, at the conclusion of some\r\ninaudible relation of his previous evening\xe2\x80\x99s adventures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Devilish good--devilish good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Seidlitz-powder man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tom Cummins was in the chair,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the brown coat. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwas half-past four when I got to Somers Town, and then I was so uncommon\r\nlushy, that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the place where the latch-key went in, and\r\nwas obliged to knock up the old \xe2\x80\x98ooman. I say, I wonder what old Fogg\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ud say, if he knew it. I should get the sack, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this humorous notion, all the clerks laughed in concert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was such a game with Fogg here, this mornin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in\r\nthe brown coat, \xe2\x80\x98while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers, and you two\r\nwere gone to the stamp-office. Fogg was down here, opening the letters\r\nwhen that chap as we issued the writ against at Camberwell, you know,\r\ncame in--what\xe2\x80\x99s his name again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ramsey,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk who had spoken to Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Ramsey--a precious seedy-looking customer. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says old\r\nFogg, looking at him very fierce--you know his way--\xe2\x80\x9cwell, Sir, have you\r\ncome to settle?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsey, putting his hand in\r\nhis pocket, and bringing out the money, \xe2\x80\x9cthe debt\xe2\x80\x99s two pound ten, and\r\nthe costs three pound five, and here it is, Sir;\xe2\x80\x9d and he sighed like\r\nbricks, as he lugged out the money, done up in a bit of blotting-paper.\r\nOld Fogg looked first at the money, and then at him, and then he coughed\r\nin his rum way, so that I knew something was coming. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a declaration filed, which increases the costs materially, I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fogg. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsey, starting\r\nback; \xe2\x80\x9cthe time was only out last night, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI do say it, though,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Fogg, \xe2\x80\x9cmy clerk\xe2\x80\x99s just gone to file it. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Jackson gone to\r\nfile that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey, Mr. Wicks?\xe2\x80\x9d Of course I\r\nsaid yes, and then Fogg coughed again, and looked at Ramsey. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Ramsey; \xe2\x80\x9cand here have I nearly driven myself mad, scraping this\r\nmoney together, and all to no purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNone at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fogg coolly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso you had better go back and scrape some more together, and bring it\r\nhere in time.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get it, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsey, striking the desk\r\nwith his fist. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bully me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fogg, getting into a passion\r\non purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not bullying you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFogg; \xe2\x80\x9cget out, sir; get out of this office, Sir, and come back, Sir,\r\nwhen you know how to behave yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, Ramsey tried to speak, but\r\nFogg wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him, so he put the money in his pocket, and sneaked\r\nout. The door was scarcely shut, when old Fogg turned round to me, with\r\na sweet smile on his face, and drew the declaration out of his coat\r\npocket. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Wicks,\xe2\x80\x9d says Fogg, \xe2\x80\x9ctake a cab, and go down to the Temple\r\nas quick as you can, and file that. The costs are quite safe, for he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsteady man with a large family, at a salary of five-and-twenty shillings\r\na week, and if he gives us a warrant of attorney, as he must in the end,\r\nI know his employers will see it paid; so we may as well get all we can\r\nget out of him, Mr. Wicks; it\xe2\x80\x99s a Christian act to do it, Mr. Wicks, for\r\nwith his large family and small income, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be all the better for a\r\ngood lesson against getting into debt--won\xe2\x80\x99t he, Mr. Wicks, won\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\nand he smiled so good-naturedly as he went away, that it was delightful\r\nto see him. He is a capital man of business,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wicks, in a tone of\r\nthe deepest admiration, \xe2\x80\x98capital, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe other three cordially subscribed to this opinion, and the anecdote\r\nafforded the most unlimited satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nice men these here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Weller to his master; \xe2\x80\x98wery\r\nnice notion of fun they has, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick nodded assent, and coughed to attract the attention of the\r\nyoung gentlemen behind the partition, who, having now relaxed their\r\nminds by a little conversation among themselves, condescended to take\r\nsome notice of the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s disengaged now?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wicks, dismounting leisurely from his stool. \xe2\x80\x98What name\r\nshall I tell Mr. Fogg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the illustrious subject of these memoirs.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson departed upstairs on his errand, and immediately returned\r\nwith a message that Mr. Fogg would see Mr. Pickwick in five minutes; and\r\nhaving delivered it, returned again to his desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he say his name was?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Wicks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the defendant in Bardell and\r\nPickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA sudden scraping of feet, mingled with the sound of suppressed\r\nlaughter, was heard from behind the partition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re a-twiggin\xe2\x80\x99 of you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Twigging of me, Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98what do you mean by\r\ntwigging me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller replied by pointing with his thumb over his shoulder, and Mr.\r\nPickwick, on looking up, became sensible of the pleasing fact, that all\r\nthe four clerks, with countenances expressive of the utmost amusement,\r\nand with their heads thrust over the wooden screen, were minutely\r\ninspecting the figure and general appearance of the supposed trifler\r\nwith female hearts, and disturber of female happiness. On his looking\r\nup, the row of heads suddenly disappeared, and the sound of pens\r\ntravelling at a furious rate over paper, immediately succeeded.\r\n\r\nA sudden ring at the bell which hung in the office, summoned Mr. Jackson\r\nto the apartment of Fogg, from whence he came back to say that he (Fogg)\r\nwas ready to see Mr. Pickwick if he would step upstairs.\r\n\r\nUpstairs Mr. Pickwick did step accordingly, leaving Sam Weller below.\r\nThe room door of the one-pair back, bore inscribed in legible characters\r\nthe imposing words, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Fogg\xe2\x80\x99; and, having tapped thereat, and been\r\ndesired to come in, Jackson ushered Mr. Pickwick into the presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mr. Dodson in?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just come in, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask him to step here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Exit Jackson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take a seat, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg; \xe2\x80\x98there is the paper, sir; my partner will\r\nbe here directly, and we can converse about this matter, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick took a seat and the paper, but, instead of reading the\r\nlatter, peeped over the top of it, and took a survey of the man of\r\nbusiness, who was an elderly, pimply-faced, vegetable-diet sort of man,\r\nin a black coat, dark mixture trousers, and small black gaiters; a kind\r\nof being who seemed to be an essential part of the desk at which he was\r\nwriting, and to have as much thought or feeling.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 silence, Mr. Dodson, a plump, portly, stern-looking\r\nman, with a loud voice, appeared; and the conversation commenced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! You are the defendant, Sir, in Bardell and Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, \xe2\x80\x98and what do you propose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, thrusting his hands into his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pockets, and\r\nthrowing himself back in his chair, \xe2\x80\x98what do you propose, Mr Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, Fogg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, \xe2\x80\x98let me hear what Mr. Pickwick has to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I came, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, gazing placidly on the two\r\npartners, \xe2\x80\x98I came here, gentlemen, to express the surprise with which I\r\nreceived your letter of the other day, and to inquire what grounds of\r\naction you can have against me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grounds of--\xe2\x80\x99 Fogg had ejaculated this much, when he was stopped by\r\nDodson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Fogg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, \xe2\x80\x98I am going to speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI beg your pardon, Mr. Dodson,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the grounds of action, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Dodson, with moral elevation\r\nin his air, \xe2\x80\x98you will consult your own conscience and your own feelings.\r\nWe, Sir, we, are guided entirely by the statement of our client. That\r\nstatement, Sir, may be true, or it may be false; it may be credible, or\r\nit may be incredible; but, if it be true, and if it be credible, I do\r\nnot hesitate to say, Sir, that our grounds of action, Sir, are strong,\r\nand not to be shaken. You may be an unfortunate man, Sir, or you may be\r\na designing one; but if I were called upon, as a juryman upon my oath,\r\nSir, to express an opinion of your conduct, Sir, I do not hesitate to\r\nassert that I should have but one opinion about it.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Dodson drew\r\nhimself up, with an air of offended virtue, and looked at Fogg, who\r\nthrust his hands farther in his pockets, and nodding his head sagely,\r\nsaid, in a tone of the fullest concurrence, \xe2\x80\x98Most certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with considerable pain depicted in his\r\ncountenance, \xe2\x80\x98you will permit me to assure you that I am a most\r\nunfortunate man, so far as this case is concerned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you are, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dodson; \xe2\x80\x98I trust you may be, Sir. If you\r\nare really innocent of what is laid to your charge, you are more\r\nunfortunate than I had believed any man could possibly be. What do you\r\nsay, Mr. Fogg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say precisely what you say,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Fogg, with a smile of\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The writ, Sir, which commences the action,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Dodson, \xe2\x80\x98was\r\nissued regularly. Mr. Fogg, where is the _Praecipe _book?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, handing over a square book, with a parchment\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is the entry,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Dodson. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMiddlesex, Capias MARTHA BARDELL,\r\nWIDOW, v. SAMUEL PICKWICK. Damages \xc2\xa31500. Dodson & Fogg for the\r\nplaintiff, Aug. 28, 1827.\xe2\x80\x9d All regular, Sir; perfectly.\xe2\x80\x99 Dodson coughed\r\nand looked at Fogg, who said \xe2\x80\x98Perfectly,\xe2\x80\x99 also. And then they both\r\nlooked at Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am to understand, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that it really is your\r\nintention to proceed with this action?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Understand, sir!--that you certainly may,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dodson, with\r\nsomething as near a smile as his importance would allow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that the damages are actually laid at fifteen hundred pounds?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To which understanding you may add my assurance, that if we could have\r\nprevailed upon our client, they would have been laid at treble the\r\namount, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dodson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe Mrs. Bardell specially said, however,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Fogg,\r\nglancing at Dodson, \xe2\x80\x98that she would not compromise for a farthing less.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unquestionably,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dodson sternly. For the action was only just\r\nbegun; and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done to let Mr. Pickwick compromise it then,\r\neven if he had been so disposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you offer no terms, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, displaying a slip of\r\nparchment in his right hand, and affectionately pressing a paper copy of\r\nit, on Mr. Pickwick with his left, \xe2\x80\x98I had better serve you with a copy\r\nof this writ, sir. Here is the original, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, gentlemen, very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, rising in person\r\nand wrath at the same time; \xe2\x80\x98you shall hear from my solicitor,\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall be very happy to do so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, opening the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And before I go, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the excited Mr. Pickwick, turning\r\nround on the landing, \xe2\x80\x98permit me to say, that of all the disgraceful and\r\nrascally proceedings--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, sir, stay,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Dodson, with great politeness. \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nJackson! Mr. Wicks!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the two clerks, appearing at the bottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I merely want you to hear what this gentleman says,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dodson.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, go on, sir--disgraceful and rascally proceedings, I think you\r\nsaid?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, thoroughly roused. \xe2\x80\x98I said, Sir, that of all\r\nthe disgraceful and rascally proceedings that ever were attempted, this\r\nis the most so. I repeat it, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You hear that, Mr. Wicks,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t forget these expressions, Mr. Jackson?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you would like to call us swindlers, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson. \xe2\x80\x98Pray\r\ndo, Sir, if you feel disposed; now pray do, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98You _are _swindlers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson. \xe2\x80\x98You can hear down there, I hope, Mr. Wicks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wicks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better come up a step or two higher, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr.\r\nFogg. \xe2\x80\x98Go on, Sir; do go on. You had better call us thieves, Sir; or\r\nperhaps You would like to assault one of _us_. Pray do it, Sir, if you\r\nwould; we will not make the smallest resistance. Pray do it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Fogg put himself very temptingly within the reach of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclenched fist, there is little doubt that that gentleman would have\r\ncomplied with his earnest entreaty, but for the interposition of Sam,\r\nwho, hearing the dispute, emerged from the office, mounted the stairs,\r\nand seized his master by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You just come away,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Battledore and shuttlecock\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwery good game, vhen you ain\xe2\x80\x99t the shuttlecock and two lawyers the\r\nbattledores, in which case it gets too excitin\xe2\x80\x99 to be pleasant. Come\r\navay, Sir. If you want to ease your mind by blowing up somebody, come\r\nout into the court and blow up me; but it\xe2\x80\x99s rayther too expensive work\r\nto be carried on here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd without the slightest ceremony, Mr. Weller hauled his master down\r\nthe stairs, and down the court, and having safely deposited him in\r\nCornhill, fell behind, prepared to follow whithersoever he should lead.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick walked on abstractedly, crossed opposite the Mansion House,\r\nand bent his steps up Cheapside. Sam began to wonder where they were\r\ngoing, when his master turned round, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam, I will go immediately to Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s just exactly the wery place vere you ought to have gone last\r\nnight, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it is, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I _know _it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98we will go there at once; but\r\nfirst, as I have been rather ruffled, I should like a glass of brandy-\r\nand-water warm, Sam. Where can I have it, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of London was extensive and peculiar. He replied,\r\nwithout the slightest consideration--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Second court on the right hand side--last house but vun on the same\r\nside the vay--take the box as stands in the first fireplace, \xe2\x80\x98cos there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no leg in the middle o\xe2\x80\x99 the table, which all the others has, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s wery inconvenient.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick observed his valet\xe2\x80\x99s directions implicitly, and bidding Sam\r\nfollow him, entered the tavern he had pointed out, where the hot brandy-\r\nand-water was speedily placed before him; while Mr. Weller, seated at a\r\nrespectful distance, though at the same table with his master, was\r\naccommodated with a pint of porter.\r\n\r\nThe room was one of a very homely description, and was apparently under\r\nthe especial patronage of stage-coachmen; for several gentleman, who had\r\nall the appearance of belonging to that learned profession, were\r\ndrinking and smoking in the different boxes. Among the number was one\r\nstout, red-faced, elderly man, in particular, seated in an opposite box,\r\nwho attracted Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s attention. The stout man was smoking with\r\ngreat vehemence, but between every half-dozen puffs, he took his pipe\r\nfrom his mouth, and looked first at Mr. Weller and then at Mr. Pickwick.\r\nThen, he would bury in a quart pot, as much of his countenance as the\r\ndimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving, and take another\r\nlook at Sam and Mr. Pickwick. Then he would take another half-dozen\r\npuffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again. At last\r\nthe stout man, putting up his legs on the seat, and leaning his back\r\nagainst the wall, began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all,\r\nand to stare through the smoke at the new-comers, as if he had made up\r\nhis mind to see the most he could of them.\r\n\r\nAt first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservation, but by degrees, as he saw Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes every now and\r\nthen turning towards him, he began to gaze in the same direction, at the\r\nsame time shading his eyes with his hand, as if he partially recognised\r\nthe object before him, and wished to make quite sure of its identity.\r\nHis doubts were speedily dispelled, however; for the stout man having\r\nblown a thick cloud from his pipe, a hoarse voice, like some strange\r\neffort of ventriloquism, emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which\r\nmuffled his throat and chest, and slowly uttered these sounds--\xe2\x80\x98Wy,\r\nSammy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 believed it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, with\r\nastonished eyes. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the old \xe2\x80\x98un.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98What old one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98How are you, my ancient?\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nwith this beautiful ebullition of filial affection, Mr. Weller made room\r\non the seat beside him, for the stout man, who advanced pipe in mouth\r\nand pot in hand, to greet him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, \xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t seen you, for two year and\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor more you have, old codger,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the son. \xe2\x80\x98How\xe2\x80\x99s mother-in-law?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, senior, with much\r\nsolemnity in his manner; \xe2\x80\x98there never was a nicer woman as a widder,\r\nthan that \xe2\x80\x98ere second wentur o\xe2\x80\x99 mine--a sweet creetur she was, Sammy;\r\nall I can say on her now, is, that as she was such an uncommon pleasant\r\nwidder, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity she ever changed her condition. She don\xe2\x80\x99t act\r\nas a vife, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t she, though?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller, junior.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Weller shook his head, as he replied with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone it once too often, Sammy; I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it once too often. Take example\r\nby your father, my boy, and be wery careful o\xe2\x80\x99 widders all your life,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98specially if they\xe2\x80\x99ve kept a public-house, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99 Having delivered this\r\nparental advice with great pathos, Mr. Weller, senior, refilled his pipe\r\nfrom a tin box he carried in his pocket; and, lighting his fresh pipe\r\nfrom the ashes of the old One, commenced smoking at a great rate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, renewing the subject, and addressing\r\nMr. Pickwick, after a considerable pause, \xe2\x80\x98nothin\xe2\x80\x99 personal, I hope,\r\nsir; I hope you ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t got a widder, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not I,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, laughing; and while Mr. Pickwick laughed,\r\nSam Weller informed his parent in a whisper, of the relation in which he\r\nstood towards that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, senior, taking off his hat, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhope you\xe2\x80\x99ve no fault to find with Sammy, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery glad to hear it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old man; \xe2\x80\x98I took a good deal o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npains with his eddication, sir; let him run in the streets when he was\r\nwery young, and shift for hisself. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to make a boy\r\nsharp, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather a dangerous process, I should imagine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And not a wery sure one, neither,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98I got reg\xe2\x80\x99larly\r\ndone the other day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did,\xe2\x80\x99 said the son; and he proceeded to relate, in as few words as\r\npossible, how he had fallen a ready dupe to the stratagems of Job\r\nTrotter.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller, senior, listened to the tale with the most profound\r\nattention, and, at its termination, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Worn\xe2\x80\x99t one o\xe2\x80\x99 these chaps slim and tall, with long hair, and the gift\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the gab wery gallopin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick did not quite understand the last item of description, but,\r\ncomprehending the first, said \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 at a venture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99 other\xe2\x80\x99s a black-haired chap in mulberry livery, with a wery large\r\nhead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, he is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick and Sam, with great earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I know where they are, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99re at Ipswich, safe enough, them two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fact,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how I know it. I work an\r\nIpswich coach now and then for a friend o\xe2\x80\x99 mine. I worked down the wery\r\nday arter the night as you caught the rheumatic, and at the Black Boy at\r\nChelmsford--the wery place they\xe2\x80\x99d come to--I took \xe2\x80\x98em up, right through\r\nto Ipswich, where the man-servant--him in the mulberries--told me they\r\nwas a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to put up for a long time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98we may as well see Ipswich as any\r\nother place. I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re quite certain it was them, governor?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller,\r\njunior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite, Sammy, quite,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father, \xe2\x80\x98for their appearance is wery\r\nsing\xe2\x80\x99ler; besides that \xe2\x80\x98ere, I wondered to see the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n so\r\nformiliar with his servant; and, more than that, as they sat in the\r\nfront, right behind the box, I heerd \xe2\x80\x98em laughing and saying how they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndone old Fireworks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old who?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Fireworks, Sir; by which, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt, they meant you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere is nothing positively vile or atrocious in the appellation of \xe2\x80\x98old\r\nFireworks,\xe2\x80\x99 but still it is by no means a respectful or flattering\r\ndesignation. The recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at\r\nJingle\xe2\x80\x99s hands, had crowded on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s mind, the moment Mr.\r\nWeller began to speak; it wanted but a feather to turn the scale, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98old Fireworks\xe2\x80\x99 did it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with an emphatic blow on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall work down to Ipswich the day arter to-morrow, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller the elder, \xe2\x80\x98from the Bull in Whitechapel; and if you really mean\r\nto go, you\xe2\x80\x99d better go with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So we had,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98very true; I can write to Bury, and\r\ntell them to meet me at Ipswich. We will go with you. But don\xe2\x80\x99t hurry\r\naway, Mr. Weller; won\xe2\x80\x99t you take anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wery good, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. W., stopping short;--\xe2\x80\x98perhaps a\r\nsmall glass of brandy to drink your health, and success to Sammy, Sir,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be amiss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A glass of brandy here!\xe2\x80\x99 The brandy was brought; and Mr. Weller, after\r\npulling his hair to Mr. Pickwick, and nodding to Sam, jerked it down his\r\ncapacious throat as if it had been a small thimbleful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98take care, old fellow, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\ntouch of your old complaint, the gout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a sov\xe2\x80\x99rin\xe2\x80\x99 cure for that, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, setting\r\ndown the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A sovereign cure for the gout,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, hastily producing\r\nhis note-book--\xe2\x80\x98what is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gout, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98the gout is a complaint as arises\r\nfrom too much ease and comfort. If ever you\xe2\x80\x99re attacked with the gout,\r\nsir, jist you marry a widder as has got a good loud woice, with a decent\r\nnotion of usin\xe2\x80\x99 it, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have the gout agin. It\xe2\x80\x99s a capital\r\nprescription, sir. I takes it reg\xe2\x80\x99lar, and I can warrant it to drive\r\naway any illness as is caused by too much jollity.\xe2\x80\x99 Having imparted this\r\nvaluable secret, Mr. Weller drained his glass once more, produced a\r\nlaboured wink, sighed deeply, and slowly retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what do you think of what your father says, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nPickwick, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98why, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s the wictim o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconnubiality, as Blue Beard\xe2\x80\x99s domestic chaplain said, vith a tear of\r\npity, ven he buried him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no replying to this very apposite conclusion, and, therefore,\r\nMr. Pickwick, after settling the reckoning, resumed his walk to Gray\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nInn. By the time he reached its secluded groves, however, eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nhad struck, and the unbroken stream of gentlemen in muddy high-lows,\r\nsoiled white hats, and rusty apparel, who were pouring towards the\r\ndifferent avenues of egress, warned him that the majority of the offices\r\nhad closed for that day.\r\n\r\nAfter climbing two pairs of steep and dirty stairs, he found his\r\nanticipations were realised. Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98outer door\xe2\x80\x99 was closed; and\r\nthe dead silence which followed Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s repeated kicks thereat,\r\nannounced that the officials had retired from business for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is pleasant, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose an hour in\r\nseeing him; I shall not be able to get one wink of sleep to-night, I\r\nknow, unless I have the satisfaction of reflecting that I have confided\r\nthis matter to a professional man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s an old \xe2\x80\x98ooman comin\xe2\x80\x99 upstairs, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98p\xe2\x80\x99raps\r\nshe knows where we can find somebody. Hollo, old lady, vere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr.\r\nPerker\xe2\x80\x99s people?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s people,\xe2\x80\x99 said a thin, miserable-looking old woman,\r\nstopping to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase--\xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nPerker\xe2\x80\x99s people\xe2\x80\x99s gone, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do the office out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAre you Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s servant?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s laundress,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, half aside to Sam, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a curious\r\ncircumstance, Sam, that they call the old women in these inns,\r\nlaundresses. I wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos they has a mortal awersion to washing anythin\xe2\x80\x99, I suppose, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking at the old woman, whose\r\nappearance, as well as the condition of the office, which she had by\r\nthis time opened, indicated a rooted antipathy to the application of\r\nsoap and water; \xe2\x80\x98do you know where I can find Mr. Perker, my good\r\nwoman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old woman gruffly; \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s out o\xe2\x80\x99 town now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99s his clerk? Do you\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know where he is, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t thank me for telling you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied the laundress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have very particular business with him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t it do in the morning?\xe2\x80\x99 said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98if it was anything very particular, I was\r\nto say where he was, so I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in telling. If you\r\njust go to the Magpie and Stump, and ask at the bar for Mr. Lowten,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll show you in to him, and he\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s clerk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this direction, and having been furthermore informed that the\r\nhostelry in question was situated in a court, happy in the double\r\nadvantage of being in the vicinity of Clare Market, and closely\r\napproximating to the back of New Inn, Mr. Pickwick and Sam descended the\r\nrickety staircase in safety, and issued forth in quest of the Magpie and\r\nStump.\r\n\r\nThis favoured tavern, sacred to the evening orgies of Mr. Lowten and his\r\ncompanions, was what ordinary people would designate a public-house.\r\nThat the landlord was a man of money-making turn was sufficiently\r\ntestified by the fact of a small bulkhead beneath the tap-room window,\r\nin size and shape not unlike a sedan-chair, being underlet to a mender\r\nof shoes: and that he was a being of a philanthropic mind was evident\r\nfrom the protection he afforded to a pieman, who vended his delicacies\r\nwithout fear of interruption, on the very door-step. In the lower\r\nwindows, which were decorated with curtains of a saffron hue, dangled\r\ntwo or three printed cards, bearing reference to Devonshire cider and\r\nDantzic spruce, while a large blackboard, announcing in white letters to\r\nan enlightened public, that there were 500,000 barrels of double stout\r\nin the cellars of the establishment, left the mind in a state of not\r\nunpleasing doubt and uncertainty as to the precise direction in the\r\nbowels of the earth, in which this mighty cavern might be supposed to\r\nextend. When we add that the weather-beaten signboard bore the half-\r\nobliterated semblance of a magpie intently eyeing a crooked streak of\r\nbrown paint, which the neighbours had been taught from infancy to\r\nconsider as the \xe2\x80\x98stump,\xe2\x80\x99 we have said all that need be said of the\r\nexterior of the edifice.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s presenting himself at the bar, an elderly female\r\nemerged from behind the screen therein, and presented herself before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mr. Lowten here, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the landlady. \xe2\x80\x98Here, Charley, show the\r\ngentleman in to Mr. Lowten.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n can\xe2\x80\x99t go in just now,\xe2\x80\x99 said a shambling pot-boy, with a\r\nred head, \xe2\x80\x98cos\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Lowten\xe2\x80\x99s a-singin\xe2\x80\x99 a comic song, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll put him\r\nout. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be done directly, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe red-headed pot-boy had scarcely finished speaking, when a most\r\nunanimous hammering of tables, and jingling of glasses, announced that\r\nthe song had that instant terminated; and Mr. Pickwick, after desiring\r\nSam to solace himself in the tap, suffered himself to be conducted into\r\nthe presence of Mr. Lowten.\r\n\r\nAt the announcement of \xe2\x80\x98A gentleman to speak to you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 a puffy-faced\r\nyoung man, who filled the chair at the head of the table, looked with\r\nsome surprise in the direction from whence the voice proceeded; and the\r\nsurprise seemed to be by no means diminished, when his eyes rested on an\r\nindividual whom he had never seen before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98and I am very sorry to\r\ndisturb the other gentlemen, too, but I come on very particular\r\nbusiness; and if you will suffer me to detain you at this end of the\r\nroom for five minutes, I shall be very much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe puffy-faced young man rose, and drawing a chair close to Mr.\r\nPickwick in an obscure corner of the room, listened attentively to his\r\ntale of woe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, when Mr. Pickwick had concluded, \xe2\x80\x98Dodson and Fogg--sharp\r\npractice theirs--capital men of business, Dodson and Fogg, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick admitted the sharp practice of Dodson and Fogg, and Lowten\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perker ain\xe2\x80\x99t in town, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t be, neither, before the end of next\r\nweek; but if you want the action defended, and will leave the copy with\r\nme, I can do all that\xe2\x80\x99s needful till he comes back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I came here for,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, handing over\r\nthe document. \xe2\x80\x98If anything particular occurs, you can write to me at the\r\npost-office, Ipswich.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s clerk; and then seeing Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s eye wandering curiously towards the table, he added, \xe2\x80\x98will\r\nyou join us, for half an hour or so? We are capital company here to-\r\nnight. There\xe2\x80\x99s Samkin and Green\xe2\x80\x99s managing-clerk, and Smithers and\r\nPrice\xe2\x80\x99s chancery, and Pimkin and Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s out o\xe2\x80\x99 doors--sings a capital\r\nsong, he does--and Jack Bamber, and ever so many more. You\xe2\x80\x99re come out\r\nof the country, I suppose. Would you like to join us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick could not resist so tempting an opportunity of studying\r\nhuman nature. He suffered himself to be led to the table, where, after\r\nhaving been introduced to the company in due form, he was accommodated\r\nwith a seat near the chairman and called for a glass of his favourite\r\nbeverage.\r\n\r\nA profound silence, quite contrary to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s expectation,\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t find this sort of thing disagreeable, I hope, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said his\r\nright hand neighbour, a gentleman in a checked shirt and Mosaic studs,\r\nwith a cigar in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in the least,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I like it very much, although\r\nI am no smoker myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be very sorry to say I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed another gentleman\r\non the opposite side of the table. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s board and lodgings to me, is\r\nsmoke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick glanced at the speaker, and thought that if it were washing\r\ntoo, it would be all the better.\r\n\r\nHere there was another pause. Mr. Pickwick was a stranger, and his\r\ncoming had evidently cast a damp upon the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Grundy\xe2\x80\x99s going to oblige the company with a song,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Grundy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 said the chairman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because he can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Grundy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better say he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the chairman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr. Grundy. Mr. Grundy\xe2\x80\x99s positive\r\nrefusal to gratify the company occasioned another silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t anybody enliven us?\xe2\x80\x99 said the chairman, despondingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you enliven us yourself, Mr. Chairman?\xe2\x80\x99 said a young man with\r\na whisker, a squint, and an open shirt collar (dirty), from the bottom\r\nof the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear! hear!\xe2\x80\x99 said the smoking gentleman, in the Mosaic jewellery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I only know one song, and I have sung it already, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfine of \xe2\x80\x9cglasses round\xe2\x80\x9d to sing the same song twice in a night,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nthe chairman.\r\n\r\nThis was an unanswerable reply, and silence prevailed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been to-night, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, hoping to start a\r\nsubject which all the company could take a part in discussing, \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nbeen to-night, in a place which you all know very well, doubtless, but\r\nwhich I have not been in for some years, and know very little of; I mean\r\nGray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, gentlemen. Curious little nooks in a great place, like\r\nLondon, these old inns are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jove!\xe2\x80\x99 said the chairman, whispering across the table to Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98you have hit upon something that one of us, at least, would\r\ntalk upon for ever. You\xe2\x80\x99ll draw old Jack Bamber out; he was never heard\r\nto talk about anything else but the inns, and he has lived alone in them\r\ntill he\xe2\x80\x99s half crazy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe individual to whom Lowten alluded, was a little, yellow, high-\r\nshouldered man, whose countenance, from his habit of stooping forward\r\nwhen silent, Mr. Pickwick had not observed before. He wondered, though,\r\nwhen the old man raised his shrivelled face, and bent his gray eye upon\r\nhim, with a keen inquiring look, that such remarkable features could\r\nhave escaped his attention for a moment. There was a fixed grim smile\r\nperpetually on his countenance; he leaned his chin on a long, skinny\r\nhand, with nails of extraordinary length; and as he inclined his head to\r\none side, and looked keenly out from beneath his ragged gray eyebrows,\r\nthere was a strange, wild slyness in his leer, quite repulsive to\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\nThis was the figure that now started forward, and burst into an animated\r\ntorrent of words. As this chapter has been a long one, however, and as\r\nthe old man was a remarkable personage, it will be more respectful to\r\nhim, and more convenient to us, to let him speak for himself in a fresh\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. IN WHICH THE OLD MAN LAUNCHES FORTH INTO HIS FAVOURITE\r\nTHEME, AND RELATES A STORY ABOUT A QUEER CLIENT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, a brief description of whose manner and\r\nappearance concluded the last chapter, \xe2\x80\x98aha! who was talking about the\r\ninns?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick--\xe2\x80\x98I was observing what singular old\r\nplaces they are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_You_!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x98What do _you _know of the\r\ntime when young men shut themselves up in those lonely rooms, and read\r\nand read, hour after hour, and night after night, till their reason\r\nwandered beneath their midnight studies; till their mental powers were\r\nexhausted; till morning\xe2\x80\x99s light brought no freshness or health to them;\r\nand they sank beneath the unnatural devotion of their youthful energies\r\nto their dry old books? Coming down to a later time, and a very\r\ndifferent day, what do _you_ know of the gradual sinking beneath\r\nconsumption, or the quick wasting of fever--the grand results of \xe2\x80\x9clife\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and dissipation--which men have undergone in these same rooms? How many\r\nvain pleaders for mercy, do you think, have turned away heart-sick from\r\nthe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office, to find a resting-place in the Thames, or a refuge\r\nin the jail? They are no ordinary houses, those. There is not a panel in\r\nthe old wainscotting, but what, if it were endowed with the powers of\r\nspeech and memory, could start from the wall, and tell its tale of\r\nhorror--the romance of life, Sir, the romance of life! Common-place as\r\nthey may seem now, I tell you they are strange old places, and I would\r\nrather hear many a legend with a terrific-sounding name, than the true\r\nhistory of one old set of chambers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something so odd in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s sudden energy, and the\r\nsubject which had called it forth, that Mr. Pickwick was prepared with\r\nno observation in reply; and the old man checking his impetuosity, and\r\nresuming the leer, which had disappeared during his previous excitement,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at them in another light--their most common-place and least\r\nromantic. What fine places of slow torture they are! Think of the needy\r\nman who has spent his all, beggared himself, and pinched his friends, to\r\nenter the profession, which is destined never to yield him a morsel of\r\nbread. The waiting--the hope--the disappointment--the fear--the misery--\r\nthe poverty--the blight on his hopes, and end to his career--the suicide\r\nperhaps, or the shabby, slipshod drunkard. Am I not right about them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd the old man rubbed his hands, and leered as if in delight at having\r\nfound another point of view in which to place his favourite subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity, and the remainder of\r\nthe company smiled, and looked on in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Talk of your German universities,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little old man. \xe2\x80\x98Pooh,\r\npooh! there\xe2\x80\x99s romance enough at home without going half a mile for it;\r\nonly people never think of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before,\r\ncertainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure you didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little old man; \xe2\x80\x98of course not. As a\r\nfriend of mine used to say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there in chambers in\r\nparticular?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cQueer old places,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLonely,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. He died one morning of\r\napoplexy, as he was going to open his outer door. Fell with his head in\r\nhis own letter-box, and there he lay for eighteen months. Everybody\r\nthought he\xe2\x80\x99d gone out of town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how was he found out at last?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The benchers determined to have his door broken open, as he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t paid\r\nany rent for two years. So they did. Forced the lock; and a very dusty\r\nskeleton in a blue coat, black knee-shorts, and silks, fell forward in\r\nthe arms of the porter who opened the door. Queer, that. Rather,\r\nperhaps; rather, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 The little old man put his head more on one side,\r\nand rubbed his hands with unspeakable glee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know another case,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little old man, when his chuckles had in\r\nsome degree subsided. \xe2\x80\x98It occurred in Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. Tenant of a top\r\nset--bad character--shut himself up in his bedroom closet, and took a\r\ndose of arsenic. The steward thought he had run away: opened the door,\r\nand put a bill up. Another man came, took the chambers, furnished them,\r\nand went to live there. Somehow or other he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep--always\r\nrestless and uncomfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cOdd,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make the other room my\r\nbedchamber, and this my sitting-room.\xe2\x80\x9d He made the change, and slept\r\nvery well at night, but suddenly found that, somehow, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read\r\nin the evening: he got nervous and uncomfortable, and used to be always\r\nsnuffing his candles and staring about him. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make this out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he, when he came home from the play one night, and was drinking a\r\nglass of cold grog, with his back to the wall, in order that he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe able to fancy there was any one behind him--\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he; and just then his eyes rested on the little closet that had\r\nbeen always locked up, and a shudder ran through his whole frame from\r\ntop to toe. \xe2\x80\x9cI have felt this strange feeling before,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot help thinking there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong about that closet.\xe2\x80\x9d He made\r\na strong effort, plucked up his courage, shivered the lock with a blow\r\nor two of the poker, opened the door, and there, sure enough, standing\r\nbolt upright in the corner, was the last tenant, with a little bottle\r\nclasped firmly in his hand, and his face--well!\xe2\x80\x99 As the little old man\r\nconcluded, he looked round on the attentive faces of his wondering\r\nauditory with a smile of grim delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What strange things these are you tell us of, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nminutely scanning the old man\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, by the aid of his glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Strange!\xe2\x80\x99 said the little old man. \xe2\x80\x98Nonsense; you think them strange,\r\nbecause you know nothing about it. They are funny, but not uncommon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Funny!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, funny, are they not?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the little old man, with a\r\ndiabolical leer; and then, without pausing for an answer, he continued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew another man--let me see--forty years ago now--who took an old,\r\ndamp, rotten set of chambers, in one of the most ancient inns, that had\r\nbeen shut up and empty for years and years before. There were lots of\r\nold women\xe2\x80\x99s stories about the place, and it certainly was very far from\r\nbeing a cheerful one; but he was poor, and the rooms were cheap, and\r\nthat would have been quite a sufficient reason for him, if they had been\r\nten times worse than they really were. He was obliged to take some\r\nmouldering fixtures that were on the place, and, among the rest, was a\r\ngreat lumbering wooden press for papers, with large glass doors, and a\r\ngreen curtain inside; a pretty useless thing for him, for he had no\r\npapers to put in it; and as to his clothes, he carried them about with\r\nhim, and that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very hard work, either. Well, he had moved in all\r\nhis furniture--it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite a truck-full--and had sprinkled it about\r\nthe room, so as to make the four chairs look as much like a dozen as\r\npossible, and was sitting down before the fire at night, drinking the\r\nfirst glass of two gallons of whisky he had ordered on credit, wondering\r\nwhether it would ever be paid for, and if so, in how many years\xe2\x80\x99 time,\r\nwhen his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says he, \xe2\x80\x9cif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been obliged to take that ugly article at the old\r\nbroker\xe2\x80\x99s valuation, I might have got something comfortable for the\r\nmoney. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking aloud to\r\nthe press, having nothing else to speak to, \xe2\x80\x9cif it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost more to\r\nbreak up your old carcass, than it would ever be worth afterward, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave a fire out of you in less than no time.\xe2\x80\x9d He had hardly spoken the\r\nwords, when a sound resembling a faint groan, appeared to issue from the\r\ninterior of the case. It startled him at first, but thinking, on a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, that it must be some young fellow in the next\r\nchamber, who had been dining out, he put his feet on the fender, and\r\nraised the poker to stir the fire. At that moment, the sound was\r\nrepeated; and one of the glass doors slowly opening, disclosed a pale\r\nand emaciated figure in soiled and worn apparel, standing erect in the\r\npress. The figure was tall and thin, and the countenance expressive of\r\ncare and anxiety; but there was something in the hue of the skin, and\r\ngaunt and unearthly appearance of the whole form, which no being of this\r\nworld was ever seen to wear. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the new tenant, turning\r\nvery pale; poising the poker in his hand, however, and taking a very\r\ndecent aim at the countenance of the figure. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t throw\r\nthat poker at me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the form; \xe2\x80\x9cif you hurled it with ever so sure\r\nan aim, it would pass through me, without resistance, and expend its\r\nforce on the wood behind. I am a spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, what do you want\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the tenant. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this room,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the apparition, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nworldly ruin was worked, and I and my children beggared. In this press,\r\nthe papers in a long, long suit, which accumulated for years, were\r\ndeposited. In this room, when I had died of grief, and long-deferred\r\nhope, two wily harpies divided the wealth for which I had contested\r\nduring a wretched existence, and of which, at last, not one farthing was\r\nleft for my unhappy descendants. I terrified them from the spot, and\r\nsince that day have prowled by night--the only period at which I can\r\nrevisit the earth--about the scenes of my long-protracted misery. This\r\napartment is mine: leave it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you insist upon making your\r\nappearance here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tenant, who had had time to collect his\r\npresence of mind during this prosy statement of the ghost\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\ngive up possession with the greatest pleasure; but I should like to ask\r\nyou one question, if you will allow me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSay on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the apparition\r\nsternly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tenant, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t apply the observation\r\npersonally to you, because it is equally applicable to most of the\r\nghosts I ever heard of; but it does appear to me somewhat inconsistent,\r\nthat when you have an opportunity of visiting the fairest spots of\r\nearth--for I suppose space is nothing to you--you should always return\r\nexactly to the very places where you have been most miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEgad,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s very true; I never thought of that before,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ghost. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the tenant, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a very uncomfortable room. From\r\nthe appearance of that press, I should be disposed to say that it is not\r\nwholly free from bugs; and I really think you might find much more\r\ncomfortable quarters: to say nothing of the climate of London, which is\r\nextremely disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very right, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ghost\r\npolitely, \xe2\x80\x9cit never struck me till now; I\xe2\x80\x99ll try change of air\r\ndirectly\xe2\x80\x9d--and, in fact, he began to vanish as he spoke; his legs,\r\nindeed, had quite disappeared. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tenant, calling\r\nafter him, \xe2\x80\x9cif you _would _have the goodness to suggest to the other\r\nladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses,\r\nthat they might be much more comfortable elsewhere, you will confer a\r\nvery great benefit on society.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the ghost; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must be\r\ndull fellows--very dull fellows, indeed; I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how we can have\r\nbeen so stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d With these words, the spirit disappeared; and what is\r\nrather remarkable,\xe2\x80\x99 added the old man, with a shrewd look round the\r\ntable, \xe2\x80\x98he never came back again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That ain\xe2\x80\x99t bad, if it\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in the Mosaic studs,\r\nlighting a fresh cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_If_!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old man, with a look of excessive contempt. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, turning to Lowten, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99ll say next, that my story\r\nabout the queer client we had, when I was in an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, is\r\nnot true either--I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shan\xe2\x80\x99t venture to say anything at all about it, seeing that I never\r\nheard the story,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the owner of the Mosaic decorations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would repeat it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten, \xe2\x80\x98nobody has heard it but me, and I have nearly\r\nforgotten it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man looked round the table, and leered more horribly than ever,\r\nas if in triumph, at the attention which was depicted in every face.\r\nThen rubbing his chin with his hand, and looking up to the ceiling as if\r\nto recall the circumstances to his memory, he began as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MAN\xe2\x80\x99S TALE ABOUT THE QUEER CLIENT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It matters little,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, \xe2\x80\x98where, or how, I picked up this\r\nbrief history. If I were to relate it in the order in which it reached\r\nme, I should commence in the middle, and when I had arrived at the\r\nconclusion, go back for a beginning. It is enough for me to say that\r\nsome of its circumstances passed before my own eyes; for the remainder I\r\nknow them to have happened, and there are some persons yet living, who\r\nwill remember them but too well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the Borough High Street, near St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Church, and on the same\r\nside of the way, stands, as most people know, the smallest of our\r\ndebtors\xe2\x80\x99 prisons, the Marshalsea. Although in later times it has been a\r\nvery different place from the sink of filth and dirt it once was, even\r\nits improved condition holds out but little temptation to the\r\nextravagant, or consolation to the improvident. The condemned felon has\r\nas good a yard for air and exercise in Newgate, as the insolvent debtor\r\nin the Marshalsea Prison. [Better. But this is past, in a better age,\r\nand the prison exists no longer.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It may be my fancy, or it may be that I cannot separate the place from\r\nthe old recollections associated with it, but this part of London I\r\ncannot bear. The street is broad, the shops are spacious, the noise of\r\npassing vehicles, the footsteps of a perpetual stream of people--all the\r\nbusy sounds of traffic, resound in it from morn to midnight; but the\r\nstreets around are mean and close; poverty and debauchery lie festering\r\nin the crowded alleys; want and misfortune are pent up in the narrow\r\nprison; an air of gloom and dreariness seems, in my eyes at least, to\r\nhang about the scene, and to impart to it a squalid and sickly hue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many eyes, that have long since been closed in the grave, have looked\r\nround upon that scene lightly enough, when entering the gate of the old\r\nMarshalsea Prison for the first time; for despair seldom comes with the\r\nfirst severe shock of misfortune. A man has confidence in untried\r\nfriends, he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his\r\nboon companions when he wanted them not; he has hope--the hope of happy\r\ninexperience--and however he may bend beneath the first shock, it\r\nsprings up in his bosom, and flourishes there for a brief space, until\r\nit droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect. How soon\r\nhave those same eyes, deeply sunken in the head, glared from faces\r\nwasted with famine, and sallow from confinement, in days when it was no\r\nfigure of speech to say that debtors rotted in prison, with no hope of\r\nrelease, and no prospect of liberty! The atrocity in its full extent no\r\nlonger exists, but there is enough of it left to give rise to\r\noccurrences that make the heart bleed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Twenty years ago, that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother\r\nand child, who, day by day, so surely as the morning came, presented\r\nthemselves at the prison gate; often after a night of restless misery\r\nand anxious thoughts, were they there, a full hour too soon, and then\r\nthe young mother turning meekly away, would lead the child to the old\r\nbridge, and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water,\r\ntinted with the light of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s sun, and stirring with all the\r\nbustling preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented\r\nat that early hour, endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects\r\nbefore him. But she would quickly set him down, and hiding her face in\r\nher shawl, give vent to the tears that blinded her; for no expression of\r\ninterest or amusement lighted up his thin and sickly face. His\r\nrecollections were few enough, but they were all of one kind--all\r\nconnected with the poverty and misery of his parents. Hour after hour\r\nhad he sat on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and with childish sympathy watched the\r\ntears that stole down her face, and then crept quietly away into some\r\ndark corner, and sobbed himself to sleep. The hard realities of the\r\nworld, with many of its worst privations--hunger and thirst, and cold\r\nand want--had all come home to him, from the first dawnings of reason;\r\nand though the form of childhood was there, its light heart, its merry\r\nlaugh, and sparkling eyes were wanting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The father and mother looked on upon this, and upon each other, with\r\nthoughts of agony they dared not breathe in words. The healthy, strong-\r\nmade man, who could have borne almost any fatigue of active exertion,\r\nwas wasting beneath the close confinement and unhealthy atmosphere of a\r\ncrowded prison. The slight and delicate woman was sinking beneath the\r\ncombined effects of bodily and mental illness. The child\xe2\x80\x99s young heart\r\nwas breaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winter came, and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain. The poor girl\r\nhad removed to a wretched apartment close to the spot of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimprisonment; and though the change had been rendered necessary by their\r\nincreasing poverty, she was happier now, for she was nearer him. For two\r\nmonths, she and her little companion watched the opening of the gate as\r\nusual. One day she failed to come, for the first time. Another morning\r\narrived, and she came alone. The child was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They little know, who coldly talk of the poor man\xe2\x80\x99s bereavements, as a\r\nhappy release from pain to the departed, and a merciful relief from\r\nexpense to the survivor--they little know, I say, what the agony of\r\nthose bereavements is. A silent look of affection and regard when all\r\nother eyes are turned coldly away--the consciousness that we possess the\r\nsympathy and affection of one being when all others have deserted us--is\r\na hold, a stay, a comfort, in the deepest affliction, which no wealth\r\ncould purchase, or power bestow. The child had sat at his parents\xe2\x80\x99 feet\r\nfor hours together, with his little hands patiently folded in each\r\nother, and his thin wan face raised towards them. They had seen him pine\r\naway, from day to day; and though his brief existence had been a joyless\r\none, and he was now removed to that peace and rest which, child as he\r\nwas, he had never known in this world, they were his parents, and his\r\nloss sank deep into their souls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was plain to those who looked upon the mother\xe2\x80\x99s altered face, that\r\ndeath must soon close the scene of her adversity and trial. Her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s fellow-prisoners shrank from obtruding on his grief and\r\nmisery, and left to himself alone, the small room he had previously\r\noccupied in common with two companions. She shared it with him; and\r\nlingering on without pain, but without hope, her life ebbed slowly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She had fainted one evening in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and he had borne her\r\nto the open window, to revive her with the air, when the light of the\r\nmoon falling full upon her face, showed him a change upon her features,\r\nwhich made him stagger beneath her weight, like a helpless infant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSet me down, George,\xe2\x80\x9d she said faintly. He did so, and seating himself\r\nbeside her, covered his face with his hands, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very hard to leave you, George,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill, and you must bear it for my sake. Oh! how I thank Him for having\r\ntaken our boy! He is happy, and in heaven now. What would he have done\r\nhere, without his mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not die, Mary, you shall not die;\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband,\r\nstarting up. He paced hurriedly to and fro, striking his head with his\r\nclenched fists; then reseating himself beside her, and supporting her in\r\nhis arms, added more calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cRouse yourself, my dear girl. Pray, pray\r\ndo. You will revive yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNever again, George; never again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying woman. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them lay\r\nme by my poor boy now, but promise me, that if ever you leave this\r\ndreadful place, and should grow rich, you will have us removed to some\r\nquiet country churchyard, a long, long way off--very far from here--\r\nwhere we can rest in peace. Dear George, promise me you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI do, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, throwing himself passionately on his knees\r\nbefore her. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to me, Mary, another word; one look--but one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He ceased to speak: for the arm that clasped his neck grew stiff and\r\nheavy. A deep sigh escaped from the wasted form before him; the lips\r\nmoved, and a smile played upon the face; but the lips were pallid, and\r\nthe smile faded into a rigid and ghastly stare. He was alone in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That night, in the silence and desolation of his miserable room, the\r\nwretched man knelt down by the dead body of his wife, and called on God\r\nto witness a terrible oath, that from that hour, he devoted himself to\r\nrevenge her death and that of his child; that thenceforth to the last\r\nmoment of his life, his whole energies should be directed to this one\r\nobject; that his revenge should be protracted and terrible; that his\r\nhatred should be undying and inextinguishable; and should hunt its\r\nobject through the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The deepest despair, and passion scarcely human, had made such fierce\r\nravages on his face and form, in that one night, that his companions in\r\nmisfortune shrank affrighted from him as he passed by. His eyes were\r\nbloodshot and heavy, his face a deadly white, and his body bent as if\r\nwith age. He had bitten his under lip nearly through in the violence of\r\nhis mental suffering, and the blood which had flowed from the wound had\r\ntrickled down his chin, and stained his shirt and neckerchief. No tear,\r\nor sound of complaint escaped him; but the unsettled look, and\r\ndisordered haste with which he paced up and down the yard, denoted the\r\nfever which was burning within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was necessary that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s body should be removed from the\r\nprison, without delay. He received the communication with perfect\r\ncalmness, and acquiesced in its propriety. Nearly all the inmates of the\r\nprison had assembled to witness its removal; they fell back on either\r\nside when the widower appeared; he walked hurriedly forward, and\r\nstationed himself, alone, in a little railed area close to the lodge\r\ngate, from whence the crowd, with an instinctive feeling of delicacy,\r\nhad retired. The rude coffin was borne slowly forward on men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders. A dead silence pervaded the throng, broken only by the\r\naudible lamentations of the women, and the shuffling steps of the\r\nbearers on the stone pavement. They reached the spot where the bereaved\r\nhusband stood: and stopped. He laid his hand upon the coffin, and\r\nmechanically adjusting the pall with which it was covered, motioned them\r\nonward. The turnkeys in the prison lobby took off their hats as it\r\npassed through, and in another moment the heavy gate closed behind it.\r\nHe looked vacantly upon the crowd, and fell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Although for many weeks after this, he was watched, night and day, in\r\nthe wildest ravings of fever, neither the consciousness of his loss, nor\r\nthe recollection of the vow he had made, ever left him for a moment.\r\nScenes changed before his eyes, place succeeded place, and event\r\nfollowed event, in all the hurry of delirium; but they were all\r\nconnected in some way with the great object of his mind. He was sailing\r\nover a boundless expanse of sea, with a blood-red sky above, and the\r\nangry waters, lashed into fury beneath, boiling and eddying up, on every\r\nside. There was another vessel before them, toiling and labouring in the\r\nhowling storm; her canvas fluttering in ribbons from the mast, and her\r\ndeck thronged with figures who were lashed to the sides, over which huge\r\nwaves every instant burst, sweeping away some devoted creatures into the\r\nfoaming sea. Onward they bore, amidst the roaring mass of water, with a\r\nspeed and force which nothing could resist; and striking the stem of the\r\nforemost vessel, crushed her beneath their keel. From the huge whirlpool\r\nwhich the sinking wreck occasioned, arose a shriek so loud and shrill--\r\nthe death-cry of a hundred drowning creatures, blended into one fierce\r\nyell--that it rung far above the war-cry of the elements, and echoed,\r\nand re-echoed till it seemed to pierce air, sky, and ocean. But what was\r\nthat--that old gray head that rose above the water\xe2\x80\x99s surface, and with\r\nlooks of agony, and screams for aid, buffeted with the waves! One look,\r\nand he had sprung from the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s side, and with vigorous strokes was\r\nswimming towards it. He reached it; he was close upon it. They were _his\r\n_features. The old man saw him coming, and vainly strove to elude his\r\ngrasp. But he clasped him tight, and dragged him beneath the water.\r\nDown, down with him, fifty fathoms down; his struggles grew fainter and\r\nfainter, until they wholly ceased. He was dead; he had killed him, and\r\nhad kept his oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was traversing the scorching sands of a mighty desert, barefoot and\r\nalone. The sand choked and blinded him; its fine thin grains entered the\r\nvery pores of his skin, and irritated him almost to madness. Gigantic\r\nmasses of the same material, carried forward by the wind, and shone\r\nthrough by the burning sun, stalked in the distance like pillars of\r\nliving fire. The bones of men, who had perished in the dreary waste, lay\r\nscattered at his feet; a fearful light fell on everything around; so far\r\nas the eye could reach, nothing but objects of dread and horror\r\npresented themselves. Vainly striving to utter a cry of terror, with his\r\ntongue cleaving to his mouth, he rushed madly forward. Armed with\r\nsupernatural strength, he waded through the sand, until, exhausted with\r\nfatigue and thirst, he fell senseless on the earth. What fragrant\r\ncoolness revived him; what gushing sound was that? Water! It was indeed\r\na well; and the clear fresh stream was running at his feet. He drank\r\ndeeply of it, and throwing his aching limbs upon the bank, sank into a\r\ndelicious trance. The sound of approaching footsteps roused him. An old\r\ngray-headed man tottered forward to slake his burning thirst. It was\r\n_he_ again! He wound his arms round the old man\xe2\x80\x99s body, and held him\r\nback. He struggled, and shrieked for water--for but one drop of water to\r\nsave his life! But he held the old man firmly, and watched his agonies\r\nwith greedy eyes; and when his lifeless head fell forward on his bosom,\r\nhe rolled the corpse from him with his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When the fever left him, and consciousness returned, he awoke to find\r\nhimself rich and free, to hear that the parent who would have let him\r\ndie in jail--_would_! who _had _let those who were far dearer to him\r\nthan his own existence die of want, and sickness of heart that medicine\r\ncannot cure--had been found dead in his bed of down. He had had all the\r\nheart to leave his son a beggar, but proud even of his health and\r\nstrength, had put off the act till it was too late, and now might gnash\r\nhis teeth in the other world, at the thought of the wealth his\r\nremissness had left him. He awoke to this, and he awoke to more. To\r\nrecollect the purpose for which he lived, and to remember that his enemy\r\nwas his wife\xe2\x80\x99s own father--the man who had cast him into prison, and\r\nwho, when his daughter and her child sued at his feet for mercy, had\r\nspurned them from his door. Oh, how he cursed the weakness that\r\nprevented him from being up, and active, in his scheme of vengeance!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He caused himself to be carried from the scene of his loss and misery,\r\nand conveyed to a quiet residence on the sea-coast; not in the hope of\r\nrecovering his peace of mind or happiness, for both were fled for ever;\r\nbut to restore his prostrate energies, and meditate on his darling\r\nobject. And here, some evil spirit cast in his way the opportunity for\r\nhis first, most horrible revenge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was summer-time; and wrapped in his gloomy thoughts, he would issue\r\nfrom his solitary lodgings early in the evening, and wandering along a\r\nnarrow path beneath the cliffs, to a wild and lonely spot that had\r\nstruck his fancy in his ramblings, seat himself on some fallen fragment\r\nof the rock, and burying his face in his hands, remain there for hours--\r\nsometimes until night had completely closed in, and the long shadows of\r\nthe frowning cliffs above his head cast a thick, black darkness on every\r\nobject near him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was seated here, one calm evening, in his old position, now and then\r\nraising his head to watch the flight of a sea-gull, or carry his eye\r\nalong the glorious crimson path, which, commencing in the middle of the\r\nocean, seemed to lead to its very verge where the sun was setting, when\r\nthe profound stillness of the spot was broken by a loud cry for help; he\r\nlistened, doubtful of his having heard aright, when the cry was repeated\r\nwith even greater vehemence than before, and, starting to his feet, he\r\nhastened in the direction whence it proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The tale told itself at once: some scattered garments lay on the beach;\r\na human head was just visible above the waves at a little distance from\r\nthe shore; and an old man, wringing his hands in agony, was running to\r\nand fro, shrieking for assistance. The invalid, whose strength was now\r\nsufficiently restored, threw off his coat, and rushed towards the sea,\r\nwith the intention of plunging in, and dragging the drowning man ashore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHasten here, Sir, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name; help, help, sir, for the love of\r\nHeaven. He is my son, Sir, my only son!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man frantically,\r\nas he advanced to meet him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy only son, Sir, and he is dying before\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the first word the old man uttered, the stranger checked himself in\r\nhis career, and, folding his arms, stood perfectly motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGreat God!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old man, recoiling, \xe2\x80\x9cHeyling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The stranger smiled, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHeyling!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man wildly; \xe2\x80\x9cmy boy, Heyling, my dear boy,\r\nlook, look!\xe2\x80\x9d Gasping for breath, the miserable father pointed to the\r\nspot where the young man was struggling for life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe cries once more. He is alive yet.\r\nHeyling, save him, save him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The stranger smiled again, and remained immovable as a statue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI have wronged you,\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the old man, falling on his knees, and\r\nclasping his hands together. \xe2\x80\x9cBe revenged; take my all, my life; cast me\r\ninto the water at your feet, and, if human nature can repress a\r\nstruggle, I will die, without stirring hand or foot. Do it, Heyling, do\r\nit, but save my boy; he is so young, Heyling, so young to die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, grasping the old man fiercely by the\r\nwrist; \xe2\x80\x9cI will have life for life, and here is _one_. _My_ child died,\r\nbefore his father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, a far more agonising and painful death than\r\nthat young slanderer of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s worth is meeting while I speak. You\r\nlaughed--laughed in your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face, where death had already set\r\nhis hand--at our sufferings, then. What think you of them now! See\r\nthere, see there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the stranger spoke, he pointed to the sea. A faint cry died away\r\nupon its surface; the last powerful struggle of the dying man agitated\r\nthe rippling waves for a few seconds; and the spot where he had gone\r\ndown into his early grave, was undistinguishable from the surrounding\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three years had elapsed, when a gentleman alighted from a private\r\ncarriage at the door of a London attorney, then well known as a man of\r\nno great nicety in his professional dealings, and requested a private\r\ninterview on business of importance. Although evidently not past the\r\nprime of life, his face was pale, haggard, and dejected; and it did not\r\nrequire the acute perception of the man of business, to discern at a\r\nglance, that disease or suffering had done more to work a change in his\r\nappearance, than the mere hand of time could have accomplished in twice\r\nthe period of his whole life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to undertake some legal business for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The attorney bowed obsequiously, and glanced at a large packet which\r\nthe gentleman carried in his hand. His visitor observed the look, and\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no common business,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cnor have these papers reached my\r\nhands without long trouble and great expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The attorney cast a still more anxious look at the packet; and his\r\nvisitor, untying the string that bound it, disclosed a quantity of\r\npromissory notes, with copies of deeds, and other documents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cUpon these papers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the client, \xe2\x80\x9cthe man whose name they bear,\r\nhas raised, as you will see, large sums of money, for years past. There\r\nwas a tacit understanding between him and the men into whose hands they\r\noriginally went--and from whom I have by degrees purchased the whole,\r\nfor treble and quadruple their nominal value--that these loans should be\r\nfrom time to time renewed, until a given period had elapsed. Such an\r\nunderstanding is nowhere expressed. He has sustained many losses of\r\nlate; and these obligations accumulating upon him at once, would crush\r\nhim to the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole amount is many thousands of pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said the attorney,\r\nlooking over the papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the client.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the man of business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDo!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the client, with sudden vehemence. \xe2\x80\x9cPut every engine of\r\nthe law in force, every trick that ingenuity can devise and rascality\r\nexecute; fair means and foul; the open oppression of the law, aided by\r\nall the craft of its most ingenious practitioners. I would have him die\r\na harassing and lingering death. Ruin him, seize and sell his lands and\r\ngoods, drive him from house and home, and drag him forth a beggar in his\r\nold age, to die in a common jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBut the costs, my dear Sir, the costs of all this,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoned the\r\nattorney, when he had recovered from his momentary surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the\r\ndefendant be a man of straw, who is to pay the costs, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cName any sum,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, his hand trembling so violently with\r\nexcitement, that he could scarcely hold the pen he seized as he spoke--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cany sum, and it is yours. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to name it, man. I shall not\r\nthink it dear, if you gain my object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The attorney named a large sum, at hazard, as the advance he should\r\nrequire to secure himself against the possibility of loss; but more with\r\nthe view of ascertaining how far his client was really disposed to go,\r\nthan with any idea that he would comply with the demand. The stranger\r\nwrote a cheque upon his banker, for the whole amount, and left him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The draft was duly honoured, and the attorney, finding that his strange\r\nclient might be safely relied upon, commenced his work in earnest. For\r\nmore than two years afterwards, Mr. Heyling would sit whole days\r\ntogether, in the office, poring over the papers as they accumulated, and\r\nreading again and again, his eyes gleaming with joy, the letters of\r\nremonstrance, the prayers for a little delay, the representations of the\r\ncertain ruin in which the opposite party must be involved, which poured\r\nin, as suit after suit, and process after process, was commenced. To all\r\napplications for a brief indulgence, there was but one reply--the money\r\nmust be paid. Land, house, furniture, each in its turn, was taken under\r\nsome one of the numerous executions which were issued; and the old man\r\nhimself would have been immured in prison had he not escaped the\r\nvigilance of the officers, and fled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The implacable animosity of Heyling, so far from being satiated by the\r\nsuccess of his persecution, increased a hundredfold with the ruin he\r\ninflicted. On being informed of the old man\xe2\x80\x99s flight, his fury was\r\nunbounded. He gnashed his teeth with rage, tore the hair from his head,\r\nand assailed with horrid imprecations the men who had been intrusted\r\nwith the writ. He was only restored to comparative calmness by repeated\r\nassurances of the certainty of discovering the fugitive. Agents were\r\nsent in quest of him, in all directions; every stratagem that could be\r\ninvented was resorted to, for the purpose of discovering his place of\r\nretreat; but it was all in vain. Half a year had passed over, and he was\r\nstill undiscovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At length late one night, Heyling, of whom nothing had been seen for\r\nmany weeks before, appeared at his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s private residence, and\r\nsent up word that a gentleman wished to see him instantly. Before the\r\nattorney, who had recognised his voice from above stairs, could order\r\nthe servant to admit him, he had rushed up the staircase, and entered\r\nthe drawing-room pale and breathless. Having closed the door, to prevent\r\nbeing overheard, he sank into a chair, and said, in a low voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHush! I have found him at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the attorney. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, my dear sir, well done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe lies concealed in a wretched lodging in Camden Town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is as well we _did _lose sight of him, for he has been\r\nliving alone there, in the most abject misery, all the time, and he is\r\npoor--very poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the attorney. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have the caption made to-\r\nmorrow, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Heyling. \xe2\x80\x9cStay! No! The next day. You are surprised at\r\nmy wishing to postpone it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a ghastly smile; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I had\r\nforgotten. The next day is an anniversary in his life: let it be done\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the attorney. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you write down instructions for\r\nthe officer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo; let him meet me here, at eight in the evening, and I will\r\naccompany him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They met on the appointed night, and, hiring a hackney-coach, directed\r\nthe driver to stop at that corner of the old Pancras Road, at which\r\nstands the parish workhouse. By the time they alighted there, it was\r\nquite dark; and, proceeding by the dead wall in front of the Veterinary\r\nHospital, they entered a small by-street, which is, or was at that time,\r\ncalled Little College Street, and which, whatever it may be now, was in\r\nthose days a desolate place enough, surrounded by little else than\r\nfields and ditches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having drawn the travelling-cap he had on half over his face, and\r\nmuffled himself in his cloak, Heyling stopped before the meanest-looking\r\nhouse in the street, and knocked gently at the door. It was at once\r\nopened by a woman, who dropped a curtsey of recognition, and Heyling,\r\nwhispering the officer to remain below, crept gently upstairs, and,\r\nopening the door of the front room, entered at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The object of his search and his unrelenting animosity, now a decrepit\r\nold man, was seated at a bare deal table, on which stood a miserable\r\ncandle. He started on the entrance of the stranger, and rose feebly to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now, what now?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat fresh misery is this?\r\nWhat do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cA word with _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Heyling. As he spoke, he seated himself at\r\nthe other end of the table, and, throwing off his cloak and cap,\r\ndisclosed his features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old man seemed instantly deprived of speech. He fell backward in\r\nhis chair, and, clasping his hands together, gazed on the apparition\r\nwith a mingled look of abhorrence and fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThis day six years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyling, \xe2\x80\x9cI claimed the life you owed me for\r\nmy child\xe2\x80\x99s. Beside the lifeless form of your daughter, old man, I swore\r\nto live a life of revenge. I have never swerved from my purpose for a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s space; but if I had, one thought of her uncomplaining,\r\nsuffering look, as she drooped away, or of the starving face of our\r\ninnocent child, would have nerved me to my task. My first act of\r\nrequital you well remember: this is my last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old man shivered, and his hands dropped powerless by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI leave England to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyling, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-\r\nnight I consign you to the living death to which you devoted her--a\r\nhopeless prison--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He raised his eyes to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, and paused. He lifted\r\nthe light to his face, set it gently down, and left the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better see to the old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the woman, as he opened\r\nthe door, and motioned the officer to follow him into the street. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink he is ill.\xe2\x80\x9d The woman closed the door, ran hastily upstairs, and\r\nfound him lifeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beneath a plain gravestone, in one of the most peaceful and secluded\r\nchurchyards in Kent, where wild flowers mingle with the grass, and the\r\nsoft landscape around forms the fairest spot in the garden of England,\r\nlie the bones of the young mother and her gentle child. But the ashes of\r\nthe father do not mingle with theirs; nor, from that night forward, did\r\nthe attorney ever gain the remotest clue to the subsequent history of\r\nhis queer client.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the old man concluded his tale, he advanced to a peg in one corner,\r\nand taking down his hat and coat, put them on with great deliberation;\r\nand, without saying another word, walked slowly away. As the gentleman\r\nwith the Mosaic studs had fallen asleep, and the major part of the\r\ncompany were deeply occupied in the humorous process of dropping melted\r\ntallow-grease into his brandy-and-water, Mr. Pickwick departed\r\nunnoticed, and having settled his own score, and that of Mr. Weller,\r\nissued forth, in company with that gentleman, from beneath the portal of\r\nthe Magpie and Stump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. MR. PICKWICK JOURNEYS TO IPSWICH AND MEETS WITH A ROMANTIC\r\nADVENTURE WITH A MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS\r\n\r\nThat \xe2\x80\x98ere your governor\xe2\x80\x99s luggage, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller of his\r\naffectionate son, as he entered the yard of the Bull Inn, Whitechapel,\r\nwith a travelling-bag and a small portmanteau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You might ha\xe2\x80\x99 made a worser guess than that, old feller,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nWeller the younger, setting down his burden in the yard, and sitting\r\nhimself down upon it afterwards. \xe2\x80\x98The governor hisself\xe2\x80\x99ll be down here\r\npresently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a-cabbin\xe2\x80\x99 it, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a havin\xe2\x80\x99 two mile o\xe2\x80\x99 danger at eight-pence,\xe2\x80\x99 responded the\r\nson. \xe2\x80\x98How\xe2\x80\x99s mother-in-law this mornin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Queer, Sammy, queer,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the elder Mr. Weller, with impressive\r\ngravity. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s been gettin\xe2\x80\x99 rayther in the Methodistical order lately,\r\nSammy; and she is uncommon pious, to be sure. She\xe2\x80\x99s too good a creetur\r\nfor me, Sammy. I feel I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Samuel. \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s wery self-denyin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his parent, with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s got hold o\xe2\x80\x99 some\r\ninwention for grown-up people being born again, Sammy--the new birth, I\r\nthink they calls it. I should wery much like to see that system in\r\nhaction, Sammy. I should wery much like to see your mother-in-law born\r\nagain. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I put her out to nurse!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think them women does t\xe2\x80\x99other day,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Weller,\r\nafter a short pause, during which he had significantly struck the side\r\nof his nose with his forefinger some half-dozen times. \xe2\x80\x98What do you\r\nthink they does, t\xe2\x80\x99other day, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Goes and gets up a grand tea drinkin\xe2\x80\x99 for a feller they calls their\r\nshepherd,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98I was a-standing starin\xe2\x80\x99 in at the pictur\r\nshop down at our place, when I sees a little bill about it; \xe2\x80\x9ctickets\r\nhalf-a-crown. All applications to be made to the committee. Secretary,\r\nMrs. Weller\xe2\x80\x9d; and when I got home there was the committee a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nour back parlour. Fourteen women; I wish you could ha\xe2\x80\x99 heard \xe2\x80\x98em, Sammy.\r\nThere they was, a-passin\xe2\x80\x99 resolutions, and wotin\xe2\x80\x99 supplies, and all\r\nsorts o\xe2\x80\x99 games. Well, what with your mother-in-law a-worrying me to go,\r\nand what with my looking for\xe2\x80\x99ard to seein\xe2\x80\x99 some queer starts if I did, I\r\nput my name down for a ticket; at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the Friday evenin\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndresses myself out wery smart, and off I goes with the old \xe2\x80\x98ooman, and\r\nup we walks into a fust-floor where there was tea-things for thirty, and\r\na whole lot o\xe2\x80\x99 women as begins whisperin\xe2\x80\x99 to one another, and lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at\r\nme, as if they\xe2\x80\x99d never seen a rayther stout gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n of eight-and-fifty\r\nafore. By and by, there comes a great bustle downstairs, and a lanky\r\nchap with a red nose and a white neckcloth rushes up, and sings out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the shepherd a-coming to wisit his faithful flock;\xe2\x80\x9d and in comes\r\na fat chap in black, vith a great white face, a-smilin\xe2\x80\x99 avay like\r\nclockwork. Such goin\xe2\x80\x99s on, Sammy! \xe2\x80\x9cThe kiss of peace,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nshepherd; and then he kissed the women all round, and ven he\xe2\x80\x99d done, the\r\nman vith the red nose began. I was just a-thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 whether I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbetter begin too--\xe2\x80\x98specially as there was a wery nice lady a-sittin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnext me--ven in comes the tea, and your mother-in-law, as had been\r\nmakin\xe2\x80\x99 the kettle bile downstairs. At it they went, tooth and nail. Such\r\na precious loud hymn, Sammy, while the tea was a brewing; such a grace,\r\nsuch eatin\xe2\x80\x99 and drinkin\xe2\x80\x99! I wish you could ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen the shepherd walkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninto the ham and muffins. I never see such a chap to eat and drink--\r\nnever. The red-nosed man warn\xe2\x80\x99t by no means the sort of person you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to grub by contract, but he was nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to the shepherd. Well;\r\narter the tea was over, they sang another hymn, and then the shepherd\r\nbegan to preach: and wery well he did it, considerin\xe2\x80\x99 how heavy them\r\nmuffins must have lied on his chest. Presently he pulls up, all of a\r\nsudden, and hollers out, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the sinner; where is the mis\xe2\x80\x99rable\r\nsinner?\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which, all the women looked at me, and began to groan as\r\nif they was a-dying. I thought it was rather sing\xe2\x80\x99ler, but howsoever, I\r\nsays nothing. Presently he pulls up again, and lookin\xe2\x80\x99 wery hard at me,\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the sinner; where is the mis\xe2\x80\x99rable sinner?\xe2\x80\x9d and all the\r\nwomen groans again, ten times louder than afore. I got rather savage at\r\nthis, so I takes a step or two for\xe2\x80\x99ard and says, \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d says I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdid you apply that \xe2\x80\x98ere obserwation to me?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98Stead of beggin\xe2\x80\x99 my pardon\r\nas any gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n would ha\xe2\x80\x99 done, he got more abusive than ever:--called\r\nme a wessel, Sammy--a wessel of wrath--and all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 names. So my\r\nblood being reg\xe2\x80\x99larly up, I first gave him two or three for himself, and\r\nthen two or three more to hand over to the man with the red nose, and\r\nwalked off. I wish you could ha\xe2\x80\x99 heard how the women screamed, Sammy,\r\nven they picked up the shepherd from underneath the table--Hollo! here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe governor, the size of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller spoke, Mr. Pickwick dismounted from a cab, and entered the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine mornin\xe2\x80\x99, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, senior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beautiful indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beautiful indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 echoes a red-haired man with an inquisitive nose and\r\ngreen spectacles, who had unpacked himself from a cab at the same moment\r\nas Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Going to Ipswich, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Extraordinary coincidence. So am I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Going outside?\xe2\x80\x99 said the red-haired man.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick bowed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul, how remarkable--I am going outside, too,\xe2\x80\x99 said the red-\r\nhaired man; \xe2\x80\x98we are positively going together.\xe2\x80\x99 And the red-haired man,\r\nwho was an important-looking, sharp-nosed, mysterious-spoken personage,\r\nwith a bird-like habit of giving his head a jerk every time he said\r\nanything, smiled as if he had made one of the strangest discoveries that\r\never fell to the lot of human wisdom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am happy in the prospect of your company, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the new-comer, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for both of us, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nCompany, you see--company--is--is--it\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing from\r\nsolitude--ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that \xe2\x80\x98ere,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, joining in the\r\nconversation, with an affable smile. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what I call a self-evident\r\nproposition, as the dog\xe2\x80\x99s-meat man said, when the housemaid told him he\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the red-haired man, surveying Mr. Weller from head to foot\r\nwith a supercilious look. \xe2\x80\x98Friend of yours, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly a friend,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, in a low tone. \xe2\x80\x98The fact\r\nis, he is my servant, but I allow him to take a good many liberties;\r\nfor, between ourselves, I flatter myself he is an original, and I am\r\nrather proud of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the red-haired man, \xe2\x80\x98that, you see, is a matter of taste. I\r\nam not fond of anything original; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it; don\xe2\x80\x99t see the\r\nnecessity for it. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is my card, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, much amused by the\r\nabruptness of the question, and the singular manner of the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the red-haired man, placing the card in his pocket-book,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickwick; very good. I like to know a man\xe2\x80\x99s name, it saves so much\r\ntrouble. That\xe2\x80\x99s my card, sir. Magnus, you will perceive, sir--Magnus is\r\nmy name. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather a good name, I think, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very good name, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, wholly unable to repress\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think it is,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Magnus. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a good name before\r\nit, too, you will observe. Permit me, sir--if you hold the card a little\r\nslanting, this way, you catch the light upon the up-stroke. There--Peter\r\nMagnus--sounds well, I think, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Curious circumstance about those initials, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nwill observe--P.M.--post meridian. In hasty notes to intimate\r\nacquaintance, I sometimes sign myself \xe2\x80\x9cAfternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d It amuses my friends\r\nvery much, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is calculated to afford them the highest gratification, I should\r\nconceive,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, rather envying the ease with which Mr.\r\nMagnus\xe2\x80\x99s friends were entertained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hostler, \xe2\x80\x98coach is ready, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is all my luggage in?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Magnus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the red bag in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the striped bag?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fore boot, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the brown-paper parcel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Under the seat, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the leather hat-box?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re all in, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, will you get up?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Magnus, standing on the wheel. \xe2\x80\x98Excuse me, Mr.\r\nPickwick. I cannot consent to get up, in this state of uncertainty. I am\r\nquite satisfied from that man\xe2\x80\x99s manner, that the leather hat-box is not\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe solemn protestations of the hostler being wholly unavailing, the\r\nleather hat-box was obliged to be raked up from the lowest depth of the\r\nboot, to satisfy him that it had been safely packed; and after he had\r\nbeen assured on this head, he felt a solemn presentiment, first, that\r\nthe red bag was mislaid, and next that the striped bag had been stolen,\r\nand then that the brown-paper parcel \xe2\x80\x98had come untied.\xe2\x80\x99 At length when\r\nhe had received ocular demonstration of the groundless nature of each\r\nand every of these suspicions, he consented to climb up to the roof of\r\nthe coach, observing that now he had taken everything off his mind, he\r\nfelt quite comfortable and happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re given to nervousness, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller,\r\nsenior, eyeing the stranger askance, as he mounted to his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I always am rather about these little matters,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but I am all right now--quite right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a blessin\xe2\x80\x99, said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Sammy, help your master up\r\nto the box; t\xe2\x80\x99other leg, Sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s it; give us your hand, Sir. Up with\r\nyou. You was a lighter weight when you was a boy, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTrue enough, that, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said the breathless Mr. Pickwick good-\r\nhumouredly, as he took his seat on the box beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jump up in front, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Now Villam, run \xe2\x80\x98em out.\r\nTake care o\xe2\x80\x99 the archvay, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n. \xe2\x80\x9cHeads,\xe2\x80\x9d as the pieman says.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Villam. Let \xe2\x80\x98em alone.\xe2\x80\x99 And away went the coach up\r\nWhitechapel, to the admiration of the whole population of that pretty\r\ndensely populated quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a wery nice neighbourhood, this, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with a touch of\r\nthe hat, which always preceded his entering into conversation with his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not indeed, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, surveying the crowded and\r\nfilthy street through which they were passing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a wery remarkable circumstance, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98that poverty and\r\noysters always seem to go together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I mean, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98is, that the poorer a place is, the\r\ngreater call there seems to be for oysters. Look here, sir; here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\noyster-stall to every half-dozen houses. The street\xe2\x80\x99s lined vith \xe2\x80\x98em.\r\nBlessed if I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that ven a man\xe2\x80\x99s wery poor, he rushes out of\r\nhis lodgings, and eats oysters in reg\xe2\x80\x99lar desperation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure he does,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, senior; \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s just the same\r\nvith pickled salmon!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those are two very remarkable facts, which never occurred to me\r\nbefore,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98The very first place we stop at, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\na note of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End; a profound\r\nsilence prevailed until they had got two or three miles farther on, when\r\nMr. Weller, senior, turning suddenly to Mr. Pickwick, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery queer life is a pike-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A pike-keeper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by a pike-keeper?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Peter Magnus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old \xe2\x80\x98un means a turnpike-keeper, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Samuel\r\nWeller, in explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I see. Yes; very curious life. Very\r\nuncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re all on \xe2\x80\x98em men as has met vith some disappointment in life,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Weller, senior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Consequence of vich, they retires from the world, and shuts\r\nthemselves up in pikes; partly with the view of being solitary, and\r\npartly to rewenge themselves on mankind by takin\xe2\x80\x99 tolls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I never knew that before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fact, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98if they was gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, you\xe2\x80\x99d call \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nmisanthropes, but as it is, they only takes to pike-keepin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith such conversation, possessing the inestimable charm of blending\r\namusement with instruction, did Mr. Weller beguile the tediousness of\r\nthe journey, during the greater part of the day. Topics of conversation\r\nwere never wanting, for even when any pause occurred in Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloquacity, it was abundantly supplied by the desire evinced by Mr.\r\nMagnus to make himself acquainted with the whole of the personal history\r\nof his fellow-travellers, and his loudly-expressed anxiety at every\r\nstage, respecting the safety and well-being of the two bags, the leather\r\nhat-box, and the brown-paper parcel.\r\n\r\nIn the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand side of the way, a short\r\ndistance after you have passed through the open space fronting the Town\r\nHall, stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation of the Great\r\nWhite Horse, rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some\r\nrampacious animal with flowing mane and tail, distantly resembling an\r\ninsane cart-horse, which is elevated above the principal door. The Great\r\nWhite Horse is famous in the neighbourhood, in the same degree as a\r\nprize ox, or a county-paper-chronicled turnip, or unwieldy pig--for its\r\nenormous size. Never was such labyrinths of uncarpeted passages, such\r\nclusters of mouldy, ill-lighted rooms, such huge numbers of small dens\r\nfor eating or sleeping in, beneath any one roof, as are collected\r\ntogether between the four walls of the Great White Horse at Ipswich.\r\n\r\nIt was at the door of this overgrown tavern that the London coach\r\nstopped, at the same hour every evening; and it was from this same\r\nLondon coach that Mr. Pickwick, Sam Weller, and Mr. Peter Magnus\r\ndismounted, on the particular evening to which this chapter of our\r\nhistory bears reference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you stop here, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Peter Magnus, when the striped\r\nbag, and the red bag, and the brown-paper parcel, and the leather hat-\r\nbox, had all been deposited in the passage. \xe2\x80\x98Do you stop here, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98I never knew anything like these\r\nextraordinary coincidences. Why, I stop here too. I hope we dine\r\ntogether?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I am not quite certain whether I\r\nhave any friends here or not, though. Is there any gentleman of the name\r\nof Tupman here, waiter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA corpulent man, with a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s napkin under his arm, and coeval\r\nstockings on his legs, slowly desisted from his occupation of staring\r\ndown the street, on this question being put to him by Mr. Pickwick; and,\r\nafter minutely inspecting that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, from the crown of\r\nhis hat to the lowest button of his gaiters, replied emphatically--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor any gentleman of the name of Snodgrass?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor Winkle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friends have not arrived to-day, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98We will\r\ndine alone, then. Show us a private room, waiter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn this request being preferred, the corpulent man condescended to order\r\nthe boots to bring in the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s luggage; and preceding them down a\r\nlong, dark passage, ushered them into a large, badly-furnished\r\napartment, with a dirty grate, in which a small fire was making a\r\nwretched attempt to be cheerful, but was fast sinking beneath the\r\ndispiriting influence of the place. After the lapse of an hour, a bit of\r\nfish and a steak was served up to the travellers, and when the dinner\r\nwas cleared away, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Peter Magnus drew their chairs up\r\nto the fire, and having ordered a bottle of the worst possible port\r\nwine, at the highest possible price, for the good of the house, drank\r\nbrandy-and-water for their own.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Magnus was naturally of a very communicative disposition, and\r\nthe brandy-and-water operated with wonderful effect in warming into life\r\nthe deepest hidden secrets of his bosom. After sundry accounts of\r\nhimself, his family, his connections, his friends, his jokes, his\r\nbusiness, and his brothers (most talkative men have a great deal to say\r\nabout their brothers), Mr. Peter Magnus took a view of Mr. Pickwick\r\nthrough his coloured spectacles for several minutes, and then said, with\r\nan air of modesty--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do you think--what _do_ you think, Mr. Pickwick--I have come\r\ndown here for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98it is wholly impossible for me to\r\nguess; on business, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partly right, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Peter Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98but partly wrong at the\r\nsame time; try again, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I must throw myself on your mercy, to tell\r\nme or not, as you may think best; for I should never guess, if I were to\r\ntry all night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, then, he-he-he!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Peter Magnus, with a bashful titter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what should you think, Mr. Pickwick, if I had come down here to make a\r\nproposal, Sir, eh? He, he, he!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think! That you are very likely to succeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, with\r\none of his beaming smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus. \xe2\x80\x98But do you really think so, Mr. Pickwick? Do\r\nyou, though?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; but you\xe2\x80\x99re joking, though.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98to let you into a little secret, I think\r\nso too. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you, Mr. Pickwick, although I\xe2\x80\x99m dreadful\r\njealous by nature--horrid--that the lady is in this house.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr.\r\nMagnus took off his spectacles, on purpose to wink, and then put them on\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what you were running out of the room for, before dinner, then,\r\nso often,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick archly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, that was it; not such a fool as to see her,\r\nthough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know, after having just come off a journey. Wait\r\ntill to-morrow, sir; double the chance then. Mr. Pickwick, Sir, there is\r\na suit of clothes in that bag, and a hat in that box, which, I expect,\r\nin the effect they will produce, will be invaluable to me, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; you must have observed my anxiety about them to-day. I do not\r\nbelieve that such another suit of clothes, and such a hat, could be\r\nbought for money, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick congratulated the fortunate owner of the irresistible\r\ngarments on their acquisition; and Mr. Peter Magnus remained a few\r\nmoments apparently absorbed in contemplation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a fine creature,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus. \xe2\x80\x98Very. She lives about twenty miles from here,\r\nMr. Pickwick. I heard she would be here to-night and all to-morrow\r\nforenoon, and came down to seize the opportunity. I think an inn is a\r\ngood sort of a place to propose to a single woman in, Mr. Pickwick. She\r\nis more likely to feel the loneliness of her situation in travelling,\r\nperhaps, than she would be at home. What do you think, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it is very probable,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Peter Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98but I am\r\nnaturally rather curious; what may you have come down here for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On a far less pleasant errand, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, the colour\r\nmounting to his face at the recollection. \xe2\x80\x98I have come down here, Sir,\r\nto expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual, upon whose truth\r\nand honour I placed implicit reliance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Peter Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s very unpleasant. It is a lady,\r\nI presume? Eh? ah! Sly, Mr. Pickwick, sly. Well, Mr. Pickwick, sir, I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t probe your feelings for the world. Painful subjects, these,\r\nsir, very painful. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me, Mr. Pickwick, if you wish to give vent\r\nto your feelings. I know what it is to be jilted, Sir; I have endured\r\nthat sort of thing three or four times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am much obliged to you, for your condolence on what you presume to be\r\nmy melancholy case,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, winding up his watch, and laying\r\nit on the table, \xe2\x80\x98but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Peter Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98not a word more; it\xe2\x80\x99s a painful\r\nsubject. I see, I see. What\xe2\x80\x99s the time, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPast twelve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go to bed. It will never do, sitting here. I\r\nshall be pale to-morrow, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the bare notion of such a calamity, Mr. Peter Magnus rang the bell\r\nfor the chambermaid; and the striped bag, the red bag, the leathern hat-\r\nbox, and the brown-paper parcel, having been conveyed to his bedroom, he\r\nretired in company with a japanned candlestick, to one side of the\r\nhouse, while Mr. Pickwick, and another japanned candlestick, were\r\nconducted through a multitude of tortuous windings, to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is your room, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, looking round him. It was a tolerably\r\nlarge double-bedded room, with a fire; upon the whole, a more\r\ncomfortable-looking apartment than Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s short experience of\r\nthe accommodations of the Great White Horse had led him to expect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody sleeps in the other bed, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good. Tell my servant to bring me up some hot water at half-past\r\neight in the morning, and that I shall not want him any more to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 and bidding Mr. Pickwick good-night, the chambermaid\r\nretired, and left him alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire, and fell into\r\na train of rambling meditations. First he thought of his friends, and\r\nwondered when they would join him; then his mind reverted to Mrs. Martha\r\nBardell; and from that lady it wandered, by a natural process, to the\r\ndingy counting-house of Dodson & Fogg. From Dodson & Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s it flew off\r\nat a tangent, to the very centre of the history of the queer client; and\r\nthen it came back to the Great White Horse at Ipswich, with sufficient\r\nclearness to convince Mr. Pickwick that he was falling asleep. So he\r\nroused himself, and began to undress, when he recollected he had left\r\nhis watch on the table downstairs.\r\n\r\nNow this watch was a special favourite with Mr. Pickwick, having been\r\ncarried about, beneath the shadow of his waistcoat, for a greater number\r\nof years than we feel called upon to state at present. The possibility\r\nof going to sleep, unless it were ticking gently beneath his pillow, or\r\nin the watch-pocket over his head, had never entered Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrain. So as it was pretty late now, and he was unwilling to ring his\r\nbell at that hour of the night, he slipped on his coat, of which he had\r\njust divested himself, and taking the japanned candlestick in his hand,\r\nwalked quietly downstairs.\r\n\r\nThe more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down, the more stairs there seemed to\r\nbe to descend, and again and again, when Mr. Pickwick got into some\r\nnarrow passage, and began to congratulate himself on having gained the\r\nground-floor, did another flight of stairs appear before his astonished\r\neyes. At last he reached a stone hall, which he remembered to have seen\r\nwhen he entered the house. Passage after passage did he explore; room\r\nafter room did he peep into; at length, as he was on the point of giving\r\nup the search in despair, he opened the door of the identical room in\r\nwhich he had spent the evening, and beheld his missing property on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph, and proceeded to retrace his\r\nsteps to his bedchamber. If his progress downward had been attended with\r\ndifficulties and uncertainty, his journey back was infinitely more\r\nperplexing. Rows of doors, garnished with boots of every shape, make,\r\nand size, branched off in every possible direction. A dozen times did he\r\nsoftly turn the handle of some bedroom door which resembled his own,\r\nwhen a gruff cry from within of \xe2\x80\x98Who the devil\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98What do you\r\nwant here?\xe2\x80\x99 caused him to steal away, on tiptoe, with a perfectly\r\nmarvellous celerity. He was reduced to the verge of despair, when an\r\nopen door attracted his attention. He peeped in. Right at last! There\r\nwere the two beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered, and the fire\r\nstill burning. His candle, not a long one when he first received it, had\r\nflickered away in the drafts of air through which he had passed and sank\r\ninto the socket as he closed the door after him. \xe2\x80\x98No matter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I can undress myself just as well by the light of the fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bedsteads stood one on each side of the door; and on the inner side\r\nof each was a little path, terminating in a rush-bottomed chair, just\r\nwide enough to admit of a person\xe2\x80\x99s getting into or out of bed, on that\r\nside, if he or she thought proper. Having carefully drawn the curtains\r\nof his bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat down on the rush-bottomed\r\nchair, and leisurely divested himself of his shoes and gaiters. He then\r\ntook off and folded up his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, and slowly\r\ndrawing on his tasselled nightcap, secured it firmly on his head, by\r\ntying beneath his chin the strings which he always had attached to that\r\narticle of dress. It was at this moment that the absurdity of his recent\r\nbewilderment struck upon his mind. Throwing himself back in the rush-\r\nbottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick laughed to himself so heartily, that it\r\nwould have been quite delightful to any man of well-constituted mind to\r\nhave watched the smiles that expanded his amiable features as they shone\r\nforth from beneath the nightcap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the best idea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick to himself, smiling till he\r\nalmost cracked the nightcap strings--\xe2\x80\x98it is the best idea, my losing\r\nmyself in this place, and wandering about these staircases, that I ever\r\nheard of. Droll, droll, very droll.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Pickwick smiled again, a\r\nbroader smile than before, and was about to continue the process of\r\nundressing, in the best possible humour, when he was suddenly stopped by\r\na most unexpected interruption: to wit, the entrance into the room of\r\nsome person with a candle, who, after locking the door, advanced to the\r\ndressing-table, and set down the light upon it.\r\n\r\nThe smile that played on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s features was instantaneously\r\nlost in a look of the most unbounded and wonder-stricken surprise. The\r\nperson, whoever it was, had come in so suddenly and with so little\r\nnoise, that Mr. Pickwick had had no time to call out, or oppose their\r\nentrance. Who could it be? A robber? Some evil-minded person who had\r\nseen him come upstairs with a handsome watch in his hand, perhaps. What\r\nwas he to do?\r\n\r\nThe only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse of his\r\nmysterious visitor with the least danger of being seen himself, was by\r\ncreeping on to the bed, and peeping out from between the curtains on the\r\nopposite side. To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted. Keeping the\r\ncurtains carefully closed with his hand, so that nothing more of him\r\ncould be seen than his face and nightcap, and putting on his spectacles,\r\nhe mustered up courage and looked out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay. Standing before the\r\ndressing-glass was a middle-aged lady, in yellow curl-papers, busily\r\nengaged in brushing what ladies call their \xe2\x80\x98back-hair.\xe2\x80\x99 However the\r\nunconscious middle-aged lady came into that room, it was quite clear\r\nthat she contemplated remaining there for the night; for she had brought\r\na rushlight and shade with her, which, with praiseworthy precaution\r\nagainst fire, she had stationed in a basin on the floor, where it was\r\nglimmering away, like a gigantic lighthouse in a particularly small\r\npiece of water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98what a dreadful thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady; and in went Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s head with automaton-\r\nlike rapidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never met with anything so awful as this,\xe2\x80\x99 thought poor Mr. Pickwick,\r\nthe cold perspiration starting in drops upon his nightcap. \xe2\x80\x98Never. This\r\nis fearful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see what was\r\ngoing forward. So out went Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s head again. The prospect was\r\nworse than before. The middle-aged lady had finished arranging her hair;\r\nhad carefully enveloped it in a muslin nightcap with a small plaited\r\nborder; and was gazing pensively on the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This matter is growing alarming,\xe2\x80\x99 reasoned Mr. Pickwick with himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t allow things to go on in this way. By the self-possession of\r\nthat lady, it is clear to me that I must have come into the wrong room.\r\nIf I call out she\xe2\x80\x99ll alarm the house; but if I remain here the\r\nconsequences will be still more frightful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, it is quite unnecessary to say, was one of the most modest\r\nand delicate-minded of mortals. The very idea of exhibiting his nightcap\r\nto a lady overpowered him, but he had tied those confounded strings in a\r\nknot, and, do what he would, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it off. The disclosure must\r\nbe made. There was only one other way of doing it. He shrunk behind the\r\ncurtains, and called out very loudly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha-hum!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident, by her\r\nfalling up against the rushlight shade; that she persuaded herself it\r\nmust have been the effect of imagination was equally clear, for when Mr.\r\nPickwick, under the impression that she had fainted away stone-dead with\r\nfright, ventured to peep out again, she was gazing pensively on the fire\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most extraordinary female this,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick, popping in\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x98Ha-hum!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese last sounds, so like those in which, as legends inform us, the\r\nferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of expressing his opinion\r\nthat it was time to lay the cloth, were too distinctly audible to be\r\nagain mistaken for the workings of fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gracious Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 said the middle-aged lady, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s--only a gentleman, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, from behind\r\nthe curtains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A gentleman!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, with a terrific scream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all over!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A strange man!\xe2\x80\x99 shrieked the lady. Another instant and the house would\r\nbe alarmed. Her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting out his head in the extremity of\r\nhis desperation, \xe2\x80\x98ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by any definite object in\r\nputting out his head, it was instantaneously productive of a good\r\neffect. The lady, as we have already stated, was near the door. She must\r\npass it, to reach the staircase, and she would most undoubtedly have\r\ndone so by this time, had not the sudden apparition of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnightcap driven her back into the remotest corner of the apartment,\r\nwhere she stood staring wildly at Mr. Pickwick, while Mr. Pickwick in\r\nhis turn stared wildly at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wretch,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, covering her eyes with her hands, \xe2\x80\x98what do you\r\nwant here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; nothing whatever, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, upon my honour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, nodding his head so\r\nenergetically, that the tassel of his nightcap danced again. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nalmost ready to sink, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, beneath the confusion of addressing a lady\r\nin my nightcap (here the lady hastily snatched off hers), but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget it off, ma\xe2\x80\x99am (here Mr. Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug, in proof\r\nof the statement). It is evident to me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, now, that I have mistaken\r\nthis bedroom for my own. I had not been here five minutes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, when\r\nyou suddenly entered it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If this improbable story be really true, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, sobbing\r\nviolently, \xe2\x80\x98you will leave it instantly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, with the greatest pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Instantly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick, very quickly. \xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am. I--I--am very sorry, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, making his\r\nappearance at the bottom of the bed, \xe2\x80\x98to have been the innocent occasion\r\nof this alarm and emotion; deeply sorry, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lady pointed to the door. One excellent quality of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter was beautifully displayed at this moment, under the most\r\ntrying circumstances. Although he had hastily put on his hat over his\r\nnightcap, after the manner of the old patrol; although he carried his\r\nshoes and gaiters in his hand, and his coat and waistcoat over his arm;\r\nnothing could subdue his native politeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am exceedingly sorry, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, bowing very low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you are, Sir, you will at once leave the room,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Immediately, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; this instant, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, opening\r\nthe door, and dropping both his shoes with a crash in so doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I trust, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Pickwick, gathering up his shoes, and\r\nturning round to bow again--\xe2\x80\x98I trust, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that my unblemished\r\ncharacter, and the devoted respect I entertain for your sex, will plead\r\nas some slight excuse for this--\xe2\x80\x99 But before Mr. Pickwick could conclude\r\nthe sentence, the lady had thrust him into the passage, and locked and\r\nbolted the door behind him.\r\n\r\nWhatever grounds of self-congratulation Mr. Pickwick might have for\r\nhaving escaped so quietly from his late awkward situation, his present\r\nposition was by no means enviable. He was alone, in an open passage, in\r\na strange house in the middle of the night, half dressed; it was not to\r\nbe supposed that he could find his way in perfect darkness to a room\r\nwhich he had been wholly unable to discover with a light, and if he made\r\nthe slightest noise in his fruitless attempts to do so, he stood every\r\nchance of being shot at, and perhaps killed, by some wakeful traveller.\r\nHe had no resource but to remain where he was until daylight appeared.\r\nSo after groping his way a few paces down the passage, and, to his\r\ninfinite alarm, stumbling over several pairs of boots in so doing, Mr.\r\nPickwick crouched into a little recess in the wall, to wait for morning,\r\nas philosophically as he might.\r\n\r\nHe was not destined, however, to undergo this additional trial of\r\npatience; for he had not been long ensconced in his present concealment\r\nwhen, to his unspeakable horror, a man, bearing a light, appeared at the\r\nend of the passage. His horror was suddenly converted into joy, however,\r\nwhen he recognised the form of his faithful attendant. It was indeed Mr.\r\nSamuel Weller, who after sitting up thus late, in conversation with the\r\nboots, who was sitting up for the mail, was now about to retire to rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly appearing before him, \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbedroom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise; and it\r\nwas not until the question had been repeated three several times, that\r\nhe turned round, and led the way to the long-sought apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as he got into bed, \xe2\x80\x98I have made one of the\r\nmost extraordinary mistakes to-night, that ever were heard of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery likely, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But of this I am determined, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98that if I were\r\nto stop in this house for six months, I would never trust myself about\r\nit, alone, again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98You rayther want somebody to look arter you, Sir,\r\nwhen your judgment goes out a wisitin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. He raised himself in\r\nbed, and extended his hand, as if he were about to say something more;\r\nbut suddenly checking himself, turned round, and bade his valet \xe2\x80\x98Good-\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. He paused when he got outside the\r\ndoor--shook his head--walked on--stopped--snuffed the candle--shook his\r\nhead again--and finally proceeded slowly to his chamber, apparently\r\nburied in the profoundest meditation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. IN WHICH MR. SAMUEL WELLER BEGINS TO DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES\r\nTO THE RETURN MATCH BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MR. TROTTER\r\n\r\nIn a small room in the vicinity of the stableyard, betimes in the\r\nmorning, which was ushered in by Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s adventure with the\r\nmiddle--aged lady in the yellow curl-papers, sat Mr. Weller, senior,\r\npreparing himself for his journey to London. He was sitting in an\r\nexcellent attitude for having his portrait taken; and here it is.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that at some earlier period of his career, Mr.\r\nWeller\xe2\x80\x99s profile might have presented a bold and determined outline. His\r\nface, however, had expanded under the influence of good living, and a\r\ndisposition remarkable for resignation; and its bold, fleshy curves had\r\nso far extended beyond the limits originally assigned them, that unless\r\nyou took a full view of his countenance in front, it was difficult to\r\ndistinguish more than the extreme tip of a very rubicund nose. His chin,\r\nfrom the same cause, had acquired the grave and imposing form which is\r\ngenerally described by prefixing the word \xe2\x80\x98double\xe2\x80\x99 to that expressive\r\nfeature; and his complexion exhibited that peculiarly mottled\r\ncombination of colours which is only to be seen in gentlemen of his\r\nprofession, and in underdone roast beef. Round his neck he wore a\r\ncrimson travelling-shawl, which merged into his chin by such\r\nimperceptible gradations, that it was difficult to distinguish the folds\r\nof the one, from the folds of the other. Over this, he mounted a long\r\nwaistcoat of a broad pink-striped pattern, and over that again, a wide-\r\nskirted green coat, ornamented with large brass buttons, whereof the two\r\nwhich garnished the waist, were so far apart, that no man had ever\r\nbeheld them both at the same time. His hair, which was short, sleek, and\r\nblack, was just visible beneath the capacious brim of a low-crowned\r\nbrown hat. His legs were encased in knee-cord breeches, and painted top-\r\nboots; and a copper watch-chain, terminating in one seal, and a key of\r\nthe same material, dangled loosely from his capacious waistband.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Mr. Weller was engaged in preparing for his journey to\r\nLondon--he was taking sustenance, in fact. On the table before him,\r\nstood a pot of ale, a cold round of beef, and a very respectable-looking\r\nloaf, to each of which he distributed his favours in turn, with the most\r\nrigid impartiality. He had just cut a mighty slice from the latter, when\r\nthe footsteps of somebody entering the room, caused him to raise his\r\nhead; and he beheld his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mornin\xe2\x80\x99, Sammy!\xe2\x80\x99 said the father.\r\n\r\nThe son walked up to the pot of ale, and nodding significantly to his\r\nparent, took a long draught by way of reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good power o\xe2\x80\x99 suction, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller the elder, looking\r\ninto the pot, when his first-born had set it down half empty. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmade an uncommon fine oyster, Sammy, if you\xe2\x80\x99d been born in that station\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I des-say, I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 managed to pick up a respectable livin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Sam applying himself to the cold beef, with considerable vigour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m wery sorry, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller, shaking up the ale,\r\nby describing small circles with the pot, preparatory to drinking. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwery sorry, Sammy, to hear from your lips, as you let yourself be\r\ngammoned by that \xe2\x80\x98ere mulberry man. I always thought, up to three days\r\nago, that the names of Veller and gammon could never come into contract,\r\nSammy, never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always exceptin\xe2\x80\x99 the case of a widder, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Widders, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, slightly changing colour. \xe2\x80\x98Widders\r\nare \xe2\x80\x98ceptions to ev\xe2\x80\x99ry rule. I have heerd how many ordinary women one\r\nwidder\xe2\x80\x99s equal to in pint o\xe2\x80\x99 comin\xe2\x80\x99 over you. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s five-and-\r\ntwenty, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know vether it ain\xe2\x80\x99t more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Weller, not noticing the interruption, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na wery different thing. You know what the counsel said, Sammy, as\r\ndefended the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n as beat his wife with the poker, venever he got\r\njolly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd arter all, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a amiable weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nI says respectin\xe2\x80\x99 widders, Sammy, and so you\xe2\x80\x99ll say, ven you gets as old\r\nas me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 know\xe2\x80\x99d better, I know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 know\xe2\x80\x99d better!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Weller, striking the table\r\nwith his fist. \xe2\x80\x98Ought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 know\xe2\x80\x99d better! why, I know a young \xe2\x80\x98un as\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t had half nor quarter your eddication--as hasn\xe2\x80\x99t slept about the\r\nmarkets, no, not six months--who\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 scorned to be let in, in such a\r\nvay; scorned it, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99 In the excitement of feeling produced by this\r\nagonising reflection, Mr. Weller rang the bell, and ordered an\r\nadditional pint of ale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s no use talking about it now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s over, and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one consolation, as they always says in\r\nTurkey, ven they cuts the wrong man\xe2\x80\x99s head off. It\xe2\x80\x99s my innings now,\r\ngov\xe2\x80\x99nor, and as soon as I catches hold o\xe2\x80\x99 this \xe2\x80\x98ere Trotter, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\ngood \xe2\x80\x98un.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you will, Sammy. I hope you will,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour health, Sammy, and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ninflicted on the family name.\xe2\x80\x99 In honour of this toast Mr. Weller\r\nimbibed at a draught, at least two-thirds of a newly-arrived pint, and\r\nhanded it over to his son, to dispose of the remainder, which he\r\ninstantaneously did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, consulting a large double-faced\r\nsilver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain. \xe2\x80\x98Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time I\r\nwas up at the office to get my vay-bill and see the coach loaded; for\r\ncoaches, Sammy, is like guns--they requires to be loaded with wery great\r\ncare, afore they go off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this parental and professional joke, Mr. Weller, junior, smiled a\r\nfilial smile. His revered parent continued in a solemn tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to leave you, Samivel, my boy, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling ven I\r\nshall see you again. Your mother-in-law may ha\xe2\x80\x99 been too much for me, or\r\na thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the celebrated Mr. Veller o\xe2\x80\x99 the Bell Savage. The family name depends\r\nwery much upon you, Samivel, and I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll do wot\xe2\x80\x99s right by it.\r\nUpon all little pints o\xe2\x80\x99 breedin\xe2\x80\x99, I know I may trust you as vell as if\r\nit was my own self. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve only this here one little bit of adwice to\r\ngive you. If ever you gets to up\xe2\x80\x99ards o\xe2\x80\x99 fifty, and feels disposed to go\r\na-marryin\xe2\x80\x99 anybody--no matter who--jist you shut yourself up in your own\r\nroom, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got one, and pison yourself off hand. Hangin\xe2\x80\x99s wulgar,\r\nso don\xe2\x80\x99t you have nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to say to that. Pison yourself, Samivel, my\r\nboy, pison yourself, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad on it arterwards.\xe2\x80\x99 With these\r\naffecting words, Mr. Weller looked steadfastly on his son, and turning\r\nslowly upon his heel, disappeared from his sight.\r\n\r\nIn the contemplative mood which these words had awakened, Mr. Samuel\r\nWeller walked forth from the Great White Horse when his father had left\r\nhim; and bending his steps towards St. Clement\xe2\x80\x99s Church, endeavoured to\r\ndissipate his melancholy, by strolling among its ancient precincts. He\r\nhad loitered about, for some time, when he found himself in a retired\r\nspot--a kind of courtyard of venerable appearance--which he discovered\r\nhad no other outlet than the turning by which he had entered. He was\r\nabout retracing his steps, when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot\r\nby a sudden appearance; and the mode and manner of this appearance, we\r\nnow proceed to relate.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Weller had been staring up at the old brick houses now and\r\nthen, in his deep abstraction, bestowing a wink upon some healthy-\r\nlooking servant girl as she drew up a blind, or threw open a bedroom\r\nwindow, when the green gate of a garden at the bottom of the yard\r\nopened, and a man having emerged therefrom, closed the green gate very\r\ncarefully after him, and walked briskly towards the very spot where Mr.\r\nWeller was standing.\r\n\r\nNow, taking this, as an isolated fact, unaccompanied by any attendant\r\ncircumstances, there was nothing very extraordinary in it; because in\r\nmany parts of the world men do come out of gardens, close green gates\r\nafter them, and even walk briskly away, without attracting any\r\nparticular share of public observation. It is clear, therefore, that\r\nthere must have been something in the man, or in his manner, or both, to\r\nattract Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s particular notice. Whether there was, or not, we\r\nmust leave the reader to determine, when we have faithfully recorded the\r\nbehaviour of the individual in question.\r\n\r\nWhen the man had shut the green gate after him, he walked, as we have\r\nsaid twice already, with a brisk pace up the courtyard; but he no sooner\r\ncaught sight of Mr. Weller than he faltered, and stopped, as if\r\nuncertain, for the moment, what course to adopt. As the green gate was\r\nclosed behind him, and there was no other outlet but the one in front,\r\nhowever, he was not long in perceiving that he must pass Mr. Samuel\r\nWeller to get away. He therefore resumed his brisk pace, and advanced,\r\nstaring straight before him. The most extraordinary thing about the man\r\nwas, that he was contorting his face into the most fearful and\r\nastonishing grimaces that ever were beheld. Nature\xe2\x80\x99s handiwork never was\r\ndisguised with such extraordinary artificial carving, as the man had\r\noverlaid his countenance with in one moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller to himself, as the man approached. \xe2\x80\x98This is wery\r\nodd. I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 swore it was him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp came the man, and his face became more frightfully distorted than\r\never, as he drew nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could take my oath to that \xe2\x80\x98ere black hair and mulberry suit,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98only I never see such a face as that afore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller said this, the man\xe2\x80\x99s features assumed an unearthly twinge,\r\nperfectly hideous. He was obliged to pass very near Sam, however, and\r\nthe scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect, under\r\nall these appalling twists of feature, something too like the small eyes\r\nof Mr. Job Trotter to be easily mistaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, you Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Sam fiercely.\r\n\r\nThe stranger stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Sam, still more gruffly.\r\n\r\nThe man with the horrible face looked, with the greatest surprise, up\r\nthe court, and down the court, and in at the windows of the houses--\r\neverywhere but at Sam Weller--and took another step forward, when he was\r\nbrought to again by another shout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, you sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, for the third time.\r\n\r\nThere was no pretending to mistake where the voice came from now, so the\r\nstranger, having no other resource, at last looked Sam Weller full in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It won\xe2\x80\x99t do, Job Trotter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Come! None o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere nonsense.\r\nYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t so wery \xe2\x80\x98andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour good looks. Bring them \xe2\x80\x98ere eyes o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn back into their proper\r\nplaces, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll knock \xe2\x80\x98em out of your head. D\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller appeared fully disposed to act up to the spirit of this\r\naddress, Mr. Trotter gradually allowed his face to resume its natural\r\nexpression; and then giving a start of joy, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98What do I see?\r\nMr. Walker!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wery glad to see me, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Job Trotter; \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr. Walker, if you had but known how\r\nI have looked forward to this meeting! It is too much, Mr. Walker; I\r\ncannot bear it, indeed I cannot.\xe2\x80\x99 And with these words, Mr. Trotter\r\nburst into a regular inundation of tears, and, flinging his arms around\r\nthose of Mr. Weller, embraced him closely, in an ecstasy of joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get off!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sam, indignant at this process, and vainly endeavouring\r\nto extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get off, I tell you. What are you crying over me for, you portable\r\nengine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I am so glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job Trotter, gradually\r\nreleasing Mr. Weller, as the first symptoms of his pugnacity\r\ndisappeared. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr. Walker, this is too much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too much!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I think it is too much--rayther! Now, what have\r\nyou got to say to me, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter made no reply; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was\r\nin full force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you got to say to me, afore I knock your head off?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated\r\nMr. Weller, in a threatening manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trotter, with a look of virtuous surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you got to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, Mr. Walker!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call me Valker; my name\xe2\x80\x99s Veller; you know that vell enough. What\r\nhave you got to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless you, Mr. Walker--Weller, I mean--a great many things, if you will\r\ncome away somewhere, where we can talk comfortably. If you knew how I\r\nhave looked for you, Mr. Weller--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery hard, indeed, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very, very, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Trotter, without moving a muscle of his\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x98But shake hands, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam eyed his companion for a few seconds, and then, as if actuated by a\r\nsudden impulse, complied with his request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job Trotter, as they walked away, \xe2\x80\x98how is your dear, good\r\nmaster? Oh, he is a worthy gentleman, Mr. Weller! I hope he didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch\r\ncold, that dreadful night, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary look of deep slyness in Job Trotter\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as he\r\nsaid this, which ran a thrill through Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s clenched fist, as he\r\nburned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs. Sam\r\nconstrained himself, however, and replied that his master was extremely\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I am so glad,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Trotter; \xe2\x80\x98is he here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is yourn?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Sam, by way of reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, he is here, and I grieve to say, Mr. Weller, he is going on\r\nworse than ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, shocking--terrible!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At a boarding-school?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not at a boarding-school,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job Trotter, with the same sly\r\nlook which Sam had noticed before; \xe2\x80\x98not at a boarding-school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the house with the green gate?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, eyeing his companion\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no--oh, not there,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, with a quickness very unusual to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x98not there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was you a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 there?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Sam, with a sharp glance. \xe2\x80\x98Got\r\ninside the gate by accident, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you my little\r\nsecrets, because, you know, we took such a fancy for each other when we\r\nfirst met. You recollect how pleasant we were that morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x98I remember. Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, speaking with great precision, and in the low tone\r\nof a man who communicates an important secret; \xe2\x80\x98in that house with the\r\ngreen gate, Mr. Weller, they keep a good many servants.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I should think, from the look on it,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Trotter, \xe2\x80\x98and one of them is a cook, who has saved\r\nup a little money, Mr. Weller, and is desirous, if she can establish\r\nherself in life, to open a little shop in the chandlery way, you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr. Weller. Well, Sir, I met her at a chapel that I go to; a very\r\nneat little chapel in this town, Mr. Weller, where they sing the number\r\nfour collection of hymns, which I generally carry about with me, in a\r\nlittle book, which you may perhaps have seen in my hand--and I got a\r\nlittle intimate with her, Mr. Weller, and from that, an acquaintance\r\nsprung up between us, and I may venture to say, Mr. Weller, that I am to\r\nbe the chandler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, and a wery amiable chandler you\xe2\x80\x99ll make,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, eyeing Job\r\nwith a side look of intense dislike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The great advantage of this, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Job, his eyes\r\nfilling with tears as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x98will be, that I shall be able to leave\r\nmy present disgraceful service with that bad man, and to devote myself\r\nto a better and more virtuous life; more like the way in which I was\r\nbrought up, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must ha\xe2\x80\x99 been wery nicely brought up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, very, Mr. Weller, very,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job. At the recollection of the\r\npurity of his youthful days, Mr. Trotter pulled forth the pink\r\nhandkerchief, and wept copiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must ha\xe2\x80\x99 been an uncommon nice boy, to go to school vith,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, heaving a deep sigh; \xe2\x80\x98I was the idol of the\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at it. What a comfort you must ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nto your blessed mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt these words, Mr. Job Trotter inserted an end of the pink handkerchief\r\ninto the corner of each eye, one after the other, and began to weep\r\ncopiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x98Chelsea water-\r\nworks is nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to you. What are you melting vith now? The\r\nconsciousness o\xe2\x80\x99 willainy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot keep my feelings down, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, after a short\r\npause. \xe2\x80\x98To think that my master should have suspected the conversation I\r\nhad with yours, and so dragged me away in a post-chaise, and after\r\npersuading the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him, and\r\nbribing the school-mistress to do the same, deserted her for a better\r\nspeculation! Oh! Mr. Weller, it makes me shudder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that was the vay, was it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure it was,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, as they had now arrived near the hotel, \xe2\x80\x98I vant to\r\nhave a little bit o\xe2\x80\x99 talk with you, Job; so if you\xe2\x80\x99re not partickler\r\nengaged, I should like to see you at the Great White Horse to-night,\r\nsomewheres about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be sure to come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99d better,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, with a very meaning look, \xe2\x80\x98or else I\r\nshall perhaps be askin\xe2\x80\x99 arter you, at the other side of the green gate,\r\nand then I might cut you out, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be sure to be with you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trotter; and wringing\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s hand with the utmost fervour, he walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care, Job Trotter, take care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, looking after him, \xe2\x80\x98or I\r\nshall be one too many for you this time. I shall, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99 Having\r\nuttered this soliloquy, and looked after Job till he was to be seen no\r\nmore, Mr. Weller made the best of his way to his master\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all in training, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s in training, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve found \xe2\x80\x98em out, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Found out who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That \xe2\x80\x98ere queer customer, and the melan-cholly chap with the black\r\nhair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible, Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with the greatest energy. \xe2\x80\x98Where\r\nare they, Sam: where are they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, hush!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; and as he assisted Mr. Pickwick to\r\ndress, he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But when is this to be done, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All in good time, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\nWhether it was done in good time, or not, will be seen hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. WHEREIN MR. PETER MAGNUS GROWS JEALOUS, AND THE MIDDLE-\r\nAGED LADY APPREHENSIVE, WHICH BRINGS THE PICKWICKIANS WITHIN THE GRASP\r\nOF THE LAW\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pickwick descended to the room in which he and Mr. Peter Magnus\r\nhad spent the preceding evening, he found that gentleman with the major\r\npart of the contents of the two bags, the leathern hat-box, and the\r\nbrown-paper parcel, displaying to all possible advantage on his person,\r\nwhile he himself was pacing up and down the room in a state of the\r\nutmost excitement and agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-morning, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Peter Magnus. \xe2\x80\x98What do you think of this,\r\nSir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very effective indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, surveying the garments of\r\nMr. Peter Magnus with a good-natured smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, Sir, I have\r\nsent up my card.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the waiter brought back word, that she would see me at eleven--at\r\neleven, Sir; it only wants a quarter now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very near the time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it is rather near,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98rather too near to be\r\npleasant--eh! Mr. Pickwick, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confidence is a great thing in these cases,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe it is, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Peter Magnus. \xe2\x80\x98I am very confident,\r\nSir. Really, Mr. Pickwick, I do not see why a man should feel any fear\r\nin such a case as this, sir. What is it, Sir? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be\r\nashamed of; it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more. Husband\r\non one side, wife on the other. That\xe2\x80\x99s my view of the matter, Mr.\r\nPickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a very philosophical one,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98But breakfast\r\nis waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDown they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the\r\nboasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable\r\ndegree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset\r\nthe tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible\r\ninclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the\r\nprincipal symptoms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He-he-he,\xe2\x80\x99 tittered Mr. Magnus, affecting cheerfulness, and gasping\r\nwith agitation. \xe2\x80\x98It only wants two minutes, Mr. Pickwick. Am I pale,\r\nSir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not very,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick; but have you ever done this sort of\r\nthing in your time?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean proposing?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with great energy, \xe2\x80\x98never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have no idea, then, how it\xe2\x80\x99s best to begin?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I may have formed some ideas upon the\r\nsubject, but, as I have never submitted them to the test of experience,\r\nI should be sorry if you were induced to regulate your proceedings by\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should feel very much obliged to you, for any advice, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nMagnus, taking another look at the clock, the hand of which was verging\r\non the five minutes past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with the profound solemnity with which\r\nthat great man could, when he pleased, render his remarks so deeply\r\nimpressive. \xe2\x80\x98I should commence, sir, with a tribute to the lady\xe2\x80\x99s beauty\r\nand excellent qualities; from them, Sir, I should diverge to my own\r\nunworthiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unworthiness for _her _only, mind, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98for to\r\nshow that I was not wholly unworthy, sir, I should take a brief review\r\nof my past life, and present condition. I should argue, by analogy, that\r\nto anybody else, I must be a very desirable object. I should then\r\nexpatiate on the warmth of my love, and the depth of my devotion.\r\nPerhaps I might then be tempted to seize her hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus; \xe2\x80\x98that would be a very great point.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should then, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, growing warmer as the\r\nsubject presented itself in more glowing colours before him--\xe2\x80\x98I should\r\nthen, Sir, come to the plain and simple question, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you have me?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nthink I am justified in assuming that upon this, she would turn away her\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think that may be taken for granted?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus; \xe2\x80\x98because, if\r\nshe did not do that at the right place, it would be embarrassing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think she would,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Upon this, sir, I should\r\nsqueeze her hand, and I think--I think, Mr. Magnus--that after I had\r\ndone that, supposing there was no refusal, I should gently draw away the\r\nhandkerchief, which my slight knowledge of human nature leads me to\r\nsuppose the lady would be applying to her eyes at the moment, and steal\r\na respectful kiss. I think I should kiss her, Mr. Magnus; and at this\r\nparticular point, I am decidedly of opinion that if the lady were going\r\nto take me at all, she would murmur into my ears a bashful acceptance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Magnus started; gazed on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s intelligent face, for a\r\nshort time in silence; and then (the dial pointing to the ten minutes\r\npast) shook him warmly by the hand, and rushed desperately from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had taken a few strides to and fro; and the small hand of\r\nthe clock following the latter part of his example, had arrived at the\r\nfigure which indicates the half-hour, when the door suddenly opened. He\r\nturned round to meet Mr. Peter Magnus, and encountered, in his stead,\r\nthe joyous face of Mr. Tupman, the serene countenance of Mr. Winkle, and\r\nthe intellectual lineaments of Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick greeted them, Mr. Peter Magnus tripped into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friends, the gentleman I was speaking of--Mr. Magnus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your servant, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus, evidently in a high state of\r\nexcitement; \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, allow me to speak to you one moment, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he said this, Mr. Magnus harnessed his forefinger to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbuttonhole, and, drawing him to a window recess, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Congratulate me, Mr. Pickwick; I followed your advice to the very\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it was all correct, was it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was, Sir. Could not possibly have been better,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Magnus.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, she is mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I congratulate you, with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, warmly\r\nshaking his new friend by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must see her. Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus; \xe2\x80\x98this way, if you please.\r\nExcuse us for one instant, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99 Hurrying on in this way, Mr.\r\nPeter Magnus drew Mr. Pickwick from the room. He paused at the next door\r\nin the passage, and tapped gently thereat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in,\xe2\x80\x99 said a female voice. And in they went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Witherfield,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98allow me to introduce my very\r\nparticular friend, Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Pickwick, I beg to make you known\r\nto Miss Witherfield.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lady was at the upper end of the room. As Mr. Pickwick bowed, he\r\ntook his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket, and put them on; a\r\nprocess which he had no sooner gone through, than, uttering an\r\nexclamation of surprise, Mr. Pickwick retreated several paces, and the\r\nlady, with a half-suppressed scream, hid her face in her hands, and\r\ndropped into a chair; whereupon Mr. Peter Magnus was stricken motionless\r\non the spot, and gazed from one to the other, with a countenance\r\nexpressive of the extremities of horror and surprise.\r\n\r\nThis certainly was, to all appearance, very unaccountable behaviour; but\r\nthe fact is, that Mr. Pickwick no sooner put on his spectacles, than he\r\nat once recognised in the future Mrs. Magnus the lady into whose room he\r\nhad so unwarrantably intruded on the previous night; and the spectacles\r\nhad no sooner crossed Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s nose, than the lady at once\r\nidentified the countenance which she had seen surrounded by all the\r\nhorrors of a nightcap. So the lady screamed, and Mr. Pickwick started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Magnus, lost in astonishment, \xe2\x80\x98what is the\r\nmeaning of this, Sir? What is the meaning of it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Magnus,\r\nin a threatening, and a louder tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, somewhat indignant at the very sudden manner\r\nin which Mr. Peter Magnus had conjugated himself into the imperative\r\nmood, \xe2\x80\x98I decline answering that question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You decline it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I object to say anything which may\r\ncompromise that lady, or awaken unpleasant recollections in her breast,\r\nwithout her consent and permission.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Witherfield,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Peter Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98do you know this person?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Know him!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the middle-aged lady, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, know him, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; I said know him,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Magnus, with\r\nferocity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have seen him,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the middle-aged lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That,\xe2\x80\x99 said the middle-aged lady, rising from her seat, and averting\r\nher head--\xe2\x80\x98that I would not reveal for worlds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98and respect your\r\ndelicacy; it shall never be revealed by _me_ depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus, \xe2\x80\x98considering the situation in\r\nwhich I am placed with regard to yourself, you carry this matter off\r\nwith tolerable coolness--tolerable coolness, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cruel Mr. Magnus!\xe2\x80\x99 said the middle-aged lady; here she wept very\r\ncopiously indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Address your observations to me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nalone am to blame, if anybody be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you alone are to blame, are you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus; \xe2\x80\x98I--I--see\r\nthrough this, sir. You repent of your determination now, do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My determination!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your determination, Sir. Oh! don\xe2\x80\x99t stare at me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I recollect your words last night, Sir. You came down here, sir, to\r\nexpose the treachery and falsehood of an individual on whose truth and\r\nhonour you had placed implicit reliance--eh?\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Peter Magnus\r\nindulged in a prolonged sneer; and taking off his green spectacles--\r\nwhich he probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy--rolled his\r\nlittle eyes about, in a manner frightful to behold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Magnus; and then he repeated the sneer with increased\r\neffect. \xe2\x80\x98But you shall answer it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Answer what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Magnus, striding up and down the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of \xe2\x80\x98Never\r\nmind,\xe2\x80\x99 for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed a quarrel in the\r\nstreet, at a theatre, public room, or elsewhere, in which it has not\r\nbeen the standard reply to all belligerent inquiries. \xe2\x80\x98Do you call\r\nyourself a gentleman, sir?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDid I offer to say anything to the young woman, sir?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDo you want your head knocked up against that wall, sir?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99 It is observable, too, that there would appear to be some hidden\r\ntaunt in this universal \xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 which rouses more indignation in\r\nthe bosom of the individual addressed, than the most lavish abuse could\r\npossibly awaken.\r\n\r\nWe do not mean to assert that the application of this brevity to\r\nhimself, struck exactly that indignation to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s soul, which\r\nit would infallibly have roused in a vulgar breast. We merely record the\r\nfact that Mr. Pickwick opened the room door, and abruptly called out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tupman, come here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman immediately presented himself, with a look of very\r\nconsiderable surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tupman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98a secret of some delicacy, in which that\r\nlady is concerned, is the cause of a difference which has just arisen\r\nbetween this gentleman and myself. When I assure him, in your presence,\r\nthat it has no relation to himself, and is not in any way connected with\r\nhis affairs, I need hardly beg you to take notice that if he continue to\r\ndispute it, he expresses a doubt of my veracity, which I shall consider\r\nextremely insulting.\xe2\x80\x99 As Mr. Pickwick said this, he looked encyclopedias\r\nat Mr. Peter Magnus.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s upright and honourable bearing, coupled with that force\r\nand energy of speech which so eminently distinguished him, would have\r\ncarried conviction to any reasonable mind; but, unfortunately, at that\r\nparticular moment, the mind of Mr. Peter Magnus was in anything but\r\nreasonable order. Consequently, instead of receiving Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexplanation as he ought to have done, he forthwith proceeded to work\r\nhimself into a red-hot, scorching, consuming passion, and to talk about\r\nwhat was due to his own feelings, and all that sort of thing; adding\r\nforce to his declamation by striding to and fro, and pulling his hair--\r\namusements which he would vary occasionally, by shaking his fist in Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s philanthropic countenance.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, in his turn, conscious of his own innocence and rectitude,\r\nand irritated by having unfortunately involved the middle-aged lady in\r\nsuch an unpleasant affair, was not so quietly disposed as was his wont.\r\nThe consequence was, that words ran high, and voices higher; and at\r\nlength Mr. Magnus told Mr. Pickwick he should hear from him; to which\r\nMr. Pickwick replied, with laudable politeness, that the sooner he heard\r\nfrom him the better; whereupon the middle-aged lady rushed in terror\r\nfrom the room, out of which Mr. Tupman dragged Mr. Pickwick, leaving Mr.\r\nPeter Magnus to himself and meditation.\r\n\r\nIf the middle-aged lady had mingled much with the busy world, or had\r\nprofited at all by the manners and customs of those who make the laws\r\nand set the fashions, she would have known that this sort of ferocity is\r\nthe most harmless thing in nature; but as she had lived for the most\r\npart in the country, and never read the parliamentary debates, she was\r\nlittle versed in these particular refinements of civilised life.\r\nAccordingly, when she had gained her bedchamber, bolted herself in, and\r\nbegan to meditate on the scene she had just witnessed, the most terrific\r\npictures of slaughter and destruction presented themselves to her\r\nimagination; among which, a full-length portrait of Mr. Peter Magnus\r\nborne home by four men, with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of\r\nbullets in his left side, was among the very least. The more the middle-\r\naged lady meditated, the more terrified she became; and at length she\r\ndetermined to repair to the house of the principal magistrate of the\r\ntown, and request him to secure the persons of Mr. Pickwick and Mr.\r\nTupman without delay.\r\n\r\nTo this decision the middle-aged lady was impelled by a variety of\r\nconsiderations, the chief of which was the incontestable proof it would\r\nafford of her devotion to Mr. Peter Magnus, and her anxiety for his\r\nsafety. She was too well acquainted with his jealous temperament to\r\nventure the slightest allusion to the real cause of her agitation on\r\nbeholding Mr. Pickwick; and she trusted to her own influence and power\r\nof persuasion with the little man, to quell his boisterous jealousy,\r\nsupposing that Mr. Pickwick were removed, and no fresh quarrel could\r\narise. Filled with these reflections, the middle-aged lady arrayed\r\nherself in her bonnet and shawl, and repaired to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling\r\nstraightway.\r\n\r\nNow George Nupkins, Esquire, the principal magistrate aforesaid, was as\r\ngrand a personage as the fastest walker would find out, between sunrise\r\nand sunset, on the twenty-first of June, which being, according to the\r\nalmanacs, the longest day in the whole year, would naturally afford him\r\nthe longest period for his search. On this particular morning, Mr.\r\nNupkins was in a state of the utmost excitement and irritation, for\r\nthere had been a rebellion in the town; all the day-scholars at the\r\nlargest day-school had conspired to break the windows of an obnoxious\r\napple-seller, and had hooted the beadle and pelted the constabulary--an\r\nelderly gentleman in top-boots, who had been called out to repress the\r\ntumult, and who had been a peace-officer, man and boy, for half a\r\ncentury at least. And Mr. Nupkins was sitting in his easy-chair,\r\nfrowning with majesty, and boiling with rage, when a lady was announced\r\non pressing, private, and particular business. Mr. Nupkins looked calmly\r\nterrible, and commanded that the lady should be shown in; which command,\r\nlike all the mandates of emperors, and magistrates, and other great\r\npotentates of the earth, was forthwith obeyed; and Miss Witherfield,\r\ninterestingly agitated, was ushered in accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Muzzle!\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\nMuzzle was an undersized footman, with a long body and short legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Muzzle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Place a chair, and leave the room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, will you state your business?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is of a very painful kind, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Witherfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very likely, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98Compose your feelings,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Nupkins looked benignant. \xe2\x80\x98And then tell me what legal\r\nbusiness brings you here, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the magistrate triumphed over the\r\nman; and he looked stern again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very distressing to me, Sir, to give this information,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nWitherfield, \xe2\x80\x98but I fear a duel is going to be fought here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98Where, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In Ipswich.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn Ipswich, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! A duel in Ipswich!\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, perfectly\r\naghast at the notion. \xe2\x80\x98Impossible, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; nothing of the kind can be\r\ncontemplated in this town, I am persuaded. Bless my soul, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, are you\r\naware of the activity of our local magistracy? Do you happen to have\r\nheard, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that I rushed into a prize-ring on the fourth of May last,\r\nattended by only sixty special constables; and, at the hazard of falling\r\na sacrifice to the angry passions of an infuriated multitude, prohibited\r\na pugilistic contest between the Middlesex Dumpling and the Suffolk\r\nBantam? A duel in Ipswich, ma\xe2\x80\x99am? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think--I do not think,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe magistrate, reasoning with himself, \xe2\x80\x98that any two men can have had\r\nthe hardihood to plan such a breach of the peace, in this town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My information is, unfortunately, but too correct,\xe2\x80\x99 said the middle-\r\naged lady; \xe2\x80\x98I was present at the quarrel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a most extraordinary thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the astounded magistrate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Muzzle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Send Mr. Jinks here, directly! Instantly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMuzzle retired; and a pale, sharp-nosed, half-fed, shabbily-clad clerk,\r\nof middle age, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jinks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This lady, Mr. Jinks, has come here, to give information of an intended\r\nduel in this town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jinks, not knowing exactly what to do, smiled a dependent\xe2\x80\x99s smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you laughing at, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\nMr. Jinks looked serious instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a fool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jinks looked humbly at the great man, and bit the top of his pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may see something very comical in this information, Sir--but I can\r\ntell you this, Mr. Jinks, that you have very little to laugh at,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe hungry-looking Jinks sighed, as if he were quite aware of the fact\r\nof his having very little indeed to be merry about; and, being ordered\r\nto take the lady\xe2\x80\x99s information, shambled to a seat, and proceeded to\r\nwrite it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This man, Pickwick, is the principal, I understand?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nmagistrate, when the statement was finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the middle-aged lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the other rioter--what\xe2\x80\x99s his name, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tupman, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTupman is the second?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The other principal, you say, has absconded, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Witherfield, with a short cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98These are two cut-throats from\r\nLondon, who have come down here to destroy his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s population,\r\nthinking that at this distance from the capital, the arm of the law is\r\nweak and paralysed. They shall be made an example of. Draw up the\r\nwarrants, Mr. Jinks. Muzzle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Grummer downstairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Send him up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe obsequious Muzzle retired, and presently returned, introducing the\r\nelderly gentleman in the top-boots, who was chiefly remarkable for a\r\nbottle-nose, a hoarse voice, a snuff-coloured surtout, and a wandering\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grummer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your Wash-up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the town quiet now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty well, your Wash-up,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Grummer. \xe2\x80\x98Pop\xe2\x80\x99lar feeling has in a\r\nmeasure subsided, consekens o\xe2\x80\x99 the boys having dispersed to cricket.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing but vigorous measures will do in these times, Grummer,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe magistrate, in a determined manner. \xe2\x80\x98If the authority of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nofficers is set at naught, we must have the riot act read. If the civil\r\npower cannot protect these windows, Grummer, the military must protect\r\nthe civil power, and the windows too. I believe that is a maxim of the\r\nconstitution, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCertainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, signing the warrants. \xe2\x80\x98Grummer, you\r\nwill bring these persons before me, this afternoon. You will find them\r\nat the Great White Horse. You recollect the case of the Middlesex\r\nDumpling and the Suffolk Bantam, Grummer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Grummer intimated, by a retrospective shake of the head, that he\r\nshould never forget it--as indeed it was not likely he would, so long as\r\nit continued to be cited daily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is even more unconstitutional,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate; \xe2\x80\x98this is even\r\na greater breach of the peace, and a grosser infringement of his\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative. I believe duelling is one of his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\nundoubted prerogatives, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Expressly stipulated in Magna Charta, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of the brightest jewels in the British crown, wrung from his\r\nMajesty by the barons, I believe, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, drawing himself up proudly, \xe2\x80\x98it shall\r\nnot be violated in this portion of his dominions. Grummer, procure\r\nassistance, and execute these warrants with as little delay as possible.\r\nMuzzle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show the lady out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Witherfield retired, deeply impressed with the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlearning and research; Mr. Nupkins retired to lunch; Mr. Jinks retired\r\nwithin himself--that being the only retirement he had, except the sofa-\r\nbedstead in the small parlour which was occupied by his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily in the daytime--and Mr. Grummer retired, to wipe out, by his mode\r\nof discharging his present commission, the insult which had been\r\nfastened upon himself, and the other representative of his Majesty--the\r\nbeadle--in the course of the morning.\r\n\r\nWhile these resolute and determined preparations for the conservation of\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s peace were pending, Mr. Pickwick and his friends, wholly\r\nunconscious of the mighty events in progress, had sat quietly down to\r\ndinner; and very talkative and companionable they all were. Mr. Pickwick\r\nwas in the very act of relating his adventure of the preceding night, to\r\nthe great amusement of his followers, Mr. Tupman especially, when the\r\ndoor opened, and a somewhat forbidding countenance peeped into the room.\r\nThe eyes in the forbidding countenance looked very earnestly at Mr.\r\nPickwick, for several seconds, and were to all appearance satisfied with\r\ntheir investigation; for the body to which the forbidding countenance\r\nbelonged, slowly brought itself into the apartment, and presented the\r\nform of an elderly individual in top-boots--not to keep the reader any\r\nlonger in suspense, in short, the eyes were the wandering eyes of Mr.\r\nGrummer, and the body was the body of the same gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Grummer\xe2\x80\x99s mode of proceeding was professional, but peculiar. His\r\nfirst act was to bolt the door on the inside; his second, to polish his\r\nhead and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief; his\r\nthird, to place his hat, with the cotton handkerchief in it, on the\r\nnearest chair; and his fourth, to produce from the breast-pocket of his\r\ncoat a short truncheon, surmounted by a brazen crown, with which he\r\nbeckoned to Mr. Pickwick with a grave and ghost-like air.\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence. He looked\r\nsteadily at Mr. Grummer for a brief space, and then said emphatically,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a private room, Sir. A private room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Grummer shook his head, and replied, \xe2\x80\x98No room\xe2\x80\x99s private to his\r\nMajesty when the street door\xe2\x80\x99s once passed. That\xe2\x80\x99s law. Some people\r\nmaintains that an Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s house is his castle. That\xe2\x80\x99s gammon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Pickwickians gazed on each other with wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which is Mr. Tupman?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Grummer. He had an intuitive\r\nperception of Mr. Pickwick; he knew him at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name\xe2\x80\x99s Tupman,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name\xe2\x80\x99s Law,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Grummer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Law,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Grummer--\xe2\x80\x98Law, civil power, and exekative; them\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\ntitles; here\xe2\x80\x99s my authority. Blank Tupman, blank Pickwick--against the\r\npeace of our sufferin\xe2\x80\x99 lord the king--stattit in the case made and\r\npurwided--and all regular. I apprehend you Pickwick! Tupman--the\r\naforesaid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by this insolence?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, starting up;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98leave the room!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Grummer, retreating very expeditiously to the door,\r\nand opening it an inch or two, \xe2\x80\x98Dubbley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said a deep voice from the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come for\xe2\x80\x99ard, Dubbley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the word of command, a dirty-faced man, something over six feet high,\r\nand stout in proportion, squeezed himself through the half-open door\r\n(making his face very red in the process), and entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the other specials outside, Dubbley?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Grummer.\r\n\r\nMr. Dubbley, who was a man of few words, nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Order in the diwision under your charge, Dubbley,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Grummer.\r\n\r\nMr. Dubbley did as he was desired; and half a dozen men, each with a\r\nshort truncheon and a brass crown, flocked into the room. Mr. Grummer\r\npocketed his staff, and looked at Mr. Dubbley; Mr. Dubbley pocketed his\r\nstaff and looked at the division; the division pocketed their staves and\r\nlooked at Messrs. Tupman and Pickwick.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick and his followers rose as one man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the meaning of this atrocious intrusion upon my privacy?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who dares apprehend me?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want here, scoundrels?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle said nothing, but he fixed his eyes on Grummer, and bestowed\r\na look upon him, which, if he had had any feeling, must have pierced his\r\nbrain. As it was, however, it had no visible effect on him whatever.\r\n\r\nWhen the executive perceived that Mr. Pickwick and his friends were\r\ndisposed to resist the authority of the law, they very significantly\r\nturned up their coat sleeves, as if knocking them down in the first\r\ninstance, and taking them up afterwards, were a mere professional act\r\nwhich had only to be thought of to be done, as a matter of course. This\r\ndemonstration was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He conferred a few moments\r\nwith Mr. Tupman apart, and then signified his readiness to proceed to\r\nthe mayor\xe2\x80\x99s residence, merely begging the parties then and there\r\nassembled, to take notice, that it was his firm intention to resent this\r\nmonstrous invasion of his privileges as an Englishman, the instant he\r\nwas at liberty; whereat the parties then and there assembled laughed\r\nvery heartily, with the single exception of Mr. Grummer, who seemed to\r\nconsider that any slight cast upon the divine right of magistrates was a\r\nspecies of blasphemy not to be tolerated.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Pickwick had signified his readiness to bow to the laws of\r\nhis country, and just when the waiters, and hostlers, and chambermaids,\r\nand post-boys, who had anticipated a delightful commotion from his\r\nthreatened obstinacy, began to turn away, disappointed and disgusted, a\r\ndifficulty arose which had not been foreseen. With every sentiment of\r\nveneration for the constituted authorities, Mr. Pickwick resolutely\r\nprotested against making his appearance in the public streets,\r\nsurrounded and guarded by the officers of justice, like a common\r\ncriminal. Mr. Grummer, in the then disturbed state of public feeling\r\n(for it was half-holiday, and the boys had not yet gone home), as\r\nresolutely protested against walking on the opposite side of the way,\r\nand taking Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s parole that he would go straight to the\r\nmagistrate\xe2\x80\x99s; and both Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman as strenuously\r\nobjected to the expense of a post-coach, which was the only respectable\r\nconveyance that could be obtained. The dispute ran high, and the dilemma\r\nlasted long; and just as the executive were on the point of overcoming\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s objection to walking to the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s, by the trite\r\nexpedient of carrying him thither, it was recollected that there stood\r\nin the inn yard, an old sedan-chair, which, having been originally built\r\nfor a gouty gentleman with funded property, would hold Mr. Pickwick and\r\nMr. Tupman, at least as conveniently as a modern post-chaise. The chair\r\nwas hired, and brought into the hall; Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman\r\nsqueezed themselves inside, and pulled down the blinds; a couple of\r\nchairmen were speedily found; and the procession started in grand order.\r\nThe specials surrounded the body of the vehicle; Mr. Grummer and Mr.\r\nDubbley marched triumphantly in front; Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle\r\nwalked arm-in-arm behind; and the unsoaped of Ipswich brought up the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThe shopkeepers of the town, although they had a very indistinct notion\r\nof the nature of the offence, could not but be much edified and\r\ngratified by this spectacle. Here was the strong arm of the law, coming\r\ndown with twenty gold-beater force, upon two offenders from the\r\nmetropolis itself; the mighty engine was directed by their own\r\nmagistrate, and worked by their own officers; and both the criminals, by\r\ntheir united efforts, were securely shut up, in the narrow compass of\r\none sedan-chair. Many were the expressions of approval and admiration\r\nwhich greeted Mr. Grummer, as he headed the cavalcade, staff in hand;\r\nloud and long were the shouts raised by the unsoaped; and amidst these\r\nunited testimonials of public approbation, the procession moved slowly\r\nand majestically along.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller, habited in his morning jacket, with the black calico\r\nsleeves, was returning in a rather desponding state from an unsuccessful\r\nsurvey of the mysterious house with the green gate, when, raising his\r\neyes, he beheld a crowd pouring down the street, surrounding an object\r\nwhich had very much the appearance of a sedan-chair. Willing to divert\r\nhis thoughts from the failure of his enterprise, he stepped aside to see\r\nthe crowd pass; and finding that they were cheering away, very much to\r\ntheir own satisfaction, forthwith began (by way of raising his spirits)\r\nto cheer too, with all his might and main.\r\n\r\nMr. Grummer passed, and Mr. Dubbley passed, and the sedan passed, and\r\nthe bodyguard of specials passed, and Sam was still responding to the\r\nenthusiastic cheers of the mob, and waving his hat about as if he were\r\nin the very last extreme of the wildest joy (though, of course, he had\r\nnot the faintest idea of the matter in hand), when he was suddenly\r\nstopped by the unexpected appearance of Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the row, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n? \xe2\x80\x99cried Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Who have they got in this here\r\nwatch-box in mournin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoth gentlemen replied together, but their words were lost in the\r\ntumult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is it?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sam again.\r\n\r\nOnce more was a joint reply returned; and, though the words were\r\ninaudible, Sam saw by the motion of the two pairs of lips that they had\r\nuttered the magic word \xe2\x80\x98Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was enough. In another minute Mr. Weller had made his way through\r\nthe crowd, stopped the chairmen, and confronted the portly Grummer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Who have you got in this here\r\nconweyance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stand back,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Grummer, whose dignity, like the dignity of a\r\ngreat many other men, had been wondrously augmented by a little\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Knock him down, if he don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dubbley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m wery much obliged to you, old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98for\r\nconsulting my conwenience, and I\xe2\x80\x99m still more obliged to the other\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, who looks as if he\xe2\x80\x99d just escaped from a giant\xe2\x80\x99s carrywan,\r\nfor his wery \xe2\x80\x98andsome suggestion; but I should prefer your givin\xe2\x80\x99 me a\r\nanswer to my question, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to you.--How are you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThis last observation was addressed with a patronising air to Mr.\r\nPickwick, who was peeping through the front window.\r\n\r\nMr. Grummer, perfectly speechless with indignation, dragged the\r\ntruncheon with the brass crown from its particular pocket, and\r\nflourished it before Sam\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s wery pretty, \xe2\x80\x98specially the crown, which is\r\nuncommon like the real one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stand back!\xe2\x80\x99 said the outraged Mr. Grummer. By way of adding force to\r\nthe command, he thrust the brass emblem of royalty into Sam\xe2\x80\x99s neckcloth\r\nwith one hand, and seized Sam\xe2\x80\x99s collar with the other--a compliment\r\nwhich Mr. Weller returned by knocking him down out of hand, having\r\npreviously with the utmost consideration, knocked down a chairman for\r\nhim to lie upon.\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Winkle was seized with a temporary attack of that species of\r\ninsanity which originates in a sense of injury, or animated by this\r\ndisplay of Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s valour, is uncertain; but certain it is, that he\r\nno sooner saw Mr. Grummer fall than he made a terrific onslaught on a\r\nsmall boy who stood next him; whereupon Mr. Snodgrass, in a truly\r\nChristian spirit, and in order that he might take no one unawares,\r\nannounced in a very loud tone that he was going to begin, and proceeded\r\nto take off his coat with the utmost deliberation. He was immediately\r\nsurrounded and secured; and it is but common justice both to him and Mr.\r\nWinkle to say, that they did not make the slightest attempt to rescue\r\neither themselves or Mr. Weller; who, after a most vigorous resistance,\r\nwas overpowered by numbers and taken prisoner. The procession then\r\nreformed; the chairmen resumed their stations; and the march was re-\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s indignation during the whole of this proceeding was\r\nbeyond all bounds. He could just see Sam upsetting the specials, and\r\nflying about in every direction; and that was all he could see, for the\r\nsedan doors wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t open, and the blinds wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pull up. At length,\r\nwith the assistance of Mr. Tupman, he managed to push open the roof; and\r\nmounting on the seat, and steadying himself as well as he could, by\r\nplacing his hand on that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, Mr. Pickwick proceeded to\r\naddress the multitude; to dwell upon the unjustifiable manner in which\r\nhe had been treated; and to call upon them to take notice that his\r\nservant had been first assaulted. In this order they reached the\r\nmagistrate\xe2\x80\x99s house; the chairmen trotting, the prisoners following, Mr.\r\nPickwick oratorising, and the crowd shouting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. SHOWING, AMONG A VARIETY OF PLEASANT MATTERS, HOW MAJESTIC\r\nAND IMPARTIAL MR. NUPKINS WAS; AND HOW MR. WELLER RETURNED MR. JOB\r\nTROTTER\xe2\x80\x99S SHUTTLECOCK AS HEAVILY AS IT CAME--WITH ANOTHER MATTER, WHICH\r\nWILL BE FOUND IN ITS PLACE\r\n\r\nViolent was Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s indignation as he was borne along; numerous\r\nwere the allusions to the personal appearance and demeanour of Mr.\r\nGrummer and his companion; and valorous were the defiances to any six of\r\nthe gentlemen present, in which he vented his dissatisfaction. Mr.\r\nSnodgrass and Mr. Winkle listened with gloomy respect to the torrent of\r\neloquence which their leader poured forth from the sedan-chair, and the\r\nrapid course of which not all Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s earnest entreaties to have\r\nthe lid of the vehicle closed, were able to check for an instant. But\r\nMr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s anger quickly gave way to curiosity when the procession\r\nturned down the identical courtyard in which he had met with the runaway\r\nJob Trotter; and curiosity was exchanged for a feeling of the most\r\ngleeful astonishment, when the all-important Mr. Grummer, commanding the\r\nsedan-bearers to halt, advanced with dignified and portentous steps to\r\nthe very green gate from which Job Trotter had emerged, and gave a\r\nmighty pull at the bell-handle which hung at the side thereof. The ring\r\nwas answered by a very smart and pretty-faced servant-girl, who, after\r\nholding up her hands in astonishment at the rebellious appearance of the\r\nprisoners, and the impassioned language of Mr. Pickwick, summoned Mr.\r\nMuzzle. Mr. Muzzle opened one half of the carriage gate, to admit the\r\nsedan, the captured ones, and the specials; and immediately slammed it\r\nin the faces of the mob, who, indignant at being excluded, and anxious\r\nto see what followed, relieved their feelings by kicking at the gate and\r\nringing the bell, for an hour or two afterwards. In this amusement they\r\nall took part by turns, except three or four fortunate individuals, who,\r\nhaving discovered a grating in the gate, which commanded a view of\r\nnothing, stared through it with the indefatigable perseverance with\r\nwhich people will flatten their noses against the front windows of a\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop, when a drunken man, who has been run over by a dog-cart\r\nin the street, is undergoing a surgical inspection in the back-parlour.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of a flight of steps, leading to the house door, which was\r\nguarded on either side by an American aloe in a green tub, the sedan-\r\nchair stopped. Mr. Pickwick and his friends were conducted into the\r\nhall, whence, having been previously announced by Muzzle, and ordered in\r\nby Mr. Nupkins, they were ushered into the worshipful presence of that\r\npublic-spirited officer.\r\n\r\nThe scene was an impressive one, well calculated to strike terror to the\r\nhearts of culprits, and to impress them with an adequate idea of the\r\nstern majesty of the law. In front of a big book-case, in a big chair,\r\nbehind a big table, and before a big volume, sat Mr. Nupkins, looking a\r\nfull size larger than any one of them, big as they were. The table was\r\nadorned with piles of papers; and above the farther end of it, appeared\r\nthe head and shoulders of Mr. Jinks, who was busily engaged in looking\r\nas busy as possible. The party having all entered, Muzzle carefully\r\nclosed the door, and placed himself behind his master\xe2\x80\x99s chair to await\r\nhis orders. Mr. Nupkins threw himself back with thrilling solemnity, and\r\nscrutinised the faces of his unwilling visitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Grummer, who is that person?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, pointing to Mr.\r\nPickwick, who, as the spokesman of his friends, stood hat in hand,\r\nbowing with the utmost politeness and respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This here\xe2\x80\x99s Pickvick, your Wash-up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Grummer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, none o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere, old Strike-a-light,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller,\r\nelbowing himself into the front rank. \xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir, but this\r\nhere officer o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn in the gambooge tops, \xe2\x80\x98ull never earn a decent\r\nlivin\xe2\x80\x99 as a master o\xe2\x80\x99 the ceremonies any vere. This here, sir\xe2\x80\x99 continued\r\nMr. Weller, thrusting Grummer aside, and addressing the magistrate with\r\npleasant familiarity, \xe2\x80\x98this here is S. Pickvick, Esquire; this here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMr. Tupman; that \xe2\x80\x98ere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Snodgrass; and farder on, next him on the\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other side, Mr. Winkle--all wery nice gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, Sir, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nwery happy to have the acquaintance on; so the sooner you commits these\r\nhere officers o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn to the tread-mill for a month or two, the sooner\r\nwe shall begin to be on a pleasant understanding. Business first,\r\npleasure arterwards, as King Richard the Third said when he stabbed the\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other king in the Tower, afore he smothered the babbies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this address, Mr. Weller brushed his hat with his\r\nright elbow, and nodded benignly to Jinks, who had heard him throughout\r\nwith unspeakable awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is this man, Grummer?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery desp\xe2\x80\x99rate ch\xe2\x80\x99racter, your Wash-up,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Grummer. \xe2\x80\x98He attempted\r\nto rescue the prisoners, and assaulted the officers; so we took him into\r\ncustody, and brought him here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did quite right,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98He is evidently a\r\ndesperate ruffian.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is my servant, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! he is your servant, is he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins. \xe2\x80\x98A conspiracy to\r\ndefeat the ends of justice, and murder its officers. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s servant.\r\nPut that down, Mr. Jinks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jinks did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s your name, fellow?\xe2\x80\x99 thundered Mr. Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Veller,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very good name for the Newgate Calendar,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins.\r\n\r\nThis was a joke; so Jinks, Grummer, Dubbley, all the specials, and\r\nMuzzle, went into fits of laughter of five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 duration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put down his name, Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two L\xe2\x80\x99s, old feller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nHere an unfortunate special laughed again, whereupon the magistrate\r\nthreatened to commit him instantly. It is a dangerous thing to laugh at\r\nthe wrong man, in these cases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where do you live?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vere ever I can,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put down that, Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, who was fast rising\r\ninto a rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Score it under,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a vagabond, Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98He is a vagabond on\r\nhis own statement,--is he not, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll commit him--I\xe2\x80\x99ll commit him as such,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a wery impartial country for justice, \xe2\x80\x98said Sam.\xe2\x80\x99 There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nmagistrate goin\xe2\x80\x99 as don\xe2\x80\x99t commit himself twice as he commits other\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this sally another special laughed, and then tried to look so\r\nsupernaturally solemn, that the magistrate detected him immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grummer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, reddening with passion, \xe2\x80\x98how dare you\r\nselect such an inefficient and disreputable person for a special\r\nconstable, as that man? How dare you do it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry, your Wash-up,\xe2\x80\x99 stammered Grummer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very sorry!\xe2\x80\x99 said the furious magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98You shall repent of this\r\nneglect of duty, Mr. Grummer; you shall be made an example of. Take that\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s staff away. He\xe2\x80\x99s drunk. You\xe2\x80\x99re drunk, fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not drunk, your Worship,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You _are _drunk,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98How dare you say you are\r\nnot drunk, Sir, when I say you are? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he smell of spirits,\r\nGrummer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Horrid, your Wash-up,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Grummer, who had a vague impression that\r\nthere was a smell of rum somewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew he did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins. \xe2\x80\x98I saw he was drunk when he first\r\ncame into the room, by his excited eye. Did you observe his excited eye,\r\nMr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t touched a drop of spirits this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, who\r\nwas as sober a fellow as need be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dare you tell me a falsehood?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins. \xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he drunk at\r\nthis moment, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98I shall commit that man for contempt.\r\nMake out his committal, Mr. Jinks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd committed the special would have been, only Jinks, who was the\r\nmagistrate\xe2\x80\x99s adviser (having had a legal education of three years in a\r\ncountry attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office), whispered the magistrate that he thought it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do; so the magistrate made a speech, and said, that in\r\nconsideration of the special\xe2\x80\x99s family, he would merely reprimand and\r\ndischarge him. Accordingly, the special was abused, vehemently, for a\r\nquarter of an hour, and sent about his business; and Grummer, Dubbley,\r\nMuzzle, and all the other specials, murmured their admiration of the\r\nmagnanimity of Mr. Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98swear Grummer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGrummer was sworn directly; but as Grummer wandered, and Mr. Nupkins\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndinner was nearly ready, Mr. Nupkins cut the matter short, by putting\r\nleading questions to Grummer, which Grummer answered as nearly in the\r\naffirmative as he could. So the examination went off, all very smooth\r\nand comfortable, and two assaults were proved against Mr. Weller, and a\r\nthreat against Mr. Winkle, and a push against Mr. Snodgrass. When all\r\nthis was done to the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction, the magistrate and Mr.\r\nJinks consulted in whispers.\r\n\r\nThe consultation having lasted about ten minutes, Mr. Jinks retired to\r\nhis end of the table; and the magistrate, with a preparatory cough, drew\r\nhimself up in his chair, and was proceeding to commence his address,\r\nwhen Mr. Pickwick interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir, for interrupting you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nbefore you proceed to express, and act upon, any opinion you may have\r\nformed on the statements which have been made here, I must claim my\r\nright to be heard so far as I am personally concerned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must submit to you, Sir--\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98or I shall order an\r\nofficer to remove you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may order your officers to do whatever you please, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick; \xe2\x80\x98and I have no doubt, from the specimen I have had of the\r\nsubordination preserved amongst them, that whatever you order, they will\r\nexecute, Sir; but I shall take the liberty, Sir, of claiming my right to\r\nbe heard, until I am removed by force.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickvick and principle!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller, in a very audible voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam, be quiet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dumb as a drum vith a hole in it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Nupkins looked at Mr. Pickwick with a gaze of intense astonishment,\r\nat his displaying such unwonted temerity; and was apparently about to\r\nreturn a very angry reply, when Mr. Jinks pulled him by the sleeve, and\r\nwhispered something in his ear. To this, the magistrate returned a half-\r\naudible answer, and then the whispering was renewed. Jinks was evidently\r\nremonstrating.\r\n\r\nAt length the magistrate, gulping down, with a very bad grace, his\r\ndisinclination to hear anything more, turned to Mr. Pickwick, and said\r\nsharply, \xe2\x80\x98What do you want to say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, sending a look through his spectacles, under\r\nwhich even Nupkins quailed, \xe2\x80\x98first, I wish to know what I and my friend\r\nhave been brought here for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Must I tell him?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the magistrate to Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you had better, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Jinks to the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An information has been sworn before me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98that it\r\nis apprehended you are going to fight a duel, and that the other man,\r\nTupman, is your aider and abettor in it. Therefore--eh, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Therefore, I call upon you both, to--I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the course, Mr.\r\nJinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To--to--what, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate pettishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To find bail, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Therefore, I call upon you both--as I was about to say when I was\r\ninterrupted by my clerk--to find bail.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGood bail,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall require good bail,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Town\xe2\x80\x99s-people,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They must be townspeople,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fifty pounds each,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Jinks, \xe2\x80\x98and householders, of course.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall require two sureties of fifty pounds each,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate\r\naloud, with great dignity, \xe2\x80\x98and they must be householders, of course.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But bless my heart, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, who, together with Mr.\r\nTupman, was all amazement and indignation; \xe2\x80\x98we are perfect strangers in\r\nthis town. I have as little knowledge of any householders here, as I\r\nhave intention of fighting a duel with anybody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98I dare say--don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr.\r\nJinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you anything more to say?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the magistrate.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had a great deal more to say, which he would no doubt have\r\nsaid, very little to his own advantage, or the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsatisfaction, if he had not, the moment he ceased speaking, been pulled\r\nby the sleeve by Mr. Weller, with whom he was immediately engaged in so\r\nearnest a conversation, that he suffered the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry to\r\npass wholly unnoticed. Mr. Nupkins was not the man to ask a question of\r\nthe kind twice over; and so, with another preparatory cough, he\r\nproceeded, amidst the reverential and admiring silence of the\r\nconstables, to pronounce his decision.\r\n\r\nHe should fine Weller two pounds for the first assault, and three pounds\r\nfor the second. He should fine Winkle two pounds, and Snodgrass one\r\npound, besides requiring them to enter into their own recognisances to\r\nkeep the peace towards all his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s subjects, and especially\r\ntowards his liege servant, Daniel Grummer. Pickwick and Tupman he had\r\nalready held to bail.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the magistrate ceasing to speak, Mr. Pickwick, with a\r\nsmile mantling on his again good-humoured countenance, stepped forward,\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, but may I request a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 private\r\nconversation with him, on a matter of deep importance to himself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. Mr. Pickwick repeated his request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a most extraordinary request,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98A private\r\ninterview?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A private interview,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick firmly; \xe2\x80\x98only, as a part of\r\nthe information which I wish to communicate is derived from my servant,\r\nI should wish him to be present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe magistrate looked at Mr. Jinks; Mr. Jinks looked at the magistrate;\r\nthe officers looked at each other in amazement. Mr. Nupkins turned\r\nsuddenly pale. Could the man Weller, in a moment of remorse, have\r\ndivulged some secret conspiracy for his assassination? It was a dreadful\r\nthought. He was a public man; and he turned paler, as he thought of\r\nJulius Caesar and Mr. Perceval.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate looked at Mr. Pickwick again, and beckoned Mr. Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think of this request, Mr. Jinks?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mr. Nupkins.\r\n\r\nMr. Jinks, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what to think of it, and was afraid\r\nhe might offend, smiled feebly, after a dubious fashion, and, screwing\r\nup the corners of his mouth, shook his head slowly from side to side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jinks,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate gravely, \xe2\x80\x98you are an ass.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this little expression of opinion, Mr. Jinks smiled again--rather\r\nmore feebly than before--and edged himself, by degrees, back into his\r\nown corner.\r\n\r\nMr. Nupkins debated the matter within himself for a few seconds, and\r\nthen, rising from his chair, and requesting Mr. Pickwick and Sam to\r\nfollow him, led the way into a small room which opened into the justice-\r\nparlour. Desiring Mr. Pickwick to walk to the upper end of the little\r\napartment, and holding his hand upon the half-closed door, that he might\r\nbe able to effect an immediate escape, in case there was the least\r\ntendency to a display of hostilities, Mr. Nupkins expressed his\r\nreadiness to hear the communication, whatever it might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will come to the point at once, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98it affects\r\nyourself and your credit materially. I have every reason to believe,\r\nSir, that you are harbouring in your house a gross impostor!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Mulberry agin all natur, for tears and\r\nwillainny!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98if I am to render myself intelligible to this\r\ngentleman, I must beg you to control your feelings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery sorry, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98but when I think o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere\r\nJob, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help opening the walve a inch or two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In one word, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98is my servant right in\r\nsuspecting that a certain Captain Fitz-Marshall is in the habit of\r\nvisiting here? Because,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick, as he saw that Mr. Nupkins\r\nwas about to offer a very indignant interruption, \xe2\x80\x98because if he be, I\r\nknow that person to be a--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, hush,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, closing the door. \xe2\x80\x98Know him to be what,\r\nSir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An unprincipled adventurer--a dishonourable character--a man who preys\r\nupon society, and makes easily-deceived people his dupes, Sir; his\r\nabsurd, his foolish, his wretched dupes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the excited Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, turning very red, and altering his whole\r\nmanner directly. \xe2\x80\x98Dear me, Mr.--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickvick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98dear me, Mr. Pickwick--pray take a\r\nseat--you cannot mean this? Captain Fitz-Marshall!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call him a cap\xe2\x80\x99en,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98nor Fitz-Marshall neither; he\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t neither one nor t\xe2\x80\x99other. He\xe2\x80\x99s a strolling actor, he is, and his\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s Jingle; and if ever there was a wolf in a mulberry suit, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ere Job Trotter\xe2\x80\x99s him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very true, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, replying to the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlook of amazement; \xe2\x80\x98my only business in this town, is to expose the\r\nperson of whom we now speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick proceeded to pour into the horror-stricken ear of Mr.\r\nNupkins, an abridged account of all Mr. Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s atrocities. He related\r\nhow he had first met him; how he had eloped with Miss Wardle; how he had\r\ncheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniary consideration; how he had\r\nentrapped himself into a lady\xe2\x80\x99s boarding-school at midnight; and how he\r\n(Mr. Pickwick) now felt it his duty to expose his assumption of his\r\npresent name and rank.\r\n\r\nAs the narrative proceeded, all the warm blood in the body of Mr.\r\nNupkins tingled up into the very tips of his ears. He had picked up the\r\ncaptain at a neighbouring race-course. Charmed with his long list of\r\naristocratic acquaintance, his extensive travel, and his fashionable\r\ndemeanour, Mrs. Nupkins and Miss Nupkins had exhibited Captain Fitz-\r\nMarshall, and quoted Captain Fitz-Marshall, and hurled Captain Fitz-\r\nMarshall at the devoted heads of their select circle of acquaintance,\r\nuntil their bosom friends, Mrs. Porkenham and the Misses Porkenhams, and\r\nMr. Sidney Porkenham, were ready to burst with jealousy and despair. And\r\nnow, to hear, after all, that he was a needy adventurer, a strolling\r\nplayer, and if not a swindler, something so very like it, that it was\r\nhard to tell the difference! Heavens! what would the Porkenhams say!\r\nWhat would be the triumph of Mr. Sidney Porkenham when he found that his\r\naddresses had been slighted for such a rival! How should he, Nupkins,\r\nmeet the eye of old Porkenham at the next quarter-sessions! And what a\r\nhandle would it be for the opposition magisterial party if the story got\r\nabroad!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But after all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, brightening for a moment, after a\r\nlong pause; \xe2\x80\x98after all, this is a mere statement. Captain Fitz-Marshall\r\nis a man of very engaging manners, and, I dare say, has many enemies.\r\nWhat proof have you of the truth of these representations?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confront me with him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that is all I ask, and all I\r\nrequire. Confront him with me and my friends here; you will want no\r\nfurther proof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, \xe2\x80\x98that might be very easily done, for he will be\r\nhere to-night, and then there would be no occasion to make the matter\r\npublic, just--just--for the young man\xe2\x80\x99s own sake, you know. I--I--should\r\nlike to consult Mrs. Nupkins on the propriety of the step, in the first\r\ninstance, though. At all events, Mr. Pickwick, we must despatch this\r\nlegal business before we can do anything else. Pray step back into the\r\nnext room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInto the next room they went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grummer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, in an awful voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your Wash-up,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Grummer, with the smile of a favourite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate sternly, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t let me see any of\r\nthis levity here. It is very unbecoming, and I can assure you that you\r\nhave very little to smile at. Was the account you gave me just now\r\nstrictly true? Now be careful, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYour Wash-up,\xe2\x80\x99 stammered Grummer, \xe2\x80\x98I-\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you are confused, are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jinks, you\r\nobserve this confusion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x98repeat your statement, Grummer, and again I\r\nwarn you to be careful. Mr. Jinks, take his words down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Grummer proceeded to re-state his complaint, but, what\r\nbetween Mr. Jinks\xe2\x80\x99s taking down his words, and the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s taking\r\nthem up, his natural tendency to rambling, and his extreme confusion, he\r\nmanaged to get involved, in something under three minutes, in such a\r\nmass of entanglement and contradiction, that Mr. Nupkins at once\r\ndeclared he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him. So the fines were remitted, and Mr.\r\nJinks found a couple of bail in no time. And all these solemn\r\nproceedings having been satisfactorily concluded, Mr. Grummer was\r\nignominiously ordered out--an awful instance of the instability of human\r\ngreatness, and the uncertain tenure of great men\xe2\x80\x99s favour.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nupkins was a majestic female in a pink gauze turban and a light\r\nbrown wig. Miss Nupkins possessed all her mamma\xe2\x80\x99s haughtiness without\r\nthe turban, and all her ill-nature without the wig; and whenever the\r\nexercise of these two amiable qualities involved mother and daughter in\r\nsome unpleasant dilemma, as they not infrequently did, they both\r\nconcurred in laying the blame on the shoulders of Mr. Nupkins.\r\nAccordingly, when Mr. Nupkins sought Mrs. Nupkins, and detailed the\r\ncommunication which had been made by Mr. Pickwick, Mrs. Nupkins suddenly\r\nrecollected that she had always expected something of the kind; that she\r\nhad always said it would be so; that her advice was never taken; that\r\nshe really did not know what Mr. Nupkins supposed she was; and so forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The idea!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Nupkins, forcing a tear of very scanty proportions\r\ninto the corner of each eye; \xe2\x80\x98the idea of my being made such a fool of!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you may thank your papa, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Nupkins; \xe2\x80\x98how I have\r\nimplored and begged that man to inquire into the captain\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\nconnections; how I have urged and entreated him to take some decisive\r\nstep! I am quite certain nobody would believe it--quite.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me, you aggravating thing, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, \xe2\x80\x98you professed yourself very fond of\r\nCaptain Fitz-Marshall. You have constantly asked him here, my dear, and\r\nyou have lost no opportunity of introducing him elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say so, Henrietta?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Nupkins, appealing to her\r\ndaughter with the air of a much-injured female. \xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say that your\r\npapa would turn round and lay all this at my door? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHere Mrs. Nupkins sobbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, pa!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Miss Nupkins. And here she sobbed too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it too much, when he has brought all this disgrace and ridicule\r\nupon us, to taunt me with being the cause of it?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs.\r\nNupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can we ever show ourselves in society!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can we face the Porkenhams?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or the Griggs!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Nupkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or the Slummintowkens!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Nupkins. \xe2\x80\x98But what does your papa\r\ncare! What is it to _him_!\xe2\x80\x99 At this dreadful reflection, Mrs. Nupkins\r\nwept mental anguish, and Miss Nupkins followed on the same side.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nupkins\xe2\x80\x99s tears continued to gush forth, with great velocity, until\r\nshe had gained a little time to think the matter over; when she decided,\r\nin her own mind, that the best thing to do would be to ask Mr. Pickwick\r\nand his friends to remain until the captain\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, and then to give\r\nMr. Pickwick the opportunity he sought. If it appeared that he had\r\nspoken truly, the captain could be turned out of the house without\r\nnoising the matter abroad, and they could easily account to the\r\nPorkenhams for his disappearance, by saying that he had been appointed,\r\nthrough the Court influence of his family, to the governor-generalship\r\nof Sierra Leone, of Saugur Point, or any other of those salubrious\r\nclimates which enchant Europeans so much, that when they once get there,\r\nthey can hardly ever prevail upon themselves to come back again.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Nupkins dried up her tears, Miss Nupkins dried up hers, and\r\nMr. Nupkins was very glad to settle the matter as Mrs. Nupkins had\r\nproposed. So Mr. Pickwick and his friends, having washed off all marks\r\nof their late encounter, were introduced to the ladies, and soon\r\nafterwards to their dinner; and Mr. Weller, whom the magistrate, with\r\nhis peculiar sagacity, had discovered in half an hour to be one of the\r\nfinest fellows alive, was consigned to the care and guardianship of Mr.\r\nMuzzle, who was specially enjoined to take him below, and make much of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How de do, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle, as he conducted Mr. Weller down the\r\nkitchen stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system,\r\nsince I see you cocked up behind your governor\xe2\x80\x99s chair in the parlour, a\r\nlittle vile ago,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will excuse my not taking more notice of you then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nMuzzle. \xe2\x80\x98You see, master hadn\xe2\x80\x99t introduced us, then. Lord, how fond he\r\nis of you, Mr. Weller, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98what a pleasant chap he is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Muzzle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much humour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And such a man to speak,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle. \xe2\x80\x98How his ideas flow, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wonderful,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98they comes a-pouring out, knocking each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s heads so fast, that they seems to stun one another; you hardly\r\nknow what he\xe2\x80\x99s arter, do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the great merit of his style of speaking,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Muzzle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care of the last step, Mr. Weller. Would you like to wash your\r\nhands, sir, before we join the ladies? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a sink, with the water\r\nlaid on, Sir, and a clean jack towel behind the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! perhaps I may as well have a rinse,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, applying\r\nplenty of yellow soap to the towel, and rubbing away till his face shone\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x98How many ladies are there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only two in our kitchen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle; \xe2\x80\x98cook and \xe2\x80\x98ouse-maid. We\r\nkeep a boy to do the dirty work, and a gal besides, but they dine in the\r\nwash\xe2\x80\x99us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, they dines in the wash\xe2\x80\x99us, do they?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Muzzle, \xe2\x80\x98we tried \xe2\x80\x98em at our table when they first\r\ncome, but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep \xe2\x80\x98em. The gal\xe2\x80\x99s manners is dreadful vulgar;\r\nand the boy breathes so very hard while he\xe2\x80\x99s eating, that we found it\r\nimpossible to sit at table with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young grampus!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, dreadful,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Muzzle; \xe2\x80\x98but that is the worst of country\r\nservice, Mr. Weller; the juniors is always so very savage. This way,\r\nsir, if you please, this way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPreceding Mr. Weller, with the utmost politeness, Mr. Muzzle conducted\r\nhim into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle to the pretty servant-girl, \xe2\x80\x98this is Mr. Weller;\r\na gentleman as master has sent down, to be made as comfortable as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your master\xe2\x80\x99s a knowin\xe2\x80\x99 hand, and has just sent me to the right\r\nplace,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with a glance of admiration at Mary. \xe2\x80\x98If I wos\r\nmaster o\xe2\x80\x99 this here house, I should alvays find the materials for\r\ncomfort vere Mary wos.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLor, Mr. Weller!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I never!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated the cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless me, cook, I forgot you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Weller, let me\r\nintroduce you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Wery glad to see you, indeed,\r\nand hope our acquaintance may be a long \xe2\x80\x98un, as the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n said to\r\nthe fi\xe2\x80\x99 pun\xe2\x80\x99 note.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen this ceremony of introduction had been gone through, the cook and\r\nMary retired into the back kitchen to titter, for ten minutes; then\r\nreturning, all giggles and blushes, they sat down to dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s easy manners and conversational powers had such\r\nirresistible influence with his new friends, that before the dinner was\r\nhalf over, they were on a footing of perfect intimacy, and in possession\r\nof a full account of the delinquency of Job Trotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never could a-bear that Job,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No more you never ought to, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos ugliness and svindlin\xe2\x80\x99 never ought to be formiliar with elegance\r\nand wirtew,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Ought they, Mr. Muzzle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not by no means,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Mary laughed, and said the cook had made her; and the cook laughed,\r\nand said she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t got a glass,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drink with me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Put your lips to this here\r\ntumbler, and then I can kiss you by deputy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For shame, Mr. Weller!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Talkin\xe2\x80\x99 in that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no harm. It\xe2\x80\x99s natur; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, cook?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, imperence,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cook, in a high state of delight;\r\nand hereupon the cook and Mary laughed again, till what between the\r\nbeer, and the cold meat, and the laughter combined, the latter young\r\nlady was brought to the verge of choking--an alarming crisis from which\r\nshe was only recovered by sundry pats on the back, and other necessary\r\nattentions, most delicately administered by Mr. Samuel Weller.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this jollity and conviviality, a loud ring was heard\r\nat the garden gate, to which the young gentleman who took his meals in\r\nthe wash-house, immediately responded. Mr. Weller was in the height of\r\nhis attentions to the pretty house-maid; Mr. Muzzle was busy doing the\r\nhonours of the table; and the cook had just paused to laugh, in the very\r\nact of raising a huge morsel to her lips; when the kitchen door opened,\r\nand in walked Mr. Job Trotter.\r\n\r\nWe have said in walked Mr. Job Trotter, but the statement is not\r\ndistinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact. The door opened\r\nand Mr. Trotter appeared. He would have walked in, and was in the very\r\nact of doing so, indeed, when catching sight of Mr. Weller, he\r\ninvoluntarily shrank back a pace or two, and stood gazing on the\r\nunexpected scene before him, perfectly motionless with amazement and\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here he is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, rising with great glee. \xe2\x80\x98Why we were that wery\r\nmoment a-speaking o\xe2\x80\x99 you. How are you? Where have you been? Come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaying his hand on the mulberry collar of the unresisting Job, Mr.\r\nWeller dragged him into the kitchen; and, locking the door, handed the\r\nkey to Mr. Muzzle, who very coolly buttoned it up in a side pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s a game!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Only think o\xe2\x80\x99 my master havin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\npleasure o\xe2\x80\x99 meeting yourn upstairs, and me havin\xe2\x80\x99 the joy o\xe2\x80\x99 meetin\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\ndown here. How are you gettin\xe2\x80\x99 on, and how is the chandlery bis\xe2\x80\x99ness\r\nlikely to do? Well, I am so glad to see you. How happy you look. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite a treat to see you; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mr. Muzzle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So cheerful he is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In such good spirits!\xe2\x80\x99 said Muzzle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so glad to see us--that makes it so much more comfortable,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSam. \xe2\x80\x98Sit down; sit down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter suffered himself to be forced into a chair by the fireside.\r\nHe cast his small eyes, first on Mr. Weller, and then on Mr. Muzzle, but\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98afore these here ladies, I should jest like to\r\nask you, as a sort of curiosity, whether you don\xe2\x80\x99t consider yourself as\r\nnice and well-behaved a young gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, as ever used a pink check\r\npocket-handkerchief, and the number four collection?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as was ever a-going to be married to a cook,\xe2\x80\x99 said that lady\r\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x98The willin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And leave off his evil ways, and set up in the chandlery line\r\narterwards,\xe2\x80\x99 said the housemaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, young man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle solemnly,\r\nenraged at the last two allusions, \xe2\x80\x98this here lady (pointing to the\r\ncook) keeps company with me; and when you presume, Sir, to talk of\r\nkeeping chandlers\xe2\x80\x99 shops with her, you injure me in one of the most\r\ndelicatest points in which one man can injure another. Do you understand\r\nthat, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Muzzle, who had a great notion of his eloquence, in which he\r\nimitated his master, paused for a reply.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Trotter made no reply. So Mr. Muzzle proceeded in a solemn\r\nmanner--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very probable, sir, that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be wanted upstairs for several\r\nminutes, Sir, because _my_ master is at this moment particularly engaged\r\nin settling the hash of _your _master, Sir; and therefore you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nleisure, Sir, for a little private talk with me, Sir. Do you understand\r\nthat, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Muzzle again paused for a reply; and again Mr. Trotter disappointed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Muzzle, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry to have to explain myself\r\nbefore ladies, but the urgency of the case will be my excuse. The back\r\nkitchen\xe2\x80\x99s empty, Sir. If you will step in there, Sir, Mr. Weller will\r\nsee fair, and we can have mutual satisfaction till the bell rings.\r\nFollow me, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Muzzle uttered these words, he took a step or two towards the\r\ndoor; and, by way of saving time, began to pull off his coat as he\r\nwalked along.\r\n\r\nNow, the cook no sooner heard the concluding words of this desperate\r\nchallenge, and saw Mr. Muzzle about to put it into execution, than she\r\nuttered a loud and piercing shriek; and rushing on Mr. Job Trotter, who\r\nrose from his chair on the instant, tore and buffeted his large flat\r\nface, with an energy peculiar to excited females, and twining her hands\r\nin his long black hair, tore therefrom about enough to make five or six\r\ndozen of the very largest-sized mourning-rings. Having accomplished this\r\nfeat with all the ardour which her devoted love for Mr. Muzzle inspired,\r\nshe staggered back; and being a lady of very excitable and delicate\r\nfeelings, she instantly fell under the dresser, and fainted away.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the bell rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s for you, Job Trotter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; and before Mr. Trotter could\r\noffer remonstrance or reply--even before he had time to stanch the\r\nwounds inflicted by the insensible lady--Sam seized one arm and Mr.\r\nMuzzle the other, and one pulling before, and the other pushing behind,\r\nthey conveyed him upstairs, and into the parlour.\r\n\r\nIt was an impressive tableau. Alfred Jingle, Esquire, alias Captain\r\nFitz-Marshall, was standing near the door with his hat in his hand, and\r\na smile on his face, wholly unmoved by his very unpleasant situation.\r\nConfronting him, stood Mr. Pickwick, who had evidently been inculcating\r\nsome high moral lesson; for his left hand was beneath his coat tail, and\r\nhis right extended in air, as was his wont when delivering himself of an\r\nimpressive address. At a little distance, stood Mr. Tupman with\r\nindignant countenance, carefully held back by his two younger friends;\r\nat the farther end of the room were Mr. Nupkins, Mrs. Nupkins, and Miss\r\nNupkins, gloomily grand and savagely vexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What prevents me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, with magisterial dignity, as Job\r\nwas brought in--\xe2\x80\x98what prevents me from detaining these men as rogues and\r\nimpostors? It is a foolish mercy. What prevents me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pride, old fellow, pride,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jingle, quite at his ease. \xe2\x80\x98Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo--no go--caught a captain, eh?--ha! ha! very good--husband for\r\ndaughter--biter bit--make it public--not for worlds--look stupid--very!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wretch,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, \xe2\x80\x98we scorn your base insinuations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always hated him,\xe2\x80\x99 added Henrietta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98Tall young man--old lover--Sidney\r\nPorkenham--rich--fine fellow--not so rich as captain, though, eh?--turn\r\nhim away--off with him--anything for captain--nothing like captain\r\nanywhere--all the girls--raving mad--eh, Job, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Jingle laughed very heartily; and Job, rubbing his hands with\r\ndelight, uttered the first sound he had given vent to since he entered\r\nthe house--a low, noiseless chuckle, which seemed to intimate that he\r\nenjoyed his laugh too much, to let any of it escape in sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Nupkins,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder lady,\xe2\x80\x99 this is not a fit conversation for\r\nthe servants to overhear. Let these wretches be removed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 Said Mr. Nupkins. \xe2\x80\x98Muzzle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Open the front door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, your Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave the house!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Nupkins, waving his hand emphatically.\r\n\r\nJingle smiled, and moved towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. Jingle stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I might,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98have taken a much greater revenge for the\r\ntreatment I have experienced at your hands, and that of your\r\nhypocritical friend there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJob Trotter bowed with great politeness, and laid his hand upon his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, growing gradually angry, \xe2\x80\x98that I might have\r\ntaken a greater revenge, but I content myself with exposing you, which I\r\nconsider a duty I owe to society. This is a leniency, Sir, which I hope\r\nyou will remember.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pickwick arrived at this point, Job Trotter, with facetious\r\ngravity, applied his hand to his ear, as if desirous not to lose a\r\nsyllable he uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I have only to add, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, now thoroughly angry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I consider you a rascal, and a--a--ruffian--and--and worse than\r\nany man I ever saw, or heard of, except that pious and sanctified\r\nvagabond in the mulberry livery.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle, \xe2\x80\x98good fellow, Pickwick--fine heart--stout old\r\nboy--but must _not _be passionate--bad thing, very--bye, bye--see you\r\nagain some day--keep up your spirits--now, Job--trot!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Jingle stuck on his hat in his old fashion, and\r\nstrode out of the room. Job Trotter paused, looked round, smiled and\r\nthen with a bow of mock solemnity to Mr. Pickwick, and a wink to Mr.\r\nWeller, the audacious slyness of which baffles all description, followed\r\nthe footsteps of his hopeful master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as Mr. Weller was following.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStay here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller seemed uncertain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay here,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I polish that \xe2\x80\x98ere Job off, in the front garden?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I kick him out o\xe2\x80\x99 the gate, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not on any account,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his master.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since his engagement, Mr. Weller looked, for a\r\nmoment, discontented and unhappy. But his countenance immediately\r\ncleared up; for the wily Mr. Muzzle, by concealing himself behind the\r\nstreet door, and rushing violently out, at the right instant, contrived\r\nwith great dexterity to overturn both Mr. Jingle and his attendant, down\r\nthe flight of steps, into the American aloe tubs that stood beneath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having discharged my duty, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick to Mr. Nupkins, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill, with my friends, bid you farewell. While we thank you for such\r\nhospitality as we have received, permit me to assure you, in our joint\r\nnames, that we should not have accepted it, or have consented to\r\nextricate ourselves in this way, from our previous dilemma, had we not\r\nbeen impelled by a strong sense of duty. We return to London to-morrow.\r\nYour secret is safe with us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving thus entered his protest against their treatment of the morning,\r\nMr. Pickwick bowed low to the ladies, and notwithstanding the\r\nsolicitations of the family, left the room with his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get your hat, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s below stairs, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, and he ran down after it.\r\n\r\nNow, there was nobody in the kitchen, but the pretty housemaid; and as\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s hat was mislaid, he had to look for it, and the pretty housemaid\r\nlighted him. They had to look all over the place for the hat. The pretty\r\nhousemaid, in her anxiety to find it, went down on her knees, and turned\r\nover all the things that were heaped together in a little corner by the\r\ndoor. It was an awkward corner. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get at it without shutting\r\nthe door first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the pretty housemaid. \xe2\x80\x98This is it, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me look,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nThe pretty housemaid had stood the candle on the floor; and, as it gave\r\na very dim light, Sam was obliged to go down on _his _knees before he\r\ncould see whether it really was his own hat or not. It was a remarkably\r\nsmall corner, and so--it was nobody\xe2\x80\x99s fault but the man\xe2\x80\x99s who built the\r\nhouse--Sam and the pretty housemaid were necessarily very close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, this is it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 said the pretty housemaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; and as he said it, he dropped the hat that had\r\ncost so much trouble in looking for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How awkward you are,\xe2\x80\x99 said the pretty housemaid. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll lose it again,\r\nif you don\xe2\x80\x99t take care.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo just to prevent his losing it again, she put it on for him.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that the pretty housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s face looked prettier still,\r\nwhen it was raised towards Sam\xe2\x80\x99s, or whether it was the accidental\r\nconsequence of their being so near to each other, is matter of\r\nuncertainty to this day; but Sam kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you did that on purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 said the pretty\r\nhousemaid, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98but I will now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he kissed her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, calling over the banisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coming, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, running upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long you have been!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was something behind the door, Sir, which perwented our getting\r\nit open, for ever so long, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the first passage of Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s first love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. WHICH CONTAINS A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PROGRESS OF THE\r\nACTION OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished the main end and object of his journey, by the\r\nexposure of Jingle, Mr. Pickwick resolved on immediately returning to\r\nLondon, with the view of becoming acquainted with the proceedings which\r\nhad been taken against him, in the meantime, by Messrs. Dodson and Fogg.\r\nActing upon this resolution with all the energy and decision of his\r\ncharacter, he mounted to the back seat of the first coach which left\r\nIpswich on the morning after the memorable occurrences detailed at\r\nlength in the two preceding chapters; and accompanied by his three\r\nfriends, and Mr. Samuel Weller, arrived in the metropolis, in perfect\r\nhealth and safety, the same evening.\r\n\r\nHere the friends, for a short time, separated. Messrs. Tupman, Winkle,\r\nand Snodgrass repaired to their several homes to make such preparations\r\nas might be requisite for their forthcoming visit to Dingley Dell; and\r\nMr. Pickwick and Sam took up their present abode in very good, old-\r\nfashioned, and comfortable quarters, to wit, the George and Vulture\r\nTavern and Hotel, George Yard, Lombard Street.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had dined, finished his second pint of particular port,\r\npulled his silk handkerchief over his head, put his feet on the fender,\r\nand thrown himself back in an easy-chair, when the entrance of Mr.\r\nWeller with his carpet-bag, aroused him from his tranquil meditation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have just been thinking, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that having left a\r\ngood many things at Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s, in Goswell Street, I ought to\r\narrange for taking them away, before I leave town again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could send them to Mr. Tupman\xe2\x80\x99s, for the present, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98but before we take them away, it is necessary that they\r\nshould be looked up, and put together. I wish you would step up to\r\nGoswell Street, Sam, and arrange about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At once, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At once,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98And stay, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick,\r\npulling out his purse, \xe2\x80\x98there is some rent to pay. The quarter is not\r\ndue till Christmas, but you may pay it, and have done with it. A month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotice terminates my tenancy. Here it is, written out. Give it, and tell\r\nMrs. Bardell she may put a bill up, as soon as she likes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98anythin\xe2\x80\x99 more, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing more, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller stepped slowly to the door, as if he expected something more;\r\nslowly opened it, slowly stepped out, and had slowly closed it within a\r\ncouple of inches, when Mr. Pickwick called out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, stepping quickly back, and closing the door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no objection, Sam, to your endeavouring to ascertain how Mrs.\r\nBardell herself seems disposed towards me, and whether it is really\r\nprobable that this vile and groundless action is to be carried to\r\nextremity. I say I do not object to you doing this, if you wish it,\r\nSam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nSam gave a short nod of intelligence, and left the room. Mr. Pickwick\r\ndrew the silk handkerchief once more over his head, And composed himself\r\nfor a nap. Mr. Weller promptly walked forth, to execute his commission.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he reached Goswell Street. A couple of\r\ncandles were burning in the little front parlour, and a couple of caps\r\nwere reflected on the window-blind. Mrs. Bardell had got company.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller knocked at the door, and after a pretty long interval--\r\noccupied by the party without, in whistling a tune, and by the party\r\nwithin, in persuading a refractory flat candle to allow itself to be\r\nlighted--a pair of small boots pattered over the floor-cloth, and Master\r\nBardell presented himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, young townskip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98how\xe2\x80\x99s mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Master Bardell, \xe2\x80\x98so am I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98tell her I want to speak to her, will\r\nyou, my hinfant fernomenon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMaster Bardell, thus adjured, placed the refractory flat candle on the\r\nbottom stair, and vanished into the front parlour with his message.\r\n\r\nThe two caps, reflected on the window-blind, were the respective head-\r\ndresses of a couple of Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s most particular acquaintance, who\r\nhad just stepped in, to have a quiet cup of tea, and a little warm\r\nsupper of a couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese. The\r\ncheese was simmering and browning away, most delightfully, in a little\r\nDutch oven before the fire; the pettitoes were getting on deliciously in\r\na little tin saucepan on the hob; and Mrs. Bardell and her two friends\r\nwere getting on very well, also, in a little quiet conversation about\r\nand concerning all their particular friends and acquaintance; when\r\nMaster Bardell came back from answering the door, and delivered the\r\nmessage intrusted to him by Mr. Samuel Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s servant!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I raly would not ha\xe2\x80\x99 believed it, unless I had ha\xe2\x80\x99 happened to\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 been here!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cluppins was a little, brisk, busy-looking woman; Mrs. Sanders was\r\na big, fat, heavy-faced personage; and the two were the company.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bardell felt it proper to be agitated; and as none of the three\r\nexactly knew whether under existing circumstances, any communication,\r\notherwise than through Dodson & Fogg, ought to be held with Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s servant, they were all rather taken by surprise. In this\r\nstate of indecision, obviously the first thing to be done, was to thump\r\nthe boy for finding Mr. Weller at the door. So his mother thumped him,\r\nand he cried melodiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your noise--do--you naughty creetur!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; don\xe2\x80\x99t worrit your poor mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough to worrit her, as it is, without you, Tommy,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs. Cluppins, with sympathising resignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! worse luck, poor lamb!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\nAt all which moral reflections, Master Bardell howled the louder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, what shall I do?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell to Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you ought to see him,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Cluppins. \xe2\x80\x98But on no\r\naccount without a witness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think two witnesses would be more lawful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders, who,\r\nlike the other friend, was bursting with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99d better come in here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Cluppins, eagerly catching at the idea; \xe2\x80\x98walk\r\nin, young man; and shut the street door first, please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller immediately took the hint; and presenting himself in the\r\nparlour, explained his business to Mrs. Bardell thus--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery sorry to \xe2\x80\x98casion any personal inconwenience, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, as the\r\nhousebreaker said to the old lady when he put her on the fire; but as me\r\nand my governor \xe2\x80\x98s only jest come to town, and is jest going away agin,\r\nit can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, the young man can\xe2\x80\x99t help the faults of his master,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs. Cluppins, much struck by Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 chimed in Mrs. Sanders, who, from certain wistful\r\nglances at the little tin saucepan, seemed to be engaged in a mental\r\ncalculation of the probable extent of the pettitoes, in the event of\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s being asked to stop to supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So all I\xe2\x80\x99ve come about, is jest this here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, disregarding the\r\ninterruption; \xe2\x80\x98first, to give my governor\xe2\x80\x99s notice--there it is.\r\nSecondly, to pay the rent--here it is. Thirdly, to say as all his things\r\nis to be put together, and give to anybody as we sends for \xe2\x80\x98em.\r\nFourthly, that you may let the place as soon as you like--and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever has happened,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, \xe2\x80\x98I always have said, and\r\nalways will say, that in every respect but one, Mr. Pickwick has always\r\nbehaved himself like a perfect gentleman. His money always as good as\r\nthe bank--always.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Bardell said this, she applied her handkerchief to her eyes, and\r\nwent out of the room to get the receipt.\r\n\r\nSam well knew that he had only to remain quiet, and the women were sure\r\nto talk; so he looked alternately at the tin saucepan, the toasted\r\ncheese, the wall, and the ceiling, in profound silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\nSam said nothing. He saw they were coming to the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I raly cannot contain myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins, \xe2\x80\x98when I think of\r\nsuch perjury. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to say anything to make you uncomfortable,\r\nyoung man, but your master\xe2\x80\x99s an old brute, and I wish I had him here to\r\ntell him so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI wish you had,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To see how dreadful she takes on, going moping about, and taking no\r\npleasure in nothing, except when her friends comes in, out of charity,\r\nto sit with her, and make her comfortable,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mrs. Cluppins,\r\nglancing at the tin saucepan and the Dutch oven, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s shocking!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Barbareous,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your master, young man! A gentleman with money, as could never feel\r\nthe expense of a wife, no more than nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mrs. Cluppins,\r\nwith great volubility; \xe2\x80\x98why there ain\xe2\x80\x99t the faintest shade of an excuse\r\nfor his behaviour! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t he marry her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98to be sure; that\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Question, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mrs. Cluppins, \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99d question him, if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d my spirit. Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever, there is law for us women, mis\xe2\x80\x99rable\r\ncreeturs as they\xe2\x80\x99d make us, if they could; and that your master will\r\nfind out, young man, to his cost, afore he\xe2\x80\x99s six months older.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this consolatory reflection, Mrs. Cluppins bridled up, and smiled at\r\nMrs. Sanders, who smiled back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The action\xe2\x80\x99s going on, and no mistake,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Sam, as Mrs. Bardell\r\nre-entered with the receipt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the receipt, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, \xe2\x80\x98and here\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nchange, and I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll take a little drop of something to keep the\r\ncold out, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only for old acquaintance\xe2\x80\x99 sake, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam saw the advantage he should gain, and at once acquiesced; whereupon\r\nMrs. Bardell produced, from a small closet, a black bottle and a wine-\r\nglass; and so great was her abstraction, in her deep mental affliction,\r\nthat, after filling Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s glass, she brought out three more wine-\r\nglasses, and filled them too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lauk, Mrs. Bardell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins, \xe2\x80\x98see what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been and\r\ndone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that is a good one!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, my poor head!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\nSam understood all this, of course, so he said at once, that he never\r\ncould drink before supper, unless a lady drank with him. A great deal of\r\nlaughter ensued, and Mrs. Sanders volunteered to humour him, so she took\r\na slight sip out of her glass. Then Sam said it must go all round, so\r\nthey all took a slight sip. Then little Mrs. Cluppins proposed as a\r\ntoast, \xe2\x80\x98Success to Bardell agin Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99; and then the ladies emptied\r\ntheir glasses in honour of the sentiment, and got very talkative\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard what\xe2\x80\x99s going forward, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nBardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd somethin\xe2\x80\x99 on it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible thing to be dragged before the public, in that way, Mr.\r\nWeller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell; \xe2\x80\x98but I see now, that it\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing I\r\nought to do, and my lawyers, Mr. Dodson and Fogg, tell me that, with the\r\nevidence as we shall call, we must succeed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should\r\ndo, Mr. Weller, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe mere idea of Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s failing in her action, affected Mrs.\r\nSanders so deeply, that she was under the necessity of refilling and re-\r\nemptying her glass immediately; feeling, as she said afterwards, that if\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the presence of mind to do so, she must have dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ven is it expected to come on?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Either in February or March,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a number of witnesses there\xe2\x80\x99ll be, won\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nCluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! won\xe2\x80\x99t there!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And won\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Dodson and Fogg be wild if the plaintiff shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99 added Mrs. Cluppins, \xe2\x80\x98when they do it all on speculation!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! won\xe2\x80\x99t they!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But the plaintiff must get it,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, there can\xe2\x80\x99t be any doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, rising and setting down his glass, \xe2\x80\x98all I can say is,\r\nthat I vish you _may _get it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell fervently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And of them Dodson and Foggs, as does these sort o\xe2\x80\x99 things on spec,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98as vell as for the other kind and gen\xe2\x80\x99rous people\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the same purfession, as sets people by the ears, free gratis for\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99, and sets their clerks to work to find out little disputes among\r\ntheir neighbours and acquaintances as vants settlin\xe2\x80\x99 by means of\r\nlawsuits--all I can say o\xe2\x80\x99 them is, that I vish they had the reward I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart would\r\nbe inclined to bestow upon them!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gratified Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amen to that,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and a fat and happy liven\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99d get out\r\nof it! Wish you good-night, ladies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo the great relief of Mrs. Sanders, Sam was allowed to depart without\r\nany reference, on the part of the hostess, to the pettitoes and toasted\r\ncheese; to which the ladies, with such juvenile assistance as Master\r\nBardell could afford, soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice--\r\nindeed they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller wended his way back to the George and Vulture, and faithfully\r\nrecounted to his master, such indications of the sharp practice of\r\nDodson & Fogg, as he had contrived to pick up in his visit to Mrs.\r\nBardell\xe2\x80\x99s. An interview with Mr. Perker, next day, more than confirmed\r\nMr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s statement; and Mr. Pickwick was fain to prepare for his\r\nChristmas visit to Dingley Dell, with the pleasant anticipation that\r\nsome two or three months afterwards, an action brought against him for\r\ndamages sustained by reason of a breach of promise of marriage, would be\r\npublicly tried in the Court of Common Pleas; the plaintiff having all\r\nthe advantages derivable, not only from the force of circumstances, but\r\nfrom the sharp practice of Dodson & Fogg to boot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. SAMUEL WELLER MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO DORKING, AND BEHOLDS\r\nHIS MOTHER-IN-LAW\r\n\r\nThere still remaining an interval of two days before the time agreed\r\nupon for the departure of the Pickwickians to Dingley Dell, Mr. Weller\r\nsat himself down in a back room at the George and Vulture, after eating\r\nan early dinner, to muse on the best way of disposing of his time. It\r\nwas a remarkably fine day; and he had not turned the matter over in his\r\nmind ten minutes, when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate;\r\nand it occurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see his\r\nfather, and pay his duty to his mother-in-law, that he was lost in\r\nastonishment at his own remissness in never thinking of this moral\r\nobligation before. Anxious to atone for his past neglect without another\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s delay, he straightway walked upstairs to Mr. Pickwick, and\r\nrequested leave of absence for this laudable purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Sam, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, his eyes glistening with\r\ndelight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his\r\nattendant; \xe2\x80\x98certainly, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller made a grateful bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad to see that you have so high a sense of your duties as a\r\nson, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always had, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a very gratifying reflection, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick\r\napprovingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98if ever I wanted anythin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nfather, I always asked for it in a wery \xe2\x80\x98spectful and obligin\xe2\x80\x99 manner.\r\nIf he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it me, I took it, for fear I should be led to do\r\nanythin\xe2\x80\x99 wrong, through not havin\xe2\x80\x99 it. I saved him a world o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble\r\nthis vay, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not precisely what I meant, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his\r\nhead, with a slight smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All good feelin\xe2\x80\x99, sir--the wery best intentions, as the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n said\r\nven he run away from his wife \xe2\x80\x98cos she seemed unhappy with him,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nMr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may go, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; and having made his best bow, and\r\nput on his best clothes, Sam planted himself on the top of the Arundel\r\ncoach, and journeyed on to Dorking.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Granby, in Mrs. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s time, was quite a model of a\r\nroadside public-house of the better class--just large enough to be\r\nconvenient, and small enough to be snug. On the opposite side of the\r\nroad was a large sign-board on a high post, representing the head and\r\nshoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance, in a red coat\r\nwith deep blue facings, and a touch of the same blue over his three-\r\ncornered hat, for a sky. Over that again were a pair of flags; beneath\r\nthe last button of his coat were a couple of cannon; and the whole\r\nformed an expressive and undoubted likeness of the Marquis of Granby of\r\nglorious memory. The bar window displayed a choice collection of\r\ngeranium plants, and a well-dusted row of spirit phials. The open\r\nshutters bore a variety of golden inscriptions, eulogistic of good beds\r\nand neat wines; and the choice group of countrymen and hostlers lounging\r\nabout the stable door and horse-trough, afforded presumptive proof of\r\nthe excellent quality of the ale and spirits which were sold within. Sam\r\nWeller paused, when he dismounted from the coach, to note all these\r\nlittle indications of a thriving business, with the eye of an\r\nexperienced traveller; and having done so, stepped in at once, highly\r\nsatisfied with everything he had observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, then!\xe2\x80\x99 said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head\r\nin at the door, \xe2\x80\x98what do you want, young man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded. It came\r\nfrom a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance, who was seated\r\nbeside the fireplace in the bar, blowing the fire to make the kettle\r\nboil for tea. She was not alone; for on the other side of the fireplace,\r\nsitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, was a man in threadbare\r\nblack clothes, with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair\r\nitself, who caught Sam\xe2\x80\x99s most particular and especial attention at once.\r\n\r\nHe was a prim-faced, red-nosed man, with a long, thin countenance, and a\r\nsemi-rattlesnake sort of eye--rather sharp, but decidedly bad. He wore\r\nvery short trousers, and black cotton stockings, which, like the rest of\r\nhis apparel, were particularly rusty. His looks were starched, but his\r\nwhite neckerchief was not, and its long limp ends straggled over his\r\nclosely-buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion.\r\nA pair of old, worn, beaver gloves, a broad-brimmed hat, and a faded\r\ngreen umbrella, with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom, as\r\nif to counterbalance the want of a handle at the top, lay on a chair\r\nbeside him; and, being disposed in a very tidy and careful manner,\r\nseemed to imply that the red-nosed man, whoever he was, had no intention\r\nof going away in a hurry.\r\n\r\nTo do the red-nosed man justice, he would have been very far from wise\r\nif he had entertained any such intention; for, to judge from all\r\nappearances, he must have been possessed of a most desirable circle of\r\nacquaintance, if he could have reasonably expected to be more\r\ncomfortable anywhere else. The fire was blazing brightly under the\r\ninfluence of the bellows, and the kettle was singing gaily under the\r\ninfluence of both. A small tray of tea-things was arranged on the table;\r\na plate of hot buttered toast was gently simmering before the fire; and\r\nthe red-nosed man himself was busily engaged in converting a large slice\r\nof bread into the same agreeable edible, through the instrumentality of\r\na long brass toasting-fork. Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot\r\npine-apple rum-and-water, with a slice of lemon in it; and every time\r\nthe red-nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye, with\r\nthe view of ascertaining how it got on, he imbibed a drop or two of the\r\nhot pine-apple rum-and-water, and smiled upon the rather stout lady, as\r\nshe blew the fire.\r\n\r\nSam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene, that he\r\nsuffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded. It\r\nwas not until it had been twice repeated, each time in a shriller tone,\r\nthat he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Governor in?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, in reply to the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Weller; for the rather stout lady was no\r\nother than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead-and-gone\r\nMr. Clarke; \xe2\x80\x98no, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect him, either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s drivin\xe2\x80\x99 up to-day?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He may be, or he may not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Weller, buttering the round of\r\ntoast which the red-nosed man had just finished. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and,\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s more, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.--Ask a blessin\xe2\x80\x99, Mr. Stiggins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe red-nosed man did as he was desired, and instantly commenced on the\r\ntoast with fierce voracity.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the red-nosed man had induced Sam, at first sight, to\r\nmore than half suspect that he was the deputy-shepherd of whom his\r\nestimable parent had spoken. The moment he saw him eat, all doubt on the\r\nsubject was removed, and he perceived at once that if he purposed to\r\ntake up his temporary quarters where he was, he must make his footing\r\ngood without delay. He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his\r\narm over the half-door of the bar, coolly unbolting it, and leisurely\r\nwalking in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother-in-law,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98how are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I do believe he is a Weller!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. W., raising her eyes to\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s face, with no very gratified expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rayther think he is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the imperturbable Sam; \xe2\x80\x98and I hope this\r\nhere reverend gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n \xe2\x80\x98ll excuse me saying that I wish I was _the\r\n_Weller as owns you, mother-in-law.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was a double-barrelled compliment. It implied that Mrs. Weller was\r\na most agreeable female, and also that Mr. Stiggins had a clerical\r\nappearance. It made a visible impression at once; and Sam followed up\r\nhis advantage by kissing his mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get along with you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller, pushing him away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For shame, young man!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman with the red nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No offence, sir, no offence,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re wery right, though;\r\nit ain\xe2\x80\x99t the right sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing, ven mothers-in-law is young and good-\r\nlooking, is it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all vanity,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller, setting her cap to rights.\r\n\r\nSam thought it was, too, but he held his peace.\r\n\r\nThe deputy-shepherd seemed by no means best pleased with Sam\xe2\x80\x99s arrival;\r\nand when the first effervescence of the compliment had subsided, even\r\nMrs. Weller looked as if she could have spared him without the smallest\r\ninconvenience. However, there he was; and as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be decently\r\nturned out, they all three sat down to tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how\xe2\x80\x99s father?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nAt this inquiry, Mrs. Weller raised her hands, and turned up her eyes,\r\nas if the subject were too painful to be alluded to.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with that \xe2\x80\x98ere gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s shocked at the way your father goes on in,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, he is, is he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And with too good reason,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mrs. Weller gravely.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast, and groaned heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a dreadful reprobate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A man of wrath!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Stiggins. He took a large semi-circular\r\nbite out of the toast, and groaned again.\r\n\r\nSam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend Mr. Stiggins\r\nsomething to groan for, but he repressed his inclination, and merely\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the old \xe2\x80\x98un up to now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Up to, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he has a hard heart. Night after\r\nnight does this excellent man--don\xe2\x80\x99t frown, Mr. Stiggins; I _will _say\r\nyou _are _an excellent man--come and sit here, for hours together, and\r\nit has not the least effect upon him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWell, that is odd,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98it \xe2\x80\x98ud have a wery considerable effect\r\nupon me, if I wos in his place; I know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact is, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins solemnly, \xe2\x80\x98he has an\r\nobderrate bosom. Oh, my young friend, who else could have resisted the\r\npleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters, and withstood their\r\nexhortations to subscribe to our noble society for providing the infant\r\nnegroes in the West Indies with flannel waistcoats and moral pocket-\r\nhandkerchiefs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s a moral pocket-ankercher?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98I never see one o\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\narticles o\xe2\x80\x99 furniter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those which combine amusement With instruction, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Mr. Stiggins, \xe2\x80\x98blending select tales with wood-cuts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98them as hangs up in the linen-drapers\xe2\x80\x99 shops,\r\nwith beggars\xe2\x80\x99 petitions and all that \xe2\x80\x98ere upon \xe2\x80\x98em?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins began a third round of toast, and nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be persuaded by the ladies, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sat and smoked his pipe, and said the infant negroes were--what did he\r\nsay the infant negroes were?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Little humbugs,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Stiggins, deeply affected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Said the infant negroes were little humbugs,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs. Weller. And\r\nthey both groaned at the atrocious conduct of the elder Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\nA great many more iniquities of a similar nature might have been\r\ndisclosed, only the toast being all eaten, the tea having got very weak,\r\nand Sam holding out no indications of meaning to go, Mr. Stiggins\r\nsuddenly recollected that he had a most pressing appointment with the\r\nshepherd, and took himself off accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe tea-things had been scarcely put away, and the hearth swept up, when\r\nthe London coach deposited Mr. Weller, senior, at the door; his legs\r\ndeposited him in the bar; and his eyes showed him his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, Sammy!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, old Nobs!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated the son. And they shook hands heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery glad to see you, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98though how\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to get over your mother-in-law, is a mystery to me. I\r\nonly vish you\xe2\x80\x99d write me out the receipt, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99s at home, old feller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe ain\xe2\x80\x99t vithin hearin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98she always goes and\r\nblows up, downstairs, for a couple of hours arter tea; so we\xe2\x80\x99ll just\r\ngive ourselves a damp, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaying this, Mr. Weller mixed two glasses of spirits-and-water, and\r\nproduced a couple of pipes. The father and son sitting down opposite\r\neach other; Sam on one side of the fire, in the high-backed chair, and\r\nMr. Weller, senior, on the other, in an easy ditto, they proceeded to\r\nenjoy themselves with all due gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anybody been here, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Weller, senior, dryly, after a\r\nlong silence.\r\n\r\nSam nodded an expressive assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Red-nosed chap?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\nSam nodded again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amiable man that \xe2\x80\x98ere, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, smoking violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seems so,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good hand at accounts,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Is he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Borrows eighteenpence on Monday, and comes on Tuesday for a shillin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nmake it up half-a-crown; calls again on Vensday for another half-crown\r\nto make it five shillin\xe2\x80\x99s; and goes on, doubling, till he gets it up to\r\na five pund note in no time, like them sums in the \xe2\x80\x98rithmetic book \xe2\x80\x98bout\r\nthe nails in the horse\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam intimated by a nod that he recollected the problem alluded to by his\r\nparent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you vouldn\xe2\x80\x99t subscribe to the flannel veskits?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, after\r\nanother interval of smoking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the good o\xe2\x80\x99 flannel veskits\r\nto the young niggers abroad? But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Weller, lowering his voice, and bending across the fireplace; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome down wery handsome towards strait veskits for some people at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller said this, he slowly recovered his former position, and\r\nwinked at his first-born, in a profound manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It cert\xe2\x80\x99nly seems a queer start to send out pocket-\xe2\x80\x99ankerchers to\r\npeople as don\xe2\x80\x99t know the use on \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re alvays a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 some gammon of that sort, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his\r\nfather. \xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99other Sunday I wos walkin\xe2\x80\x99 up the road, wen who should I see,\r\na-standin\xe2\x80\x99 at a chapel door, with a blue soup-plate in her hand, but\r\nyour mother-in-law! I werily believe there was change for a couple o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsuv\xe2\x80\x99rins in it, then, Sammy, all in ha\xe2\x80\x99pence; and as the people come\r\nout, they rattled the pennies in it, till you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought that no\r\nmortal plate as ever was baked, could ha\xe2\x80\x99 stood the wear and tear. What\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99ye think it was all for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For another tea-drinkin\xe2\x80\x99, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit on it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the father; \xe2\x80\x98for the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s water-rate,\r\nSammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s water-rate!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98there was three quarters owin\xe2\x80\x99, and the\r\nshepherd hadn\xe2\x80\x99t paid a farden, not he--perhaps it might be on account\r\nthat the water warn\xe2\x80\x99t o\xe2\x80\x99 much use to him, for it\xe2\x80\x99s wery little o\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\ntap he drinks, Sammy, wery; he knows a trick worth a good half-dozen of\r\nthat, he does. Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t paid, and so they cuts the water\r\noff. Down goes the shepherd to chapel, gives out as he\xe2\x80\x99s a persecuted\r\nsaint, and says he hopes the heart of the turncock as cut the water off,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ll be softened, and turned in the right vay, but he rayther thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooked for somethin\xe2\x80\x99 uncomfortable. Upon this, the women calls a\r\nmeetin\xe2\x80\x99, sings a hymn, wotes your mother-in-law into the chair,\r\nwolunteers a collection next Sunday, and hands it all over to the\r\nshepherd. And if he ain\xe2\x80\x99t got enough out on \xe2\x80\x98em, Sammy, to make him free\r\nof the water company for life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m one\r\nDutchman, and you\xe2\x80\x99re another, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller smoked for some minutes in silence, and then resumed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The worst o\xe2\x80\x99 these here shepherds is, my boy, that they reg\xe2\x80\x99larly turns\r\nthe heads of all the young ladies, about here. Lord bless their little\r\nhearts, they thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know no better; but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re the wictims o\xe2\x80\x99 gammon, Samivel, they\xe2\x80\x99re the wictims o\xe2\x80\x99 gammon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I s\xe2\x80\x99pose they are,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 else,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, shaking his head gravely; \xe2\x80\x98and wot\r\naggrawates me, Samivel, is to see \xe2\x80\x98em a-wastin\xe2\x80\x99 all their time and\r\nlabour in making clothes for copper-coloured people as don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x98em,\r\nand taking no notice of flesh-coloured Christians as do. If I\xe2\x80\x99d my vay,\r\nSamivel, I\xe2\x80\x99d just stick some o\xe2\x80\x99 these here lazy shepherds behind a heavy\r\nwheelbarrow, and run \xe2\x80\x98em up and down a fourteen-inch-wide plank all day.\r\nThat \xe2\x80\x98ud shake the nonsense out of \xe2\x80\x98em, if anythin\xe2\x80\x99 vould.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller, having delivered this gentle recipe with strong emphasis,\r\neked out by a variety of nods and contortions of the eye, emptied his\r\nglass at a draught, and knocked the ashes out of his pipe, with native\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nHe was engaged in this operation, when a shrill voice was heard in the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s your dear relation, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller; and Mrs. W. hurried\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve come back, have you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, filling a fresh pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has Mr. Stiggins been back?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, lighting the pipe by the\r\ningenious process of holding to the bowl thereof, between the tongs, a\r\nred-hot coal from the adjacent fire; and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, my dear, I shall\r\nmanage to surwive it, if he don\xe2\x80\x99t come back at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ugh, you wretch!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98none o\xe2\x80\x99 these little lovin\xe2\x80\x99s afore\r\nstrangers. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the reverend gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 in now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this announcement, Mrs. Weller hastily wiped off the tears which she\r\nhad just begun to force on; and Mr. W. drew his chair sullenly into the\r\nchimney-corner.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins was easily prevailed on to take another glass of the hot\r\npine-apple rum-and-water, and a second, and a third, and then to refresh\r\nhimself with a slight supper, previous to beginning again. He sat on the\r\nsame side as Mr. Weller, senior; and every time he could contrive to do\r\nso, unseen by his wife, that gentleman indicated to his son the hidden\r\nemotions of his bosom, by shaking his fist over the deputy-shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead; a process which afforded his son the most unmingled delight and\r\nsatisfaction, the more especially as Mr. Stiggins went on, quietly\r\ndrinking the hot pine-apple rum-and-water, wholly unconscious of what\r\nwas going forward.\r\n\r\nThe major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Weller and the\r\nreverend Mr. Stiggins; and the topics principally descanted on, were the\r\nvirtues of the shepherd, the worthiness of his flock, and the high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanours of everybody beside--dissertations which the\r\nelder Mr. Weller occasionally interrupted by half-suppressed references\r\nto a gentleman of the name of Walker, and other running commentaries of\r\nthe same kind.\r\n\r\nAt length Mr. Stiggins, with several most indubitable symptoms of having\r\nquite as much pine-apple rum-and-water about him as he could comfortably\r\naccommodate, took his hat, and his leave; and Sam was, immediately\r\nafterwards, shown to bed by his father. The respectable old gentleman\r\nwrung his hand fervently, and seemed disposed to address some\r\nobservation to his son; but on Mrs. Weller advancing towards him, he\r\nappeared to relinquish that intention, and abruptly bade him good-night.\r\n\r\nSam was up betimes next day, and having partaken of a hasty breakfast,\r\nprepared to return to London. He had scarcely set foot without the\r\nhouse, when his father stood before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Goin\xe2\x80\x99, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Off at once,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I vish you could muffle that \xe2\x80\x98ere Stiggins, and take him vith you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am ashamed on you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam reproachfully; \xe2\x80\x98what do you let him show\r\nhis red nose in the Markis o\xe2\x80\x99 Granby at all, for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look, and replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m a married man, Samivel, \xe2\x80\x98cause I\xe2\x80\x99m a married man. Ven you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na married man, Samivel, you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand a good many things as you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand now; but vether it\xe2\x80\x99s worth while goin\xe2\x80\x99 through so much,\r\nto learn so little, as the charity-boy said ven he got to the end of the\r\nalphabet, is a matter o\xe2\x80\x99 taste. I rayther think it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tar, tar, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to say this here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, stopping short, \xe2\x80\x98that if I\r\nwas the properiator o\xe2\x80\x99 the Markis o\xe2\x80\x99 Granby, and that \xe2\x80\x98ere Stiggins came\r\nand made toast in my bar, I\xe2\x80\x99d--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller, with great anxiety. \xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pison his rum-and-water,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, shaking his son eagerly by the hand, \xe2\x80\x98would you\r\nraly, Sammy-would you, though?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard upon him at first. I\xe2\x80\x99d drop\r\nhim in the water-butt, and put the lid on; and if I found he was\r\ninsensible to kindness, I\xe2\x80\x99d try the other persvasion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Weller bestowed a look of deep, unspeakable admiration on\r\nhis son, and, having once more grasped his hand, walked slowly away,\r\nrevolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had\r\ngiven rise.\r\n\r\nSam looked after him, until he turned a corner of the road; and then set\r\nforward on his walk to London. He meditated at first, on the probable\r\nconsequences of his own advice, and the likelihood of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadopting it. He dismissed the subject from his mind, however, with the\r\nconsolatory reflection that time alone would show; and this is the\r\nreflection we would impress upon the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. A GOOD-HUMOURED CHRISTMAS CHAPTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT\r\nOF A WEDDING, AND SOME OTHER SPORTS BESIDE: WHICH ALTHOUGH IN THEIR WAY,\r\nEVEN AS GOOD CUSTOMS AS MARRIAGE ITSELF, ARE NOT QUITE SO RELIGIOUSLY\r\nKEPT UP, IN THESE DEGENERATE TIMES\r\n\r\nAs brisk as bees, if not altogether as light as fairies, did the four\r\nPickwickians assemble on the morning of the twenty-second day of\r\nDecember, in the year of grace in which these, their faithfully-recorded\r\nadventures, were undertaken and accomplished. Christmas was close at\r\nhand, in all his bluff and hearty honesty; it was the season of\r\nhospitality, merriment, and open-heartedness; the old year was\r\npreparing, like an ancient philosopher, to call his friends around him,\r\nand amidst the sound of feasting and revelry to pass gently and calmly\r\naway. Gay and merry was the time; and right gay and merry were at least\r\nfour of the numerous hearts that were gladdened by its coming.\r\n\r\nAnd numerous indeed are the hearts to which Christmas brings a brief\r\nseason of happiness and enjoyment. How many families, whose members have\r\nbeen dispersed and scattered far and wide, in the restless struggles of\r\nlife, are then reunited, and meet once again in that happy state of\r\ncompanionship and mutual goodwill, which is a source of such pure and\r\nunalloyed delight; and one so incompatible with the cares and sorrows of\r\nthe world, that the religious belief of the most civilised nations, and\r\nthe rude traditions of the roughest savages, alike number it among the\r\nfirst joys of a future condition of existence, provided for the blessed\r\nand happy! How many old recollections, and how many dormant sympathies,\r\ndoes Christmas time awaken!\r\n\r\nWe write these words now, many miles distant from the spot at which,\r\nyear after year, we met on that day, a merry and joyous circle. Many of\r\nthe hearts that throbbed so gaily then, have ceased to beat; many of the\r\nlooks that shone so brightly then, have ceased to glow; the hands we\r\ngrasped, have grown cold; the eyes we sought, have hid their lustre in\r\nthe grave; and yet the old house, the room, the merry voices and smiling\r\nfaces, the jest, the laugh, the most minute and trivial circumstances\r\nconnected with those happy meetings, crowd upon our mind at each\r\nrecurrence of the season, as if the last assemblage had been but\r\nyesterday! Happy, happy Christmas, that can win us back to the delusions\r\nof our childish days; that can recall to the old man the pleasures of\r\nhis youth; that can transport the sailor and the traveller, thousands of\r\nmiles away, back to his own fireside and his quiet home!\r\n\r\nBut we are so taken up and occupied with the good qualities of this\r\nsaint Christmas, that we are keeping Mr. Pickwick and his friends\r\nwaiting in the cold on the outside of the Muggleton coach, which they\r\nhave just attained, well wrapped up in great-coats, shawls, and\r\ncomforters. The portmanteaus and carpet-bags have been stowed away, and\r\nMr. Weller and the guard are endeavouring to insinuate into the fore-\r\nboot a huge cod-fish several sizes too large for it--which is snugly\r\npacked up, in a long brown basket, with a layer of straw over the top,\r\nand which has been left to the last, in order that he may repose in\r\nsafety on the half-dozen barrels of real native oysters, all the\r\nproperty of Mr. Pickwick, which have been arranged in regular order at\r\nthe bottom of the receptacle. The interest displayed in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance is most intense, as Mr. Weller and the guard try to squeeze\r\nthe cod-fish into the boot, first head first, and then tail first, and\r\nthen top upward, and then bottom upward, and then side-ways, and then\r\nlong-ways, all of which artifices the implacable cod-fish sturdily\r\nresists, until the guard accidentally hits him in the very middle of the\r\nbasket, whereupon he suddenly disappears into the boot, and with him,\r\nthe head and shoulders of the guard himself, who, not calculating upon\r\nso sudden a cessation of the passive resistance of the cod-fish,\r\nexperiences a very unexpected shock, to the unsmotherable delight of all\r\nthe porters and bystanders. Upon this, Mr. Pickwick smiles with great\r\ngood-humour, and drawing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket, begs the\r\nguard, as he picks himself out of the boot, to drink his health in a\r\nglass of hot brandy-and-water; at which the guard smiles too, and\r\nMessrs. Snodgrass, Winkle, and Tupman, all smile in company. The guard\r\nand Mr. Weller disappear for five minutes, most probably to get the hot\r\nbrandy-and-water, for they smell very strongly of it, when they return,\r\nthe coachman mounts to the box, Mr. Weller jumps up behind, the\r\nPickwickians pull their coats round their legs and their shawls over\r\ntheir noses, the helpers pull the horse-cloths off, the coachman shouts\r\nout a cheery \xe2\x80\x98All right,\xe2\x80\x99 and away they go.\r\n\r\nThey have rumbled through the streets, and jolted over the stones, and\r\nat length reach the wide and open country. The wheels skim over the hard\r\nand frosty ground; and the horses, bursting into a canter at a smart\r\ncrack of the whip, step along the road as if the load behind them--\r\ncoach, passengers, cod-fish, oyster-barrels, and all--were but a feather\r\nat their heels. They have descended a gentle slope, and enter upon a\r\nlevel, as compact and dry as a solid block of marble, two miles long.\r\nAnother crack of the whip, and on they speed, at a smart gallop, the\r\nhorses tossing their heads and rattling the harness, as if in\r\nexhilaration at the rapidity of the motion; while the coachman, holding\r\nwhip and reins in one hand, takes off his hat with the other, and\r\nresting it on his knees, pulls out his handkerchief, and wipes his\r\nforehead, partly because he has a habit of doing it, and partly because\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s as well to show the passengers how cool he is, and what an easy\r\nthing it is to drive four-in-hand, when you have had as much practice as\r\nhe has. Having done this very leisurely (otherwise the effect would be\r\nmaterially impaired), he replaces his handkerchief, pulls on his hat,\r\nadjusts his gloves, squares his elbows, cracks the whip again, and on\r\nthey speed, more merrily than before.\r\n\r\nA few small houses, scattered on either side of the road, betoken the\r\nentrance to some town or village. The lively notes of the guard\xe2\x80\x99s key-\r\nbugle vibrate in the clear cold air, and wake up the old gentleman\r\ninside, who, carefully letting down the window-sash half-way, and\r\nstanding sentry over the air, takes a short peep out, and then carefully\r\npulling it up again, informs the other inside that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to\r\nchange directly; on which the other inside wakes himself up, and\r\ndetermines to postpone his next nap until after the stoppage. Again the\r\nbugle sounds lustily forth, and rouses the cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife and children,\r\nwho peep out at the house door, and watch the coach till it turns the\r\ncorner, when they once more crouch round the blazing fire, and throw on\r\nanother log of wood against father comes home; while father himself, a\r\nfull mile off, has just exchanged a friendly nod with the coachman, and\r\nturned round to take a good long stare at the vehicle as it whirls away.\r\n\r\nAnd now the bugle plays a lively air as the coach rattles through the\r\nill-paved streets of a country town; and the coachman, undoing the\r\nbuckle which keeps his ribands together, prepares to throw them off the\r\nmoment he stops. Mr. Pickwick emerges from his coat collar, and looks\r\nabout him with great curiosity; perceiving which, the coachman informs\r\nMr. Pickwick of the name of the town, and tells him it was market-day\r\nyesterday, both of which pieces of information Mr. Pickwick retails to\r\nhis fellow-passengers; whereupon they emerge from their coat collars\r\ntoo, and look about them also. Mr. Winkle, who sits at the extreme edge,\r\nwith one leg dangling in the air, is nearly precipitated into the\r\nstreet, as the coach twists round the sharp corner by the cheesemonger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop, and turns into the market-place; and before Mr. Snodgrass, who\r\nsits next to him, has recovered from his alarm, they pull up at the inn\r\nyard where the fresh horses, with cloths on, are already waiting. The\r\ncoachman throws down the reins and gets down himself, and the other\r\noutside passengers drop down also; except those who have no great\r\nconfidence in their ability to get up again; and they remain where they\r\nare, and stamp their feet against the coach to warm them--looking, with\r\nlonging eyes and red noses, at the bright fire in the inn bar, and the\r\nsprigs of holly with red berries which ornament the window.\r\n\r\nBut the guard has delivered at the corn-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, the brown paper\r\npacket he took out of the little pouch which hangs over his shoulder by\r\na leathern strap; and has seen the horses carefully put to; and has\r\nthrown on the pavement the saddle which was brought from London on the\r\ncoach roof; and has assisted in the conference between the coachman and\r\nthe hostler about the gray mare that hurt her off fore-leg last Tuesday;\r\nand he and Mr. Weller are all right behind, and the coachman is all\r\nright in front, and the old gentleman inside, who has kept the window\r\ndown full two inches all this time, has pulled it up again, and the\r\ncloths are off, and they are all ready for starting, except the \xe2\x80\x98two\r\nstout gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 whom the coachman inquires after with some impatience.\r\nHereupon the coachman, and the guard, and Sam Weller, and Mr. Winkle,\r\nand Mr. Snodgrass, and all the hostlers, and every one of the idlers,\r\nwho are more in number than all the others put together, shout for the\r\nmissing gentlemen as loud as they can bawl. A distant response is heard\r\nfrom the yard, and Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman come running down it,\r\nquite out of breath, for they have been having a glass of ale a-piece,\r\nand Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s fingers are so cold that he has been full five\r\nminutes before he could find the sixpence to pay for it. The coachman\r\nshouts an admonitory \xe2\x80\x98Now then, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 the guard re-echoes it; the\r\nold gentleman inside thinks it a very extraordinary thing that people\r\n_will _get down when they know there isn\xe2\x80\x99t time for it; Mr. Pickwick\r\nstruggles up on one side, Mr. Tupman on the other; Mr. Winkle cries \xe2\x80\x98All\r\nright\xe2\x80\x99; and off they start. Shawls are pulled up, coat collars are\r\nreadjusted, the pavement ceases, the houses disappear; and they are once\r\nagain dashing along the open road, with the fresh clear air blowing in\r\ntheir faces, and gladdening their very hearts within them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the progress of Mr. Pickwick and his friends by the Muggleton\r\nTelegraph, on their way to Dingley Dell; and at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock that\r\nafternoon they all stood high and dry, safe and sound, hale and hearty,\r\nupon the steps of the Blue Lion, having taken on the road quite enough\r\nof ale and brandy, to enable them to bid defiance to the frost that was\r\nbinding up the earth in its iron fetters, and weaving its beautiful\r\nnetwork upon the trees and hedges. Mr. Pickwick was busily engaged in\r\ncounting the barrels of oysters and superintending the disinterment of\r\nthe cod-fish, when he felt himself gently pulled by the skirts of the\r\ncoat. Looking round, he discovered that the individual who resorted to\r\nthis mode of catching his attention was no other than Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite page, better known to the readers of this unvarnished history,\r\nby the distinguishing appellation of the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy.\r\n\r\nAs he said it, he glanced from the cod-fish to the oyster-barrels, and\r\nchuckled joyously. He was fatter than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you look rosy enough, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asleep, right in front of the taproom fire,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat\r\nboy, who had heated himself to the colour of a new chimney-pot, in the\r\ncourse of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s nap. \xe2\x80\x98Master sent me over with the chay-cart, to\r\ncarry your luggage up to the house. He\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 sent some saddle-horses,\r\nbut he thought you\xe2\x80\x99d rather walk, being a cold day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick hastily, for he remembered how they had\r\ntravelled over nearly the same ground on a previous occasion. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, we\r\nwould rather walk. Here, Sam!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Help Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s servant to put the packages into the cart, and then\r\nride on with him. We will walk forward at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving given this direction, and settled with the coachman, Mr. Pickwick\r\nand his three friends struck into the footpath across the fields, and\r\nwalked briskly away, leaving Mr. Weller and the fat boy confronted\r\ntogether for the first time. Sam looked at the fat boy with great\r\nastonishment, but without saying a word; and began to stow the luggage\r\nrapidly away in the cart, while the fat boy stood quietly by, and seemed\r\nto think it a very interesting sort of thing to see Mr. Weller working\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, throwing in the last carpet-bag, \xe2\x80\x98there they are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy, in a very satisfied tone, \xe2\x80\x98there they are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, young twenty stun,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a nice specimen of a prize\r\nboy, you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ain\xe2\x80\x99t got nothin\xe2\x80\x99 on your mind as makes you fret yourself, have\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not as I knows on,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should rayther ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought, to look at you, that you was a-labourin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nunder an unrequited attachment to some young \xe2\x80\x98ooman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I am glad to hear it. Do you ever drink anythin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I likes eating better,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 s\xe2\x80\x99posed that; but what I mean is, should\r\nyou like a drop of anythin\xe2\x80\x99 as\xe2\x80\x99d warm you? but I s\xe2\x80\x99pose you never was\r\ncold, with all them elastic fixtures, was you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy; \xe2\x80\x98and I likes a drop of something, when\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you do, do you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98come this way, then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Blue Lion tap was soon gained, and the fat boy swallowed a glass of\r\nliquor without so much as winking--a feat which considerably advanced\r\nhim in Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion. Mr. Weller having transacted a similar\r\npiece of business on his own account, they got into the cart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you drive?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should rayther think so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy, putting the reins in his hand, and\r\npointing up a lane, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s as straight as you can go; you can\xe2\x80\x99t miss it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, the fat boy laid himself affectionately down by the\r\nside of the cod-fish, and, placing an oyster-barrel under his head for a\r\npillow, fell asleep instantaneously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98of all the cool boys ever I set my eyes on, this here\r\nyoung gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n is the coolest. Come, wake up, young dropsy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut as young dropsy evinced no symptoms of returning animation, Sam\r\nWeller sat himself down in front of the cart, and starting the old horse\r\nwith a jerk of the rein, jogged steadily on, towards the Manor Farm.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Pickwick and his friends having walked their blood into\r\nactive circulation, proceeded cheerfully on. The paths were hard; the\r\ngrass was crisp and frosty; the air had a fine, dry, bracing coldness;\r\nand the rapid approach of the gray twilight (slate-coloured is a better\r\nterm in frosty weather) made them look forward with pleasant\r\nanticipation to the comforts which awaited them at their hospitable\r\nentertainer\xe2\x80\x99s. It was the sort of afternoon that might induce a couple\r\nof elderly gentlemen, in a lonely field, to take off their greatcoats\r\nand play at leap-frog in pure lightness of heart and gaiety; and we\r\nfirmly believe that had Mr. Tupman at that moment proffered \xe2\x80\x98a back,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr. Pickwick would have accepted his offer with the utmost avidity.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Tupman did not volunteer any such accommodation, and the\r\nfriends walked on, conversing merrily. As they turned into a lane they\r\nhad to cross, the sound of many voices burst upon their ears; and before\r\nthey had even had time to form a guess to whom they belonged, they\r\nwalked into the very centre of the party who were expecting their\r\narrival--a fact which was first notified to the Pickwickians, by the\r\nloud \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah,\xe2\x80\x99 which burst from old Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s lips, when they appeared in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was Wardle himself, looking, if that were possible, more\r\njolly than ever; then there were Bella and her faithful Trundle; and,\r\nlastly, there were Emily and some eight or ten young ladies, who had all\r\ncome down to the wedding, which was to take place next day, and who were\r\nin as happy and important a state as young ladies usually are, on such\r\nmomentous occasions; and they were, one and all, startling the fields\r\nand lanes, far and wide, with their frolic and laughter.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of introduction, under such circumstances, was very soon\r\nperformed, or we should rather say that the introduction was soon over,\r\nwithout any ceremony at all. In two minutes thereafter, Mr. Pickwick was\r\njoking with the young ladies who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come over the stile while he\r\nlooked--or who, having pretty feet and unexceptionable ankles, preferred\r\nstanding on the top rail for five minutes or so, declaring that they\r\nwere too frightened to move--with as much ease and absence of reserve or\r\nconstraint, as if he had known them for life. It is worthy of remark,\r\ntoo, that Mr. Snodgrass offered Emily far more assistance than the\r\nabsolute terrors of the stile (although it was full three feet high, and\r\nhad only a couple of stepping-stones) would seem to require; while one\r\nblack-eyed young lady in a very nice little pair of boots with fur round\r\nthe top, was observed to scream very loudly, when Mr. Winkle offered to\r\nhelp her over.\r\n\r\nAll this was very snug and pleasant. And when the difficulties of the\r\nstile were at last surmounted, and they once more entered on the open\r\nfield, old Wardle informed Mr. Pickwick how they had all been down in a\r\nbody to inspect the furniture and fittings-up of the house, which the\r\nyoung couple were to tenant, after the Christmas holidays; at which\r\ncommunication Bella and Trundle both coloured up, as red as the fat boy\r\nafter the taproom fire; and the young lady with the black eyes and the\r\nfur round the boots, whispered something in Emily\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and then\r\nglanced archly at Mr. Snodgrass; to which Emily responded that she was a\r\nfoolish girl, but turned very red, notwithstanding; and Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nwho was as modest as all great geniuses usually are, felt the crimson\r\nrising to the crown of his head, and devoutly wished, in the inmost\r\nrecesses of his own heart, that the young lady aforesaid, with her black\r\neyes, and her archness, and her boots with the fur round the top, were\r\nall comfortably deposited in the adjacent county.\r\n\r\nBut if they were social and happy outside the house, what was the warmth\r\nand cordiality of their reception when they reached the farm! The very\r\nservants grinned with pleasure at sight of Mr. Pickwick; and Emma\r\nbestowed a half-demure, half-impudent, and all-pretty look of\r\nrecognition, on Mr. Tupman, which was enough to make the statue of\r\nBonaparte in the passage, unfold his arms, and clasp her within them.\r\n\r\nThe old lady was seated with customary state in the front parlour, but\r\nshe was rather cross, and, by consequence, most particularly deaf. She\r\nnever went out herself, and like a great many other old ladies of the\r\nsame stamp, she was apt to consider it an act of domestic treason, if\r\nanybody else took the liberty of doing what she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. So, bless her\r\nold soul, she sat as upright as she could, in her great chair, and\r\nlooked as fierce as might be--and that was benevolent after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick. You recollect him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old lady, with great dignity. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble\r\nMr. Pickwick about an old creetur like me. Nobody cares about me now,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s very nat\xe2\x80\x99ral they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the old lady tossed her\r\nhead, and smoothed down her lavender-coloured silk dress with trembling\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you cut an old\r\nfriend in this way. I have come down expressly to have a long talk, and\r\nanother rubber with you; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll show these boys and girls how to\r\ndance a minuet, before they\xe2\x80\x99re eight-and-forty hours older.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old lady was rapidly giving way, but she did not like to do it all\r\nat once; so she only said, \xe2\x80\x98Ah! I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Come, come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be cross, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood soul. Recollect Bella; come, you must keep her spirits up, poor\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe good old lady heard this, for her lip quivered as her son said it.\r\nBut age has its little infirmities of temper, and she was not quite\r\nbrought round yet. So, she smoothed down the lavender-coloured dress\r\nagain, and turning to Mr. Pickwick said, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mr. Pickwick, young people\r\nwas very different, when I was a girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No doubt of that, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why\r\nI would make much of the few that have any traces of the old stock\xe2\x80\x99--and\r\nsaying this, Mr. Pickwick gently pulled Bella towards him, and bestowing\r\na kiss upon her forehead, bade her sit down on the little stool at her\r\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s feet. Whether the expression of her countenance, as it was\r\nraised towards the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s face, called up a thought of old times, or\r\nwhether the old lady was touched by Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate good-\r\nnature, or whatever was the cause, she was fairly melted; so she threw\r\nherself on her granddaughter\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and all the little ill-humour\r\nevaporated in a gush of silent tears.\r\n\r\nA happy party they were, that night. Sedate and solemn were the score of\r\nrubbers in which Mr. Pickwick and the old lady played together;\r\nuproarious was the mirth of the round table. Long after the ladies had\r\nretired, did the hot elder wine, well qualified with brandy and spice,\r\ngo round, and round, and round again; and sound was the sleep and\r\npleasant were the dreams that followed. It is a remarkable fact that\r\nthose of Mr. Snodgrass bore constant reference to Emily Wardle; and that\r\nthe principal figure in Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s visions was a young lady with black\r\neyes, and arch smile, and a pair of remarkably nice boots with fur round\r\nthe tops.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was awakened early in the morning, by a hum of voices and a\r\npattering of feet, sufficient to rouse even the fat boy from his heavy\r\nslumbers. He sat up in bed and listened. The female servants and female\r\nvisitors were running constantly to and fro; and there were such\r\nmultitudinous demands for hot water, such repeated outcries for needles\r\nand thread, and so many half-suppressed entreaties of \xe2\x80\x98Oh, do come and\r\ntie me, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear!\xe2\x80\x99 that Mr. Pickwick in his innocence began to\r\nimagine that something dreadful must have occurred--when he grew more\r\nawake, and remembered the wedding. The occasion being an important one,\r\nhe dressed himself with peculiar care, and descended to the breakfast-\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThere were all the female servants in a bran new uniform of pink muslin\r\ngowns with white bows in their caps, running about the house in a state\r\nof excitement and agitation which it would be impossible to describe.\r\nThe old lady was dressed out in a brocaded gown, which had not seen the\r\nlight for twenty years, saving and excepting such truant rays as had\r\nstolen through the chinks in the box in which it had been laid by,\r\nduring the whole time. Mr. Trundle was in high feather and spirits, but\r\na little nervous withal. The hearty old landlord was trying to look very\r\ncheerful and unconcerned, but failing signally in the attempt. All the\r\ngirls were in tears and white muslin, except a select two or three, who\r\nwere being honoured with a private view of the bride and bridesmaids,\r\nupstairs. All the Pickwickians were in most blooming array; and there\r\nwas a terrific roaring on the grass in front of the house, occasioned by\r\nall the men, boys, and hobbledehoys attached to the farm, each of whom\r\nhad got a white bow in his button-hole, and all of whom were cheering\r\nwith might and main; being incited thereto, and stimulated therein by\r\nthe precept and example of Mr. Samuel Weller, who had managed to become\r\nmighty popular already, and was as much at home as if he had been born\r\non the land.\r\n\r\nA wedding is a licensed subject to joke upon, but there really is no\r\ngreat joke in the matter after all;--we speak merely of the ceremony,\r\nand beg it to be distinctly understood that we indulge in no hidden\r\nsarcasm upon a married life. Mixed up with the pleasure and joy of the\r\noccasion, are the many regrets at quitting home, the tears of parting\r\nbetween parent and child, the consciousness of leaving the dearest and\r\nkindest friends of the happiest portion of human life, to encounter its\r\ncares and troubles with others still untried and little known--natural\r\nfeelings which we would not render this chapter mournful by describing,\r\nand which we should be still more unwilling to be supposed to ridicule.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly say, then, that the ceremony was performed by the old\r\nclergyman, in the parish church of Dingley Dell, and that Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname is attached to the register, still preserved in the vestry thereof;\r\nthat the young lady with the black eyes signed her name in a very\r\nunsteady and tremulous manner; that Emily\xe2\x80\x99s signature, as the other\r\nbridesmaid, is nearly illegible; that it all went off in very admirable\r\nstyle; that the young ladies generally thought it far less shocking than\r\nthey had expected; and that although the owner of the black eyes and the\r\narch smile informed Mr. Wardle that she was sure she could never submit\r\nto anything so dreadful, we have the very best reasons for thinking she\r\nwas mistaken. To all this, we may add, that Mr. Pickwick was the first\r\nwho saluted the bride, and that in so doing he threw over her neck a\r\nrich gold watch and chain, which no mortal eyes but the jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s had\r\never beheld before. Then, the old church bell rang as gaily as it could,\r\nand they all returned to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vere does the mince-pies go, young opium-eater?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller to the\r\nfat boy, as he assisted in laying out such articles of consumption as\r\nhad not been duly arranged on the previous night.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy pointed to the destination of the pies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98stick a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 Christmas in \xe2\x80\x98em. T\xe2\x80\x99other dish\r\nopposite. There; now we look compact and comfortable, as the father said\r\nven he cut his little boy\xe2\x80\x99s head off, to cure him o\xe2\x80\x99 squintin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller made the comparison, he fell back a step or two, to give\r\nfull effect to it, and surveyed the preparations with the utmost\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wardle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, almost as soon as they were all seated, \xe2\x80\x98a\r\nglass of wine in honour of this happy occasion!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be delighted, my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Joe--damn that boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat boy, starting up from a remote\r\ncorner, where, like the patron saint of fat boys--the immortal Horner--\r\nhe had been devouring a Christmas pie, though not with the coolness and\r\ndeliberation which characterised that young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fill Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s glass.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy filled Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s glass, and then retired behind his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s chair, from whence he watched the play of the knives and forks,\r\nand the progress of the choice morsels from the dishes to the mouths of\r\nthe company, with a kind of dark and gloomy joy that was most\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God bless you, old fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Same to you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle; and they pledged each other,\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Wardle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98we old folks must have a glass of\r\nwine together, in honour of this joyful event.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old lady was in a state of great grandeur just then, for she was\r\nsitting at the top of the table in the brocaded gown, with her newly-\r\nmarried granddaughter on one side, and Mr. Pickwick on the other, to do\r\nthe carving. Mr. Pickwick had not spoken in a very loud tone, but she\r\nunderstood him at once, and drank off a full glass of wine to his long\r\nlife and happiness; after which the worthy old soul launched forth into\r\na minute and particular account of her own wedding, with a dissertation\r\non the fashion of wearing high-heeled shoes, and some particulars\r\nconcerning the life and adventures of the beautiful Lady Tollimglower,\r\ndeceased; at all of which the old lady herself laughed very heartily\r\nindeed, and so did the young ladies too, for they were wondering among\r\nthemselves what on earth grandma was talking about. When they laughed,\r\nthe old lady laughed ten times more heartily, and said that these always\r\nhad been considered capital stories, which caused them all to laugh\r\nagain, and put the old lady into the very best of humours. Then the cake\r\nwas cut, and passed through the ring; the young ladies saved pieces to\r\nput under their pillows to dream of their future husbands on; and a\r\ngreat deal of blushing and merriment was thereby occasioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Miller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick to his old acquaintance, the hard-headed\r\ngentleman, \xe2\x80\x98a glass of wine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great satisfaction, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the hard-headed\r\ngentleman solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll take me in?\xe2\x80\x99 said the benevolent old clergyman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And me,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And me, and me,\xe2\x80\x99 said a couple of poor relations at the bottom of the\r\ntable, who had eaten and drunk very heartily, and laughed at everything.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick expressed his heartfelt delight at every additional\r\nsuggestion; and his eyes beamed with hilarity and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear! Hear, hear! Hear, hear!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Weller, in the\r\nexcitement of his feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call in all the servants,\xe2\x80\x99 cried old Wardle, interposing to prevent the\r\npublic rebuke which Mr. Weller would otherwise most indubitably have\r\nreceived from his master. \xe2\x80\x98Give them a glass of wine each to drink the\r\ntoast in. Now, Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmidst the silence of the company, the whispering of the women-servants,\r\nand the awkward embarrassment of the men, Mr. Pickwick proceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ladies and gentlemen--no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say ladies and gentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call\r\nyou my friends, my dear friends, if the ladies will allow me to take so\r\ngreat a liberty--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Pickwick was interrupted by immense applause from the ladies,\r\nechoed by the gentlemen, during which the owner of the eyes was\r\ndistinctly heard to state that she could kiss that dear Mr. Pickwick.\r\nWhereupon Mr. Winkle gallantly inquired if it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done by\r\ndeputy: to which the young lady with the black eyes replied \xe2\x80\x98Go away,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand accompanied the request with a look which said as plainly as a look\r\ncould do, \xe2\x80\x98if you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear friends,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I am going to propose the\r\nhealth of the bride and bridegroom--God bless \xe2\x80\x98em (cheers and tears). My\r\nyoung friend, Trundle, I believe to be a very excellent and manly\r\nfellow; and his wife I know to be a very amiable and lovely girl, well\r\nqualified to transfer to another sphere of action the happiness which\r\nfor twenty years she has diffused around her, in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n(Here, the fat boy burst forth into stentorian blubberings, and was led\r\nforth by the coat collar, by Mr. Weller.) I wish,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I was young enough to be her sister\xe2\x80\x99s husband (cheers), but,\r\nfailing that, I am happy to be old enough to be her father; for, being\r\nso, I shall not be suspected of any latent designs when I say, that I\r\nadmire, esteem, and love them both (cheers and sobs). The bride\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather, our good friend there, is a noble person, and I am proud to know\r\nhim (great uproar). He is a kind, excellent, independent-spirited, fine-\r\nhearted, hospitable, liberal man (enthusiastic shouts from the poor\r\nrelations, at all the adjectives; and especially at the two last). That\r\nhis daughter may enjoy all the happiness, even he can desire; and that\r\nhe may derive from the contemplation of her felicity all the\r\ngratification of heart and peace of mind which he so well deserves, is,\r\nI am persuaded, our united wish. So, let us drink their healths, and\r\nwish them prolonged life, and every blessing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick concluded amidst a whirlwind of applause; and once more\r\nwere the lungs of the supernumeraries, under Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s command,\r\nbrought into active and efficient operation. Mr. Wardle proposed Mr.\r\nPickwick; Mr. Pickwick proposed the old lady. Mr. Snodgrass proposed Mr.\r\nWardle; Mr. Wardle proposed Mr. Snodgrass. One of the poor relations\r\nproposed Mr. Tupman, and the other poor relation proposed Mr. Winkle;\r\nall was happiness and festivity, until the mysterious disappearance of\r\nboth the poor relations beneath the table, warned the party that it was\r\ntime to adjourn.\r\n\r\nAt dinner they met again, after a five-and-twenty mile walk, undertaken\r\nby the males at Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, to get rid of the effects of\r\nthe wine at breakfast. The poor relations had kept in bed all day, with\r\nthe view of attaining the same happy consummation, but, as they had been\r\nunsuccessful, they stopped there. Mr. Weller kept the domestics in a\r\nstate of perpetual hilarity; and the fat boy divided his time into small\r\nalternate allotments of eating and sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was as hearty an affair as the breakfast, and was quite as\r\nnoisy, without the tears. Then came the dessert and some more toasts.\r\nThen came the tea and coffee; and then, the ball.\r\n\r\nThe best sitting-room at Manor Farm was a good, long, dark-panelled room\r\nwith a high chimney-piece, and a capacious chimney, up which you could\r\nhave driven one of the new patent cabs, wheels and all. At the upper end\r\nof the room, seated in a shady bower of holly and evergreens were the\r\ntwo best fiddlers, and the only harp, in all Muggleton. In all sorts of\r\nrecesses, and on all kinds of brackets, stood massive old silver\r\ncandlesticks with four branches each. The carpet was up, the candles\r\nburned bright, the fire blazed and crackled on the hearth, and merry\r\nvoices and light-hearted laughter rang through the room. If any of the\r\nold English yeomen had turned into fairies when they died, it was just\r\nthe place in which they would have held their revels.\r\n\r\nIf anything could have added to the interest of this agreeable scene, it\r\nwould have been the remarkable fact of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s appearing without\r\nhis gaiters, for the first time within the memory of his oldest friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean to dance?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I do,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see I am dressed for\r\nthe purpose?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick called attention to his speckled silk\r\nstockings, and smartly tied pumps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_You _in silk stockings!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Tupman jocosely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why not, sir--why not?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, turning warmly upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, of course there is no reason why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wear them,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nresponded Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I imagine not, sir--I imagine not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, in a very\r\nperemptory tone.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman had contemplated a laugh, but he found it was a serious\r\nmatter; so he looked grave, and said they were a pretty pattern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope they are,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, fixing his eyes upon his friend.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see nothing extraordinary in the stockings, _as_ stockings, I\r\ntrust, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not. Oh, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Tupman. He walked away;\r\nand Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s countenance resumed its customary benign expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are all ready, I believe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, who was stationed with\r\nthe old lady at the top of the dance, and had already made four false\r\nstarts, in his excessive anxiety to commence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then begin at once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp struck the two fiddles and the one harp, and off went Mr. Pickwick\r\ninto hands across, when there was a general clapping of hands, and a cry\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, who was only brought to, by the\r\nfiddles and harp desisting, and could have been stopped by no other\r\nearthly power, if the house had been on fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Arabella Allen?\xe2\x80\x99 cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Winkle?\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Tupman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here we are!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed that gentleman, emerging with his pretty\r\ncompanion from the corner; as he did so, it would have been hard to tell\r\nwhich was the redder in the face, he or the young lady with the black\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an extraordinary thing it is, Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, rather\r\npettishly, \xe2\x80\x98that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken your place before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a very expressive smile, as his eyes\r\nrested on Arabella, \xe2\x80\x98well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it _was _extraordinary,\r\neither, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no time to think more about the matter, for the\r\nfiddles and harp began in real earnest. Away went Mr. Pickwick--hands\r\nacross--down the middle to the very end of the room, and half-way up the\r\nchimney, back again to the door--poussette everywhere--loud stamp on the\r\nground--ready for the next couple--off again--all the figure over once\r\nmore--another stamp to beat out the time--next couple, and the next, and\r\nthe next again--never was such going; at last, after they had reached\r\nthe bottom of the dance, and full fourteen couple after the old lady had\r\nretired in an exhausted state, and the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been\r\nsubstituted in her stead, did that gentleman, when there was no demand\r\nwhatever on his exertions, keep perpetually dancing in his place, to\r\nkeep time to the music, smiling on his partner all the while with a\r\nblandness of demeanour which baffles all description.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before Mr. Pickwick was weary of dancing, the newly-married couple\r\nhad retired from the scene. There was a glorious supper downstairs,\r\nnotwithstanding, and a good long sitting after it; and when Mr. Pickwick\r\nawoke, late the next morning, he had a confused recollection of having,\r\nseverally and confidentially, invited somewhere about five-and-forty\r\npeople to dine with him at the George and Vulture, the very first time\r\nthey came to London; which Mr. Pickwick rightly considered a pretty\r\ncertain indication of his having taken something besides exercise, on\r\nthe previous night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so your family has games in the kitchen to-night, my dear, has\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam of Emma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Emma; \xe2\x80\x98we always have on Christmas Eve.\r\nMaster wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t neglect to keep it up on any account.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your master\xe2\x80\x99s a wery pretty notion of keeping anythin\xe2\x80\x99 up, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98I never see such a sensible sort of man as he is, or\r\nsuch a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh, that he is!\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy, joining in the conversation; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe breed nice pork!\xe2\x80\x99 The fat youth gave a semi-cannibalic leer at Mr.\r\nWeller, as he thought of the roast legs and gravy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve woke up, at last, have you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, young boa-constructer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller\r\nimpressively; \xe2\x80\x98if you don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep a little less, and exercise a little\r\nmore, wen you comes to be a man you\xe2\x80\x99ll lay yourself open to the same\r\nsort of personal inconwenience as was inflicted on the old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n as\r\nwore the pigtail.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did they do to him?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the fat boy, in a faltering voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98he was one o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nlargest patterns as was ever turned out--reg\xe2\x80\x99lar fat man, as hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncaught a glimpse of his own shoes for five-and-forty year.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Emma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98and if you\xe2\x80\x99d put an\r\nexact model of his own legs on the dinin\xe2\x80\x99-table afore him, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 known \xe2\x80\x98em. Well, he always walks to his office with a wery handsome\r\ngold watch-chain hanging out, about a foot and a quarter, and a gold\r\nwatch in his fob pocket as was worth--I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to say how much, but as\r\nmuch as a watch can be--a large, heavy, round manufacter, as stout for a\r\nwatch, as he was for a man, and with a big face in proportion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter not carry that \xe2\x80\x98ere watch,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s friends,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be robbed on it,\xe2\x80\x9d says they. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I?\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d says they. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see the thief as\r\ncould get this here watch out, for I\xe2\x80\x99m blessed if I ever can, it\xe2\x80\x99s such\r\na tight fit,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cand wenever I vants to know what\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nobliged to stare into the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 shops,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Well, then he laughs\r\nas hearty as if he was a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to pieces, and out he walks agin with his\r\npowdered head and pigtail, and rolls down the Strand with the chain\r\nhangin\xe2\x80\x99 out furder than ever, and the great round watch almost bustin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthrough his gray kersey smalls. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t a pickpocket in all London\r\nas didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a pull at that chain, but the chain \xe2\x80\x98ud never break, and\r\nthe watch \xe2\x80\x98ud never come out, so they soon got tired of dragging such a\r\nheavy old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n along the pavement, and he\xe2\x80\x99d go home and laugh till\r\nthe pigtail wibrated like the penderlum of a Dutch clock. At last, one\r\nday the old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n was a-rollin\xe2\x80\x99 along, and he sees a pickpocket as\r\nhe know\xe2\x80\x99d by sight, a-coming up, arm in arm with a little boy with a\r\nwery large head. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a game,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to have another try, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d So he begins a-\r\nchucklin\xe2\x80\x99 wery hearty, wen, all of a sudden, the little boy leaves hold\r\nof the pickpocket\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and rushes head foremost straight into the old\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s stomach, and for a moment doubles him right up with the\r\npain. \xe2\x80\x9cMurder!\xe2\x80\x9d says the old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\npickpocket, a-wisperin\xe2\x80\x99 in his ear. And wen he come straight agin, the\r\nwatch and chain was gone, and what\xe2\x80\x99s worse than that, the old\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s digestion was all wrong ever afterwards, to the wery last\r\nday of his life; so just you look about you, young feller, and take care\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t get too fat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller concluded this moral tale, with which the fat boy appeared\r\nmuch affected, they all three repaired to the large kitchen, in which\r\nthe family were by this time assembled, according to annual custom on\r\nChristmas Eve, observed by old Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s forefathers from time\r\nimmemorial.\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of the ceiling of this kitchen, old Wardle had just\r\nsuspended, with his own hands, a huge branch of mistletoe, and this same\r\nbranch of mistletoe instantaneously gave rise to a scene of general and\r\nmost delightful struggling and confusion; in the midst of which, Mr.\r\nPickwick, with a gallantry that would have done honour to a descendant\r\nof Lady Tollimglower herself, took the old lady by the hand, led her\r\nbeneath the mystic branch, and saluted her in all courtesy and decorum.\r\nThe old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all\r\nthe dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity, but the\r\nyounger ladies, not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious\r\nveneration for the custom, or imagining that the value of a salute is\r\nvery much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it, screamed\r\nand struggled, and ran into corners, and threatened and remonstrated,\r\nand did everything but leave the room, until some of the less\r\nadventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting, when they all at\r\nonce found it useless to resist any longer, and submitted to be kissed\r\nwith a good grace. Mr. Winkle kissed the young lady with the black eyes,\r\nand Mr. Snodgrass kissed Emily; and Mr. Weller, not being particular\r\nabout the form of being under the mistletoe, kissed Emma and the other\r\nfemale servants, just as he caught them. As to the poor relations, they\r\nkissed everybody, not even excepting the plainer portions of the young\r\nlady visitors, who, in their excessive confusion, ran right under the\r\nmistletoe, as soon as it was hung up, without knowing it! Wardle stood\r\nwith his back to the fire, surveying the whole scene, with the utmost\r\nsatisfaction; and the fat boy took the opportunity of appropriating to\r\nhis own use, and summarily devouring, a particularly fine mince-pie,\r\nthat had been carefully put by, for somebody else.\r\n\r\nNow, the screaming had subsided, and faces were in a glow, and curls in\r\na tangle, and Mr. Pickwick, after kissing the old lady as before\r\nmentioned, was standing under the mistletoe, looking with a very pleased\r\ncountenance on all that was passing around him, when the young lady with\r\nthe black eyes, after a little whispering with the other young ladies,\r\nmade a sudden dart forward, and, putting her arm round Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck, saluted him affectionately on the left cheek; and before Mr.\r\nPickwick distinctly knew what was the matter, he was surrounded by the\r\nwhole body, and kissed by every one of them.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick in the centre of the group,\r\nnow pulled this way, and then that, and first kissed on the chin, and\r\nthen on the nose, and then on the spectacles, and to hear the peals of\r\nlaughter which were raised on every side; but it was a still more\r\npleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick, blinded shortly afterwards with a\r\nsilk handkerchief, falling up against the wall, and scrambling into\r\ncorners, and going through all the mysteries of blind-man\xe2\x80\x99s buff, with\r\nthe utmost relish for the game, until at last he caught one of the poor\r\nrelations, and then had to evade the blind-man himself, which he did\r\nwith a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause\r\nof all beholders. The poor relations caught the people who they thought\r\nwould like it, and, when the game flagged, got caught themselves. When\r\nthey all tired of blind-man\xe2\x80\x99s buff, there was a great game at snap-\r\ndragon, and when fingers enough were burned with that, and all the\r\nraisins were gone, they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a\r\nsubstantial supper, and a mighty bowl of wassail, something smaller than\r\nan ordinary wash-house copper, in which the hot apples were hissing and\r\nbubbling with a rich look, and a jolly sound, that were perfectly\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking round him, \xe2\x80\x98this is, indeed,\r\ncomfort.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Our invariable custom,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Everybody sits\r\ndown with us on Christmas Eve, as you see them now--servants and all;\r\nand here we wait, until the clock strikes twelve, to usher Christmas in,\r\nand beguile the time with forfeits and old stories. Trundle, my boy,\r\nrake up the fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred. The deep\r\nred blaze sent forth a rich glow, that penetrated into the farthest\r\ncorner of the room, and cast its cheerful tint on every face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98a song--a Christmas song! I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you one, in\r\ndefault of a better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fill up,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98It will be two hours, good, before you see the\r\nbottom of the bowl through the deep rich colour of the wassail; fill up\r\nall round, and now for the song.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus saying, the merry old gentleman, in a good, round, sturdy voice,\r\ncommenced without more ado--\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I care not for Spring; on his fickle wing Let the blossoms and buds be\r\nborne; He woos them amain with his treacherous rain, And he scatters\r\nthem ere the morn. An inconstant elf, he knows not himself, Nor his own\r\nchanging mind an hour, He\xe2\x80\x99ll smile in your face, and, with wry grimace,\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll wither your youngest flower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let the Summer sun to his bright home run, He shall never be sought by\r\nme; When he\xe2\x80\x99s dimmed by a cloud I can laugh aloud And care not how sulky\r\nhe be! For his darling child is the madness wild That sports in fierce\r\nfever\xe2\x80\x99s train; And when love is too strong, it don\xe2\x80\x99t last long, As many\r\nhave found to their pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A mild harvest night, by the tranquil light Of the modest and gentle\r\nmoon, Has a far sweeter sheen for me, I ween, Than the broad and\r\nunblushing noon. But every leaf awakens my grief, As it lieth beneath\r\nthe tree; So let Autumn air be never so fair, It by no means agrees with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But my song I troll out, for _Christmas _Stout, The hearty, the true,\r\nand the bold; A bumper I drain, and with might and main Give three\r\ncheers for this Christmas old! We\xe2\x80\x99ll usher him in with a merry din That\r\nshall gladden his joyous heart, And we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep him up, while there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbite or sup, And in fellowship good, we\xe2\x80\x99ll part. \xe2\x80\x98In his fine honest\r\npride, he scorns to hide One jot of his hard-weather scars; They\xe2\x80\x99re no\r\ndisgrace, for there\xe2\x80\x99s much the same trace On the cheeks of our bravest\r\ntars. Then again I sing till the roof doth ring And it echoes from wall\r\nto wall--To the stout old wight, fair welcome to-night, As the King of\r\nthe Seasons all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis song was tumultuously applauded--for friends and dependents make a\r\ncapital audience--and the poor relations, especially, were in perfect\r\necstasies of rapture. Again was the fire replenished, and again went the\r\nwassail round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How it snows!\xe2\x80\x99 said one of the men, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Snows, does it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rough, cold night, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man; \xe2\x80\x98and there\xe2\x80\x99s a wind got up,\r\nthat drifts it across the fields, in a thick white cloud.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does Jem say?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old lady. \xe2\x80\x98There ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything the\r\nmatter, is there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98he says there\xe2\x80\x99s a snowdrift, and a\r\nwind that\xe2\x80\x99s piercing cold. I should know that, by the way it rumbles in\r\nthe chimney.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, \xe2\x80\x98there was just such a wind, and just such a\r\nfall of snow, a good many years back, I recollect--just five years\r\nbefore your poor father died. It was a Christmas Eve, too; and I\r\nremember that on that very night he told us the story about the goblins\r\nthat carried away old Gabriel Grub.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The story about what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, nothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98About an old sexton, that the\r\ngood people down here suppose to have been carried away by goblins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated the old lady. \xe2\x80\x98Is there anybody hardy enough to\r\ndisbelieve it? Suppose! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard ever since you were a child,\r\nthat he _was _carried away by the goblins, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you know he was?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, mother, he was, if you like,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle laughing. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\n_was_ carried away by goblins, Pickwick; and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98not an end of it, I assure you; for I must\r\nhear how, and why, and all about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWardle smiled, as every head was bent forward to hear, and filling out\r\nthe wassail with no stinted hand, nodded a health to Mr. Pickwick, and\r\nbegan as follows--\r\n\r\nBut bless our editorial heart, what a long chapter we have been betrayed\r\ninto! We had quite forgotten all such petty restrictions as chapters, we\r\nsolemnly declare. So here goes, to give the goblin a fair start in a new\r\none. A clear stage and no favour for the goblins, ladies and gentlemen,\r\nif you please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. THE STORY OF THE GOBLINS WHO STOLE A SEXTON\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In an old abbey town, down in this part of the country, a long, long\r\nwhile ago--so long, that the story must be a true one, because our\r\ngreat-grandfathers implicitly believed it--there officiated as sexton\r\nand grave-digger in the churchyard, one Gabriel Grub. It by no means\r\nfollows that because a man is a sexton, and constantly surrounded by the\r\nemblems of mortality, therefore he should be a morose and melancholy\r\nman; your undertakers are the merriest fellows in the world; and I once\r\nhad the honour of being on intimate terms with a mute, who in private\r\nlife, and off duty, was as comical and jocose a little fellow as ever\r\nchirped out a devil-may-care song, without a hitch in his memory, or\r\ndrained off a good stiff glass without stopping for breath. But\r\nnotwithstanding these precedents to the contrary, Gabriel Grub was an\r\nill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow--a morose and lonely man,\r\nwho consorted with nobody but himself, and an old wicker bottle which\r\nfitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket--and who eyed each merry\r\nface, as it passed him by, with such a deep scowl of malice and ill-\r\nhumour, as it was difficult to meet without feeling something the worse\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A little before twilight, one Christmas Eve, Gabriel shouldered his\r\nspade, lighted his lantern, and betook himself towards the old\r\nchurchyard; for he had got a grave to finish by next morning, and,\r\nfeeling very low, he thought it might raise his spirits, perhaps, if he\r\nwent on with his work at once. As he went his way, up the ancient\r\nstreet, he saw the cheerful light of the blazing fires gleam through the\r\nold casements, and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those\r\nwho were assembled around them; he marked the bustling preparations for\r\nnext day\xe2\x80\x99s cheer, and smelled the numerous savoury odours consequent\r\nthereupon, as they steamed up from the kitchen windows in clouds. All\r\nthis was gall and wormwood to the heart of Gabriel Grub; and when groups\r\nof children bounded out of the houses, tripped across the road, and were\r\nmet, before they could knock at the opposite door, by half a dozen\r\ncurly-headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked\r\nupstairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games, Gabriel smiled\r\ngrimly, and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp, as he\r\nthought of measles, scarlet fever, thrush, whooping-cough, and a good\r\nmany other sources of consolation besides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In this happy frame of mind, Gabriel strode along, returning a short,\r\nsullen growl to the good-humoured greetings of such of his neighbours as\r\nnow and then passed him, until he turned into the dark lane which led to\r\nthe churchyard. Now, Gabriel had been looking forward to reaching the\r\ndark lane, because it was, generally speaking, a nice, gloomy, mournful\r\nplace, into which the townspeople did not much care to go, except in\r\nbroad daylight, and when the sun was shining; consequently, he was not a\r\nlittle indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song\r\nabout a merry Christmas, in this very sanctuary which had been called\r\nCoffin Lane ever since the days of the old abbey, and the time of the\r\nshaven-headed monks. As Gabriel walked on, and the voice drew nearer, he\r\nfound it proceeded from a small boy, who was hurrying along, to join one\r\nof the little parties in the old street, and who, partly to keep himself\r\ncompany, and partly to prepare himself for the occasion, was shouting\r\nout the song at the highest pitch of his lungs. So Gabriel waited until\r\nthe boy came up, and then dodged him into a corner, and rapped him over\r\nthe head with his lantern five or six times, just to teach him to\r\nmodulate his voice. And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his\r\nhead, singing quite a different sort of tune, Gabriel Grub chuckled very\r\nheartily to himself, and entered the churchyard, locking the gate behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He took off his coat, set down his lantern, and getting into the\r\nunfinished grave, worked at it for an hour or so with right good-will.\r\nBut the earth was hardened with the frost, and it was no very easy\r\nmatter to break it up, and shovel it out; and although there was a moon,\r\nit was a very young one, and shed little light upon the grave, which was\r\nin the shadow of the church. At any other time, these obstacles would\r\nhave made Gabriel Grub very moody and miserable, but he was so well\r\npleased with having stopped the small boy\xe2\x80\x99s singing, that he took little\r\nheed of the scanty progress he had made, and looked down into the grave,\r\nwhen he had finished work for the night, with grim satisfaction,\r\nmurmuring as he gathered up his things--\r\n\r\n\r\nBrave lodgings for one, brave lodgings for one, A few feet of cold\r\nearth, when life is done; A stone at the head, a stone at the feet, A\r\nrich, juicy meal for the worms to eat; Rank grass overhead, and damp\r\nclay around, Brave lodgings for one, these, in holy ground!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHo! ho!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Gabriel Grub, as he sat himself down on a flat\r\ntombstone which was a favourite resting-place of his, and drew forth his\r\nwicker bottle. \xe2\x80\x9cA coffin at Christmas! A Christmas box! Ho! ho! ho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHo! ho! ho!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated a voice which sounded close behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gabriel paused, in some alarm, in the act of raising the wicker bottle\r\nto his lips, and looked round. The bottom of the oldest grave about him\r\nwas not more still and quiet than the churchyard in the pale moonlight.\r\nThe cold hoar frost glistened on the tombstones, and sparkled like rows\r\nof gems, among the stone carvings of the old church. The snow lay hard\r\nand crisp upon the ground; and spread over the thickly-strewn mounds of\r\nearth, so white and smooth a cover that it seemed as if corpses lay\r\nthere, hidden only by their winding sheets. Not the faintest rustle\r\nbroke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene. Sound itself\r\nappeared to be frozen up, all was so cold and still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the echoes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel Grub, raising the bottle to his lips\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt was _not_,\xe2\x80\x9d said a deep voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gabriel started up, and stood rooted to the spot with astonishment and\r\nterror; for his eyes rested on a form that made his blood run cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seated on an upright tombstone, close to him, was a strange, unearthly\r\nfigure, whom Gabriel felt at once, was no being of this world. His long,\r\nfantastic legs which might have reached the ground, were cocked up, and\r\ncrossed after a quaint, fantastic fashion; his sinewy arms were bare;\r\nand his hands rested on his knees. On his short, round body, he wore a\r\nclose covering, ornamented with small slashes; a short cloak dangled at\r\nhis back; the collar was cut into curious peaks, which served the goblin\r\nin lieu of ruff or neckerchief; and his shoes curled up at his toes into\r\nlong points. On his head, he wore a broad-brimmed sugar-loaf hat,\r\ngarnished with a single feather. The hat was covered with the white\r\nfrost; and the goblin looked as if he had sat on the same tombstone very\r\ncomfortably, for two or three hundred years. He was sitting perfectly\r\nstill; his tongue was put out, as if in derision; and he was grinning at\r\nGabriel Grub with such a grin as only a goblin could call up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt was _not _the echoes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gabriel Grub was paralysed, and could make no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do here on Christmas Eve?\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI came to dig a grave, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Gabriel Grub.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man wanders among graves and churchyards on such a night as\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the goblin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed a wild chorus of voices that\r\nseemed to fill the churchyard. Gabriel looked fearfully round--nothing\r\nwas to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got in that bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHollands, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sexton, trembling more than ever; for he\r\nhad bought it of the smugglers, and he thought that perhaps his\r\nquestioner might be in the excise department of the goblins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWho drinks Hollands alone, and in a churchyard, on such a night as\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the wild voices again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The goblin leered maliciously at the terrified sexton, and then raising\r\nhis voice, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who, then, is our fair and lawful prize?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To this inquiry the invisible chorus replied, in a strain that sounded\r\nlike the voices of many choristers singing to the mighty swell of the\r\nold church organ--a strain that seemed borne to the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s ears upon a\r\nwild wind, and to die away as it passed onward; but the burden of the\r\nreply was still the same, \xe2\x80\x9cGabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The goblin grinned a broader grin than before, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nGabriel, what do you say to this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sexton gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of this, Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin, kicking up his\r\nfeet in the air on either side of the tombstone, and looking at the\r\nturned-up points with as much complacency as if he had been\r\ncontemplating the most fashionable pair of Wellingtons in all Bond\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s--very curious, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sexton, half dead with\r\nfright; \xe2\x80\x9cvery curious, and very pretty, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and\r\nfinish my work, Sir, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWork!\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe grave, Sir; making the grave,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the sexton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the grave, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin; \xe2\x80\x9cwho makes graves at a time when\r\nall other men are merry, and takes a pleasure in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again the mysterious voices replied, \xe2\x80\x9cGabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid my friends want you, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin, thrusting\r\nhis tongue farther into his cheek than ever--and a most astonishing\r\ntongue it was--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid my friends want you, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngoblin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cUnder favour, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the horror-stricken sexton, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nthey can, Sir; they don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, Sir; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the gentlemen have\r\never seen me, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, they have,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the goblin; \xe2\x80\x9cwe know the man with the\r\nsulky face and grim scowl, that came down the street to-night, throwing\r\nhis evil looks at the children, and grasping his burying-spade the\r\ntighter. We know the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his\r\nheart, because the boy could be merry, and he could not. We know him, we\r\nknow him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, the goblin gave a loud, shrill laugh, which the echoes returned\r\ntwentyfold; and throwing his legs up in the air, stood upon his head, or\r\nrather upon the very point of his sugar-loaf hat, on the narrow edge of\r\nthe tombstone, whence he threw a Somerset with extraordinary agility,\r\nright to the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s feet, at which he planted himself in the attitude\r\nin which tailors generally sit upon the shop-board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI--I--am afraid I must leave you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sexton, making an\r\neffort to move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLeave us!\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin, \xe2\x80\x9cGabriel Grub going to leave us. Ho! ho!\r\nho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the goblin laughed, the sexton observed, for one instant, a\r\nbrilliant illumination within the windows of the church, as if the whole\r\nbuilding were lighted up; it disappeared, the organ pealed forth a\r\nlively air, and whole troops of goblins, the very counterpart of the\r\nfirst one, poured into the churchyard, and began playing at leap-frog\r\nwith the tombstones, never stopping for an instant to take breath, but\r\n\xe2\x80\x9covering\xe2\x80\x9d the highest among them, one after the other, with the most\r\nmarvellous dexterity. The first goblin was a most astonishing leaper,\r\nand none of the others could come near him; even in the extremity of his\r\nterror the sexton could not help observing, that while his friends were\r\ncontent to leap over the common-sized gravestones, the first one took\r\nthe family vaults, iron railings and all, with as much ease as if they\r\nhad been so many street-posts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At last the game reached to a most exciting pitch; the organ played\r\nquicker and quicker, and the goblins leaped faster and faster, coiling\r\nthemselves up, rolling head over heels upon the ground, and bounding\r\nover the tombstones like footballs. The sexton\xe2\x80\x99s brain whirled round\r\nwith the rapidity of the motion he beheld, and his legs reeled beneath\r\nhim, as the spirits flew before his eyes; when the goblin king, suddenly\r\ndarting towards him, laid his hand upon his collar, and sank with him\r\nthrough the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Gabriel Grub had had time to fetch his breath, which the rapidity\r\nof his descent had for the moment taken away, he found himself in what\r\nappeared to be a large cavern, surrounded on all sides by crowds of\r\ngoblins, ugly and grim; in the centre of the room, on an elevated seat,\r\nwas stationed his friend of the churchyard; and close behind him stood\r\nGabriel Grub himself, without power of motion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCold to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king of the goblins, \xe2\x80\x9cvery cold. A glass of\r\nsomething warm here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At this command, half a dozen officious goblins, with a perpetual smile\r\nupon their faces, whom Gabriel Grub imagined to be courtiers, on that\r\naccount, hastily disappeared, and presently returned with a goblet of\r\nliquid fire, which they presented to the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the goblin, whose cheeks and throat were transparent, as he\r\ntossed down the flame, \xe2\x80\x9cthis warms one, indeed! Bring a bumper of the\r\nsame, for Mr. Grub.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he was not in\r\nthe habit of taking anything warm at night; one of the goblins held him\r\nwhile another poured the blazing liquid down his throat; the whole\r\nassembly screeched with laughter, as he coughed and choked, and wiped\r\naway the tears which gushed plentifully from his eyes, after swallowing\r\nthe burning draught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, fantastically poking the taper corner of his\r\nsugar-loaf hat into the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and thereby occasioning him the\r\nmost exquisite pain; \xe2\x80\x9cand now, show the man of misery and gloom, a few\r\nof the pictures from our own great storehouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the goblin said this, a thick cloud which obscured the remoter end\r\nof the cavern rolled gradually away, and disclosed, apparently at a\r\ngreat distance, a small and scantily furnished, but neat and clean\r\napartment. A crowd of little children were gathered round a bright fire,\r\nclinging to their mother\xe2\x80\x99s gown, and gambolling around her chair. The\r\nmother occasionally rose, and drew aside the window-curtain, as if to\r\nlook for some expected object; a frugal meal was ready spread upon the\r\ntable; and an elbow chair was placed near the fire. A knock was heard at\r\nthe door; the mother opened it, and the children crowded round her, and\r\nclapped their hands for joy, as their father entered. He was wet and\r\nweary, and shook the snow from his garments, as the children crowded\r\nround him, and seizing his cloak, hat, stick, and gloves, with busy\r\nzeal, ran with them from the room. Then, as he sat down to his meal\r\nbefore the fire, the children climbed about his knee, and the mother sat\r\nby his side, and all seemed happiness and comfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But a change came upon the view, almost imperceptibly. The scene was\r\naltered to a small bedroom, where the fairest and youngest child lay\r\ndying; the roses had fled from his cheek, and the light from his eye;\r\nand even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never\r\nfelt or known before, he died. His young brothers and sisters crowded\r\nround his little bed, and seized his tiny hand, so cold and heavy; but\r\nthey shrank back from its touch, and looked with awe on his infant face;\r\nfor calm and tranquil as it was, and sleeping in rest and peace as the\r\nbeautiful child seemed to be, they saw that he was dead, and they knew\r\nthat he was an angel looking down upon, and blessing them, from a bright\r\nand happy Heaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again the light cloud passed across the picture, and again the subject\r\nchanged. The father and mother were old and helpless now, and the number\r\nof those about them was diminished more than half; but content and\r\ncheerfulness sat on every face, and beamed in every eye, as they crowded\r\nround the fireside, and told and listened to old stories of earlier and\r\nbygone days. Slowly and peacefully, the father sank into the grave, and,\r\nsoon after, the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a\r\nplace of rest. The few who yet survived them, kneeled by their tomb, and\r\nwatered the green turf which covered it with their tears; then rose, and\r\nturned away, sadly and mournfully, but not with bitter cries, or\r\ndespairing lamentations, for they knew that they should one day meet\r\nagain; and once more they mixed with the busy world, and their content\r\nand cheerfulness were restored. The cloud settled upon the picture, and\r\nconcealed it from the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin, turning his large face\r\ntowards Gabriel Grub.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty, and looked\r\nsomewhat ashamed, as the goblin bent his fiery eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou a miserable man!\xe2\x80\x9d said the goblin, in a tone of excessive\r\ncontempt. \xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared disposed to add more, but indignation\r\nchoked his utterance, so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs, and,\r\nflourishing it above his head a little, to insure his aim, administered\r\na good sound kick to Gabriel Grub; immediately after which, all the\r\ngoblins in waiting crowded round the wretched sexton, and kicked him\r\nwithout mercy, according to the established and invariable custom of\r\ncourtiers upon earth, who kick whom royalty kicks, and hug whom royalty\r\nhugs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShow him some more!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king of the goblins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At these words, the cloud was dispelled, and a rich and beautiful\r\nlandscape was disclosed to view--there is just such another, to this\r\nday, within half a mile of the old abbey town. The sun shone from out\r\nthe clear blue sky, the water sparkled beneath his rays, and the trees\r\nlooked greener, and the flowers more gay, beneath its cheering\r\ninfluence. The water rippled on with a pleasant sound, the trees rustled\r\nin the light wind that murmured among their leaves, the birds sang upon\r\nthe boughs, and the lark carolled on high her welcome to the morning.\r\nYes, it was morning; the bright, balmy morning of summer; the minutest\r\nleaf, the smallest blade of grass, was instinct with life. The ant crept\r\nforth to her daily toil, the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm\r\nrays of the sun; myriads of insects spread their transparent wings, and\r\nrevelled in their brief but happy existence. Man walked forth, elated\r\nwith the scene; and all was brightness and splendour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d_You _a miserable man!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king of the goblins, in a more\r\ncontemptuous tone than before. And again the king of the goblins gave\r\nhis leg a flourish; again it descended on the shoulders of the sexton;\r\nand again the attendant goblins imitated the example of their chief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many a time the cloud went and came, and many a lesson it taught to\r\nGabriel Grub, who, although his shoulders smarted with pain from the\r\nfrequent applications of the goblins\xe2\x80\x99 feet thereunto, looked on with an\r\ninterest that nothing could diminish. He saw that men who worked hard,\r\nand earned their scanty bread with lives of labour, were cheerful and\r\nhappy; and that to the most ignorant, the sweet face of Nature was a\r\nnever-failing source of cheerfulness and joy. He saw those who had been\r\ndelicately nurtured, and tenderly brought up, cheerful under privations,\r\nand superior to suffering, that would have crushed many of a rougher\r\ngrain, because they bore within their own bosoms the materials of\r\nhappiness, contentment, and peace. He saw that women, the tenderest and\r\nmost fragile of all God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures, were the oftenest superior to\r\nsorrow, adversity, and distress; and he saw that it was because they\r\nbore, in their own hearts, an inexhaustible well-spring of affection and\r\ndevotion. Above all, he saw that men like himself, who snarled at the\r\nmirth and cheerfulness of others, were the foulest weeds on the fair\r\nsurface of the earth; and setting all the good of the world against the\r\nevil, he came to the conclusion that it was a very decent and\r\nrespectable sort of world after all. No sooner had he formed it, than\r\nthe cloud which had closed over the last picture, seemed to settle on\r\nhis senses, and lull him to repose. One by one, the goblins faded from\r\nhis sight; and, as the last one disappeared, he sank to sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The day had broken when Gabriel Grub awoke, and found himself lying at\r\nfull length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard, with the wicker\r\nbottle lying empty by his side, and his coat, spade, and lantern, all\r\nwell whitened by the last night\xe2\x80\x99s frost, scattered on the ground. The\r\nstone on which he had first seen the goblin seated, stood bolt upright\r\nbefore him, and the grave at which he had worked, the night before, was\r\nnot far off. At first, he began to doubt the reality of his adventures,\r\nbut the acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise, assured\r\nhim that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal. He was\r\nstaggered again, by observing no traces of footsteps in the snow on\r\nwhich the goblins had played at leap-frog with the gravestones, but he\r\nspeedily accounted for this circumstance when he remembered that, being\r\nspirits, they would leave no visible impression behind them. So, Gabriel\r\nGrub got on his feet as well as he could, for the pain in his back; and,\r\nbrushing the frost off his coat, put it on, and turned his face towards\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he was an altered man, and he could not bear the thought of\r\nreturning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at, and his\r\nreformation disbelieved. He hesitated for a few moments; and then turned\r\naway to wander where he might, and seek his bread elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The lantern, the spade, and the wicker bottle were found, that day, in\r\nthe churchyard. There were a great many speculations about the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfate, at first, but it was speedily determined that he had been carried\r\naway by the goblins; and there were not wanting some very credible\r\nwitnesses who had distinctly seen him whisked through the air on the\r\nback of a chestnut horse blind of one eye, with the hind-quarters of a\r\nlion, and the tail of a bear. At length all this was devoutly believed;\r\nand the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious, for a trifling\r\nemolument, a good-sized piece of the church weathercock which had been\r\naccidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his aerial flight, and\r\npicked up by himself in the churchyard, a year or two afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately, these stories were somewhat disturbed by the unlooked-\r\nfor reappearance of Gabriel Grub himself, some ten years afterwards, a\r\nragged, contented, rheumatic old man. He told his story to the\r\nclergyman, and also to the mayor; and in course of time it began to be\r\nreceived as a matter of history, in which form it has continued down to\r\nthis very day. The believers in the weathercock tale, having misplaced\r\ntheir confidence once, were not easily prevailed upon to part with it\r\nagain, so they looked as wise as they could, shrugged their shoulders,\r\ntouched their foreheads, and murmured something about Gabriel Grub\r\nhaving drunk all the Hollands, and then fallen asleep on the flat\r\ntombstone; and they affected to explain what he supposed he had\r\nwitnessed in the goblin\xe2\x80\x99s cavern, by saying that he had seen the world,\r\nand grown wiser. But this opinion, which was by no means a popular one\r\nat any time, gradually died off; and be the matter how it may, as\r\nGabriel Grub was afflicted with rheumatism to the end of his days, this\r\nstory has at least one moral, if it teach no better one--and that is,\r\nthat if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at Christmas time, he may\r\nmake up his mind to be not a bit the better for it: let the spirits be\r\nnever so good, or let them be even as many degrees beyond proof, as\r\nthose which Gabriel Grub saw in the goblin\xe2\x80\x99s cavern.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. HOW THE PICKWICKIANS MADE AND CULTIVATED THE ACQUAINTANCE\r\nOF A COUPLE OF NICE YOUNG MEN BELONGING TO ONE OF THE LIBERAL\r\nPROFESSIONS; HOW THEY DISPORTED THEMSELVES ON THE ICE; AND HOW THEIR\r\nVISIT CAME TO A CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWell, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as that favoured servitor entered his\r\nbed-chamber, with his warm water, on the morning of Christmas Day,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98still frosty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Water in the wash-hand basin\xe2\x80\x99s a mask o\xe2\x80\x99 ice, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Severe weather, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine time for them as is well wropped up, as the Polar bear said to\r\nhimself, ven he was practising his skating,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be down in a quarter of an hour, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nuntying his nightcap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 sawbones\r\ndownstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A couple of what!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, sitting up in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A couple o\xe2\x80\x99 sawbones,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s a sawbones?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, not quite certain whether it\r\nwas a live animal, or something to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know what a sawbones is, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthought everybody know\xe2\x80\x99d as a sawbones was a surgeon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, a surgeon, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just that, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98These here ones as is below, though,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t reg\xe2\x80\x99lar thoroughbred sawbones; they\xe2\x80\x99re only in trainin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn other words they\xe2\x80\x99re medical students, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nSam Weller nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, casting his nightcap energetically\r\non the counterpane. \xe2\x80\x98They are fine fellows--very fine fellows; with\r\njudgments matured by observation and reflection; and tastes refined by\r\nreading and study. I am very glad of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re a-smokin\xe2\x80\x99 cigars by the kitchen fire,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his hands, \xe2\x80\x98overflowing with kindly\r\nfeelings and animal spirits. Just what I like to see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd one on \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, not noticing his master\xe2\x80\x99s interruption, \xe2\x80\x98one\r\non \xe2\x80\x98em\xe2\x80\x99s got his legs on the table, and is a-drinking brandy neat, vile\r\nthe t\xe2\x80\x99other one--him in the barnacles--has got a barrel o\xe2\x80\x99 oysters\r\natween his knees, which he\xe2\x80\x99s a-openin\xe2\x80\x99 like steam, and as fast as he\r\neats \xe2\x80\x98em, he takes a aim vith the shells at young dropsy, who\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsittin\xe2\x80\x99 down fast asleep, in the chimbley corner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eccentricities of genius, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98You may retire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam did retire accordingly. Mr. Pickwick at the expiration of the\r\nquarter of an hour, went down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here he is at last!\xe2\x80\x99 said old Mr. Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Pickwick, this is Miss\r\nAllen\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Mr. Benjamin Allen. Ben we call him, and so may you, if\r\nyou like. This gentleman is his very particular friend, Mr.--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bob Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen; whereupon Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen laughed in concert.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick bowed to Bob Sawyer, and Bob Sawyer bowed to Mr. Pickwick.\r\nBob and his very particular friend then applied themselves most\r\nassiduously to the eatables before them; and Mr. Pickwick had an\r\nopportunity of glancing at them both.\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen was a coarse, stout, thick-set young man, with black\r\nhair cut rather short, and a white face cut rather long. He was\r\nembellished with spectacles, and wore a white neckerchief. Below his\r\nsingle-breasted black surtout, which was buttoned up to his chin,\r\nappeared the usual number of pepper-and-salt coloured legs, terminating\r\nin a pair of imperfectly polished boots. Although his coat was short in\r\nthe sleeves, it disclosed no vestige of a linen wristband; and although\r\nthere was quite enough of his face to admit of the encroachment of a\r\nshirt collar, it was not graced by the smallest approach to that\r\nappendage. He presented, altogether, rather a mildewy appearance, and\r\nemitted a fragrant odour of full-flavoured Cubas.\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer, who was habited in a coarse, blue coat, which, without\r\nbeing either a greatcoat or a surtout, partook of the nature and\r\nqualities of both, had about him that sort of slovenly smartness, and\r\nswaggering gait, which is peculiar to young gentlemen who smoke in the\r\nstreets by day, shout and scream in the same by night, call waiters by\r\ntheir Christian names, and do various other acts and deeds of an equally\r\nfacetious description. He wore a pair of plaid trousers, and a large,\r\nrough, double-breasted waistcoat; out of doors, he carried a thick stick\r\nwith a big top. He eschewed gloves, and looked, upon the whole,\r\nsomething like a dissipated Robinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nSuch were the two worthies to whom Mr. Pickwick was introduced, as he\r\ntook his seat at the breakfast-table on Christmas morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Splendid morning, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer slightly nodded his assent to the proposition, and asked\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen for the mustard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you come far this morning, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blue Lion at Muggleton,\xe2\x80\x99 briefly responded Mr. Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should have joined us last night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So we should,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98but the brandy was too good to\r\nleave in a hurry; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Ben?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen; \xe2\x80\x98and the cigars were not bad, or\r\nthe pork-chops either; were they, Bob?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Decidedly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob. The particular friends resumed their attack\r\nupon the breakfast, more freely than before, as if the recollection of\r\nlast night\xe2\x80\x99s supper had imparted a new relish to the meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peg away, Bob,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Allen, to his companion, encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I do,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer. And so, to do him justice, he did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing like dissecting, to give one an appetite,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer,\r\nlooking round the table.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick slightly shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the bye, Bob,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Allen, \xe2\x80\x98have you finished that leg yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nearly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sawyer, helping himself to half a fowl as he spoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a very muscular one for a child\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIs it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Allen carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, with his mouth full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve put my name down for an arm at our place,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Allen. \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nclubbing for a subject, and the list is nearly full, only we can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nhold of any fellow that wants a head. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d take it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied \xe2\x80\x98Bob Sawyer; \xe2\x80\x98can\xe2\x80\x99t afford expensive luxuries.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 said Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind a brain, but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand a whole head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHush, hush, gentlemen, pray,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I hear the ladies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick spoke, the ladies, gallantly escorted by Messrs.\r\nSnodgrass, Winkle, and Tupman, returned from an early walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Ben!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, in a tone which expressed more surprise than\r\npleasure at the sight of her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come to take you home to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Benjamin.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle turned pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see Bob Sawyer, Arabella?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen,\r\nsomewhat reproachfully. Arabella gracefully held out her hand, in\r\nacknowledgment of Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s presence. A thrill of hatred struck to\r\nMr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s heart, as Bob Sawyer inflicted on the proffered hand a\r\nperceptible squeeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ben, dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, blushing; \xe2\x80\x98have--have--you been introduced\r\nto Mr. Winkle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not been, but I shall be very happy to be, Arabella,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nher brother gravely. Here Mr. Allen bowed grimly to Mr. Winkle, while\r\nMr. Winkle and Mr. Bob Sawyer glanced mutual distrust out of the corners\r\nof their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the two new visitors, and the consequent check upon Mr.\r\nWinkle and the young lady with the fur round her boots, would in all\r\nprobability have proved a very unpleasant interruption to the hilarity\r\nof the party, had not the cheerfulness of Mr. Pickwick, and the good\r\nhumour of the host, been exerted to the very utmost for the common weal.\r\nMr. Winkle gradually insinuated himself into the good graces of Mr.\r\nBenjamin Allen, and even joined in a friendly conversation with Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer; who, enlivened with the brandy, and the breakfast, and the\r\ntalking, gradually ripened into a state of extreme facetiousness, and\r\nrelated with much glee an agreeable anecdote, about the removal of a\r\ntumour on some gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s head, which he illustrated by means of an\r\noyster-knife and a half-quartern loaf, to the great edification of the\r\nassembled company. Then the whole train went to church, where Mr.\r\nBenjamin Allen fell fast asleep; while Mr. Bob Sawyer abstracted his\r\nthoughts from worldly matters, by the ingenious process of carving his\r\nname on the seat of the pew, in corpulent letters of four inches long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, after a substantial lunch, with the agreeable items\r\nof strong beer and cherry-brandy, had been done ample justice to, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\nsay you to an hour on the ice? We shall have plenty of time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prime!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You skate, of course, Winkle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye-yes; oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98I--I--am _rather _out of\r\npractice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, _do_ skate, Mr. Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x98I like to see it so much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it is _so_ graceful,\xe2\x80\x99 said another young lady.\r\n\r\nA third young lady said it was elegant, and a fourth expressed her\r\nopinion that it was \xe2\x80\x98swan-like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be very happy, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, reddening; \xe2\x80\x98but I\r\nhave no skates.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis objection was at once overruled. Trundle had a couple of pair, and\r\nthe fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more downstairs;\r\nwhereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight, and looked exquisitely\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nOld Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the fat boy\r\nand Mr. Weller, having shovelled and swept away the snow which had\r\nfallen on it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a\r\ndexterity which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and described\r\ncircles with his left leg, and cut figures of eight, and inscribed upon\r\nthe ice, without once stopping for breath, a great many other pleasant\r\nand astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick,\r\nMr. Tupman, and the ladies; which reached a pitch of positive\r\nenthusiasm, when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the\r\naforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some mystic evolutions, which they\r\ncalled a reel.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue with the cold,\r\nhad been forcing a gimlet into the sole of his feet, and putting his\r\nskates on, with the points behind, and getting the straps into a very\r\ncomplicated and entangled state, with the assistance of Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nwho knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo. At length, however,\r\nwith the assistance of Mr. Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly\r\nscrewed and buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, then, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, in an encouraging tone; \xe2\x80\x98off vith you, and\r\nshow \xe2\x80\x98em how to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, Sam, stop!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently, and clutching\r\nhold of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s arms with the grasp of a drowning man. \xe2\x80\x98How slippery it\r\nis, Sam!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not an uncommon thing upon ice, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Hold up,\r\nSir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis last observation of Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s bore reference to a demonstration\r\nMr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic desire to throw his feet in\r\nthe air, and dash the back of his head on the ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These--these--are very awkward skates; ain\xe2\x80\x99t they, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nWinkle, staggering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeerd there\xe2\x80\x99s a orkard gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n in \xe2\x80\x98em, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that there was\r\nanything the matter. \xe2\x80\x98Come; the ladies are all anxiety.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m coming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to begin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, endeavouring to disengage himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Sir, start off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop an instant, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging most affectionately\r\nto Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98I find I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of coats at home that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant, Sam. You may have them, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind touching your hat, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle hastily. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t take your hand away to do that. I meant to have given you five\r\nshillings this morning for a Christmas box, Sam. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it you this\r\nafternoon, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just hold me at first, Sam; will you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98There--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright. I shall soon get in the way of it, Sam. Not too fast, Sam; not\r\ntoo fast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, stooping forward, with his body half doubled up, was being\r\nassisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a very singular and un-swan-like\r\nmanner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite\r\nbank--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here. I want you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let go, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear the governor a-callin\xe2\x80\x99? Let go,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself from the grasp of\r\nthe agonised Pickwickian, and, in so doing, administered a considerable\r\nimpetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle. With an accuracy which no degree of\r\ndexterity or practice could have insured, that unfortunate gentleman\r\nbore swiftly down into the centre of the reel, at the very moment when\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty. Mr.\r\nWinkle struck wildly against him, and with a loud crash they both fell\r\nheavily down. Mr. Pickwick ran to the spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to his\r\nfeet, but Mr. Winkle was far too wise to do anything of the kind, in\r\nskates. He was seated on the ice, making spasmodic efforts to smile; but\r\nanguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you hurt?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d let me bleed you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin, with great\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really think you had better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do _you _think, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr. Weller, and\r\nsaid in a stern voice, \xe2\x80\x98Take his skates off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; but really I had scarcely begun,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take his skates off,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Pickwick firmly.\r\n\r\nThe command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle allowed Sam to obey it,\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lift him up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to rise.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders; and,\r\nbeckoning his friend to approach, fixed a searching look upon him, and\r\nuttered in a low, but distinct and emphatic tone, these remarkable\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a humbug, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A humbug, Sir. I will speak plainer, if you wish it. An impostor, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith those words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel, and rejoined\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment just\r\nrecorded, Mr. Weller and the fat boy, having by their joint endeavours\r\ncut out a slide, were exercising themselves thereupon, in a very\r\nmasterly and brilliant manner. Sam Weller, in particular, was displaying\r\nthat beautiful feat of fancy-sliding which is currently denominated\r\n\xe2\x80\x98knocking at the cobbler\xe2\x80\x99s door,\xe2\x80\x99 and which is achieved by skimming over\r\nthe ice on one foot, and occasionally giving a postman\xe2\x80\x99s knock upon it\r\nwith the other. It was a good long slide, and there was something in the\r\nmotion which Mr. Pickwick, who was very cold with standing still, could\r\nnot help envying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It looks a nice warm exercise that, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired of Wardle,\r\nwhen that gentleman was thoroughly out of breath, by reason of the\r\nindefatigable manner in which he had converted his legs into a pair of\r\ncompasses, and drawn complicated problems on the ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, it does, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Do you slide?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used to do so, on the gutters, when I was a boy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try it now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, do, please, Mr. Pickwick!\xe2\x80\x99 cried all the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be very happy to afford you any amusement,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done such a thing these thirty years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh! pooh! Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, dragging off his skates with the\r\nimpetuosity which characterised all his proceedings. \xe2\x80\x98Here; I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep\r\nyou company; come along!\xe2\x80\x99 And away went the good-tempered old fellow\r\ndown the slide, with a rapidity which came very close upon Mr. Weller,\r\nand beat the fat boy all to nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paused, considered, pulled off his gloves and put them in\r\nhis hat; took two or three short runs, baulked himself as often, and at\r\nlast took another run, and went slowly and gravely down the slide, with\r\nhis feet about a yard and a quarter apart, amidst the gratified shouts\r\nof all the spectators.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep the pot a-bilin\xe2\x80\x99, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; and down went Wardle again, and\r\nthen Mr. Pickwick, and then Sam, and then Mr. Winkle, and then Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer, and then the fat boy, and then Mr. Snodgrass, following closely\r\nupon each other\xe2\x80\x99s heels, and running after each other with as much\r\neagerness as if their future prospects in life depended on their\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nIt was the most intensely interesting thing, to observe the manner in\r\nwhich Mr. Pickwick performed his share in the ceremony; to watch the\r\ntorture of anxiety with which he viewed the person behind, gaining upon\r\nhim at the imminent hazard of tripping him up; to see him gradually\r\nexpend the painful force he had put on at first, and turn slowly round\r\non the slide, with his face towards the point from which he had started;\r\nto contemplate the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had\r\naccomplished the distance, and the eagerness with which he turned round\r\nwhen he had done so, and ran after his predecessor, his black gaiters\r\ntripping pleasantly through the snow, and his eyes beaming cheerfulness\r\nand gladness through his spectacles. And when he was knocked down (which\r\nhappened upon the average every third round), it was the most\r\ninvigorating sight that can possibly be imagined, to behold him gather\r\nup his hat, gloves, and handkerchief, with a glowing countenance, and\r\nresume his station in the rank, with an ardour and enthusiasm that\r\nnothing Could abate.\r\n\r\nThe sport was at its height, the sliding was at the quickest, the\r\nlaughter was at the loudest, when a sharp smart crack was heard. There\r\nwas a quick rush towards the bank, a wild scream from the ladies, and a\r\nshout from Mr. Tupman. A large mass of ice disappeared; the water\r\nbubbled up over it; Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hat, gloves, and handkerchief were\r\nfloating on the surface; and this was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody\r\ncould see.\r\n\r\nDismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance; the males turned\r\npale, and the females fainted; Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle grasped each\r\nother by the hand, and gazed at the spot where their leader had gone\r\ndown, with frenzied eagerness; while Mr. Tupman, by way of rendering the\r\npromptest assistance, and at the same time conveying to any persons who\r\nmight be within hearing, the clearest possible notion of the\r\ncatastrophe, ran off across the country at his utmost speed, screaming\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fire!\xe2\x80\x99 with all his might.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, when old Wardle and Sam Weller were approaching\r\nthe hole with cautious steps, and Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a\r\nhurried consultation with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding\r\nthe company generally, as an improving little bit of professional\r\npractice--it was at this very moment, that a face, head, and shoulders,\r\nemerged from beneath the water, and disclosed the features and\r\nspectacles of Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep yourself up for an instant--for only one instant!\xe2\x80\x99 bawled Mr.\r\nSnodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, do; let me implore you--for my sake!\xe2\x80\x99 roared Mr. Winkle, deeply\r\naffected. The adjuration was rather unnecessary; the probability being,\r\nthat if Mr. Pickwick had declined to keep himself up for anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so, for his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the water from his head\r\nand face, and gasping for breath. \xe2\x80\x98I fell upon my back. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\non my feet at first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s coat as was yet visible, bore\r\ntestimony to the accuracy of this statement; and as the fears of the\r\nspectators were still further relieved by the fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly\r\nrecollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep,\r\nprodigies of valour were performed to get him out. After a vast quantity\r\nof splashing, and cracking, and struggling, Mr. Pickwick was at length\r\nfairly extricated from his unpleasant position, and once more stood on\r\ndry land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll catch his death of cold,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear old thing!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x98Let me wrap this shawl round you, Mr.\r\nPickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing you can do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98and when you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot it on, run home as fast as your legs can carry you, and jump into\r\nbed directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA dozen shawls were offered on the instant. Three or four of the\r\nthickest having been selected, Mr. Pickwick was wrapped up, and started\r\noff, under the guidance of Mr. Weller; presenting the singular\r\nphenomenon of an elderly gentleman, dripping wet, and without a hat,\r\nwith his arms bound down to his sides, skimming over the ground, without\r\nany clearly-defined purpose, at the rate of six good English miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case, and\r\nurged on by Sam Weller, he kept at the very top of his speed until he\r\nreached the door of Manor Farm, where Mr. Tupman had arrived some five\r\nminutes before, and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of the\r\nheart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen\r\nchimney was on fire--a calamity which always presented itself in glowing\r\ncolours to the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s mind, when anybody about her evinced the\r\nsmallest agitation.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed. Sam Weller\r\nlighted a blazing fire in the room, and took up his dinner; a bowl of\r\npunch was carried up afterwards, and a grand carouse held in honour of\r\nhis safety. Old Wardle would not hear of his rising, so they made the\r\nbed the chair, and Mr. Pickwick presided. A second and a third bowl were\r\nordered in; and when Mr. Pickwick awoke next morning, there was not a\r\nsymptom of rheumatism about him; which proves, as Mr. Bob Sawyer very\r\njustly observed, that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases; and\r\nthat if ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive, it was merely\r\nbecause the patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking enough of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe jovial party broke up next morning. Breakings-up are capital things\r\nin our school-days, but in after life they are painful enough. Death,\r\nself-interest, and fortune\xe2\x80\x99s changes, are every day breaking up many a\r\nhappy group, and scattering them far and wide; and the boys and girls\r\nnever come back again. We do not mean to say that it was exactly the\r\ncase in this particular instance; all we wish to inform the reader is,\r\nthat the different members of the party dispersed to their several\r\nhomes; that Mr. Pickwick and his friends once more took their seats on\r\nthe top of the Muggleton coach; and that Arabella Allen repaired to her\r\nplace of destination, wherever it might have been--we dare say Mr.\r\nWinkle knew, but we confess we don\xe2\x80\x99t--under the care and guardianship of\r\nher brother Benjamin, and his most intimate and particular friend, Mr.\r\nBob Sawyer.\r\n\r\nBefore they separated, however, that gentleman and Mr. Benjamin Allen\r\ndrew Mr. Pickwick aside with an air of some mystery; and Mr. Bob Sawyer,\r\nthrusting his forefinger between two of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s ribs, and thereby\r\ndisplaying his native drollery, and his knowledge of the anatomy of the\r\nhuman frame, at one and the same time, inquired--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, old boy, where do you hang out?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick replied that he\r\nwas at present suspended at the George and Vulture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come and see me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing would give me greater pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s my lodgings,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer, producing a card. \xe2\x80\x98Lant\r\nStreet, Borough; it\xe2\x80\x99s near Guy\xe2\x80\x99s, and handy for me, you know. Little\r\ndistance after you\xe2\x80\x99ve passed St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Church--turns out of the High\r\nStreet on the right hand side the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall find it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come on Thursday fortnight, and bring the other chaps with you,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a few medical fellows that night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick expressed the pleasure it would afford him to meet the\r\nmedical fellows; and after Mr. Bob Sawyer had informed him that he meant\r\nto be very cosy, and that his friend Ben was to be one of the party,\r\nthey shook hands and separated.\r\n\r\nWe feel that in this place we lay ourself open to the inquiry whether\r\nMr. Winkle was whispering, during this brief conversation, to Arabella\r\nAllen; and if so, what he said; and furthermore, whether Mr. Snodgrass\r\nwas conversing apart with Emily Wardle; and if so, what _he_ said. To\r\nthis, we reply, that whatever they might have said to the ladies, they\r\nsaid nothing at all to Mr. Pickwick or Mr. Tupman for eight-and-twenty\r\nmiles, and that they sighed very often, refused ale and brandy, and\r\nlooked gloomy. If our observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory\r\ninferences from these facts, we beg them by all means to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. WHICH IS ALL ABOUT THE LAW, AND SUNDRY GREAT AUTHORITIES\r\nLEARNED THEREIN\r\n\r\nScattered about, in various holes and corners of the Temple, are certain\r\ndark and dirty chambers, in and out of which, all the morning in\r\nvacation, and half the evening too in term time, there may be seen\r\nconstantly hurrying with bundles of papers under their arms, and\r\nprotruding from their pockets, an almost uninterrupted succession of\r\nlawyers\xe2\x80\x99 clerks. There are several grades of lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 clerks. There is\r\nthe articled clerk, who has paid a premium, and is an attorney in\r\nperspective, who runs a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s bill, receives invitations to parties,\r\nknows a family in Gower Street, and another in Tavistock Square; who\r\ngoes out of town every long vacation to see his father, who keeps live\r\nhorses innumerable; and who is, in short, the very aristocrat of clerks.\r\nThere is the salaried clerk--out of door, or in door, as the case may\r\nbe--who devotes the major part of his thirty shillings a week to his\r\nPersonal pleasure and adornments, repairs half-price to the Adelphi\r\nTheatre at least three times a week, dissipates majestically at the\r\ncider cellars afterwards, and is a dirty caricature of the fashion which\r\nexpired six months ago. There is the middle-aged copying clerk, with a\r\nlarge family, who is always shabby, and often drunk. And there are the\r\noffice lads in their first surtouts, who feel a befitting contempt for\r\nboys at day-schools, club as they go home at night, for saveloys and\r\nporter, and think there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like \xe2\x80\x98life.\xe2\x80\x99 There are varieties of\r\nthe genus, too numerous to recapitulate, but however numerous they may\r\nbe, they are all to be seen, at certain regulated business hours,\r\nhurrying to and from the places we have just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThese sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession,\r\nwhere writs are issued, judgments signed, declarations filed, and\r\nnumerous other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and\r\ntorment of His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s liege subjects, and the comfort and emolument\r\nof the practitioners of the law. They are, for the most part, low-\r\nroofed, mouldy rooms, where innumerable rolls of parchment, which have\r\nbeen perspiring in secret for the last century, send forth an agreeable\r\nodour, which is mingled by day with the scent of the dry-rot, and by\r\nnight with the various exhalations which arise from damp cloaks,\r\nfestering umbrellas, and the coarsest tallow candles.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, some ten days or a\r\nfortnight after Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to London, there\r\nhurried into one of these offices, an individual in a brown coat and\r\nbrass buttons, whose long hair was scrupulously twisted round the rim of\r\nhis napless hat, and whose soiled drab trousers were so tightly strapped\r\nover his Blucher boots, that his knees threatened every moment to start\r\nfrom their concealment. He produced from his coat pockets a long and\r\nnarrow strip of parchment, on which the presiding functionary impressed\r\nan illegible black stamp. He then drew forth four scraps of paper, of\r\nsimilar dimensions, each containing a printed copy of the strip of\r\nparchment with blanks for a name; and having filled up the blanks, put\r\nall the five documents in his pocket, and hurried away.\r\n\r\nThe man in the brown coat, with the cabalistic documents in his pocket,\r\nwas no other than our old acquaintance Mr. Jackson, of the house of\r\nDodson & Fogg, Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Court, Cornhill. Instead of returning to the\r\noffice whence he came, however, he bent his steps direct to Sun Court,\r\nand walking straight into the George and Vulture, demanded to know\r\nwhether one Mr. Pickwick was within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s servant, Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 said the barmaid of the George and\r\nVulture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jackson. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve come on business. If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll show me Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s room I\xe2\x80\x99ll step up myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What name, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jackson,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe waiter stepped upstairs to announce Mr. Jackson; but Mr. Jackson\r\nsaved him the trouble by following close at his heels, and walking into\r\nthe apartment before he could articulate a syllable.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had, that day, invited his three friends to dinner; they\r\nwere all seated round the fire, drinking their wine, when Mr. Jackson\r\npresented himself, as above described.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How de do, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jackson, nodding to Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman bowed, and looked somewhat surprised, for the physiognomy\r\nof Mr. Jackson dwelt not in his recollection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have called from Dodson and Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jackson, in an\r\nexplanatory tone.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick roused at the name. \xe2\x80\x98I refer you to my attorney, Sir; Mr.\r\nPerker, of Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Waiter, show this gentleman out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson, deliberately depositing\r\nhis hat on the floor, and drawing from his pocket the strip of\r\nparchment. \xe2\x80\x98But personal service, by clerk or agent, in these cases, you\r\nknow, Mr. Pickwick--nothing like caution, sir, in all legal forms--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Jackson cast his eye on the parchment; and, resting his hands\r\non the table, and looking round with a winning and persuasive smile,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Now, come; don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s have no words about such a little matter\r\nas this. Which of you gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x99s Snodgrass?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this inquiry, Mr. Snodgrass gave such a very undisguised and palpable\r\nstart, that no further reply was needed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I thought so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jackson, more affably than before. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nlittle something to trouble you with, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only a subpoena in Bardell and Pickwick on behalf of the\r\nplaintiff,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson, singling out one of the slips of paper, and\r\nproducing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll come on, in the\r\nsettens after Term: fourteenth of Febooary, we expect; we\xe2\x80\x99ve marked it a\r\nspecial jury cause, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only ten down the paper. That\xe2\x80\x99s yours, Mr.\r\nSnodgrass.\xe2\x80\x99 As Jackson said this, he presented the parchment before the\r\neyes of Mr. Snodgrass, and slipped the paper and the shilling into his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment, when\r\nJackson, turning sharply upon him, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I ain\xe2\x80\x99t mistaken when I say your name\xe2\x80\x99s Tupman, am I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman looked at Mr. Pickwick; but, perceiving no encouragement in\r\nthat gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s widely-opened eyes to deny his name, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my name is Tupman, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that other gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Winkle, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson. Mr.\r\nWinkle faltered out a reply in the affirmative; and both gentlemen were\r\nforthwith invested with a slip of paper, and a shilling each, by the\r\ndexterous Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll think me rather troublesome, but\r\nI want somebody else, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t inconvenient. I have Samuel Weller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname here, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Send my servant here, waiter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. The waiter retired,\r\nconsiderably astonished, and Mr. Pickwick motioned Jackson to a seat.\r\n\r\nThere was a painful pause, which was at length broken by the innocent\r\ndefendant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, his indignation rising while he\r\nspoke--\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, Sir, that it is the intention of your employers to\r\nseek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson struck his forefinger several times against the left side of\r\nhis nose, to intimate that he was not there to disclose the secrets of\r\nthe prison house, and playfully rejoined--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not knowin\xe2\x80\x99, can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For what other reason, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98are these subpoenas\r\nserved upon them, if not for this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good plant, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson, slowly shaking his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x98But it won\xe2\x80\x99t do. No harm in trying, but there\xe2\x80\x99s little to be got\r\nout of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Jackson smiled once more upon the company, and, applying his\r\nleft thumb to the tip of his nose, worked a visionary coffee-mill with\r\nhis right hand, thereby performing a very graceful piece of pantomime\r\n(then much in vogue, but now, unhappily, almost obsolete) which was\r\nfamiliarly denominated \xe2\x80\x98taking a grinder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson, in conclusion; \xe2\x80\x98Perker\xe2\x80\x99s people\r\nmust guess what we\xe2\x80\x99ve served these subpoenas for. If they can\xe2\x80\x99t, they\r\nmust wait till the action comes on, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll find out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his unwelcome\r\nvisitor, and would probably have hurled some tremendous anathema at the\r\nheads of Messrs. Dodson & Fogg, had not Sam\xe2\x80\x99s entrance at the instant\r\ninterrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Samuel Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jackson, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vun o\xe2\x80\x99 the truest things as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said for many a long year,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nSam, in a most composed manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a subpoena for you, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that in English?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the original,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson, declining the required explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson, shaking the parchment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x98rig\xe2\x80\x99nal, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m wery glad I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen the \xe2\x80\x98rig\xe2\x80\x99nal, \xe2\x80\x98cos it\xe2\x80\x99s a gratifyin\xe2\x80\x99 sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing, and eases vun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind so much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And here\xe2\x80\x99s the shilling,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s from Dodson and Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it\xe2\x80\x99s uncommon handsome o\xe2\x80\x99 Dodson and Fogg, as knows so little of\r\nme, to come down vith a present,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I feel it as a wery high\r\ncompliment, sir; it\xe2\x80\x99s a wery honorable thing to them, as they knows how\r\nto reward merit werever they meets it. Besides which, it\xe2\x80\x99s affectin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s feelin\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller said this, he inflicted a little friction on his right\r\neyelid, with the sleeve of his coat, after the most approved manner of\r\nactors when they are in domestic pathetics.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson seemed rather puzzled by Sam\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings; but, as he had\r\nserved the subpoenas, and had nothing more to say, he made a feint of\r\nputting on the one glove which he usually carried in his hand, for the\r\nsake of appearances; and returned to the office to report progress.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick slept little that night; his memory had received a very\r\ndisagreeable refresher on the subject of Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s action. He\r\nbreakfasted betimes next morning, and, desiring Sam to accompany him,\r\nset forth towards Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking round, when they got to the end of\r\nCheapside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, stepping up to his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp Newgate Street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick did not turn round immediately, but looked vacantly in\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s face for a few seconds, and heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This action, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98is expected to come on, on the\r\nfourteenth of next month.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRemarkable coincidence that \xe2\x80\x98ere, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why remarkable, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Walentine\xe2\x80\x99s day, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Sam; \xe2\x80\x98reg\xe2\x80\x99lar good day for a breach o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npromise trial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s smile awakened no gleam of mirth in his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance. Mr. Pickwick turned abruptly round, and led the way in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThey had walked some distance, Mr. Pickwick trotting on before, plunged\r\nin profound meditation, and Sam following behind, with a countenance\r\nexpressive of the most enviable and easy defiance of everything and\r\neverybody, when the latter, who was always especially anxious to impart\r\nto his master any exclusive information he possessed, quickened his pace\r\nuntil he was close at Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s heels; and, pointing up at a house\r\nthey were passing, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery nice pork-shop that \xe2\x80\x98ere, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it seems so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Celebrated sassage factory,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it!\xe2\x80\x99 reiterated Sam, with some indignation; \xe2\x80\x98I should rayther think\r\nit was. Why, sir, bless your innocent eyebrows, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the\r\nmysterious disappearance of a \xe2\x80\x98spectable tradesman took place four years\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say he was burked, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking\r\nhastily round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98I wish I did; far worse\r\nthan that. He was the master o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere shop, sir, and the inwentor o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe patent-never-leavin\xe2\x80\x99-off sassage steam-ingin, as \xe2\x80\x98ud swaller up a\r\npavin\xe2\x80\x99 stone if you put it too near, and grind it into sassages as easy\r\nas if it was a tender young babby. Wery proud o\xe2\x80\x99 that machine he was, as\r\nit was nat\xe2\x80\x99ral he should be, and he\xe2\x80\x99d stand down in the celler a-lookin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat it wen it was in full play, till he got quite melancholy with joy. A\r\nwery happy man he\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been, Sir, in the procession o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere ingin\r\nand two more lovely hinfants besides, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for his wife,\r\nwho was a most owdacious wixin. She was always a-follerin\xe2\x80\x99 him about,\r\nand dinnin\xe2\x80\x99 in his ears, till at last he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it no longer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he says one day; \xe2\x80\x9cif you persewere\r\nin this here sort of amusement,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blessed if I don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\naway to \xe2\x80\x98Merriker; and that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a idle willin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish the \xe2\x80\x98Merrikins joy of their bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d Arter which\r\nshe keeps on abusin\xe2\x80\x99 of him for half an hour, and then runs into the\r\nlittle parlour behind the shop, sets to a-screamin\xe2\x80\x99, says he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the\r\ndeath on her, and falls in a fit, which lasts for three good hours--one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 them fits wich is all screamin\xe2\x80\x99 and kickin\xe2\x80\x99. Well, next mornin\xe2\x80\x99, the\r\nhusband was missin\xe2\x80\x99. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken nothin\xe2\x80\x99 from the till--hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nput on his greatcoat--so it was quite clear he warn\xe2\x80\x99t gone to \xe2\x80\x98Merriker.\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t come back next day; didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back next week; missis had bills\r\nprinted, sayin\xe2\x80\x99 that, if he\xe2\x80\x99d come back, he should be forgiven\r\neverythin\xe2\x80\x99 (which was very liberal, seein\xe2\x80\x99 that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat all); the canals was dragged, and for two months arterwards, wenever\r\na body turned up, it was carried, as a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar thing, straight off to\r\nthe sassage shop. Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever, none on \xe2\x80\x98em answered; so they gave out that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d run away, and she kep\xe2\x80\x99 on the bis\xe2\x80\x99ness. One Saturday night, a\r\nlittle, thin, old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n comes into the shop in a great passion and\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you the missis o\xe2\x80\x99 this here shop?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I\xe2\x80\x99ve just looked in to say that me and my\r\nfamily ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be choked for nothin\xe2\x80\x99; and more than that,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to observe that as you don\xe2\x80\x99t use the\r\nprimest parts of the meat in the manafacter o\xe2\x80\x99 sassages, I\xe2\x80\x99d think you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nfind beef come nearly as cheap as buttons.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAs buttons, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cButtons, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d says the little, old gentleman, unfolding a bit of\r\npaper, and showin\xe2\x80\x99 twenty or thirty halves o\xe2\x80\x99 buttons. \xe2\x80\x9cNice seasonin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfor sassages, is trousers\xe2\x80\x99 buttons, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbuttons!\xe2\x80\x9d says the widder beginnin\xe2\x80\x99 to faint, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d screams the little\r\nold gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, turnin\xe2\x80\x99 wery pale. \xe2\x80\x9cI see it all,\xe2\x80\x9d says the widder; \xe2\x80\x9cin a\r\nfit of temporary insanity he rashly converted hisself into sassages!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And so he had, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, looking steadily into Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s horror-stricken countenance, \xe2\x80\x98or else he\xe2\x80\x99d been draw\xe2\x80\x99d into\r\nthe ingin; but however that might ha\xe2\x80\x99 been, the little, old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\r\nwho had been remarkably partial to sassages all his life, rushed out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe shop in a wild state, and was never heerd on arterwards!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe relation of this affecting incident of private life brought master\r\nand man to Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s chambers. Lowten, holding the door half open,\r\nwas in conversation with a rustily-clad, miserable-looking man, in boots\r\nwithout toes and gloves without fingers. There were traces of privation\r\nand suffering--almost of despair--in his lank and care-worn countenance;\r\nhe felt his poverty, for he shrank to the dark side of the staircase as\r\nMr. Pickwick approached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten, scribbling his name on the doorpost with his pen,\r\nand rubbing it out again with the feather. \xe2\x80\x98Will you leave a message for\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite uncertain,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lowten, winking at Mr. Pickwick, as the\r\nstranger cast his eyes towards the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be of any use my waiting for him?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nstranger, looking wistfully into the office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the clerk, moving a little more\r\ninto the centre of the doorway. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s certain not to be back this week,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s a chance whether he will be next; for when Perker once gets out\r\nof town, he\xe2\x80\x99s never in a hurry to come back again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Out of town!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98dear me, how unfortunate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go away, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a letter for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe stranger, seeming to hesitate, once more looked towards the ground,\r\nand the clerk winked slyly at Mr. Pickwick, as if to intimate that some\r\nexquisite piece of humour was going forward, though what it was Mr.\r\nPickwick could not for the life of him divine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Step in, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten. \xe2\x80\x98Well, will you leave a message,\r\nMr. Watty, or will you call again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done in my\r\nbusiness,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man; \xe2\x80\x98for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t neglect it, Mr. Lowten.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the clerk. \xe2\x80\x98Walk in, Mr. Pickwick.\r\nGood-morning, Mr. Watty; it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine day for walking, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 Seeing\r\nthat the stranger still lingered, he beckoned Sam Weller to follow his\r\nmaster in, and shut the door in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There never was such a pestering bankrupt as that since the world\r\nbegan, I do believe!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten, throwing down his pen with the air of\r\nan injured man. \xe2\x80\x98His affairs haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in Chancery quite four years\r\nyet, and I\xe2\x80\x99m d----d if he don\xe2\x80\x99t come worrying here twice a week. Step\r\nthis way, Mr. Pickwick. Perker _is_ in, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll see you, I know.\r\nDevilish cold,\xe2\x80\x99 he added pettishly, \xe2\x80\x98standing at that door, wasting\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s time with such seedy vagabonds!\xe2\x80\x99 Having very vehemently stirred a\r\nparticularly large fire with a particularly small poker, the clerk led\r\nthe way to his principal\xe2\x80\x99s private room, and announced Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mr. Perker, bustling up from his chair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear sir, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the news about your matter, eh? Anything\r\nmore about our friends in Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Court? They\xe2\x80\x99ve not been sleeping, I\r\nknow that. Ah, they\xe2\x80\x99re very smart fellows; very smart, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the little man concluded, he took an emphatic pinch of snuff, as a\r\ntribute to the smartness of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are great scoundrels,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aye, aye,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of opinion, you know,\r\nand we won\xe2\x80\x99t dispute about terms; because of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nexpected to view these subjects with a professional eye. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone everything that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. I have retained Serjeant Snubbin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he a good man?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good man!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker; \xe2\x80\x98bless your heart and soul, my dear Sir,\r\nSerjeant Snubbin is at the very top of his profession. Gets treble the\r\nbusiness of any man in court--engaged in every case. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t mention\r\nit abroad; but we say--we of the profession--that Serjeant Snubbin leads\r\nthe court by the nose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this\r\ncommunication, and nodded mysteriously to Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have subpoenaed my three friends,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! of course they would,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker. \xe2\x80\x98Important witnesses; saw\r\nyou in a delicate situation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But she fainted of her own accord,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98She threw\r\nherself into my arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very likely, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker; \xe2\x80\x98very likely and very\r\nnatural. Nothing more so, my dear Sir, nothing. But who\xe2\x80\x99s to prove it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have subpoenaed my servant, too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, quitting the\r\nother point; for there Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s question had somewhat staggered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, my dear Sir; of course. I knew they would. I could have told\r\nyou that, a month ago. You know, my dear Sir, if you _will _take the\r\nmanagement of your affairs into your own hands after entrusting them to\r\nyour solicitor, you must also take the consequences.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Perker\r\ndrew himself up with conscious dignity, and brushed some stray grains of\r\nsnuff from his shirt frill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do they want him to prove?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Pickwick, after two or\r\nthree minutes\xe2\x80\x99 silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That you sent him up to the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x98s to make some offer of a\r\ncompromise, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker. \xe2\x80\x98It don\xe2\x80\x99t matter much, though; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think many counsel could get a great deal out of _him_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they could,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, smiling, despite his\r\nvexation, at the idea of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s appearance as a witness. \xe2\x80\x98What course do\r\nwe pursue?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have only one to adopt, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker; \xe2\x80\x98cross-examine\r\nthe witnesses; trust to Snubbin\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence; throw dust in the eyes of\r\nthe judge; throw ourselves on the jury.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And suppose the verdict is against me?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nMr. Perker smiled, took a very long pinch of snuff, stirred the fire,\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and remained expressively silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean that in that case I must pay the damages?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nwho had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness.\r\n\r\nPerker gave the fire another very unnecessary poke, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nafraid so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I beg to announce to you my unalterable determination to pay no\r\ndamages whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, most emphatically. \xe2\x80\x98None, Perker.\r\nNot a pound, not a penny of my money, shall find its way into the\r\npockets of Dodson and Fogg. That is my deliberate and irrevocable\r\ndetermination.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick gave a heavy blow on the table before him,\r\nin confirmation of the irrevocability of his intention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, my dear Sir, very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker. \xe2\x80\x98You know best, of\r\ncourse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick hastily. \xe2\x80\x98Where does Serjeant Snubbin\r\nlive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Old Square,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to see him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See Serjeant Snubbin, my dear Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Perker, in utter\r\namazement. \xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir, impossible. See Serjeant Snubbin!\r\nBless you, my dear Sir, such a thing was never heard of, without a\r\nconsultation fee being previously paid, and a consultation fixed. It\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done, my dear Sir; it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, however, had made up his mind not only that it could be\r\ndone, but that it should be done; and the consequence was, that within\r\nten minutes after he had received the assurance that the thing was\r\nimpossible, he was conducted by his solicitor into the outer office of\r\nthe great Serjeant Snubbin himself.\r\n\r\nIt was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions, with a large writing-\r\ntable drawn up near the fire, the baize top of which had long since lost\r\nall claim to its original hue of green, and had gradually grown gray\r\nwith dust and age, except where all traces of its natural colour were\r\nobliterated by ink-stains. Upon the table were numerous little bundles\r\nof papers tied with red tape; and behind it, sat an elderly clerk, whose\r\nsleek appearance and heavy gold watch-chain presented imposing\r\nindications of the extensive and lucrative practice of Mr. Serjeant\r\nSnubbin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the Serjeant in his room, Mr. Mallard?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Perker, offering\r\nhis box with all imaginable courtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply, \xe2\x80\x98but he\xe2\x80\x99s very busy. Look here; not an\r\nopinion given yet, on any one of these cases; and an expedition fee paid\r\nwith all of \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99 The clerk smiled as he said this, and inhaled the\r\npinch of snuff with a zest which seemed to be compounded of a fondness\r\nfor snuff and a relish for fees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something like practice that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the barrister\xe2\x80\x99s clerk, producing his own box, and offering\r\nit with the greatest cordiality; \xe2\x80\x98and the best of it is, that as nobody\r\nalive except myself can read the serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s writing, they are obliged to\r\nwait for the opinions, when he has given them, till I have copied \xe2\x80\x98em,\r\nha-ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which makes good for we know who, besides the serjeant, and draws a\r\nlittle more out of the clients, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker; \xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x99 At this\r\nthe serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s clerk laughed again--not a noisy boisterous laugh, but a\r\nsilent, internal chuckle, which Mr. Pickwick disliked to hear. When a\r\nman bleeds inwardly, it is a dangerous thing for himself; but when he\r\nlaughs inwardly, it bodes no good to other people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You haven\xe2\x80\x99t made me out that little list of the fees that I\xe2\x80\x99m in your\r\ndebt, have you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I have not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker. \xe2\x80\x98Let me have them, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a\r\ncheque. But I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re too busy pocketing the ready money, to\r\nthink of the debtors, eh? ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x99 This sally seemed to tickle the\r\nclerk amazingly, and he once more enjoyed a little quiet laugh to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Mr. Mallard, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, suddenly recovering his\r\ngravity, and drawing the great man\xe2\x80\x99s great man into a Corner, by the\r\nlappel of his coat; \xe2\x80\x98you must persuade the Serjeant to see me, and my\r\nclient here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s not bad either. See the Serjeant!\r\ncome, that\xe2\x80\x99s too absurd.\xe2\x80\x99 Notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal,\r\nhowever, the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing\r\nof Mr. Pickwick; and after a short conversation conducted in whispers,\r\nwalked softly down a little dark passage, and disappeared into the legal\r\nluminary\xe2\x80\x99s sanctum, whence he shortly returned on tiptoe, and informed\r\nMr. Perker and Mr. Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed upon,\r\nin violation of all established rules and customs, to admit them at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Serjeant Snubbins was a lantern-faced, sallow-complexioned man, of\r\nabout five-and-forty, or--as the novels say--he might be fifty. He had\r\nthat dull-looking, boiled eye which is often to be seen in the heads of\r\npeople who have applied themselves during many years to a weary and\r\nlaborious course of study; and which would have been sufficient, without\r\nthe additional eyeglass which dangled from a broad black riband round\r\nhis neck, to warn a stranger that he was very near-sighted. His hair was\r\nthin and weak, which was partly attributable to his having never devoted\r\nmuch time to its arrangement, and partly to his having worn for five-\r\nand-twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him. The\r\nmarks of hairpowder on his coat-collar, and the ill-washed and worse\r\ntied white neckerchief round his throat, showed that he had not found\r\nleisure since he left the court to make any alteration in his dress;\r\nwhile the slovenly style of the remainder of his costume warranted the\r\ninference that his personal appearance would not have been very much\r\nimproved if he had. Books of practice, heaps of papers, and opened\r\nletters, were scattered over the table, without any attempt at order or\r\narrangement; the furniture of the room was old and rickety; the doors of\r\nthe book-case were rotting in their hinges; the dust flew out from the\r\ncarpet in little clouds at every step; the blinds were yellow with age\r\nand dirt; the state of everything in the room showed, with a clearness\r\nnot to be mistaken, that Mr. Serjeant Snubbin was far too much occupied\r\nwith his professional pursuits to take any great heed or regard of his\r\npersonal comforts.\r\n\r\nThe Serjeant was writing when his clients entered; he bowed abstractedly\r\nwhen Mr. Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor; and then, motioning\r\nthem to a seat, put his pen carefully in the inkstand, nursed his left\r\nleg, and waited to be spoken to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick is the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick, Serjeant\r\nSnubbin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am retained in that, am I?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Serjeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker.\r\n\r\nThe Serjeant nodded his head, and waited for something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick was anxious to call upon you, Serjeant Snubbin,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPerker, \xe2\x80\x98to state to you, before you entered upon the case, that he\r\ndenies there being any ground or pretence whatever for the action\r\nagainst him; and that unless he came into court with clean hands, and\r\nwithout the most conscientious conviction that he was right in resisting\r\nthe plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s demand, he would not be there at all. I believe I state\r\nyour views correctly; do I not, my dear Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man,\r\nturning to Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Serjeant Snubbin unfolded his glasses, raised them to his eyes; and,\r\nafter looking at Mr. Pickwick for a few seconds with great curiosity,\r\nturned to Mr. Perker, and said, smiling slightly as he spoke--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has Mr. Pickwick a strong case?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe attorney shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you propose calling witnesses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe smile on the Serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s countenance became more defined; he rocked\r\nhis leg with increased violence; and, throwing himself back in his easy-\r\nchair, coughed dubiously.\r\n\r\nThese tokens of the Serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s presentiments on the subject, slight as\r\nthey were, were not lost on Mr. Pickwick. He settled the spectacles,\r\nthrough which he had attentively regarded such demonstrations of the\r\nbarrister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings as he had permitted himself to exhibit, more firmly\r\non his nose; and said with great energy, and in utter disregard of all\r\nMr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s admonitory winkings and frownings--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My wishing to wait upon you, for such a purpose as this, Sir, appears,\r\nI have no doubt, to a gentleman who sees so much of these matters as you\r\nmust necessarily do, a very extraordinary circumstance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire, but the smile came back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen of your profession, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98see the\r\nworst side of human nature. All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad\r\nblood, rise up before you. You know from your experience of juries (I\r\nmean no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and\r\nyou are apt to attribute to others, a desire to use, for purposes of\r\ndeception and self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure\r\nhonesty and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your\r\nutmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well, from\r\nconstantly employing them yourselves. I really believe that to this\r\ncircumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of\r\nyour being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and over-cautious.\r\nConscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration\r\nto you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you\r\ndistinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am\r\ninnocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well\r\naware of the inestimable value of your assistance, Sir, I must beg to\r\nadd, that unless you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived\r\nof the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLong before the close of this address, which we are bound to say was of\r\na very prosy character for Mr. Pickwick, the Serjeant had relapsed into\r\na state of abstraction. After some minutes, however, during which he had\r\nreassumed his pen, he appeared to be again aware of the presence of his\r\nclients; raising his head from the paper, he said, rather snappishly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is with me in this case?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Phunky, Serjeant Snubbin,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the attorney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Phunky--Phunky,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Serjeant, \xe2\x80\x98I never heard the name before. He\r\nmust be a very young man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is a very young man,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the attorney. \xe2\x80\x98He was only called\r\nthe other day. Let me see--he has not been at the Bar eight years yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I thought not,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Serjeant, in that sort of pitying tone in\r\nwhich ordinary folks would speak of a very helpless little child. \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nMallard, send round to Mr.--Mr.--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhunky\xe2\x80\x99s--Holborn Court, Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Perker. (Holborn Court,\r\nby the bye, is South Square now.)--\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Phunky, and say I should be glad\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99d step here, a moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Mallard departed to execute his commission; and Serjeant Snubbin\r\nrelapsed into abstraction until Mr. Phunky himself was introduced.\r\n\r\nAlthough an infant barrister, he was a full-grown man. He had a very\r\nnervous manner, and a painful hesitation in his speech; it did not\r\nappear to be a natural defect, but seemed rather the result of timidity,\r\narising from the consciousness of being \xe2\x80\x98kept down\xe2\x80\x99 by want of means, or\r\ninterest, or connection, or impudence, as the case might be. He was\r\noverawed by the Serjeant, and profoundly courteous to the attorney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not had the pleasure of seeing you before, Mr. Phunky,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSerjeant Snubbin, with haughty condescension.\r\n\r\nMr. Phunky bowed. He _had _had the pleasure of seeing the Serjeant, and\r\nof envying him too, with all a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s envy, for eight years and a\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are with me in this case, I understand?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Serjeant.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Phunky had been a rich man, he would have instantly sent for his\r\nclerk to remind him; if he had been a wise one, he would have applied\r\nhis forefinger to his forehead, and endeavoured to recollect, whether,\r\nin the multiplicity of his engagements, he had undertaken this one or\r\nnot; but as he was neither rich nor wise (in this sense, at all events)\r\nhe turned red, and bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you read the papers, Mr. Phunky?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the Serjeant.\r\n\r\nHere again, Mr. Phunky should have professed to have forgotten all about\r\nthe merits of the case; but as he had read such papers as had been laid\r\nbefore him in the course of the action, and had thought of nothing else,\r\nwaking or sleeping, throughout the two months during which he had been\r\nretained as Mr. Serjeant Snubbin\xe2\x80\x99s junior, he turned a deeper red and\r\nbowed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Serjeant, waving his pen in the\r\ndirection in which that gentleman was standing.\r\n\r\nMr. Phunky bowed to Mr. Pickwick, with a reverence which a first client\r\nmust ever awaken; and again inclined his head towards his leader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you will take Mr. Pickwick away,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Serjeant, \xe2\x80\x98and--and-\r\n-and--hear anything Mr. Pickwick may wish to communicate. We shall have\r\na consultation, of course.\xe2\x80\x99 With that hint that he had been interrupted\r\nquite long enough, Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, who had been gradually growing\r\nmore and more abstracted, applied his glass to his eyes for an instant,\r\nbowed slightly round, and was once more deeply immersed in the case\r\nbefore him, which arose out of an interminable lawsuit, originating in\r\nthe act of an individual, deceased a century or so ago, who had stopped\r\nup a pathway leading from some place which nobody ever came from, to\r\nsome other place which nobody ever went to.\r\n\r\nMr. Phunky would not hear of passing through any door until Mr. Pickwick\r\nand his solicitor had passed through before him, so it was some time\r\nbefore they got into the Square; and when they did reach it, they walked\r\nup and down, and held a long conference, the result of which was, that\r\nit was a very difficult matter to say how the verdict would go; that\r\nnobody could presume to calculate on the issue of an action; that it was\r\nvery lucky they had prevented the other party from getting Serjeant\r\nSnubbin; and other topics of doubt and consolation, common in such a\r\nposition of affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nduration; and, bidding adieu to Lowten, they returned to the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. DESCRIBES, FAR MORE FULLY THAN THE COURT NEWSMAN EVER\r\nDID, A BACHELOR\xe2\x80\x99S PARTY, GIVEN BY MR. BOB SAWYER AT HIS LODGINGS IN THE\r\nBOROUGH\r\n\r\nThere is a repose about Lant Street, in the Borough, which sheds a\r\ngentle melancholy upon the soul. There are always a good many houses to\r\nlet in the street: it is a by-street too, and its dulness is soothing. A\r\nhouse in Lant Street would not come within the denomination of a first-\r\nrate residence, in the strict acceptation of the term; but it is a most\r\ndesirable spot nevertheless. If a man wished to abstract himself from\r\nthe world--to remove himself from within the reach of temptation--to\r\nplace himself beyond the possibility of any inducement to look out of\r\nthe window--we should recommend him by all means go to Lant Street.\r\n\r\nIn this happy retreat are colonised a few clear-starchers, a sprinkling\r\nof journeymen bookbinders, one or two prison agents for the Insolvent\r\nCourt, several small housekeepers who are employed in the Docks, a\r\nhandful of mantua-makers, and a seasoning of jobbing tailors. The\r\nmajority of the inhabitants either direct their energies to the letting\r\nof furnished apartments, or devote themselves to the healthful and\r\ninvigorating pursuit of mangling. The chief features in the still life\r\nof the street are green shutters, lodging-bills, brass door-plates, and\r\nbell-handles; the principal specimens of animated nature, the pot-boy,\r\nthe muffin youth, and the baked-potato man. The population is migratory,\r\nusually disappearing on the verge of quarter-day, and generally by\r\nnight. His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s revenues are seldom collected in this happy valley;\r\nthe rents are dubious; and the water communication is very frequently\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer embellished one side of the fire, in his first-floor\r\nfront, early on the evening for which he had invited Mr. Pickwick, and\r\nMr. Ben Allen the other. The preparations for the reception of visitors\r\nappeared to be completed. The umbrellas in the passage had been heaped\r\ninto the little corner outside the back-parlour door; the bonnet and\r\nshawl of the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s servant had been removed from the bannisters;\r\nthere were not more than two pairs of pattens on the street-door mat;\r\nand a kitchen candle, with a very long snuff, burned cheerfully on the\r\nledge of the staircase window. Mr. Bob Sawyer had himself purchased the\r\nspirits at a wine vaults in High Street, and had returned home preceding\r\nthe bearer thereof, to preclude the possibility of their delivery at the\r\nwrong house. The punch was ready-made in a red pan in the bedroom; a\r\nlittle table, covered with a green baize cloth, had been borrowed from\r\nthe parlour, to play at cards on; and the glasses of the establishment,\r\ntogether with those which had been borrowed for the occasion from the\r\npublic-house, were all drawn up in a tray, which was deposited on the\r\nlanding outside the door.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the highly satisfactory nature of all these\r\narrangements, there was a cloud on the countenance of Mr. Bob Sawyer, as\r\nhe sat by the fireside. There was a sympathising expression, too, in the\r\nfeatures of Mr. Ben Allen, as he gazed intently on the coals, and a tone\r\nof melancholy in his voice, as he said, after a long silence--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it is unlucky she should have taken it in her head to turn sour,\r\njust on this occasion. She might at least have waited till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s her malevolence--that\xe2\x80\x99s her malevolence,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer vehemently. \xe2\x80\x98She says that if I can afford to give a party I\r\nought to be able to pay her confounded \xe2\x80\x9clittle bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHow long has it been running?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Ben Allen. A bill, by the\r\nbye, is the most extraordinary locomotive engine that the genius of man\r\never produced. It would keep on running during the longest lifetime,\r\nwithout ever once stopping of its own accord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a quarter, and a month or so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\nBen Allen coughed hopelessly, and directed a searching look between the\r\ntwo top bars of the stove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a deuced unpleasant thing if she takes it into her head to let\r\nout, when those fellows are here, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Horrible,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98horrible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA low tap was heard at the room door. Mr. Bob Sawyer looked expressively\r\nat his friend, and bade the tapper come in; whereupon a dirty, slipshod\r\ngirl in black cotton stockings, who might have passed for the neglected\r\ndaughter of a superannuated dustman in very reduced circumstances,\r\nthrust in her head, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please, Mister Sawyer, Missis Raddle wants to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Bob Sawyer could return any answer, the girl suddenly\r\ndisappeared with a jerk, as if somebody had given her a violent pull\r\nbehind; this mysterious exit was no sooner accomplished, than there was\r\nanother tap at the door--a smart, pointed tap, which seemed to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I am, and in I\xe2\x80\x99m coming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer glanced at his friend with a look of abject apprehension,\r\nand once more cried, \xe2\x80\x98Come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe permission was not at all necessary, for, before Mr. Bob Sawyer had\r\nuttered the words, a little, fierce woman bounced into the room, all in\r\na tremble with passion, and pale with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little, fierce woman, trying to appear very\r\ncalm, \xe2\x80\x98if you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the kindness to settle that little bill of mine\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my rent to pay this afternoon, and my\r\nlandlord\xe2\x80\x99s a-waiting below now.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the little woman rubbed her hands,\r\nand looked steadily over Mr. Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s head, at the wall behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry to put you to any inconvenience, Mrs. Raddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob\r\nSawyer deferentially, \xe2\x80\x98but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t any inconvenience,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the little woman, with a\r\nshrill titter. \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it particular before to-day; leastways, as\r\nit has to go to my landlord directly, it was as well for you to keep it\r\nas me. You promised me this afternoon, Mr. Sawyer, and every gentleman\r\nas has ever lived here, has kept his word, Sir, as of course anybody as\r\ncalls himself a gentleman does.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Raddle tossed her head, bit her\r\nlips, rubbed her hands harder, and looked at the wall more steadily than\r\never. It was plain to see, as Mr. Bob Sawyer remarked in a style of\r\nEastern allegory on a subsequent occasion, that she was \xe2\x80\x98getting the\r\nsteam up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry, Mrs. Raddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, with all imaginable\r\nhumility, \xe2\x80\x98but the fact is, that I have been disappointed in the City\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x99--Extraordinary place that City. An astonishing number of men\r\nalways _are _getting disappointed there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle, planting herself firmly on a\r\npurple cauliflower in the Kidderminster carpet, \xe2\x80\x98and what\xe2\x80\x99s that to me,\r\nSir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I--have no doubt, Mrs. Raddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, blinking this last\r\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x98that before the middle of next week we shall be able to set\r\nourselves quite square, and go on, on a better system, afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was all Mrs. Raddle wanted. She had bustled up to the apartment of\r\nthe unlucky Bob Sawyer, so bent upon going into a passion, that, in all\r\nprobability, payment would have rather disappointed her than otherwise.\r\nShe was in excellent order for a little relaxation of the kind, having\r\njust exchanged a few introductory compliments with Mr. R. in the front\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you suppose, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle, elevating her voice for\r\nthe information of the neighbours--\xe2\x80\x98do you suppose that I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going day\r\nafter day to let a fellar occupy my lodgings as never thinks of paying\r\nhis rent, nor even the very money laid out for the fresh butter and lump\r\nsugar that\xe2\x80\x99s bought for his breakfast, and the very milk that\xe2\x80\x99s took in,\r\nat the street door? Do you suppose a hard-working and industrious woman\r\nas has lived in this street for twenty year (ten year over the way, and\r\nnine year and three-quarters in this very house) has nothing else to do\r\nbut to work herself to death after a parcel of lazy idle fellars, that\r\nare always smoking and drinking, and lounging, when they ought to be\r\nglad to turn their hands to anything that would help \xe2\x80\x98em to pay their\r\nbills? Do you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good soul,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen soothingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have the goodness to keep your observashuns to yourself, Sir, I beg,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mrs. Raddle, suddenly arresting the rapid torrent of her speech,\r\nand addressing the third party with impressive slowness and solemnity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not aweer, Sir, that you have any right to address your\r\nconversation to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I let these apartments to you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you certainly did not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Mrs. Raddle, with lofty politeness. \xe2\x80\x98Then\r\np\xe2\x80\x99raps, Sir, you\xe2\x80\x99ll confine yourself to breaking the arms and legs of\r\nthe poor people in the hospitals, and keep yourself _to_ yourself, Sir,\r\nor there may be some persons here as will make you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you are such an unreasonable woman,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Benjamin\r\nAllen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your parding, young man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle, in a cold\r\nperspiration of anger. \xe2\x80\x98But will you have the goodness just to call me\r\nthat again, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make use of the word in any invidious sense, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen, growing somewhat uneasy on his own account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your parding, young man,\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mrs. Raddle, in a louder and\r\nmore imperative tone. \xe2\x80\x98But who do you call a woman? Did you make that\r\nremark to me, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, bless my heart!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you apply that name to me, I ask of you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mrs.\r\nRaddle, with intense fierceness, throwing the door wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, of course I did,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, of course you did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle, backing gradually to the\r\ndoor, and raising her voice to its loudest pitch, for the special behoof\r\nof Mr. Raddle in the kitchen. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, of course you did! And everybody\r\nknows that they may safely insult me in my own \xe2\x80\x98ouse while my husband\r\nsits sleeping downstairs, and taking no more notice than if I was a dog\r\nin the streets. He ought to be ashamed of himself (here Mrs. Raddle\r\nsobbed) to allow his wife to be treated in this way by a parcel of young\r\ncutters and carvers of live people\xe2\x80\x99s bodies, that disgraces the lodgings\r\n(another sob), and leaving her exposed to all manner of abuse; a base,\r\nfaint-hearted, timorous wretch, that\xe2\x80\x99s afraid to come upstairs, and face\r\nthe ruffinly creatures--that\xe2\x80\x99s afraid--that\xe2\x80\x99s afraid to come!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs.\r\nRaddle paused to listen whether the repetition of the taunt had roused\r\nher better half; and finding that it had not been successful, proceeded\r\nto descend the stairs with sobs innumerable; when there came a loud\r\ndouble knock at the street door; whereupon she burst into an hysterical\r\nfit of weeping, accompanied with dismal moans, which was prolonged until\r\nthe knock had been repeated six times, when, in an uncontrollable burst\r\nof mental agony, she threw down all the umbrellas, and disappeared into\r\nthe back parlour, closing the door after her with an awful crash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does Mr. Sawyer live here?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, when the door was\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, \xe2\x80\x98first floor. It\xe2\x80\x99s the door straight afore you,\r\nwhen you gets to the top of the stairs.\xe2\x80\x99 Having given this instruction,\r\nthe handmaid, who had been brought up among the aboriginal inhabitants\r\nof Southwark, disappeared, with the candle in her hand, down the kitchen\r\nstairs, perfectly satisfied that she had done everything that could\r\npossibly be required of her under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass, who entered last, secured the street door, after several\r\nineffectual efforts, by putting up the chain; and the friends stumbled\r\nupstairs, where they were received by Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been\r\nafraid to go down, lest he should be waylaid by Mrs. Raddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the discomfited student. \xe2\x80\x98Glad to see you--take care\r\nof the glasses.\xe2\x80\x99 This caution was addressed to Mr. Pickwick, who had put\r\nhis hat in the tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m rather\r\nconfined for room here, but you must put up with all that, when you come\r\nto see a young bachelor. Walk in. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this gentleman before, I\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick shook hands with Mr. Benjamin Allen, and his\r\nfriends followed his example. They had scarcely taken their seats when\r\nthere was another double knock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Hopkins!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98Hush. Yes, it is.\r\nCome up, Jack; come up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs, and Jack Hopkins presented\r\nhimself. He wore a black velvet waistcoat, with thunder-and-lightning\r\nbuttons; and a blue striped shirt, with a white false collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re late, Jack?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Been detained at Bartholomew\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Hopkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything new?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, nothing particular. Rather a good accident brought into the\r\ncasualty ward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was that, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs\xe2\x80\x99 window; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a very\r\nfair case indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean that the patient is in a fair way to recover?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Hopkins carelessly. \xe2\x80\x98No, I should rather say he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. There must be a splendid operation, though, to-morrow--\r\nmagnificent sight if Slasher does it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You consider Mr. Slasher a good operator?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Best alive,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Hopkins. \xe2\x80\x98Took a boy\xe2\x80\x99s leg out of the socket last\r\nweek--boy ate five apples and a gingerbread cake--exactly two minutes\r\nafter it was all over, boy said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie there to be made game\r\nof, and he\xe2\x80\x99d tell his mother if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t begin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh! That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jack Hopkins. \xe2\x80\x98Is it, Bob?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the bye, Bob,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hopkins, with a scarcely perceptible glance at\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s attentive face, \xe2\x80\x98we had a curious accident last night. A\r\nchild was brought in, who had swallowed a necklace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Swallowed what, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A necklace,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jack Hopkins. \xe2\x80\x98Not all at once, you know, that\r\nwould be too much--you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow that, if the child did--eh, Mr.\r\nPickwick? ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Hopkins appeared highly gratified with his own\r\npleasantry, and continued--\xe2\x80\x98No, the way was this. Child\xe2\x80\x99s parents were\r\npoor people who lived in a court. Child\xe2\x80\x99s eldest sister bought a\r\nnecklace--common necklace, made of large black wooden beads. Child being\r\nfond of toys, cribbed the necklace, hid it, played with it, cut the\r\nstring, and swallowed a bead. Child thought it capital fun, went back\r\nnext day, and swallowed another bead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98what a dreadful thing! I beg your\r\npardon, Sir. Go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next day, child swallowed two beads; the day after that, he treated\r\nhimself to three, and so on, till in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time he had got through\r\nthe necklace--five-and-twenty beads in all. The sister, who was an\r\nindustrious girl, and seldom treated herself to a bit of finery, cried\r\nher eyes out, at the loss of the necklace; looked high and low for it;\r\nbut, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t say, didn\xe2\x80\x99t find it. A few days afterwards, the family\r\nwere at dinner--baked shoulder of mutton, and potatoes under it--the\r\nchild, who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hungry, was playing about the room, when suddenly\r\nthere was heard a devil of a noise, like a small hailstorm. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nthat, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nchild. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father. There was a short\r\nsilence, and then the noise began again, worse than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind what I say, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself in bed,\r\nin something less than a pig\xe2\x80\x99s whisper.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave the child a shake to\r\nmake him obedient, and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard\r\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, damme, it\xe2\x80\x99s _in_ the child!\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nthe croup in the wrong place!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child,\r\nbeginning to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the necklace; I swallowed it, father.\xe2\x80\x9d--The\r\nfather caught the child up, and ran with him to the hospital; the beads\r\nin the boy\xe2\x80\x99s stomach rattling all the way with the jolting; and the\r\npeople looking up in the air, and down in the cellars, to see where the\r\nunusual sound came from. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jack Hopkins,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and he makes such a devil of a noise when he walks about, that they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nobliged to muffle him in a watchman\xe2\x80\x99s coat, for fear he should wake the\r\npatients.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the most extraordinary case I ever heard of,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nwith an emphatic blow on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jack Hopkins. \xe2\x80\x98Is it, Bob?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very singular things occur in our profession, I can assure you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Hopkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I should be disposed to imagine,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nAnother knock at the door announced a large-headed young man in a black\r\nwig, who brought with him a scorbutic youth in a long stock. The next\r\ncomer was a gentleman in a shirt emblazoned with pink anchors, who was\r\nclosely followed by a pale youth with a plated watchguard. The arrival\r\nof a prim personage in clean linen and cloth boots rendered the party\r\ncomplete. The little table with the green baize cover was wheeled out;\r\nthe first instalment of punch was brought in, in a white jug; and the\r\nsucceeding three hours were devoted to _Vingt-et-un_ at sixpence a\r\ndozen, which was only once interrupted by a slight dispute between the\r\nscorbutic youth and the gentleman with the pink anchors; in the course\r\nof which, the scorbutic youth intimated a burning desire to pull the\r\nnose of the gentleman with the emblems of hope; in reply to which, that\r\nindividual expressed his decided unwillingness to accept of any \xe2\x80\x98sauce\xe2\x80\x99\r\non gratuitous terms, either from the irascible young gentleman with the\r\nscorbutic countenance, or any other person who was ornamented with a\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nWhen the last \xe2\x80\x98natural\xe2\x80\x99 had been declared, and the profit and loss\r\naccount of fish and sixpences adjusted, to the satisfaction of all\r\nparties, Mr. Bob Sawyer rang for supper, and the visitors squeezed\r\nthemselves into corners while it was getting ready.\r\n\r\nIt was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine. First of all,\r\nit was necessary to awaken the girl, who had fallen asleep with her face\r\non the kitchen table; this took a little time, and, even when she did\r\nanswer the bell, another quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless\r\nendeavours to impart to her a faint and distant glimmering of reason.\r\nThe man to whom the order for the oysters had been sent, had not been\r\ntold to open them; it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with a\r\nlimp knife and a two-pronged fork; and very little was done in this way.\r\nVery little of the beef was done either; and the ham (which was also\r\nfrom the German-sausage shop round the corner) was in a similar\r\npredicament. However, there was plenty of porter in a tin can; and the\r\ncheese went a great way, for it was very strong. So upon the whole,\r\nperhaps, the supper was quite as good as such matters usually are.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, another jug of punch was put upon the table, together with\r\na paper of cigars, and a couple of bottles of spirits. Then there was an\r\nawful pause; and this awful pause was occasioned by a very common\r\noccurrence in this sort of place, but a very embarrassing one\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the girl was washing the glasses. The establishment boasted\r\nfour: we do not record the circumstance as at all derogatory to Mrs.\r\nRaddle, for there never was a lodging-house yet, that was not short of\r\nglasses. The landlady\xe2\x80\x99s glasses were little, thin, blown-glass tumblers,\r\nand those which had been borrowed from the public-house were great,\r\ndropsical, bloated articles, each supported on a huge gouty leg. This\r\nwould have been in itself sufficient to have possessed the company with\r\nthe real state of affairs; but the young woman of all work had prevented\r\nthe possibility of any misconception arising in the mind of any\r\ngentleman upon the subject, by forcibly dragging every man\xe2\x80\x99s glass away,\r\nlong before he had finished his beer, and audibly stating, despite the\r\nwinks and interruptions of Mr. Bob Sawyer, that it was to be conveyed\r\ndownstairs, and washed forthwith.\r\n\r\nIt is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good. The prim man in the\r\ncloth boots, who had been unsuccessfully attempting to make a joke\r\nduring the whole time the round game lasted, saw his opportunity, and\r\navailed himself of it. The instant the glasses disappeared, he commenced\r\na long story about a great public character, whose name he had\r\nforgotten, making a particularly happy reply to another eminent and\r\nillustrious individual whom he had never been able to identify. He\r\nenlarged at some length and with great minuteness upon divers collateral\r\ncircumstances, distantly connected with the anecdote in hand, but for\r\nthe life of him he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recollect at that precise moment what the\r\nanecdote was, although he had been in the habit of telling the story\r\nwith great applause for the last ten years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the prim man in the cloth boots, \xe2\x80\x98it is a very\r\nextraordinary circumstance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry you have forgotten it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer, glancing\r\neagerly at the door, as he thought he heard the noise of glasses\r\njingling; \xe2\x80\x98very sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So am I,\xe2\x80\x99 responded the prim man, \xe2\x80\x98because I know it would have\r\nafforded so much amusement. Never mind; I dare say I shall manage to\r\nrecollect it, in the course of half an hour or so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe prim man arrived at this point just as the glasses came back, when\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer, who had been absorbed in attention during the whole\r\ntime, said he should very much like to hear the end of it, for, so far\r\nas it went, it was, without exception, the very best story he had ever\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer to a degree of equanimity\r\nwhich he had not possessed since his interview with his landlady. His\r\nface brightened up, and he began to feel quite convivial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Betsy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer, with great suavity, and dispersing,\r\nat the same time, the tumultuous little mob of glasses the girl had\r\ncollected in the centre of the table--\xe2\x80\x98now, Betsy, the warm water; be\r\nbrisk, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t have no warm water,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Betsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No warm water!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, with a shake of the head which expressed a more\r\ndecided negative than the most copious language could have conveyed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missis Raddle said you warn\xe2\x80\x99t to have none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe surprise depicted on the countenances of his guests imparted new\r\ncourage to the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bring up the warm water instantly--instantly!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer,\r\nwith desperate sternness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the girl; \xe2\x80\x98Missis Raddle raked out the kitchen\r\nfire afore she went to bed, and locked up the kittle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, never mind; never mind. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb yourself about such a\r\ntrifle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, observing the conflict of Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassions, as depicted in his countenance, \xe2\x80\x98cold water will do very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, admirably,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My landlady is subject to some slight attacks of mental derangement,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nremarked Bob Sawyer, with a ghastly smile; \xe2\x80\x98I fear I must give her\r\nwarning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear I must,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, with heroic firmness. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay her what I\r\nowe her, and give her warning to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x99 Poor fellow! how\r\ndevoutly he wished he could!\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s heart-sickening attempts to rally under this last blow,\r\ncommunicated a dispiriting influence to the company, the greater part of\r\nwhom, with the view of raising their spirits, attached themselves with\r\nextra cordiality to the cold brandy-and-water, the first perceptible\r\neffects of which were displayed in a renewal of hostilities between the\r\nscorbutic youth and the gentleman in the shirt. The belligerents vented\r\ntheir feelings of mutual contempt, for some time, in a variety of\r\nfrownings and snortings, until at last the scorbutic youth felt it\r\nnecessary to come to a more explicit understanding on the matter; when\r\nthe following clear understanding took place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the scorbutic youth, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Noddy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be very sorry, Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Noddy, \xe2\x80\x98to create any\r\nunpleasantness at any friend\xe2\x80\x99s table, and much less at yours, Sawyer--\r\nvery; but I must take this opportunity of informing Mr. Gunter that he\r\nis no gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I should be very sorry, Sawyer, to create any disturbance in the\r\nstreet in which you reside,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Gunter, \xe2\x80\x98but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I shall be\r\nunder the necessity of alarming the neighbours by throwing the person\r\nwho has just spoken, out o\xe2\x80\x99 window.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Noddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I say, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Gunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to see you do it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Noddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall _feel _me do it in half a minute, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Gunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I request that you\xe2\x80\x99ll favour me with your card, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Noddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll do nothing of the kind, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Gunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Noddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you\xe2\x80\x99ll stick it up over your chimney-piece, and delude your\r\nvisitors into the false belief that a gentleman has been to see you,\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Gunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, a friend of mine shall wait on you in the morning,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nNoddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you for the caution, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave\r\nparticular directions with the servant to lock up the spoons,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nMr. Gunter.\r\n\r\nAt this point the remainder of the guests interposed, and remonstrated\r\nwith both parties on the impropriety of their conduct; on which Mr.\r\nNoddy begged to state that his father was quite as respectable as Mr.\r\nGunter\xe2\x80\x99s father; to which Mr. Gunter replied that his father was to the\r\nfull as respectable as Mr. Noddy\xe2\x80\x99s father, and that his father\xe2\x80\x99s son was\r\nas good a man as Mr. Noddy, any day in the week. As this announcement\r\nseemed the prelude to a recommencement of the dispute, there was another\r\ninterference on the part of the company; and a vast quantity of talking\r\nand clamouring ensued, in the course of which Mr. Noddy gradually\r\nallowed his feelings to overpower him, and professed that he had ever\r\nentertained a devoted personal attachment towards Mr. Gunter. To this\r\nMr. Gunter replied that, upon the whole, he rather preferred Mr. Noddy\r\nto his own brother; on hearing which admission, Mr. Noddy magnanimously\r\nrose from his seat, and proffered his hand to Mr. Gunter. Mr. Gunter\r\ngrasped it with affecting fervour; and everybody said that the whole\r\ndispute had been conducted in a manner which was highly honourable to\r\nboth parties concerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jack Hopkins, \xe2\x80\x98just to set us going again, Bob, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nsinging a song.\xe2\x80\x99 And Hopkins, incited thereto by tumultuous applause,\r\nplunged himself at once into \xe2\x80\x98The King, God bless him,\xe2\x80\x99 which he sang as\r\nloud as he could, to a novel air, compounded of the \xe2\x80\x98Bay of Biscay,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A Frog he would.\xe2\x80\x99 The chorus was the essence of the song; and, as each\r\ngentleman sang it to the tune he knew best, the effect was very striking\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of the chorus to the first verse, that Mr. Pickwick\r\nheld up his hand in a listening attitude, and said, as soon as silence\r\nwas restored--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! I beg your pardon. I thought I heard somebody calling from\r\nupstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA profound silence immediately ensued; and Mr. Bob Sawyer was observed\r\nto turn pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I hear it now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Have the goodness to open\r\nthe door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject was removed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Sawyer! Mr. Sawyer!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed a voice from the two-pair landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my landlady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, looking round him with great\r\ndismay. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mrs. Raddle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by this, Mr. Sawyer?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the voice, with great\r\nshrillness and rapidity of utterance. \xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it enough to be swindled\r\nout of one\xe2\x80\x99s rent, and money lent out of pocket besides, and abused and\r\ninsulted by your friends that dares to call themselves men, without\r\nhaving the house turned out of the window, and noise enough made to\r\nbring the fire-engines here, at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning?--Turn them\r\nwretches away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,\xe2\x80\x99 said the voice of Mr. Raddle,\r\nwhich appeared to proceed from beneath some distant bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ashamed of themselves!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle. \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go down and\r\nknock \xe2\x80\x98em every one downstairs? You would if you was a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI should if I was a dozen men, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Raddle pacifically,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but they have the advantage of me in numbers, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ugh, you coward!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Raddle, with supreme contempt. \xe2\x80\x98_Do_ you\r\nmean to turn them wretches out, or not, Mr. Sawyer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re going, Mrs. Raddle, they\xe2\x80\x99re going,\xe2\x80\x99 said the miserable Bob. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam afraid you\xe2\x80\x99d better go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer to his friends. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthought you were making too much noise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a very unfortunate thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the prim man. \xe2\x80\x98Just as we were\r\ngetting so comfortable too!\xe2\x80\x99 The prim man was just beginning to have a\r\ndawning recollection of the story he had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s hardly to be borne,\xe2\x80\x99 said the prim man, looking round. \xe2\x80\x98Hardly to\r\nbe borne, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to be endured,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jack Hopkins; \xe2\x80\x98let\xe2\x80\x99s have the other verse,\r\nBob. Come, here goes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, Jack, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Bob Sawyer; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a capital song, but\r\nI am afraid we had better not have the other verse. They are very\r\nviolent people, the people of the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I step upstairs, and pitch into the landlord?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Hopkins,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98or keep on ringing the bell, or go and groan on the staircase? You may\r\ncommand me, Bob.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very much indebted to you for your friendship and good-nature,\r\nHopkins,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wretched Mr. Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98but I think the best plan\r\nto avoid any further dispute is for us to break up at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the shrill voice of Mrs. Raddle, \xe2\x80\x98are them\r\nbrutes going?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re only looking for their hats, Mrs. Raddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob; \xe2\x80\x98they are\r\ngoing directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Going!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle, thrusting her nightcap over the banisters\r\njust as Mr. Pickwick, followed by Mr. Tupman, emerged from the sitting-\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x98Going! what did they ever come for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Pickwick, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get along with you, old wretch!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Raddle, hastily\r\nwithdrawing the nightcap. \xe2\x80\x98Old enough to be his grandfather, you willin!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re worse than any of \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick found it in vain to protest his innocence, so hurried\r\ndownstairs into the street, whither he was closely followed by Mr.\r\nTupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. Mr. Ben Allen, who was dismally\r\ndepressed with spirits and agitation, accompanied them as far as London\r\nBridge, and in the course of the walk confided to Mr. Winkle, as an\r\nespecially eligible person to intrust the secret to, that he was\r\nresolved to cut the throat of any gentleman, except Mr. Bob Sawyer, who\r\nshould aspire to the affections of his sister Arabella. Having expressed\r\nhis determination to perform this painful duty of a brother with proper\r\nfirmness, he burst into tears, knocked his hat over his eyes, and,\r\nmaking the best of his way back, knocked double knocks at the door of\r\nthe Borough Market office, and took short naps on the steps alternately,\r\nuntil daybreak, under the firm impression that he lived there, and had\r\nforgotten the key.\r\n\r\nThe visitors having all departed, in compliance with the rather pressing\r\nrequest of Mrs. Raddle, the luckless Mr. Bob Sawyer was left alone, to\r\nmeditate on the probable events of to-morrow, and the pleasures of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. MR. WELLER THE ELDER DELIVERS SOME CRITICAL SENTIMENTS\r\nRESPECTING LITERARY COMPOSITION; AND, ASSISTED BY HIS SON SAMUEL, PAYS A\r\nSMALL INSTALMENT OF RETALIATION TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN\r\nWITH THE RED NOSE\r\n\r\nThe morning of the thirteenth of February, which the readers of this\r\nauthentic narrative know, as well as we do, to have been the day\r\nimmediately preceding that which was appointed for the trial of Mrs.\r\nBardell\xe2\x80\x99s action, was a busy time for Mr. Samuel Weller, who was\r\nperpetually engaged in travelling from the George and Vulture to Mr.\r\nPerker\xe2\x80\x99s chambers and back again, from and between the hours of nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning and two in the afternoon, both inclusive. Not\r\nthat there was anything whatever to be done, for the consultation had\r\ntaken place, and the course of proceeding to be adopted, had been\r\nfinally determined on; but Mr. Pickwick being in a most extreme state of\r\nexcitement, persevered in constantly sending small notes to his\r\nattorney, merely containing the inquiry, \xe2\x80\x98Dear Perker. Is all going on\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x99 to which Mr. Perker invariably forwarded the reply, \xe2\x80\x98Dear\r\nPickwick. As well as possible\xe2\x80\x99; the fact being, as we have already\r\nhinted, that there was nothing whatever to go on, either well or ill,\r\nuntil the sitting of the court on the following morning.\r\n\r\nBut people who go voluntarily to law, or are taken forcibly there, for\r\nthe first time, may be allowed to labour under some temporary irritation\r\nand anxiety; and Sam, with a due allowance for the frailties of human\r\nnature, obeyed all his master\xe2\x80\x99s behests with that imperturbable good-\r\nhumour and unruffable composure which formed one of his most striking\r\nand amiable characteristics.\r\n\r\nSam had solaced himself with a most agreeable little dinner, and was\r\nwaiting at the bar for the glass of warm mixture in which Mr. Pickwick\r\nhad requested him to drown the fatigues of his morning\xe2\x80\x99s walks, when a\r\nyoung boy of about three feet high, or thereabouts, in a hairy cap and\r\nfustian overalls, whose garb bespoke a laudable ambition to attain in\r\ntime the elevation of an hostler, entered the passage of the George and\r\nVulture, and looked first up the stairs, and then along the passage, and\r\nthen into the bar, as if in search of somebody to whom he bore a\r\ncommission; whereupon the barmaid, conceiving it not improbable that the\r\nsaid commission might be directed to the tea or table spoons of the\r\nestablishment, accosted the boy with--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, young man, what do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there anybody here, named Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the youth, in a loud voice\r\nof treble quality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the t\xe2\x80\x99other name?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam Weller, looking round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How should I know?\xe2\x80\x99 briskly replied the young gentleman below the hairy\r\ncap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a sharp boy, you are,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98only I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t show\r\nthat wery fine edge too much, if I was you, in case anybody took it off.\r\nWhat do you mean by comin\xe2\x80\x99 to a hot-el, and asking arter Sam, vith as\r\nmuch politeness as a vild Indian?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos an old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n told me to,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, with deep disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Him as drives a Ipswich coach, and uses our parlour,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the boy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He told me yesterday mornin\xe2\x80\x99 to come to the George and Wultur this\r\narternoon, and ask for Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my father, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, turning with an explanatory\r\nair to the young lady in the bar; \xe2\x80\x98blessed if I think he hardly knows\r\nwot my other name is. Well, young brockiley sprout, wot then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, \xe2\x80\x98you was to come to him at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock to our\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ouse, \xe2\x80\x98cos he wants to see you--Blue Boar, Leaden\xe2\x80\x99all Markit. Shall I\r\nsay you\xe2\x80\x99re comin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may wenture on that \xe2\x80\x98ere statement, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. And thus\r\nempowered, the young gentleman walked away, awakening all the echoes in\r\nGeorge Yard as he did so, with several chaste and extremely correct\r\nimitations of a drover\xe2\x80\x99s whistle, delivered in a tone of peculiar\r\nrichness and volume.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller having obtained leave of absence from Mr. Pickwick, who, in\r\nhis then state of excitement and worry, was by no means displeased at\r\nbeing left alone, set forth, long before the appointed hour, and having\r\nplenty of time at his disposal, sauntered down as far as the Mansion\r\nHouse, where he paused and contemplated, with a face of great calmness\r\nand philosophy, the numerous cads and drivers of short stages who\r\nassemble near that famous place of resort, to the great terror and\r\nconfusion of the old-lady population of these realms. Having loitered\r\nhere, for half an hour or so, Mr. Weller turned, and began wending his\r\nway towards Leadenhall Market, through a variety of by-streets and\r\ncourts. As he was sauntering away his spare time, and stopped to look at\r\nalmost every object that met his gaze, it is by no means surprising that\r\nMr. Weller should have paused before a small stationer\xe2\x80\x99s and print-\r\nseller\xe2\x80\x99s window; but without further explanation it does appear\r\nsurprising that his eyes should have no sooner rested on certain\r\npictures which were exposed for sale therein, than he gave a sudden\r\nstart, smote his right leg with great vehemence, and exclaimed, with\r\nenergy, \xe2\x80\x98if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for this, I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 forgot all about it,\r\ntill it was too late!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe particular picture on which Sam Weller\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed, as he said\r\nthis, was a highly-coloured representation of a couple of human hearts\r\nskewered together with an arrow, cooking before a cheerful fire, while a\r\nmale and female cannibal in modern attire, the gentleman being clad in a\r\nblue coat and white trousers, and the lady in a deep red pelisse with a\r\nparasol of the same, were approaching the meal with hungry eyes, up a\r\nserpentine gravel path leading thereunto. A decidedly indelicate young\r\ngentleman, in a pair of wings and nothing else, was depicted as\r\nsuperintending the cooking; a representation of the spire of the church\r\nin Langham Place, London, appeared in the distance; and the whole formed\r\na \xe2\x80\x98valentine,\xe2\x80\x99 of which, as a written inscription in the window\r\ntestified, there was a large assortment within, which the shopkeeper\r\npledged himself to dispose of, to his countrymen generally, at the\r\nreduced rate of one-and-sixpence each.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 forgot it; I should certainly ha\xe2\x80\x99 forgot it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; so\r\nsaying, he at once stepped into the stationer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and requested to\r\nbe served with a sheet of the best gilt-edged letter-paper, and a hard-\r\nnibbed pen which could be warranted not to splutter. These articles\r\nhaving been promptly supplied, he walked on direct towards Leadenhall\r\nMarket at a good round pace, very different from his recent lingering\r\none. Looking round him, he there beheld a signboard on which the\r\npainter\xe2\x80\x99s art had delineated something remotely resembling a cerulean\r\nelephant with an aquiline nose in lieu of trunk. Rightly conjecturing\r\nthat this was the Blue Boar himself, he stepped into the house, and\r\ninquired concerning his parent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He won\xe2\x80\x99t be here this three-quarters of an hour or more,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nyoung lady who superintended the domestic arrangements of the Blue Boar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Let me have nine-penn\xe2\x80\x99oth o\xe2\x80\x99 brandy-\r\nand-water luke, and the inkstand, will you, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe brandy-and-water luke, and the inkstand, having been carried into\r\nthe little parlour, and the young lady having carefully flattened down\r\nthe coals to prevent their blazing, and carried away the poker to\r\npreclude the possibility of the fire being stirred, without the full\r\nprivity and concurrence of the Blue Boar being first had and obtained,\r\nSam Weller sat himself down in a box near the stove, and pulled out the\r\nsheet of gilt-edged letter-paper, and the hard-nibbed pen. Then looking\r\ncarefully at the pen to see that there were no hairs in it, and dusting\r\ndown the table, so that there might be no crumbs of bread under the\r\npaper, Sam tucked up the cuffs of his coat, squared his elbows, and\r\ncomposed himself to write.\r\n\r\nTo ladies and gentlemen who are not in the habit of devoting themselves\r\npractically to the science of penmanship, writing a letter is no very\r\neasy task; it being always considered necessary in such cases for the\r\nwriter to recline his head on his left arm, so as to place his eyes as\r\nnearly as possible on a level with the paper, and, while glancing\r\nsideways at the letters he is constructing, to form with his tongue\r\nimaginary characters to correspond. These motions, although\r\nunquestionably of the greatest assistance to original composition,\r\nretard in some degree the progress of the writer; and Sam had\r\nunconsciously been a full hour and a half writing words in small text,\r\nsmearing out wrong letters with his little finger, and putting in new\r\nones which required going over very often to render them visible through\r\nthe old blots, when he was roused by the opening of the door and the\r\nentrance of his parent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, my Prooshan Blue,\xe2\x80\x99 responded the son, laying down his pen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the last bulletin about mother-in-law?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Veller passed a very good night, but is uncommon perwerse, and\r\nunpleasant this mornin\xe2\x80\x99. Signed upon oath, Tony Veller, Esquire. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe last vun as was issued, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, untying his\r\nshawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No better yet?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All the symptoms aggerawated,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, shaking his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But wot\xe2\x80\x99s that, you\xe2\x80\x99re a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 of? Pursuit of knowledge under\r\ndifficulties, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve done now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with slight embarrassment; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-\r\nwritin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I see,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Not to any young \xe2\x80\x98ooman, I hope,\r\nSammy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s no use a-sayin\xe2\x80\x99 it ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a walentine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A what!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller, apparently horror-stricken by the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A walentine,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Samivel, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, in reproachful accents, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it. Arter the warnin\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ve had o\xe2\x80\x99 your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwicious propensities; arter all I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to you upon this here wery\r\nsubject; arter actiwally seein\xe2\x80\x99 and bein\xe2\x80\x99 in the company o\xe2\x80\x99 your own\r\nmother-in-law, vich I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought wos a moral lesson as no man\r\ncould never ha\xe2\x80\x99 forgotten to his dyin\xe2\x80\x99 day! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndone it, Sammy, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it!\xe2\x80\x99 These reflections\r\nwere too much for the good old man. He raised Sam\xe2\x80\x99s tumbler to his lips\r\nand drank off its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nev\xe2\x80\x99r mind, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a wery agonisin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrial to me at my time of life, but I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty tough, that\xe2\x80\x99s vun\r\nconsolation, as the wery old turkey remarked wen the farmer said he wos\r\nafeerd he should be obliged to kill him for the London market.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99ll be a trial?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To see you married, Sammy--to see you a dilluded wictim, and thinkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin your innocence that it\xe2\x80\x99s all wery capital,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na dreadful trial to a father\xe2\x80\x99s feelin\xe2\x80\x99s, that \xe2\x80\x98ere, Sammy--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get married, don\xe2\x80\x99t you fret\r\nyourself about that; I know you\xe2\x80\x99re a judge of these things. Order in\r\nyour pipe and I\xe2\x80\x99ll read you the letter. There!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe cannot distinctly say whether it was the prospect of the pipe, or the\r\nconsolatory reflection that a fatal disposition to get married ran in\r\nthe family, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, which calmed Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s feelings,\r\nand caused his grief to subside. We should be rather disposed to say\r\nthat the result was attained by combining the two sources of\r\nconsolation, for he repeated the second in a low tone, very frequently;\r\nringing the bell meanwhile, to order in the first. He then divested\r\nhimself of his upper coat; and lighting the pipe and placing himself in\r\nfront of the fire with his back towards it, so that he could feel its\r\nfull heat, and recline against the mantel-piece at the same time, turned\r\ntowards Sam, and, with a countenance greatly mollified by the softening\r\ninfluence of tobacco, requested him to \xe2\x80\x98fire away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam dipped his pen into the ink to be ready for any corrections, and\r\nbegan with a very theatrical air--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLovely--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, ringing the bell. \xe2\x80\x98A double glass o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ninwariable, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the girl; who with great quickness appeared,\r\nvanished, returned, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They seem to know your ways here,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here before, in my time. Go on,\r\nSammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLovely creetur,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t in poetry, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 interposed his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Poetry\xe2\x80\x99s unnat\xe2\x80\x99ral; no man\r\never talked poetry \xe2\x80\x98cept a beadle on boxin\xe2\x80\x99-day, or Warren\xe2\x80\x99s blackin\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nor Rowland\xe2\x80\x99s oil, or some of them low fellows; never you let yourself\r\ndown to talk poetry, my boy. Begin agin, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller resumed his pipe with critical solemnity, and Sam once more\r\ncommenced, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLovely creetur I feel myself a damned--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t proper,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, taking his pipe from his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cdamned,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam, holding the letter up to the\r\nlight, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshamed,\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s a blot there--\xe2\x80\x9cI feel myself ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Feel myself ashamed, and completely cir--\xe2\x80\x99 I forget what this here word\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, scratching his head with the pen, in vain attempts to\r\nremember.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you look at it, then?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I am a-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98but there\xe2\x80\x99s another blot.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cc,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9ci,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cd.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Circumwented, p\xe2\x80\x99raps,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9ccircumscribed\xe2\x80\x9d; that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That ain\xe2\x80\x99t as good a word as \xe2\x80\x9ccircumwented,\xe2\x80\x9d Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think not?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 like it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it means more?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell p\xe2\x80\x99raps it\xe2\x80\x99s a more tenderer word,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, after a few\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x99 reflection. \xe2\x80\x98Go on, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFeel myself ashamed and completely circumscribed in a-dressin\xe2\x80\x99 of you,\r\nfor you are a nice gal and nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a wery pretty sentiment,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller, removing\r\nhis pipe to make way for the remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think it is rayther good,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam, highly flattered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot I like in that \xe2\x80\x98ere style of writin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98is, that there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no callin\xe2\x80\x99 names in it--no Wenuses, nor nothin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat kind.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some friends as\xe2\x80\x99ll do either for him, but my adwice \xe2\x80\x98ud\r\nbe this here--never mind the character, and stick to the alleybi.\r\nNothing like a alleybi, Sammy, nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller looked very profound\r\nas he delivered this legal opinion; and burying his nose in his tumbler,\r\nwinked over the top thereof, at his astonished son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be\r\ntried at the Old Bailey, do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That ain\xe2\x80\x99t no part of the present consideration, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nWeller. \xe2\x80\x98Verever he\xe2\x80\x99s a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be tried, my boy, a alleybi\xe2\x80\x99s the thing\r\nto get him off. Ve got Tom Vildspark off that \xe2\x80\x98ere manslaughter, with a\r\nalleybi, ven all the big vigs to a man said as nothing couldn\xe2\x80\x99t save\r\nhim. And my \xe2\x80\x98pinion is, Sammy, that if your governor don\xe2\x80\x99t prove a\r\nalleybi, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be what the Italians call reg\xe2\x80\x99larly flummoxed, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the elder Mr. Weller entertained a firm and unalterable conviction\r\nthat the Old Bailey was the supreme court of judicature in this country,\r\nand that its rules and forms of proceeding regulated and controlled the\r\npractice of all other courts of justice whatsoever, he totally\r\ndisregarded the assurances and arguments of his son, tending to show\r\nthat the alibi was inadmissible; and vehemently protested that Mr.\r\nPickwick was being \xe2\x80\x98wictimised.\xe2\x80\x99 Finding that it was of no use to\r\ndiscuss the matter further, Sam changed the subject, and inquired what\r\nthe second topic was, on which his revered parent wished to consult him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a pint o\xe2\x80\x99 domestic policy, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98This here\r\nStiggins--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Red-nosed man?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wery same,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98This here red-nosed man, Sammy,\r\nwisits your mother-in-law vith a kindness and constancy I never see\r\nequalled. He\xe2\x80\x99s sitch a friend o\xe2\x80\x99 the family, Sammy, that wen he\xe2\x80\x99s avay\r\nfrom us, he can\xe2\x80\x99t be comfortable unless he has somethin\xe2\x80\x99 to remember us\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I\xe2\x80\x99d give him somethin\xe2\x80\x99 as \xe2\x80\x98ud turpentine and beeswax his memory for\r\nthe next ten years or so, if I wos you,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98I wos a-going to say, he always\r\nbrings now, a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half, and fills it\r\nvith the pine-apple rum afore he goes avay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And empties it afore he comes back, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clean!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98never leaves nothin\xe2\x80\x99 in it but the cork\r\nand the smell; trust him for that, Sammy. Now, these here fellows, my\r\nboy, are a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to-night to get up the monthly meetin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the Brick\r\nLane Branch o\xe2\x80\x99 the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance\r\nAssociation. Your mother-in-law wos a-goin\xe2\x80\x99, Sammy, but she\xe2\x80\x99s got the\r\nrheumatics, and can\xe2\x80\x99t; and I, Sammy--I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the two tickets as wos\r\nsent her.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller communicated this secret with great glee, and\r\nwinked so indefatigably after doing so, that Sam began to think he must\r\nhave got the _Tic Doloureux_ in his right eyelid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said that young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 continued his progenitor, looking round him very cautiously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go, punctiwal to the time. The deputy-shepherd won\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nSammy; the deputy-shepherd won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Weller was seized with a\r\nparoxysm of chuckles, which gradually terminated in as near an approach\r\nto a choke as an elderly gentleman can, with safety, sustain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I never see sitch an old ghost in all my born days,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed\r\nSam, rubbing the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s back, hard enough to set him on fire\r\nwith the friction. \xe2\x80\x98What are you a-laughin\xe2\x80\x99 at, corpilence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, looking round him with increased\r\ncaution, and speaking in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x98Two friends o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, as works the\r\nOxford Road, and is up to all kinds o\xe2\x80\x99 games, has got the deputy-\r\nshepherd safe in tow, Sammy; and ven he does come to the Ebenezer\r\nJunction (vich he\xe2\x80\x99s sure to do: for they\xe2\x80\x99ll see him to the door, and\r\nshove him in, if necessary), he\xe2\x80\x99ll be as far gone in rum-and-water, as\r\never he wos at the Markis o\xe2\x80\x99 Granby, Dorkin\xe2\x80\x99, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not sayin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nlittle neither.\xe2\x80\x99 And with this, Mr. Weller once more laughed\r\nimmoderately, and once more relapsed into a state of partial\r\nsuffocation, in consequence.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more in accordance with Sam Weller\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\nthan the projected exposure of the real propensities and qualities of\r\nthe red-nosed man; and it being very near the appointed hour of meeting,\r\nthe father and son took their way at once to Brick Lane, Sam not\r\nforgetting to drop his letter into a general post-office as they walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nThe monthly meetings of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand\r\nJunction Ebenezer Temperance Association were held in a large room,\r\npleasantly and airily situated at the top of a safe and commodious\r\nladder. The president was the straight-walking Mr. Anthony Humm, a\r\nconverted fireman, now a schoolmaster, and occasionally an itinerant\r\npreacher; and the secretary was Mr. Jonas Mudge, chandler\xe2\x80\x99s shopkeeper,\r\nan enthusiastic and disinterested vessel, who sold tea to the members.\r\nPrevious to the commencement of business, the ladies sat upon forms, and\r\ndrank tea, till such time as they considered it expedient to leave off;\r\nand a large wooden money-box was conspicuously placed upon the green\r\nbaize cloth of the business-table, behind which the secretary stood, and\r\nacknowledged, with a gracious smile, every addition to the rich vein of\r\ncopper which lay concealed within.\r\n\r\nOn this particular occasion the women drank tea to a most alarming\r\nextent; greatly to the horror of Mr. Weller, senior, who, utterly\r\nregardless of all Sam\xe2\x80\x99s admonitory nudgings, stared about him in every\r\ndirection with the most undisguised astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98if some o\xe2\x80\x99 these here people don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\ntappin\xe2\x80\x99 to-morrow mornin\xe2\x80\x99, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t your father, and that\xe2\x80\x99s wot it is.\r\nWhy, this here old lady next me is a-drowndin\xe2\x80\x99 herself in tea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBe quiet, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Weller, a moment afterwards, in a tone of deep\r\nagitation, \xe2\x80\x98mark my vords, my boy. If that \xe2\x80\x98ere secretary fellow keeps\r\non for only five minutes more, he\xe2\x80\x99ll blow hisself up with toast and\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, let him, if he likes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no bis\xe2\x80\x99ness o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyourn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If this here lasts much longer, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, in the same\r\nlow voice, \xe2\x80\x98I shall feel it my duty, as a human bein\xe2\x80\x99, to rise and\r\naddress the cheer. There\xe2\x80\x99s a young \xe2\x80\x98ooman on the next form but two, as\r\nhas drunk nine breakfast cups and a half; and she\xe2\x80\x99s a-swellin\xe2\x80\x99 wisibly\r\nbefore my wery eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that Mr. Weller would have carried his benevolent\r\nintention into immediate execution, if a great noise, occasioned by\r\nputting up the cups and saucers, had not very fortunately announced that\r\nthe tea-drinking was over. The crockery having been removed, the table\r\nwith the green baize cover was carried out into the centre of the room,\r\nand the business of the evening was commenced by a little emphatic man,\r\nwith a bald head and drab shorts, who suddenly rushed up the ladder, at\r\nthe imminent peril of snapping the two little legs incased in the drab\r\nshorts, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ladies and gentlemen, I move our excellent brother, Mr. Anthony Humm,\r\ninto the chair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe ladies waved a choice selection of pocket-handkerchiefs at this\r\nproposition; and the impetuous little man literally moved Mr. Humm into\r\nthe chair, by taking him by the shoulders and thrusting him into a\r\nmahogany-frame which had once represented that article of furniture. The\r\nwaving of handkerchiefs was renewed; and Mr. Humm, who was a sleek,\r\nwhite-faced man, in a perpetual perspiration, bowed meekly, to the great\r\nadmiration of the females, and formally took his seat. Silence was then\r\nproclaimed by the little man in the drab shorts, and Mr. Humm rose and\r\nsaid--That, with the permission of his Brick Lane Branch brothers and\r\nsisters, then and there present, the secretary would read the report of\r\nthe Brick Lane Branch committee; a proposition which was again received\r\nwith a demonstration of pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nThe secretary having sneezed in a very impressive manner, and the cough\r\nwhich always seizes an assembly, when anything particular is going to be\r\ndone, having been duly performed, the following document was read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE BRICK LANE BRANCH OF THE UNITED GRAND\r\nJUNCTION EBENEZER TEMPERANCE ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your committee have pursued their grateful labours during the past\r\nmonth, and have the unspeakable pleasure of reporting the following\r\nadditional cases of converts to Temperance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H. Walker, tailor, wife, and two children. When in better\r\ncircumstances, owns to having been in the constant habit of drinking ale\r\nand beer; says he is not certain whether he did not twice a week, for\r\ntwenty years, taste \xe2\x80\x9cdog\xe2\x80\x99s nose,\xe2\x80\x9d which your committee find upon\r\ninquiry, to be compounded of warm porter, moist sugar, gin, and nutmeg\r\n(a groan, and \xe2\x80\x98So it is!\xe2\x80\x99 from an elderly female). Is now out of work\r\nand penniless; thinks it must be the porter (cheers) or the loss of the\r\nuse of his right hand; is not certain which, but thinks it very likely\r\nthat, if he had drunk nothing but water all his life, his fellow-workman\r\nwould never have stuck a rusty needle in him, and thereby occasioned his\r\naccident (tremendous cheering). Has nothing but cold water to drink, and\r\nnever feels thirsty (great applause).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Betsy Martin, widow, one child, and one eye. Goes out charing and\r\nwashing, by the day; never had more than one eye, but knows her mother\r\ndrank bottled stout, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if that caused it (immense\r\ncheering). Thinks it not impossible that if she had always abstained\r\nfrom spirits she might have had two eyes by this time (tremendous\r\napplause). Used, at every place she went to, to have eighteen-pence a\r\nday, a pint of porter, and a glass of spirits; but since she became a\r\nmember of the Brick Lane Branch, has always demanded three-and-sixpence\r\n(the announcement of this most interesting fact was received with\r\ndeafening enthusiasm).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Henry Beller was for many years toast-master at various corporation\r\ndinners, during which time he drank a great deal of foreign wine; may\r\nsometimes have carried a bottle or two home with him; is not quite\r\ncertain of that, but is sure if he did, that he drank the contents.\r\nFeels very low and melancholy, is very feverish, and has a constant\r\nthirst upon him; thinks it must be the wine he used to drink (cheers).\r\nIs out of employ now; and never touches a drop of foreign wine by any\r\nchance (tremendous plaudits).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thomas Burton is purveyor of cat\xe2\x80\x99s meat to the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs,\r\nand several members of the Common Council (the announcement of this\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name was received with breathless interest). Has a wooden\r\nleg; finds a wooden leg expensive, going over the stones; used to wear\r\nsecond-hand wooden legs, and drink a glass of hot gin-and-water\r\nregularly every night--sometimes two (deep sighs). Found the second-hand\r\nwooden legs split and rot very quickly; is firmly persuaded that their\r\nconstitution was undermined by the gin-and-water (prolonged cheering).\r\nBuys new wooden legs now, and drinks nothing but water and weak tea. The\r\nnew legs last twice as long as the others used to do, and he attributes\r\nthis solely to his temperate habits (triumphant cheers).\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnthony Humm now moved that the assembly do regale itself with a song.\r\nWith a view to their rational and moral enjoyment, Brother Mordlin had\r\nadapted the beautiful words of \xe2\x80\x98Who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of a Jolly Young\r\nWaterman?\xe2\x80\x99 to the tune of the Old Hundredth, which he would request them\r\nto join him in singing (great applause). He might take that opportunity\r\nof expressing his firm persuasion that the late Mr. Dibdin, seeing the\r\nerrors of his former life, had written that song to show the advantages\r\nof abstinence. It was a temperance song (whirlwinds of cheers). The\r\nneatness of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s attire, the dexterity of his feathering, the\r\nenviable state of mind which enabled him in the beautiful words of the\r\npoet, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Row along, thinking of nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nall combined to prove that he must have been a water-drinker (cheers).\r\nOh, what a state of virtuous jollity! (rapturous cheering). And what was\r\nthe young man\xe2\x80\x99s reward? Let all young men present mark this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The maidens all flocked to his boat so readily.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Loud cheers, in which the ladies joined.) What a bright example! The\r\nsisterhood, the maidens, flocking round the young waterman, and urging\r\nhim along the stream of duty and of temperance. But, was it the maidens\r\nof humble life only, who soothed, consoled, and supported him? No!\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was always first oars with the fine city ladies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Immense cheering.) The soft sex to a man--he begged pardon, to a\r\nfemale--rallied round the young waterman, and turned with disgust from\r\nthe drinker of spirits (cheers). The Brick Lane Branch brothers were\r\nwatermen (cheers and laughter). That room was their boat; that audience\r\nwere the maidens; and he (Mr. Anthony Humm), however unworthily, was\r\n\xe2\x80\x98first oars\xe2\x80\x99 (unbounded applause).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot does he mean by the soft sex, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller, in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The womin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He ain\xe2\x80\x99t far out there, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98they _must _be a\r\nsoft sex--a wery soft sex, indeed--if they let themselves be gammoned by\r\nsuch fellers as him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAny further observations from the indignant old gentleman were cut short\r\nby the announcement of the song, which Mr. Anthony Humm gave out two\r\nlines at a time, for the information of such of his hearers as were\r\nunacquainted with the legend. While it was being sung, the little man\r\nwith the drab shorts disappeared; he returned immediately on its\r\nconclusion, and whispered Mr. Anthony Humm, with a face of the deepest\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friends,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Humm, holding up his hand in a deprecatory\r\nmanner, to bespeak the silence of such of the stout old ladies as were\r\nyet a line or two behind; \xe2\x80\x98my friends, a delegate from the Dorking\r\nBranch of our society, Brother Stiggins, attends below.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOut came the pocket-handkerchiefs again, in greater force than ever; for\r\nMr. Stiggins was excessively popular among the female constituency of\r\nBrick Lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He may approach, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Humm, looking round him, with a fat\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x98Brother Tadger, let him come forth and greet us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little man in the drab shorts who answered to the name of Brother\r\nTadger, bustled down the ladder with great speed, and was immediately\r\nafterwards heard tumbling up with the Reverend Mr. Stiggins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a-comin\xe2\x80\x99, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Weller, purple in the countenance\r\nwith suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98for I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. He\xe2\x80\x99s close\r\nto the door. I hear him a-knockin\xe2\x80\x99 his head again the lath and plaster\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Sam Weller spoke, the little door flew open, and Brother Tadger\r\nappeared, closely followed by the Reverend Mr. Stiggins, who no sooner\r\nentered, than there was a great clapping of hands, and stamping of feet,\r\nand flourishing of handkerchiefs; to all of which manifestations of\r\ndelight, Brother Stiggins returned no other acknowledgment than staring\r\nwith a wild eye, and a fixed smile, at the extreme top of the wick of\r\nthe candle on the table, swaying his body to and fro, meanwhile, in a\r\nvery unsteady and uncertain manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you unwell, Brother Stiggins?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Anthony Humm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am all right, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Stiggins, in a tone in which ferocity\r\nwas blended with an extreme thickness of utterance; \xe2\x80\x98I am all right,\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, very well,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Anthony Humm, retreating a few paces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe no man here has ventured to say that I am not all right,\r\nSir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Humm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should advise him not to, Sir; I should advise him not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nStiggins.\r\n\r\nBy this time the audience were perfectly silent, and waited with some\r\nanxiety for the resumption of business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you address the meeting, brother?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Humm, with a smile of\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Stiggins; \xe2\x80\x98No, sir. I will not, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe meeting looked at each other with raised eyelids; and a murmur of\r\nastonishment ran through the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins, unbuttoning his coat, and\r\nspeaking very loudly--\xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion, sir, that this meeting is drunk,\r\nsir. Brother Tadger, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins, suddenly increasing in\r\nferocity, and turning sharp round on the little man in the drab shorts,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_you _are drunk, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 With this, Mr. Stiggins, entertaining a\r\npraiseworthy desire to promote the sobriety of the meeting, and to\r\nexclude therefrom all improper characters, hit Brother Tadger on the\r\nsummit of the nose with such unerring aim, that the drab shorts\r\ndisappeared like a flash of lightning. Brother Tadger had been knocked,\r\nhead first, down the ladder.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the women set up a loud and dismal screaming; and rushing in\r\nsmall parties before their favourite brothers, flung their arms around\r\nthem to preserve them from danger. An instance of affection, which had\r\nnearly proved fatal to Humm, who, being extremely popular, was all but\r\nsuffocated, by the crowd of female devotees that hung about his neck,\r\nand heaped caresses upon him. The greater part of the lights were\r\nquickly put out, and nothing but noise and confusion resounded on all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, taking off his greatcoat with much\r\ndeliberation, \xe2\x80\x98just you step out, and fetch in a watchman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And wot are you a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do, the while?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never you mind me, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98I shall ockipy\r\nmyself in havin\xe2\x80\x99 a small settlement with that \xe2\x80\x98ere Stiggins.\xe2\x80\x99 Before Sam\r\ncould interfere to prevent it, his heroic parent had penetrated into a\r\nremote corner of the room, and attacked the Reverend Mr. Stiggins with\r\nmanual dexterity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come off!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come on!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Weller; and without further invitation he gave the\r\nReverend Mr. Stiggins a preliminary tap on the head, and began dancing\r\nround him in a buoyant and cork-like manner, which in a gentleman at his\r\ntime of life was a perfect marvel to behold.\r\n\r\nFinding all remonstrances unavailing, Sam pulled his hat firmly on,\r\nthrew his father\xe2\x80\x99s coat over his arm, and taking the old man round the\r\nwaist, forcibly dragged him down the ladder, and into the street; never\r\nreleasing his hold, or permitting him to stop, until they reached the\r\ncorner. As they gained it, they could hear the shouts of the populace,\r\nwho were witnessing the removal of the Reverend Mr. Stiggins to strong\r\nlodgings for the night, and could hear the noise occasioned by the\r\ndispersion in various directions of the members of the Brick Lane Branch\r\nof the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. IS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO A FULL AND FAITHFUL REPORT OF THE\r\nMEMORABLE TRIAL OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK\r\n\r\nI wonder what the foreman of the jury, whoever he\xe2\x80\x99ll be, has got for\r\nbreakfast,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, by way of keeping up a conversation on\r\nthe eventful morning of the fourteenth of February.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, \xe2\x80\x98I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s got a good one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhy so?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Highly important--very important, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker. \xe2\x80\x98A\r\ngood, contented, well-breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold\r\nof. Discontented or hungry jurymen, my dear sir, always find for the\r\nplaintiff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking very blank, \xe2\x80\x98what do they\r\ndo that for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the little man coolly; \xe2\x80\x98saves time, I\r\nsuppose. If it\xe2\x80\x99s near dinner-time, the foreman takes out his watch when\r\nthe jury has retired, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, gentlemen, ten minutes to\r\nfive, I declare! I dine at five, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d says everybody\r\nelse, except two men who ought to have dined at three and seem more than\r\nhalf disposed to stand out in consequence. The foreman smiles, and puts\r\nup his watch:--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen, what do we say, plaintiff or defendant,\r\ngentlemen? I rather think, so far as I am concerned, gentlemen,--I say,\r\nI rather think--but don\xe2\x80\x99t let that influence you--I _rather_ think the\r\nplaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s the man.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon this, two or three other men are sure to say\r\nthat they think so too--as of course they do; and then they get on very\r\nunanimously and comfortably. Ten minutes past nine!\xe2\x80\x99 said the little\r\nman, looking at his watch. \xe2\x80\x98Time we were off, my dear sir; breach of\r\npromise trial-court is generally full in such cases. You had better ring\r\nfor a coach, my dear sir, or we shall be rather late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick immediately rang the bell, and a coach having been\r\nprocured, the four Pickwickians and Mr. Perker ensconced themselves\r\ntherein, and drove to Guildhall; Sam Weller, Mr. Lowten, and the blue\r\nbag, following in a cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lowten,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, when they reached the outer hall of the court,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98put Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s friends in the students\xe2\x80\x99 box; Mr. Pickwick himself\r\nhad better sit by me. This way, my dear sir, this way.\xe2\x80\x99 Taking Mr.\r\nPickwick by the coat sleeve, the little man led him to the low seat just\r\nbeneath the desks of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Counsel, which is constructed for the\r\nconvenience of attorneys, who from that spot can whisper into the ear of\r\nthe leading counsel in the case, any instructions that may be necessary\r\nduring the progress of the trial. The occupants of this seat are\r\ninvisible to the great body of spectators, inasmuch as they sit on a\r\nmuch lower level than either the barristers or the audience, whose seats\r\nare raised above the floor. Of course they have their backs to both, and\r\ntheir faces towards the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the witness-box, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to a\r\nkind of pulpit, with a brass rail, on his left hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the witness-box, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, disinterring a\r\nquantity of papers from the blue bag, which Lowten had just deposited at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to a couple of enclosed seats on\r\nhis right, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s where the jurymen sit, is it not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The identical place, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, tapping the lid of\r\nhis snuff-box.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation, and took a glance\r\nat the court. There were already a pretty large sprinkling of spectators\r\nin the gallery, and a numerous muster of gentlemen in wigs, in the\r\nbarristers\xe2\x80\x99 seats, who presented, as a body, all that pleasing and\r\nextensive variety of nose and whisker for which the Bar of England is so\r\njustly celebrated. Such of the gentlemen as had a brief to carry,\r\ncarried it in as conspicuous a manner as possible, and occasionally\r\nscratched their noses therewith, to impress the fact more strongly on\r\nthe observation of the spectators. Other gentlemen, who had no briefs to\r\nshow, carried under their arms goodly octavos, with a red label behind,\r\nand that under-done-pie-crust-coloured cover, which is technically known\r\nas \xe2\x80\x98law calf.\xe2\x80\x99 Others, who had neither briefs nor books, thrust their\r\nhands into their pockets, and looked as wise as they conveniently could;\r\nothers, again, moved here and there with great restlessness and\r\nearnestness of manner, content to awaken thereby the admiration and\r\nastonishment of the uninitiated strangers. The whole, to the great\r\nwonderment of Mr. Pickwick, were divided into little groups, who were\r\nchatting and discussing the news of the day in the most unfeeling manner\r\npossible--just as if no trial at all were coming on.\r\n\r\nA bow from Mr. Phunky, as he entered, and took his seat behind the row\r\nappropriated to the King\xe2\x80\x99s Counsel, attracted Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s attention;\r\nand he had scarcely returned it, when Mr. Serjeant Snubbin appeared,\r\nfollowed by Mr. Mallard, who half hid the Serjeant behind a large\r\ncrimson bag, which he placed on his table, and, after shaking hands with\r\nPerker, withdrew. Then there entered two or three more Serjeants; and\r\namong them, one with a fat body and a red face, who nodded in a friendly\r\nmanner to Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, and said it was a fine morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that red-faced man, who said it was a fine morning, and nodded to\r\nour counsel?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s opposed to us; he leads on\r\nthe other side. That gentleman behind him is Mr. Skimpin, his junior.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was on the point of inquiring, with great abhorrence of the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s cold-blooded villainy, how Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, who was counsel\r\nfor the opposite party, dared to presume to tell Mr. Serjeant Snubbin,\r\nwho was counsel for him, that it was a fine morning, when he was\r\ninterrupted by a general rising of the barristers, and a loud cry of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence!\xe2\x80\x99 from the officers of the court. Looking round, he found that\r\nthis was caused by the entrance of the judge.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Stareleigh (who sat in the absence of the Chief Justice,\r\noccasioned by indisposition) was a most particularly short man, and so\r\nfat, that he seemed all face and waistcoat. He rolled in, upon two\r\nlittle turned legs, and having bobbed gravely to the Bar, who bobbed\r\ngravely to him, put his little legs underneath his table, and his little\r\nthree-cornered hat upon it; and when Mr. Justice Stareleigh had done\r\nthis, all you could see of him was two queer little eyes, one broad pink\r\nface, and somewhere about half of a big and very comical-looking wig.\r\n\r\nThe judge had no sooner taken his seat, than the officer on the floor of\r\nthe court called out \xe2\x80\x98Silence!\xe2\x80\x99 in a commanding tone, upon which another\r\nofficer in the gallery cried \xe2\x80\x98Silence!\xe2\x80\x99 in an angry manner, whereupon\r\nthree or four more ushers shouted \xe2\x80\x98Silence!\xe2\x80\x99 in a voice of indignant\r\nremonstrance. This being done, a gentleman in black, who sat below the\r\njudge, proceeded to call over the names of the jury; and after a great\r\ndeal of bawling, it was discovered that only ten special jurymen were\r\npresent. Upon this, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a _tales_; the gentleman\r\nin black then proceeded to press into the special jury, two of the\r\ncommon jurymen; and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Answer to your names, gentlemen, that you may be sworn,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ngentleman in black. \xe2\x80\x98Richard Upwitch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the greengrocer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thomas Groffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chemist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take the book, gentlemen. You shall well and truly try--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg this court\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chemist, who was a tall, thin,\r\nyellow-visaged man, \xe2\x80\x98but I hope this court will excuse my attendance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On what grounds, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Justice Stareleigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no assistant, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chemist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help that, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Justice Stareleigh. \xe2\x80\x98You should\r\nhire one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the chemist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you ought to be able to afford it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge,\r\nreddening; for Mr. Justice Stareleigh\xe2\x80\x99s temper bordered on the\r\nirritable, and brooked not contradiction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know I _ought _to do, if I got on as well as I deserved; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nmy Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the chemist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Swear the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge peremptorily.\r\n\r\nThe officer had got no further than the \xe2\x80\x98You shall well and truly try,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhen he was again interrupted by the chemist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am to be sworn, my Lord, am I?\xe2\x80\x99 said the chemist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the testy little judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the chemist, in a resigned manner. \xe2\x80\x98Then\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be murder before this trial\xe2\x80\x99s over; that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Swear me, if\r\nyou please, Sir;\xe2\x80\x99 and sworn the chemist was, before the judge could find\r\nwords to utter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I merely wanted to observe, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chemist, taking his seat\r\nwith great deliberation, \xe2\x80\x98that I\xe2\x80\x99ve left nobody but an errand-boy in my\r\nshop. He is a very nice boy, my Lord, but he is not acquainted with\r\ndrugs; and I know that the prevailing impression on his mind is, that\r\nEpsom salts means oxalic acid; and syrup of senna, laudanum. That\xe2\x80\x99s all,\r\nmy Lord.\xe2\x80\x99 With this, the tall chemist composed himself into a\r\ncomfortable attitude, and, assuming a pleasant expression of\r\ncountenance, appeared to have prepared himself for the worst.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepest\r\nhorror, when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body of the\r\ncourt; and immediately afterwards Mrs. Bardell, supported by Mrs.\r\nCluppins, was led in, and placed, in a drooping state, at the other end\r\nof the seat on which Mr. Pickwick sat. An extra-sized umbrella was then\r\nhanded in by Mr. Dodson, and a pair of pattens by Mr. Fogg, each of whom\r\nhad prepared a most sympathising and melancholy face for the occasion.\r\nMrs. Sanders then appeared, leading in Master Bardell. At sight of her\r\nchild, Mrs. Bardell started; suddenly recollecting herself, she kissed\r\nhim in a frantic manner; then relapsing into a state of hysterical\r\nimbecility, the good lady requested to be informed where she was. In\r\nreply to this, Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders turned their heads away\r\nand wept, while Messrs. Dodson and Fogg entreated the plaintiff to\r\ncompose herself. Serjeant Buzfuz rubbed his eyes very hard with a large\r\nwhite handkerchief, and gave an appealing look towards the jury, while\r\nthe judge was visibly affected, and several of the beholders tried to\r\ncough down their emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good notion that indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Perker to Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital fellows those Dodson and Fogg; excellent ideas of effect, my\r\ndear Sir, excellent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Perker spoke, Mrs. Bardell began to recover by slow degrees, while\r\nMrs. Cluppins, after a careful survey of Master Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s buttons and\r\nthe button-holes to which they severally belonged, placed him on the\r\nfloor of the court in front of his mother--a commanding position in\r\nwhich he could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of\r\nboth judge and jury. This was not done without considerable opposition,\r\nand many tears, on the part of the young gentleman himself, who had\r\ncertain inward misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of\r\nthe judge\xe2\x80\x99s eye was only a formal prelude to his being immediately\r\nordered away for instant execution, or for transportation beyond the\r\nseas, during the whole term of his natural life, at the very least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bardell and Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the gentleman in black, calling on the\r\ncase, which stood first on the list.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am for the plaintiff, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is with you, Brother Buzfuz?\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge. Mr. Skimpin bowed, to\r\nintimate that he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I appear for the defendant, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anybody with you, Brother Snubbin?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Phunky, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Serjeant Snubbin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serjeant Buzfuz and Mr. Skimpin for the plaintiff,\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge,\r\nwriting down the names in his note-book, and reading as he wrote; \xe2\x80\x98for\r\nthe defendant, Serjeant Snubbin and Mr. Monkey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, Phunky.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge; \xe2\x80\x98I never had the pleasure of hearing\r\nthe gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name before.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Phunky bowed and smiled, and the\r\njudge bowed and smiled too, and then Mr. Phunky, blushing into the very\r\nwhites of his eyes, tried to look as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that everybody\r\nwas gazing at him, a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet, or\r\nin all reasonable probability, ever will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on,\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge.\r\n\r\nThe ushers again called silence, and Mr. Skimpin proceeded to \xe2\x80\x98open the\r\ncase\xe2\x80\x99; and the case appeared to have very little inside it when he had\r\nopened it, for he kept such particulars as he knew, completely to\r\nhimself, and sat down, after a lapse of three minutes, leaving the jury\r\nin precisely the same advanced stage of wisdom as they were in before.\r\n\r\nSerjeant Buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and dignity which the\r\ngrave nature of the proceedings demanded, and having whispered to\r\nDodson, and conferred briefly with Fogg, pulled his gown over his\r\nshoulders, settled his wig, and addressed the jury.\r\n\r\nSerjeant Buzfuz began by saying, that never, in the whole course of his\r\nprofessional experience--never, from the very first moment of his\r\napplying himself to the study and practice of the law--had he approached\r\na case with feelings of such deep emotion, or with such a heavy sense of\r\nthe responsibility imposed upon him--a responsibility, he would say,\r\nwhich he could never have supported, were he not buoyed up and sustained\r\nby a conviction so strong, that it amounted to positive certainty that\r\nthe cause of truth and justice, or, in other words, the cause of his\r\nmuch-injured and most oppressed client, must prevail with the high-\r\nminded and intelligent dozen of men whom he now saw in that box before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCounsel usually begin in this way, because it puts the jury on the very\r\nbest terms with themselves, and makes them think what sharp fellows they\r\nmust be. A visible effect was produced immediately, several jurymen\r\nbeginning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Serjeant\r\nBuzfuz, well knowing that, from the learned friend alluded to, the\r\ngentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at all--\xe2\x80\x98you have heard\r\nfrom my learned friend, gentlemen, that this is an action for a breach\r\nof promise of marriage, in which the damages are laid at \xc2\xa31,500. But you\r\nhave not heard from my learned friend, inasmuch as it did not come\r\nwithin my learned friend\xe2\x80\x99s province to tell you, what are the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the case. Those facts and circumstances, gentlemen, you\r\nshall hear detailed by me, and proved by the unimpeachable female whom I\r\nwill place in that box before you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, with a tremendous emphasis on the word \xe2\x80\x98box,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsmote his table with a mighty sound, and glanced at Dodson and Fogg, who\r\nnodded admiration of the Serjeant, and indignant defiance of the\r\ndefendant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The plaintiff, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Serjeant Buzfuz, in a soft and\r\nmelancholy voice, \xe2\x80\x98the plaintiff is a widow; yes, gentlemen, a widow.\r\nThe late Mr. Bardell, after enjoying, for many years, the esteem and\r\nconfidence of his sovereign, as one of the guardians of his royal\r\nrevenues, glided almost imperceptibly from the world, to seek elsewhere\r\nfor that repose and peace which a custom-house can never afford.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this pathetic description of the decease of Mr. Bardell, who had been\r\nknocked on the head with a quart-pot in a public-house cellar, the\r\nlearned serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s voice faltered, and he proceeded, with emotion--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some time before his death, he had stamped his likeness upon a little\r\nboy. With this little boy, the only pledge of her departed exciseman,\r\nMrs. Bardell shrank from the world, and courted the retirement and\r\ntranquillity of Goswell Street; and here she placed in her front parlour\r\nwindow a written placard, bearing this inscription--\xe2\x80\x9cApartments\r\nfurnished for a single gentleman. Inquire within.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 Here Serjeant Buzfuz\r\npaused, while several gentlemen of the jury took a note of the document.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no date to that, is there?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired a juror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no date, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Serjeant Buzfuz; \xe2\x80\x98but I am\r\ninstructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s parlour window just\r\nthis time three years. I entreat the attention of the jury to the\r\nwording of this document--\xe2\x80\x9cApartments furnished for a single gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d!\r\nMrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s opinions of the opposite sex, gentlemen, were derived\r\nfrom a long contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost\r\nhusband. She had no fear, she had no distrust, she had no suspicion; all\r\nwas confidence and reliance. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bardell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bardell\r\nwas a man of honour, Mr. Bardell was a man of his word, Mr. Bardell was\r\nno deceiver, Mr. Bardell was once a single gentleman himself; to single\r\ngentlemen I look for protection, for assistance, for comfort, and for\r\nconsolation; in single gentlemen I shall perpetually see something to\r\nremind me of what Mr. Bardell was when he first won my young and untried\r\naffections; to a single gentleman, then, shall my lodgings be let.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Actuated by this beautiful and touching impulse (among the best impulses\r\nof our imperfect nature, gentlemen), the lonely and desolate widow dried\r\nher tears, furnished her first floor, caught her innocent boy to her\r\nmaternal bosom, and put the bill up in her parlour window. Did it remain\r\nthere long? No. The serpent was on the watch, the train was laid, the\r\nmine was preparing, the sapper and miner was at work. Before the bill\r\nhad been in the parlour window three days--three days, gentlemen--a\r\nbeing, erect upon two legs, and bearing all the outward semblance of a\r\nman, and not of a monster, knocked at the door of Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nHe inquired within--he took the lodgings; and on the very next day he\r\nentered into possession of them. This man was Pickwick--Pickwick, the\r\ndefendant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSerjeant Buzfuz, who had proceeded with such volubility that his face\r\nwas perfectly crimson, here paused for breath. The silence awoke Mr.\r\nJustice Stareleigh, who immediately wrote down something with a pen\r\nwithout any ink in it, and looked unusually profound, to impress the\r\njury with the belief that he always thought most deeply with his eyes\r\nshut. Serjeant Buzfuz proceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of this man Pickwick I will say little; the subject presents but few\r\nattractions; and I, gentlemen, am not the man, nor are you, gentlemen,\r\nthe men, to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness, and\r\nof systematic villainy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Pickwick, who had been writhing in silence for some time, gave\r\na violent start, as if some vague idea of assaulting Serjeant Buzfuz, in\r\nthe august presence of justice and law, suggested itself to his mind. An\r\nadmonitory gesture from Perker restrained him, and he listened to the\r\nlearned gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s continuation with a look of indignation, which\r\ncontrasted forcibly with the admiring faces of Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs.\r\nSanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say systematic villainy, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking\r\nthrough Mr. Pickwick, and talking _at_ him; \xe2\x80\x98and when I say systematic\r\nvillainy, let me tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am\r\ninformed he is, that it would have been more decent in him, more\r\nbecoming, in better judgment, and in better taste, if he had stopped\r\naway. Let me tell him, gentlemen, that any gestures of dissent or\r\ndisapprobation in which he may indulge in this court will not go down\r\nwith you; that you will know how to value and how to appreciate them;\r\nand let me tell him further, as my Lord will tell you, gentlemen, that a\r\ncounsel, in the discharge of his duty to his client, is neither to be\r\nintimidated nor bullied, nor put down; and that any attempt to do either\r\nthe one or the other, or the first, or the last, will recoil on the head\r\nof the attempter, be he plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name\r\nPickwick, or Noakes, or Stoakes, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thompson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little divergence from the subject in hand, had, of course, the\r\nintended effect of turning all eyes to Mr. Pickwick. Serjeant Buzfuz,\r\nhaving partially recovered from the state of moral elevation into which\r\nhe had lashed himself, resumed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall show you, gentlemen, that for two years, Pickwick continued to\r\nreside constantly, and without interruption or intermission, at Mrs.\r\nBardell\xe2\x80\x99s house. I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the whole of\r\nthat time, waited on him, attended to his comforts, cooked his meals,\r\nlooked out his linen for the washerwoman when it went abroad, darned,\r\naired, and prepared it for wear, when it came home, and, in short,\r\nenjoyed his fullest trust and confidence. I shall show you that, on many\r\noccasions, he gave halfpence, and on some occasions even sixpences, to\r\nher little boy; and I shall prove to you, by a witness whose testimony\r\nit will be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert,\r\nthat on one occasion he patted the boy on the head, and, after inquiring\r\nwhether he had won any \xe2\x80\x9c_alley tors_\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c_commoneys_\xe2\x80\x9d lately (both of\r\nwhich I understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized by\r\nthe youth of this town), made use of this remarkable expression, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nshould you like to have another father?\xe2\x80\x9d I shall prove to you,\r\ngentlemen, that about a year ago, Pickwick suddenly began to absent\r\nhimself from home, during long intervals, as if with the intention of\r\ngradually breaking off from my client; but I shall show you also, that\r\nhis resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong, or that his\r\nbetter feelings conquered, if better feelings he has, or that the charms\r\nand accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly\r\nintentions, by proving to you, that on one occasion, when he returned\r\nfrom the country, he distinctly and in terms, offered her marriage:\r\npreviously, however, taking special care that there would be no witness\r\nto their solemn contract; and I am in a situation to prove to you, on\r\nthe testimony of three of his own friends--most unwilling witnesses,\r\ngentlemen--most unwilling witnesses--that on that morning he was\r\ndiscovered by them holding the plaintiff in his arms, and soothing her\r\nagitation by his caresses and endearments.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this part of the\r\nlearned Serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s address. Drawing forth two very small scraps of\r\npaper, he proceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, gentlemen, but one word more. Two letters have passed between\r\nthese parties, letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of\r\nthe defendant, and which speak volumes, indeed. The letters, too,\r\nbespeak the character of the man. They are not open, fervent, eloquent\r\nepistles, breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment.\r\nThey are covert, sly, underhanded communications, but, fortunately, far\r\nmore conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and the\r\nmost poetic imagery--letters that must be viewed with a cautious and\r\nsuspicious eye--letters that were evidently intended at the time, by\r\nPickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties into whose hands they\r\nmight fall. Let me read the first: \xe2\x80\x9cGarraways, twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Dear Mrs.\r\nB.--Chops and tomato sauce. Yours, _Pickwick_.\xe2\x80\x9d Gentlemen, what does\r\nthis mean? Chops and tomato sauce. Yours, Pickwick! Chops! Gracious\r\nheavens! and tomato sauce! Gentlemen, is the happiness of a sensitive\r\nand confiding female to be trifled away, by such shallow artifices as\r\nthese? The next has no date whatever, which is in itself suspicious.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mrs. B., I shall not be at home till to-morrow. Slow coach.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen follows this very remarkable expression. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself\r\nabout the warming-pan.\xe2\x80\x9d The warming-pan! Why, gentlemen, who _does\r\n_trouble himself about a warming-pan? When was the peace of mind of man\r\nor woman broken or disturbed by a warming-pan, which is in itself a\r\nharmless, a useful, and I will add, gentlemen, a comforting article of\r\ndomestic furniture? Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to\r\nagitate herself about this warming-pan, unless (as is no doubt the case)\r\nit is a mere cover for hidden fire--a mere substitute for some endearing\r\nword or promise, agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence,\r\nartfully contrived by Pickwick with a view to his contemplated\r\ndesertion, and which I am not in a condition to explain? And what does\r\nthis allusion to the slow coach mean? For aught I know, it may be a\r\nreference to Pickwick himself, who has most unquestionably been a\r\ncriminally slow coach during the whole of this transaction, but whose\r\nspeed will now be very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels,\r\ngentlemen, as he will find to his cost, will very soon be greased by\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Serjeant Buzfuz paused in this place, to see whether the jury smiled\r\nat his joke; but as nobody took it but the greengrocer, whose\r\nsensitiveness on the subject was very probably occasioned by his having\r\nsubjected a chaise-cart to the process in question on that identical\r\nmorning, the learned Serjeant considered it advisable to undergo a\r\nslight relapse into the dismals before he concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But enough of this, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\ndifficult to smile with an aching heart; it is ill jesting when our\r\ndeepest sympathies are awakened. My client\xe2\x80\x99s hopes and prospects are\r\nruined, and it is no figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone\r\nindeed. The bill is down--but there is no tenant. Eligible single\r\ngentlemen pass and repass--but there is no invitation for to inquire\r\nwithin or without. All is gloom and silence in the house; even the voice\r\nof the child is hushed; his infant sports are disregarded when his\r\nmother weeps; his \xe2\x80\x9calley tors\xe2\x80\x9d and his \xe2\x80\x9ccommoneys\xe2\x80\x9d are alike neglected;\r\nhe forgets the long familiar cry of \xe2\x80\x9cknuckle down,\xe2\x80\x9d and at tip-cheese,\r\nor odd and even, his hand is out. But Pickwick, gentlemen, Pickwick, the\r\nruthless destroyer of this domestic oasis in the desert of Goswell\r\nStreet--Pickwick who has choked up the well, and thrown ashes on the\r\nsward--Pickwick, who comes before you to-day with his heartless tomato\r\nsauce and warming-pans--Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing\r\neffrontery, and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made. Damages,\r\ngentlemen--heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can visit\r\nhim; the only recompense you can award to my client. And for those\r\ndamages she now appeals to an enlightened, a high-minded, a right-\r\nfeeling, a conscientious, a dispassionate, a sympathising, a\r\ncontemplative jury of her civilised countrymen.\xe2\x80\x99 With this beautiful\r\nperoration, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz sat down, and Mr. Justice Stareleigh\r\nwoke up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call Elizabeth Cluppins,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, rising a minute\r\nafterwards, with renewed vigour.\r\n\r\nThe nearest usher called for Elizabeth Tuppins; another one, at a little\r\ndistance off, demanded Elizabeth Jupkins; and a third rushed in a\r\nbreathless state into King Street, and screamed for Elizabeth Muffins\r\ntill he was hoarse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mrs. Cluppins, with the combined assistance of Mrs. Bardell,\r\nMrs. Sanders, Mr. Dodson, and Mr. Fogg, was hoisted into the witness-\r\nbox; and when she was safely perched on the top step, Mrs. Bardell stood\r\non the bottom one, with the pocket-handkerchief and pattens in one hand,\r\nand a glass bottle that might hold about a quarter of a pint of\r\nsmelling-salts in the other, ready for any emergency. Mrs. Sanders,\r\nwhose eyes were intently fixed on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s face, planted herself\r\nclose by, with the large umbrella, keeping her right thumb pressed on\r\nthe spring with an earnest countenance, as if she were fully prepared to\r\nput it up at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Cluppins,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, \xe2\x80\x98pray compose yourself, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nOf course, directly Mrs. Cluppins was desired to compose herself, she\r\nsobbed with increased vehemence, and gave divers alarming manifestations\r\nof an approaching fainting fit, or, as she afterwards said, of her\r\nfeelings being too many for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you recollect, Mrs. Cluppins,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, after a few\r\nunimportant questions--\xe2\x80\x98do you recollect being in Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s back\r\none pair of stairs, on one particular morning in July last, when she was\r\ndusting Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s apartment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my Lord and jury, I do,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room was the first-floor front, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it were, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What were you doing in the back room, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the little\r\njudge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Lord and jury,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins, with interesting agitation, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill not deceive you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better not, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was there,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mrs. Cluppins, \xe2\x80\x98unbeknown to Mrs. Bardell; I had\r\nbeen out with a little basket, gentlemen, to buy three pound of red\r\nkidney pertaties, which was three pound tuppence ha\xe2\x80\x99penny, when I see\r\nMrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s street door on the jar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the what?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the little judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partly open, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Snubbin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She said on the jar,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little judge, with a cunning look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Snubbin. The little judge\r\nlooked doubtful, and said he\xe2\x80\x99d make a note of it. Mrs. Cluppins then\r\nresumed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I walked in, gentlemen, just to say good-mornin\xe2\x80\x99, and went, in a\r\npermiscuous manner, upstairs, and into the back room. Gentlemen, there\r\nwas the sound of voices in the front room, and--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you listened, I believe, Mrs. Cluppins?\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beggin\xe2\x80\x99 your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Cluppins, in a majestic manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would scorn the haction. The voices was very loud, Sir, and forced\r\nthemselves upon my ear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mrs. Cluppins, you were not listening, but you heard the voices.\r\nWas one of those voices Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it were, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 And Mrs. Cluppins, after distinctly stating that\r\nMr. Pickwick addressed himself to Mrs. Bardell, repeated by slow\r\ndegrees, and by dint of many questions, the conversation with which our\r\nreaders are already acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe jury looked suspicious, and Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz smiled as he sat\r\ndown. They looked positively awful when Serjeant Snubbin intimated that\r\nhe should not cross-examine the witness, for Mr. Pickwick wished it to\r\nbe distinctly stated that it was due to her to say, that her account was\r\nin substance correct.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cluppins having once broken the ice, thought it a favourable\r\nopportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic\r\naffairs; so she straightway proceeded to inform the court that she was\r\nthe mother of eight children at that present speaking, and that she\r\nentertained confident expectations of presenting Mr. Cluppins with a\r\nninth, somewhere about that day six months. At this interesting point,\r\nthe little judge interposed most irascibly; and the effect of the\r\ninterposition was, that both the worthy lady and Mrs. Sanders were\r\npolitely taken out of court, under the escort of Mr. Jackson, without\r\nfurther parley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nathaniel Winkle!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Skimpin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99 replied a feeble voice. Mr. Winkle entered the witness-box, and\r\nhaving been duly sworn, bowed to the judge with considerable deference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge sharply, in acknowledgment of\r\nthe salute; \xe2\x80\x98look at the jury.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle obeyed the mandate, and looked at the place where he thought\r\nit most probable the jury might be; for seeing anything in his then\r\nstate of intellectual complication was wholly out of the question.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle was then examined by Mr. Skimpin, who, being a promising\r\nyoung man of two or three-and-forty, was of course anxious to confuse a\r\nwitness who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side, as\r\nmuch as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Skimpin, \xe2\x80\x98have the goodness to let his Lordship\r\nknow what your name is, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 and Mr. Skimpin inclined his head on\r\none side to listen with great sharpness to the answer, and glanced at\r\nthe jury meanwhile, as if to imply that he rather expected Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnatural taste for perjury would induce him to give some name which did\r\nnot belong to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the witness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s your Christian name, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 angrily inquired the little judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nathaniel, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Daniel--any other name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nathaniel, sir--my Lord, I mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nathaniel Daniel, or Daniel Nathaniel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my Lord, only Nathaniel--not Daniel at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you tell me it was Daniel for, then, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the judge, with a severe frown. \xe2\x80\x98How could I\r\nhave got Daniel on my notes, unless you told me so, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis argument was, of course, unanswerable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Winkle has rather a short memory, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Skimpin,\r\nwith another glance at the jury. \xe2\x80\x98We shall find means to refresh it\r\nbefore we have quite done with him, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better be careful, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little judge, with a sinister\r\nlook at the witness.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Winkle bowed, and endeavoured to feign an easiness of manner,\r\nwhich, in his then state of confusion, gave him rather the air of a\r\ndisconcerted pickpocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Skimpin, \xe2\x80\x98attend to me, if you please, Sir;\r\nand let me recommend you, for your own sake, to bear in mind his\r\nLordship\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions to be careful. I believe you are a particular\r\nfriend of Mr. Pickwick, the defendant, are you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have known Mr. Pickwick now, as well as I recollect at this moment,\r\nnearly--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Mr. Winkle, do not evade the question. Are you, or are you not, a\r\nparticular friend of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was just about to say, that--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you, or will you not, answer my question, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be committed, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed\r\nthe little judge, looking over his note-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Skimpin, \xe2\x80\x98yes or no, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you are. And why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say that at once, Sir? Perhaps you\r\nknow the plaintiff too? Eh, Mr. Winkle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her; I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know her, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her? Now, have the goodness to\r\ntell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by that, Mr. Winkle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean that I am not intimate with her, but I have seen her when I went\r\nto call on Mr. Pickwick, in Goswell Street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How often have you seen her, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How often?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr. Winkle, how often? I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat the question for you a dozen\r\ntimes, if you require it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 And the learned gentleman, with a firm\r\nand steady frown, placed his hands on his hips, and smiled suspiciously\r\nto the jury.\r\n\r\nOn this question there arose the edifying brow-beating, customary on\r\nsuch points. First of all, Mr. Winkle said it was quite impossible for\r\nhim to say how many times he had seen Mrs. Bardell. Then he was asked if\r\nhe had seen her twenty times, to which he replied, \xe2\x80\x98Certainly--more than\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he was asked whether he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen her a hundred times--\r\nwhether he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swear that he had seen her more than fifty times--\r\nwhether he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that he had seen her at least seventy-five times,\r\nand so forth; the satisfactory conclusion which was arrived at, at last,\r\nbeing, that he had better take care of himself, and mind what he was\r\nabout. The witness having been by these means reduced to the requisite\r\nebb of nervous perplexity, the examination was continued as follows--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Mr. Winkle, do you remember calling on the defendant Pickwick at\r\nthese apartments in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s house in Goswell Street, on one\r\nparticular morning, in the month of July last?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were you accompanied on that occasion by a friend of the name of\r\nTupman, and another by the name of Snodgrass?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are they here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes, they are,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, looking very earnestly towards the\r\nspot where his friends were stationed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray attend to me, Mr. Winkle, and never mind your friends,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nSkimpin, with another expressive look at the jury. \xe2\x80\x98They must tell their\r\nstories without any previous consultation with you, if none has yet\r\ntaken place (another look at the jury). Now, Sir, tell the gentlemen of\r\nthe jury what you saw on entering the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s room, on this\r\nparticular morning. Come; out with it, Sir; we must have it, sooner or\r\nlater.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The defendant, Mr. Pickwick, was holding the plaintiff in his arms,\r\nwith his hands clasping her waist,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle with natural\r\nhesitation, \xe2\x80\x98and the plaintiff appeared to have fainted away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you hear the defendant say anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I heard him call Mrs. Bardell a good creature, and I heard him ask her\r\nto compose herself, for what a situation it was, if anybody should come,\r\nor words to that effect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Winkle, I have only one more question to ask you, and I beg\r\nyou to bear in mind his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s caution. Will you undertake to swear\r\nthat Pickwick, the defendant, did not say on the occasion in question--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mrs. Bardell, you\xe2\x80\x99re a good creature; compose yourself to this\r\nsituation, for to this situation you must come,\xe2\x80\x9d or words to that\r\neffect?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand him so, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, astounded\r\non this ingenious dove-tailing of the few words he had heard. \xe2\x80\x98I was on\r\nthe staircase, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear distinctly; the impression on my mind\r\nis--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind,\r\nMr. Winkle, which I fear would be of little service to honest,\r\nstraightforward men,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Skimpin. \xe2\x80\x98You were on the\r\nstaircase, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t distinctly hear; but you will not swear that\r\nPickwick did not make use of the expressions I have quoted? Do I\r\nunderstand that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I will not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle; and down sat Mr. Skimpin with a\r\ntriumphant countenance.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner,\r\nup to this point, that it could very well afford to have any additional\r\nsuspicion cast upon it. But as it could afford to be placed in a rather\r\nbetter light, if possible, Mr. Phunky rose for the purpose of getting\r\nsomething important out of Mr. Winkle in cross-examination. Whether he\r\ndid get anything important out of him, will immediately appear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe, Mr. Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Phunky, \xe2\x80\x98that Mr. Pickwick is not a\r\nyoung man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98old enough to be my father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have told my learned friend that you have known Mr. Pickwick a long\r\ntime. Had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about to\r\nbe married?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; certainly not;\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle with so much eagerness, that\r\nMr. Phunky ought to have got him out of the box with all possible\r\ndispatch. Lawyers hold that there are two kinds of particularly bad\r\nwitnesses--a reluctant witness, and a too-willing witness; it was Mr.\r\nWinkle\xe2\x80\x99s fate to figure in both characters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will even go further than this, Mr. Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Phunky, in\r\na most smooth and complacent manner. \xe2\x80\x98Did you ever see anything in Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s manner and conduct towards the opposite sex, to induce you to\r\nbelieve that he ever contemplated matrimony of late years, in any case?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has his behaviour, when females have been in the case, always been that\r\nof a man, who, having attained a pretty advanced period of life, content\r\nwith his own occupations and amusements, treats them only as a father\r\nmight his daughters?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the least doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, in the fulness of his\r\nheart. \xe2\x80\x98That is--yes--oh, yes--certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have never known anything in his behaviour towards Mrs. Bardell, or\r\nany other female, in the least degree suspicious?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Phunky,\r\npreparing to sit down; for Serjeant Snubbin was winking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N-n-no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98except on one trifling occasion, which, I\r\nhave no doubt, might be easily explained.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, if the unfortunate Mr. Phunky had sat down when Serjeant Snubbin\r\nhad winked at him, or if Serjeant Buzfuz had stopped this irregular\r\ncross-examination at the outset (which he knew better than to do;\r\nobserving Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety, and well knowing it would, in all\r\nprobability, lead to something serviceable to him), this unfortunate\r\nadmission would not have been elicited. The moment the words fell from\r\nMr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s lips, Mr. Phunky sat down, and Serjeant Snubbin rather\r\nhastily told him he might leave the box, which Mr. Winkle prepared to do\r\nwith great readiness, when Serjeant Buzfuz stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, Mr. Winkle, stay!\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, \xe2\x80\x98will your Lordship have\r\nthe goodness to ask him, what this one instance of suspicious behaviour\r\ntowards females on the part of this gentleman, who is old enough to be\r\nhis father, was?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You hear what the learned counsel says, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the judge,\r\nturning to the miserable and agonised Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98Describe the occasion\r\nto which you refer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, trembling with anxiety, \xe2\x80\x98I--I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little judge; \xe2\x80\x98but you must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmid the profound silence of the whole court, Mr. Winkle faltered out,\r\nthat the trifling circumstance of suspicion was Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nfound in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping-apartment at midnight; which had terminated,\r\nhe believed, in the breaking off of the projected marriage of the lady\r\nin question, and had led, he knew, to the whole party being forcibly\r\ncarried before George Nupkins, Esq., magistrate and justice of the\r\npeace, for the borough of Ipswich!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may leave the box, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Snubbin. Mr. Winkle did\r\nleave the box, and rushed with delirious haste to the George and\r\nVulture, where he was discovered some hours after, by the waiter,\r\ngroaning in a hollow and dismal manner, with his head buried beneath the\r\nsofa cushions.\r\n\r\nTracy Tupman, and Augustus Snodgrass, were severally called into the\r\nbox; both corroborated the testimony of their unhappy friend; and each\r\nwas driven to the verge of desperation by excessive badgering.\r\n\r\nSusannah Sanders was then called, and examined by Serjeant Buzfuz, and\r\ncross-examined by Serjeant Snubbin. Had always said and believed that\r\nPickwick would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew that Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nengaged to Pickwick was the current topic of conversation in the\r\nneighbourhood, after the fainting in July; had been told it herself by\r\nMrs. Mudberry which kept a mangle, and Mrs. Bunkin which clear-starched,\r\nbut did not see either Mrs. Mudberry or Mrs. Bunkin in court. Had heard\r\nPickwick ask the little boy how he should like to have another father.\r\nDid not know that Mrs. Bardell was at that time keeping company with the\r\nbaker, but did know that the baker was then a single man and is now\r\nmarried. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swear that Mrs. Bardell was not very fond of the\r\nbaker, but should think that the baker was not very fond of Mrs.\r\nBardell, or he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have married somebody else. Thought Mrs. Bardell\r\nfainted away on the morning in July, because Pickwick asked her to name\r\nthe day: knew that she (witness) fainted away stone dead when Mr.\r\nSanders asked her to name the day, and believed that everybody as called\r\nherself a lady would do the same, under similar circumstances. Heard\r\nPickwick ask the boy the question about the marbles, but upon her oath\r\ndid not know the difference between an \xe2\x80\x98alley tor\xe2\x80\x99 and a \xe2\x80\x98commoney.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy the _court_.--During the period of her keeping company with Mr.\r\nSanders, had received love letters, like other ladies. In the course of\r\ntheir correspondence Mr. Sanders had often called her a \xe2\x80\x98duck,\xe2\x80\x99 but\r\nnever \xe2\x80\x98chops,\xe2\x80\x99 nor yet \xe2\x80\x98tomato sauce.\xe2\x80\x99 He was particularly fond of\r\nducks. Perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomato sauce, he\r\nmight have called her that, as a term of affection.\r\n\r\nSerjeant Buzfuz now rose with more importance than he had yet exhibited,\r\nif that were possible, and vociferated; \xe2\x80\x98Call Samuel Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was quite unnecessary to call Samuel Weller; for Samuel Weller\r\nstepped briskly into the box the instant his name was pronounced; and\r\nplacing his hat on the floor, and his arms on the rail, took a bird\xe2\x80\x99s-\r\neye view of the Bar, and a comprehensive survey of the Bench, with a\r\nremarkably cheerful and lively aspect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s your name, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam Weller, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you spell it with a \xe2\x80\x9cV\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nSam; \xe2\x80\x98I never had occasion to spell it more than once or twice in my\r\nlife, but I spells it with a \xe2\x80\x9cV.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud, \xe2\x80\x98Quite right too, Samivel,\r\nquite right. Put it down a \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d my Lord, put it down a \xe2\x80\x9cwe.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWho is that, who dares address the court?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little judge,\r\nlooking up. \xe2\x80\x98Usher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bring that person here instantly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut as the usher didn\xe2\x80\x99t find the person, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him; and, after\r\na great commotion, all the people who had got up to look for the\r\nculprit, sat down again. The little judge turned to the witness as soon\r\nas his indignation would allow him to speak, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know who that was, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rayther suspect it was my father, my lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you see him here now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, staring right up into the lantern\r\nat the roof of the court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you could have pointed him out, I would have committed him\r\ninstantly,\xe2\x80\x99 said the judge. Sam bowed his acknowledgments and turned,\r\nwith unimpaired cheerfulness of countenance, towards Serjeant Buzfuz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe you are in the service of Mr. Pickwick, the defendant in this\r\ncase? Speak up, if you please, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean to speak up, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98I am in the service o\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ere gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99man, and a wery good service it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Little to do, and plenty to get, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, with\r\njocularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, quite enough to get, Sir, as the soldier said ven they ordered him\r\nthree hundred and fifty lashes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must not tell us what the soldier, or any other man, said, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninterposed the judge; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s not evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when you\r\nwere first engaged by the defendant; eh, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant\r\nBuzfuz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I do, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have the goodness to tell the jury what it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar new fit out o\xe2\x80\x99 clothes that mornin\xe2\x80\x99, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men of the\r\njury,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and that was a wery partickler and uncommon\r\ncircumstance vith me in those days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHereupon there was a general laugh; and the little judge, looking with\r\nan angry countenance over his desk, said, \xe2\x80\x98You had better be careful,\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So Mr. Pickwick said at the time, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98and I was\r\nwery careful o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere suit o\xe2\x80\x99 clothes; wery careful indeed, my\r\nLord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe judge looked sternly at Sam for full two minutes, but Sam\xe2\x80\x99s features\r\nwere so perfectly calm and serene that the judge said nothing, and\r\nmotioned Serjeant Buzfuz to proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, folding his\r\narms emphatically, and turning half-round to the jury, as if in mute\r\nassurance that he would bother the witness yet--\xe2\x80\x98do you mean to tell me,\r\nMr. Weller, that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the\r\nplaintiff in the arms of the defendant, which you have heard described\r\nby the witnesses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98I was in the passage till they called me\r\nup, and then the old lady was not there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, attend, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, dipping a large pen\r\ninto the inkstand before him, for the purpose of frightening Sam with a\r\nshow of taking down his answer. \xe2\x80\x98You were in the passage, and yet saw\r\nnothing of what was going forward. Have you a pair of eyes, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I have a pair of eyes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and that\xe2\x80\x99s just it. If they\r\nwos a pair o\xe2\x80\x99 patent double million magnifyin\xe2\x80\x99 gas microscopes of hextra\r\npower, p\xe2\x80\x99raps I might be able to see through a flight o\xe2\x80\x99 stairs and a\r\ndeal door; but bein\xe2\x80\x99 only eyes, you see, my wision \xe2\x80\x98s limited.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this answer, which was delivered without the slightest appearance of\r\nirritation, and with the most complete simplicity and equanimity of\r\nmanner, the spectators tittered, the little judge smiled, and Serjeant\r\nBuzfuz looked particularly foolish. After a short consultation with\r\nDodson & Fogg, the learned Serjeant again turned towards Sam, and said,\r\nwith a painful effort to conceal his vexation, \xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Weller, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nask you a question on another point, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam, with the utmost good-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember going up to Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s house, one night in November\r\nlast?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh, yes, wery well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you do remember that, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, recovering\r\nhis spirits; \xe2\x80\x98I thought we should get at something at last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rayther thought that, too, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; and at this the\r\nspectators tittered again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; I suppose you went up to have a little talk about this trial--eh,\r\nMr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking knowingly at the jury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went up to pay the rent; but we did get a-talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about the trial,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you did get a-talking about the trial,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz,\r\nbrightening up with the anticipation of some important discovery. \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nwhat passed about the trial; will you have the goodness to tell us, Mr.\r\nWeller\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vith all the pleasure in life, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Arter a few\r\nunimportant obserwations from the two wirtuous females as has been\r\nexamined here to-day, the ladies gets into a very great state o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadmiration at the honourable conduct of Mr. Dodson and Fogg--them two\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men as is settin\xe2\x80\x99 near you now.\xe2\x80\x99 This, of course, drew general\r\nattention to Dodson & Fogg, who looked as virtuous as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The attorneys for the plaintiff,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz. \xe2\x80\x98Well! They\r\nspoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of Messrs. Dodson and\r\nFogg, the attorneys for the plaintiff, did they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98they said what a wery gen\xe2\x80\x99rous thing it was o\xe2\x80\x99 them to\r\nhave taken up the case on spec, and to charge nothing at all for costs,\r\nunless they got \xe2\x80\x98em out of Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this very unexpected reply, the spectators tittered again, and Dodson\r\n& Fogg, turning very red, leaned over to Serjeant Buzfuz, and in a\r\nhurried manner whispered something in his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz aloud, with affected\r\ncomposure. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly useless, my Lord, attempting to get at any\r\nevidence through the impenetrable stupidity of this witness. I will not\r\ntrouble the court by asking him any more questions. Stand down, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would any other gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99man like to ask me anythin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam,\r\ntaking up his hat, and looking round most deliberately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not I, Mr. Weller, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Snubbin, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may go down, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, waving his hand\r\nimpatiently. Sam went down accordingly, after doing Messrs. Dodson &\r\nFogg\xe2\x80\x99s case as much harm as he conveniently could, and saying just as\r\nlittle respecting Mr. Pickwick as might be, which was precisely the\r\nobject he had had in view all along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no objection to admit, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Snubbin, \xe2\x80\x98if it\r\nwill save the examination of another witness, that Mr. Pickwick has\r\nretired from business, and is a gentleman of considerable independent\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Serjeant Buzfuz, putting in the two letters to be\r\nread, \xe2\x80\x98then that\xe2\x80\x99s my case, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSerjeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant; and\r\na very long and a very emphatic address he delivered, in which he\r\nbestowed the highest possible eulogiums on the conduct and character of\r\nMr. Pickwick; but inasmuch as our readers are far better able to form a\r\ncorrect estimate of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s merits and deserts, than Serjeant\r\nSnubbin could possibly be, we do not feel called upon to enter at any\r\nlength into the learned gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s observations. He attempted to show\r\nthat the letters which had been exhibited, merely related to Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, or to the preparations for receiving him in his\r\napartments on his return from some country excursion. It is sufficient\r\nto add in general terms, that he did the best he could for Mr. Pickwick;\r\nand the best, as everybody knows, on the infallible authority of the old\r\nadage, could do no more.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Stareleigh summed up, in the old-established and most\r\napproved form. He read as much of his notes to the jury as he could\r\ndecipher on so short a notice, and made running-comments on the evidence\r\nas he went along. If Mrs. Bardell were right, it was perfectly clear\r\nthat Mr. Pickwick was wrong, and if they thought the evidence of Mrs.\r\nCluppins worthy of credence they would believe it, and, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nwhy, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. If they were satisfied that a breach of promise of\r\nmarriage had been committed they would find for the plaintiff with such\r\ndamages as they thought proper; and if, on the other hand, it appeared\r\nto them that no promise of marriage had ever been given, they would find\r\nfor the defendant with no damages at all. The jury then retired to their\r\nprivate room to talk the matter over, and the judge retired to _his\r\n_private room, to refresh himself with a mutton chop and a glass of\r\nsherry.\r\n\r\nAn anxious quarter of a hour elapsed; the jury came back; the judge was\r\nfetched in. Mr. Pickwick put on his spectacles, and gazed at the foreman\r\nwith an agitated countenance and a quickly-beating heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the individual in black, \xe2\x80\x98are you all agreed upon your\r\nverdict?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the foreman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you find for the plaintiff, gentlemen, or for the defendant?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor the plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With what damages, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seven hundred and fifty pounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick took off his spectacles, carefully wiped the glasses,\r\nfolded them into their case, and put them in his pocket; then, having\r\ndrawn on his gloves with great nicety, and stared at the foreman all the\r\nwhile, he mechanically followed Mr. Perker and the blue bag out of\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nThey stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court fees; and here,\r\nMr. Pickwick was joined by his friends. Here, too, he encountered\r\nMessrs. Dodson & Fogg, rubbing their hands with every token of outward\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, for self and partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You imagine you\xe2\x80\x99ll get your costs, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\nFogg said they thought it rather probable. Dodson smiled, and said\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d try.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may try, and try, and try again, Messrs. Dodson and Fogg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick vehemently, \xe2\x80\x98but not one farthing of costs or damages do you\r\never get from me, if I spend the rest of my existence in a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprison.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Dodson. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll think better of that, before next\r\nterm, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He, he, he! We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see about that, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 grinned Fogg.\r\n\r\nSpeechless with indignation, Mr. Pickwick allowed himself to be led by\r\nhis solicitor and friends to the door, and there assisted into a\r\nhackney-coach, which had been fetched for the purpose, by the ever-\r\nwatchful Sam Weller.\r\n\r\nSam had put up the steps, and was preparing to jump upon the box, when\r\nhe felt himself gently touched on the shoulder; and, looking round, his\r\nfather stood before him. The old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s countenance wore a mournful\r\nexpression, as he shook his head gravely, and said, in warning accents--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know\xe2\x80\x99d what \xe2\x80\x98ud come o\xe2\x80\x99 this here mode o\xe2\x80\x99 doin\xe2\x80\x99 bisness. Oh, Sammy,\r\nSammy, vy worn\xe2\x80\x99t there a alleybi!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. IN WHICH MR. PICKWICK THINKS HE HAD BETTER GO TO BATH; AND\r\nGOES ACCORDINGLY\r\n\r\nBut surely, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Perker, as he stood in Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s apartment on the morning after the trial, \xe2\x80\x98surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally mean--really and seriously now, and irritation apart--that you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t pay these costs and damages?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not one halfpenny,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick firmly; \xe2\x80\x98not one halfpenny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hooroar for the principle, as the money-lender said ven he vouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrenew the bill,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Weller, who was clearing away the\r\nbreakfast-things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98have the goodness to step downstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; and acting on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s gentle\r\nhint, Sam retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Perker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with great seriousness of manner, \xe2\x80\x98my\r\nfriends here have endeavoured to dissuade me from this determination,\r\nbut without avail. I shall employ myself as usual, until the opposite\r\nparty have the power of issuing a legal process of execution against me;\r\nand if they are vile enough to avail themselves of it, and to arrest my\r\nperson, I shall yield myself up with perfect cheerfulness and content of\r\nheart. When can they do this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They can issue execution, my dear Sir, for the amount of the damages\r\nand taxed costs, next term,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, \xe2\x80\x98just two months hence, my\r\ndear sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Until that time, my dear fellow, let me\r\nhear no more of the matter. And now,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, looking\r\nround on his friends with a good-humoured smile, and a sparkle in the\r\neye which no spectacles could dim or conceal, \xe2\x80\x98the only question is,\r\nWhere shall we go next?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were too much affected by their friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheroism to offer any reply. Mr. Winkle had not yet sufficiently\r\nrecovered the recollection of his evidence at the trial, to make any\r\nobservation on any subject, so Mr. Pickwick paused in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98if you leave me to suggest our\r\ndestination, I say Bath. I think none of us have ever been there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNobody had; and as the proposition was warmly seconded by Perker, who\r\nconsidered it extremely probable that if Mr. Pickwick saw a little\r\nchange and gaiety he would be inclined to think better of his\r\ndetermination, and worse of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s prison, it was carried\r\nunanimously; and Sam was at once despatched to the White Horse Cellar,\r\nto take five places by the half-past seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock coach, next morning.\r\n\r\nThere were just two places to be had inside, and just three to be had\r\nout; so Sam Weller booked for them all, and having exchanged a few\r\ncompliments with the booking-office clerk on the subject of a pewter\r\nhalf-crown which was tendered him as a portion of his \xe2\x80\x98change,\xe2\x80\x99 walked\r\nback to the George and Vulture, where he was pretty busily employed\r\nuntil bed-time in reducing clothes and linen into the smallest possible\r\ncompass, and exerting his mechanical genius in constructing a variety of\r\ningenious devices for keeping the lids on boxes which had neither locks\r\nnor hinges.\r\n\r\nThe next was a very unpropitious morning for a journey--muggy, damp, and\r\ndrizzly. The horses in the stages that were going out, and had come\r\nthrough the city, were smoking so, that the outside passengers were\r\ninvisible. The newspaper-sellers looked moist, and smelled mouldy; the\r\nwet ran off the hats of the orange-vendors as they thrust their heads\r\ninto the coach windows, and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner.\r\nThe Jews with the fifty-bladed penknives shut them up in despair; the\r\nmen with the pocket-books made pocket-books of them. Watch-guards and\r\ntoasting-forks were alike at a discount, and pencil-cases and sponges\r\nwere a drug in the market.\r\n\r\nLeaving Sam Weller to rescue the luggage from the seven or eight porters\r\nwho flung themselves savagely upon it, the moment the coach stopped, and\r\nfinding that they were about twenty minutes too early, Mr. Pickwick and\r\nhis friends went for shelter into the travellers\xe2\x80\x99 room--the last\r\nresource of human dejection.\r\n\r\nThe travellers\xe2\x80\x99 room at the White Horse Cellar is of course\r\nuncomfortable; it would be no travellers\xe2\x80\x99 room if it were not. It is the\r\nright-hand parlour, into which an aspiring kitchen fireplace appears to\r\nhave walked, accompanied by a rebellious poker, tongs, and shovel. It is\r\ndivided into boxes, for the solitary confinement of travellers, and is\r\nfurnished with a clock, a looking-glass, and a live waiter, which latter\r\narticle is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses, in a corner of\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nOne of these boxes was occupied, on this particular occasion, by a\r\nstern-eyed man of about five-and-forty, who had a bald and glossy\r\nforehead, with a good deal of black hair at the sides and back of his\r\nhead, and large black whiskers. He was buttoned up to the chin in a\r\nbrown coat; and had a large sealskin travelling-cap, and a greatcoat and\r\ncloak, lying on the seat beside him. He looked up from his breakfast as\r\nMr. Pickwick entered, with a fierce and peremptory air, which was very\r\ndignified; and, having scrutinised that gentleman and his companions to\r\nhis entire satisfaction, hummed a tune, in a manner which seemed to say\r\nthat he rather suspected somebody wanted to take advantage of him, but\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Waiter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman with the whiskers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 replied a man with a dirty complexion, and a towel of the same,\r\nemerging from the kennel before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some more toast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Buttered toast, mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Directly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the whiskers hummed a tune in the same manner as\r\nbefore, and pending the arrival of the toast, advanced to the front of\r\nthe fire, and, taking his coat tails under his arms, looked at his boots\r\nand ruminated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder whereabouts in Bath this coach puts up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nmildly addressing Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hum--eh--what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 said the strange man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I made an observation to my friend, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, always\r\nready to enter into conversation. \xe2\x80\x98I wondered at what house the Bath\r\ncoach put up. Perhaps you can inform me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAre you going to Bath?\xe2\x80\x99 said the strange man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And those other gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are going also,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not inside--I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned if you\xe2\x80\x99re going inside,\xe2\x80\x99 said the strange\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not all of us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not all of you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the strange man emphatically. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken two\r\nplaces. If they try to squeeze six people into an infernal box that only\r\nholds four, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a post-chaise and bring an action. I\xe2\x80\x99ve paid my\r\nfare. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do; I told the clerk when I took my places that it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. I know these things have been done. I know they are done\r\nevery day; but I never was done, and I never will be. Those who know me\r\nbest, best know it; crush me!\xe2\x80\x99 Here the fierce gentleman rang the bell\r\nwith great violence, and told the waiter he\xe2\x80\x99d better bring the toast in\r\nfive seconds, or he\xe2\x80\x99d know the reason why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98you will allow me to observe that\r\nthis is a very unnecessary display of excitement. I have only taken\r\nplaces inside for two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fierce man. \xe2\x80\x98I withdraw my expressions.\r\nI tender an apology. There\xe2\x80\x99s my card. Give me your acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great pleasure, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98We are to be fellow-\r\ntravellers, and I hope we shall find each other\xe2\x80\x99s society mutually\r\nagreeable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope we shall,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fierce gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I know we shall. I like\r\nyour looks; they please me. Gentlemen, your hands and names. Know me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOf course, an interchange of friendly salutations followed this gracious\r\nspeech; and the fierce gentleman immediately proceeded to inform the\r\nfriends, in the same short, abrupt, jerking sentences, that his name was\r\nDowler; that he was going to Bath on pleasure; that he was formerly in\r\nthe army; that he had now set up in business as a gentleman; that he\r\nlived upon the profits; and that the individual for whom the second\r\nplace was taken, was a personage no less illustrious than Mrs. Dowler,\r\nhis lady wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a fine woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98I am proud of her. I have\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope I shall have the pleasure of judging,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98She shall know you. She shall esteem you.\r\nI courted her under singular circumstances. I won her through a rash\r\nvow. Thus. I saw her; I loved her; I proposed; she refused me.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nlove another?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cSpare my blushes.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI know him.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cYou do.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\ngood; if he remains here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll skin him.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord bless me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you skin the gentleman, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle, with a very pale\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wrote him a note, I said it was a painful thing. And so it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said I had pledged my word as a gentleman to skin him. My character\r\nwas at stake. I had no alternative. As an officer in His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice, I was bound to skin him. I regretted the necessity, but it must\r\nbe done. He was open to conviction. He saw that the rules of the service\r\nwere imperative. He fled. I married her. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the coach. That\xe2\x80\x99s her\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Dowler concluded, he pointed to a stage which had just driven up,\r\nfrom the open window of which a rather pretty face in a bright blue\r\nbonnet was looking among the crowd on the pavement, most probably for\r\nthe rash man himself. Mr. Dowler paid his bill, and hurried out with his\r\ntravelling cap, coat, and cloak; and Mr. Pickwick and his friends\r\nfollowed to secure their places.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass had seated themselves at the back part of\r\nthe coach; Mr. Winkle had got inside; and Mr. Pickwick was preparing to\r\nfollow him, when Sam Weller came up to his master, and whispering in his\r\near, begged to speak to him, with an air of the deepest mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s rayther a rum go, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m wery much afeerd, sir, that the\r\nproperiator o\xe2\x80\x99 this here coach is a playin\xe2\x80\x99 some imperence vith us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is that, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98aren\xe2\x80\x99t the names down on the\r\nway-bill?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The names is not only down on the vay-bill, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve painted vun on \xe2\x80\x98em up, on the door o\xe2\x80\x99 the coach.\xe2\x80\x99 As Sam spoke,\r\nhe pointed to that part of the coach door on which the proprietor\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nusually appears; and there, sure enough, in gilt letters of a goodly\r\nsize, was the magic name of _Pickwick_!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, quite staggered by the coincidence;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what a very extraordinary thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but that ain\xe2\x80\x99t all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, again directing his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention to the coach door; \xe2\x80\x98not content vith writin\xe2\x80\x99 up \xe2\x80\x9cPick-wick,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n they puts \xe2\x80\x9cMoses\xe2\x80\x9d afore it, vich I call addin\xe2\x80\x99 insult to injury, as the\r\nparrot said ven they not only took him from his native land, but made\r\nhim talk the English langwidge arterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s odd enough, certainly, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but if we stand\r\ntalking here, we shall lose our places.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot, ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to be done in consequence, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam,\r\nperfectly aghast at the coolness with which Mr. Pickwick prepared to\r\nensconce himself inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98What should be done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAin\xe2\x80\x99t nobody to be whopped for takin\xe2\x80\x99 this here liberty, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller, who had expected that at least he would have been commissioned\r\nto challenge the guard and the coachman to a pugilistic encounter on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick eagerly; \xe2\x80\x98not on any account. Jump\r\nup to your seat directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am wery much afeered,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Sam to himself, as he turned away,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that somethin\xe2\x80\x99 queer\xe2\x80\x99s come over the governor, or he\xe2\x80\x99d never ha\xe2\x80\x99 stood\r\nthis so quiet. I hope that \xe2\x80\x98ere trial hasn\xe2\x80\x99t broke his spirit, but it\r\nlooks bad, wery bad.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller shook his head gravely; and it is\r\nworthy of remark, as an illustration of the manner in which he took this\r\ncircumstance to heart, that he did not speak another word until the\r\ncoach reached the Kensington turnpike. Which was so long a time for him\r\nto remain taciturn, that the fact may be considered wholly\r\nunprecedented.\r\n\r\nNothing worthy of special mention occurred during the journey. Mr.\r\nDowler related a variety of anecdotes, all illustrative of his own\r\npersonal prowess and desperation, and appealed to Mrs. Dowler in\r\ncorroboration thereof; when Mrs. Dowler invariably brought in, in the\r\nform of an appendix, some remarkable fact or circumstance which Mr.\r\nDowler had forgotten, or had perhaps through modesty, omitted; for the\r\naddenda in every instance went to show that Mr. Dowler was even a more\r\nwonderful fellow than he made himself out to be. Mr. Pickwick and Mr.\r\nWinkle listened with great admiration, and at intervals conversed with\r\nMrs. Dowler, who was a very agreeable and fascinating person. So, what\r\nbetween Mr. Dowler\xe2\x80\x99s stories, and Mrs. Dowler\xe2\x80\x99s charms, and Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s good-humour, and Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s good listening, the insides\r\ncontrived to be very companionable all the way.\r\n\r\nThe outsides did as outsides always do. They were very cheerful and\r\ntalkative at the beginning of every stage, and very dismal and sleepy in\r\nthe middle, and very bright and wakeful again towards the end. There was\r\none young gentleman in an India-rubber cloak, who smoked cigars all day;\r\nand there was another young gentleman in a parody upon a greatcoat, who\r\nlighted a good many, and feeling obviously unsettled after the second\r\nwhiff, threw them away when he thought nobody was looking at him. There\r\nwas a third young man on the box who wished to be learned in cattle; and\r\nan old one behind, who was familiar with farming. There was a constant\r\nsuccession of Christian names in smock-frocks and white coats, who were\r\ninvited to have a \xe2\x80\x98lift\xe2\x80\x99 by the guard, and who knew every horse and\r\nhostler on the road and off it; and there was a dinner which would have\r\nbeen cheap at half-a-crown a mouth, if any moderate number of mouths\r\ncould have eaten it in the time. And at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M. Mr. Pickwick\r\nand his friends, and Mr. Dowler and his wife, respectively retired to\r\ntheir private sitting-rooms at the White Hart Hotel, opposite the Great\r\nPump Room, Bath, where the waiters, from their costume, might be\r\nmistaken for Westminster boys, only they destroy the illusion by\r\nbehaving themselves much better.\r\n\r\nBreakfast had scarcely been cleared away on the succeeding morning, when\r\na waiter brought in Mr. Dowler\xe2\x80\x99s card, with a request to be allowed\r\npermission to introduce a friend. Mr. Dowler at once followed up the\r\ndelivery of the card, by bringing himself and the friend also.\r\n\r\nThe friend was a charming young man of not much more than fifty, dressed\r\nin a very bright blue coat with resplendent buttons, black trousers, and\r\nthe thinnest possible pair of highly-polished boots. A gold eye-glass\r\nwas suspended from his neck by a short, broad, black ribbon; a gold\r\nsnuff-box was lightly clasped in his left hand; gold rings innumerable\r\nglittered on his fingers; and a large diamond pin set in gold glistened\r\nin his shirt frill. He had a gold watch, and a gold curb chain with\r\nlarge gold seals; and he carried a pliant ebony cane with a gold top.\r\nHis linen was of the very whitest, finest, and stiffest; his wig of the\r\nglossiest, blackest, and curliest. His snuff was princes\xe2\x80\x99 mixture; his\r\nscent _bouquet du roi_. His features were contracted into a perpetual\r\nsmile; and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at\r\na small distance to tell the real from the false.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dowler; \xe2\x80\x98my friend, Angelo Cyrus Bantam,\r\nEsquire, M.C.; Bantam; Mr. Pickwick. Know each other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Welcome to Ba--ath, Sir. This is indeed an acquisition. Most welcome to\r\nBa--ath, sir. It is long--very long, Mr. Pickwick, since you drank the\r\nwaters. It appears an age, Mr. Pickwick. Re-markable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSuch were the expressions with which Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, M.C.,\r\ntook Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hand; retaining it in his, meantime, and shrugging\r\nup his shoulders with a constant succession of bows, as if he really\r\ncould not make up his mind to the trial of letting it go again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a very long time since I drank the waters, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nMr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98for, to the best of my knowledge, I was never here\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never in Ba--ath, Mr. Pickwick!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the Grand Master, letting\r\nthe hand fall in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x98Never in Ba--ath! He! he! Mr. Pickwick,\r\nyou are a wag. Not bad, not bad. Good, good. He! he! he! Re-markable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To my shame, I must say that I am perfectly serious,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr.\r\nPickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I really never was here before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the Grand Master, looking extremely pleased;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98yes, yes--good, good--better and better. You are the gentleman of whom\r\nwe have heard. Yes; we know you, Mr. Pickwick; we know you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The reports of the trial in those confounded papers,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr.\r\nPickwick. \xe2\x80\x98They have heard all about me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYou are the gentleman residing on Clapham Green,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Bantam, \xe2\x80\x98who\r\nlost the use of his limbs from imprudently taking cold after port wine;\r\nwho could not be moved in consequence of acute suffering, and who had\r\nthe water from the king\xe2\x80\x99s bath bottled at one hundred and three degrees,\r\nand sent by wagon to his bedroom in town, where he bathed, sneezed, and\r\nthe same day recovered. Very remarkable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment which the supposition implied,\r\nbut had the self-denial to repudiate it, notwithstanding; and taking\r\nadvantage of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence on the part of the M.C., begged to\r\nintroduce his friends, Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. An\r\nintroduction which overwhelmed the M.C. with delight and honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bantam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dowler, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick and his friends are strangers.\r\nThey must put their names down. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the book?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The register of the distinguished visitors in Ba--ath will be at the\r\nPump Room this morning at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the M.C. \xe2\x80\x98Will you guide\r\nour friends to that splendid building, and enable me to procure their\r\nautographs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98This is a long call. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to go. I\r\nshall be here again in an hour. Come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a ball-night,\xe2\x80\x99 said the M.C., again taking Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nas he rose to go. \xe2\x80\x98The ball-nights in Ba--ath are moments snatched from\r\nparadise; rendered bewitching by music, beauty, elegance, fashion,\r\netiquette, and--and--above all, by the absence of tradespeople, who are\r\nquite inconsistent with paradise, and who have an amalgamation of\r\nthemselves at the Guildhall every fortnight, which is, to say the least,\r\nremarkable. Good-bye, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 and protesting all the way downstairs\r\nthat he was most satisfied, and most delighted, and most overpowered,\r\nand most flattered, Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, M.C., stepped into a\r\nvery elegant chariot that waited at the door, and rattled off.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour, Mr. Pickwick and his friends, escorted by Dowler,\r\nrepaired to the Assembly Rooms, and wrote their names down in the book--\r\nan instance of condescension at which Angelo Bantam was even more\r\noverpowered than before. Tickets of admission to that evening\xe2\x80\x99s assembly\r\nwere to have been prepared for the whole party, but as they were not\r\nready, Mr. Pickwick undertook, despite all the protestations to the\r\ncontrary of Angelo Bantam, to send Sam for them at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon, to the M.C.\xe2\x80\x99s house in Queen Square. Having taken a short\r\nwalk through the city, and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that Park\r\nStreet was very much like the perpendicular streets a man sees in a\r\ndream, which he cannot get up for the life of him, they returned to the\r\nWhite Hart, and despatched Sam on the errand to which his master had\r\npledged him.\r\n\r\nSam Weller put on his hat in a very easy and graceful manner, and,\r\nthrusting his hands in his waistcoat pockets, walked with great\r\ndeliberation to Queen Square, whistling as he went along, several of the\r\nmost popular airs of the day, as arranged with entirely new movements\r\nfor that noble instrument the organ, either mouth or barrel. Arriving at\r\nthe number in Queen Square to which he had been directed, he left off\r\nwhistling and gave a cheerful knock, which was instantaneously answered\r\nby a powdered-headed footman in gorgeous livery, and of symmetrical\r\nstature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this here Mr. Bantam\xe2\x80\x99s, old feller?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam Weller, nothing\r\nabashed by the blaze of splendour which burst upon his sight in the\r\nperson of the powdered-headed footman with the gorgeous livery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, young man?\xe2\x80\x99 was the haughty inquiry of the powdered-headed\r\nfootman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos if it is, jist you step in to him with that \xe2\x80\x98ere card, and say Mr.\r\nVeller\xe2\x80\x99s a-waitin\xe2\x80\x99, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. And saying it, he very coolly\r\nwalked into the hall, and sat down.\r\n\r\nThe powdered-headed footman slammed the door very hard, and scowled very\r\ngrandly; but both the slam and the scowl were lost upon Sam, who was\r\nregarding a mahogany umbrella-stand with every outward token of critical\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nApparently his master\xe2\x80\x99s reception of the card had impressed the\r\npowdered-headed footman in Sam\xe2\x80\x99s favour, for when he came back from\r\ndelivering it, he smiled in a friendly manner, and said that the answer\r\nwould be ready directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Tell the old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n not to put himself in a\r\nperspiration. No hurry, six-foot. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You dine early, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the powdered-headed footman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I find I gets on better at supper when I does,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you been long in Bath, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the powdered-headed footman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not had the pleasure of hearing of you before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t created any wery surprisin\xe2\x80\x99 sensation here, as yet,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined\r\nSam, \xe2\x80\x98for me and the other fash\xe2\x80\x99nables only come last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nice place, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the powdered-headed footman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seems so,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pleasant society, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the powdered-headed footman. \xe2\x80\x98Very\r\nagreeable servants, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think they wos,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Affable, unaffected, say-\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99-to-nobody sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 fellers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, very much so, indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the powdered-headed footman,\r\ntaking Sam\xe2\x80\x99s remarks as a high compliment. \xe2\x80\x98Very much so indeed. Do you\r\ndo anything in this way, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the tall footman, producing a\r\nsmall snuff-box with a fox\xe2\x80\x99s head on the top of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not without sneezing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, it _is_ difficult, sir, I confess,\xe2\x80\x99 said the tall footman. \xe2\x80\x98It may\r\nbe done by degrees, Sir. Coffee is the best practice. I carried coffee,\r\nSir, for a long time. It looks very like rappee, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, a sharp peal at the bell reduced the powdered-headed footman to\r\nthe ignominious necessity of putting the fox\xe2\x80\x99s head in his pocket, and\r\nhastening with a humble countenance to Mr. Bantam\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98study.\xe2\x80\x99 By the bye,\r\nwho ever knew a man who never read or wrote either, who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got some\r\nsmall back parlour which he _would _call a study!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is the answer, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the powdered-headed footman. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it inconveniently large.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, taking a letter with a small enclosure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s just possible as exhausted natur\xe2\x80\x99 may manage to surwive it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope we shall meet again, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the powdered-headed footman,\r\nrubbing his hands, and following Sam out to the door-step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are wery obligin\xe2\x80\x99, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t allow yourself to\r\nbe fatigued beyond your powers; there\xe2\x80\x99s a amiable bein\xe2\x80\x99. Consider what\r\nyou owe to society, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let yourself be injured by too much work.\r\nFor the sake o\xe2\x80\x99 your feller-creeturs, keep yourself as quiet as you can;\r\nonly think what a loss you would be!\xe2\x80\x99 With these pathetic words, Sam\r\nWeller departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very singular young man that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the powdered-headed footman,\r\nlooking after Mr. Weller, with a countenance which clearly showed he\r\ncould make nothing of him.\r\n\r\nSam said nothing at all. He winked, shook his head, smiled, winked\r\nagain; and, with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote\r\nthat he was greatly amused with something or other, walked merrily away.\r\n\r\nAt precisely twenty minutes before eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night, Angelo\r\nCyrus Bantam, Esq., the Master of the Ceremonies, emerged from his\r\nchariot at the door of the Assembly Rooms in the same wig, the same\r\nteeth, the same eye-glass, the same watch and seals, the same rings, the\r\nsame shirt-pin, and the same cane. The only observable alterations in\r\nhis appearance were, that he wore a brighter blue coat, with a white\r\nsilk lining, black tights, black silk stockings, and pumps, and a white\r\nwaistcoat, and was, if possible, just a thought more scented.\r\n\r\nThus attired, the Master of the Ceremonies, in strict discharge of the\r\nimportant duties of his all-important office, planted himself in the\r\nroom to receive the company.\r\n\r\nBath being full, the company, and the sixpences for tea, poured in, in\r\nshoals. In the ballroom, the long card-room, the octagonal card-room,\r\nthe staircases, and the passages, the hum of many voices, and the sound\r\nof many feet, were perfectly bewildering. Dresses rustled, feathers\r\nwaved, lights shone, and jewels sparkled. There was the music--not of\r\nthe quadrille band, for it had not yet commenced; but the music of soft,\r\ntiny footsteps, with now and then a clear, merry laugh--low and gentle,\r\nbut very pleasant to hear in a female voice, whether in Bath or\r\nelsewhere. Brilliant eyes, lighted up with pleasurable expectation,\r\ngleamed from every side; and, look where you would, some exquisite form\r\nglided gracefully through the throng, and was no sooner lost, than it\r\nwas replaced by another as dainty and bewitching.\r\n\r\nIn the tea-room, and hovering round the card-tables, were a vast number\r\nof queer old ladies, and decrepit old gentlemen, discussing all the\r\nsmall talk and scandal of the day, with a relish and gusto which\r\nsufficiently bespoke the intensity of the pleasure they derived from the\r\noccupation. Mingled with these groups, were three or four match-making\r\nmammas, appearing to be wholly absorbed by the conversation in which\r\nthey were taking part, but failing not from time to time to cast an\r\nanxious sidelong glance upon their daughters, who, remembering the\r\nmaternal injunction to make the best use of their youth, had already\r\ncommenced incipient flirtations in the mislaying scarves, putting on\r\ngloves, setting down cups, and so forth; slight matters apparently, but\r\nwhich may be turned to surprisingly good account by expert\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\nLounging near the doors, and in remote corners, were various knots of\r\nsilly young men, displaying various varieties of puppyism and stupidity;\r\namusing all sensible people near them with their folly and conceit; and\r\nhappily thinking themselves the objects of general admiration--a wise\r\nand merciful dispensation which no good man will quarrel with.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, seated on some of the back benches, where they had already\r\ntaken up their positions for the evening, were divers unmarried ladies\r\npast their grand climacteric, who, not dancing because there were no\r\npartners for them, and not playing cards lest they should be set down as\r\nirretrievably single, were in the favourable situation of being able to\r\nabuse everybody without reflecting on themselves. In short, they could\r\nabuse everybody, because everybody was there. It was a scene of gaiety,\r\nglitter, and show; of richly-dressed people, handsome mirrors, chalked\r\nfloors, girandoles and wax-candles; and in all parts of the scene,\r\ngliding from spot to spot in silent softness, bowing obsequiously to\r\nthis party, nodding familiarly to that, and smiling complacently on all,\r\nwas the sprucely-attired person of Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, the\r\nMaster of the Ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop in the tea-room. Take your sixpenn\xe2\x80\x99orth. Then lay on hot water,\r\nand call it tea. Drink it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dowler, in a loud voice, directing\r\nMr. Pickwick, who advanced at the head of the little party, with Mrs.\r\nDowler on his arm. Into the tea-room Mr. Pickwick turned; and catching\r\nsight of him, Mr. Bantam corkscrewed his way through the crowd and\r\nwelcomed him with ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir, I am highly honoured. Ba--ath is favoured. Mrs. Dowler,\r\nyou embellish the rooms. I congratulate you on your feathers. Re-\r\nmarkable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anybody here?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Dowler suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anybody! The _elite _of Ba--ath. Mr. Pickwick, do you see the old lady\r\nin the gauze turban?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fat old lady?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush, my dear sir--nobody\xe2\x80\x99s fat or old in Ba--ath. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Dowager\r\nLady Snuphanuph.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No less a person, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Master of the Ceremonies.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush. Draw a little nearer, Mr. Pickwick. You see the splendidly-\r\ndressed young man coming this way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The one with the long hair, and the particularly small forehead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The same. The richest young man in Ba--ath at this moment. Young Lord\r\nMutanhed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear his voice in a moment, Mr. Pickwick. He\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to\r\nme. The other gentleman with him, in the red under-waistcoat and dark\r\nmoustache, is the Honourable Mr. Crushton, his bosom friend. How do you\r\ndo, my Lord?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Veway hot, Bantam,\xe2\x80\x99 said his Lordship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It _is_ very warm, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the M.C.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confounded,\xe2\x80\x99 assented the Honourable Mr. Crushton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you seen his Lordship\xe2\x80\x99s mail-cart, Bantam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the\r\nHonourable Mr. Crushton, after a short pause, during which young Lord\r\nMutanhed had been endeavouring to stare Mr. Pickwick out of countenance,\r\nand Mr. Crushton had been reflecting what subject his Lordship could\r\ntalk about best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the M.C. \xe2\x80\x98A mail-cart! What an excellent idea.\r\nRe-markable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gwacious heavens!\xe2\x80\x99 said his Lordship, \xe2\x80\x98I thought evewebody had seen the\r\nnew mail-cart; it\xe2\x80\x99s the neatest, pwettiest, gwacefullest thing that ever\r\nwan upon wheels. Painted wed, with a cweam piebald.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With a real box for the letters, and all complete,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Honourable\r\nMr. Crushton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a little seat in fwont, with an iwon wail, for the dwiver,\xe2\x80\x99 added\r\nhis Lordship. \xe2\x80\x98I dwove it over to Bwistol the other morning, in a\r\ncwimson coat, with two servants widing a quarter of a mile behind; and\r\nconfound me if the people didn\xe2\x80\x99t wush out of their cottages, and awest\r\nmy pwogwess, to know if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the post. Glorwious--glorwious!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this anecdote his Lordship laughed very heartily, as did the\r\nlisteners, of course. Then, drawing his arm through that of the\r\nobsequious Mr. Crushton, Lord Mutanhed walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Delightful young man, his Lordship,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Master of the Ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I should think,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick drily.\r\n\r\nThe dancing having commenced, the necessary introductions having been\r\nmade, and all preliminaries arranged, Angelo Bantam rejoined Mr.\r\nPickwick, and led him into the card-room.\r\n\r\nJust at the very moment of their entrance, the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph\r\nand two other ladies of an ancient and whist-like appearance, were\r\nhovering over an unoccupied card-table; and they no sooner set eyes upon\r\nMr. Pickwick under the convoy of Angelo Bantam, than they exchanged\r\nglances with each other, seeing that he was precisely the very person\r\nthey wanted, to make up the rubber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Bantam,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph coaxingly, \xe2\x80\x98find us\r\nsome nice creature to make up this table; there\xe2\x80\x99s a good soul.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr.\r\nPickwick happened to be looking another way at the moment, so her\r\nLadyship nodded her head towards him, and frowned expressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend Mr. Pickwick, my Lady, will be most happy, I am sure,\r\nremarkably so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the M.C., taking the hint. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, Lady\r\nSnuphanuph--Mrs. Colonel Wugsby--Miss Bolo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick bowed to each of the ladies, and, finding escape\r\nimpossible, cut. Mr. Pickwick and Miss Bolo against Lady Snuphanuph and\r\nMrs. Colonel Wugsby.\r\n\r\nAs the trump card was turned up, at the commencement of the second deal,\r\ntwo young ladies hurried into the room, and took their stations on\r\neither side of Mrs. Colonel Wugsby\xe2\x80\x99s chair, where they waited patiently\r\nuntil the hand was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Jane,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, turning to one of the girls,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI came to ask, ma, whether I might dance with the youngest Mr. Crawley,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhispered the prettier and younger of the two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good God, Jane, how can you think of such things?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the mamma\r\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you repeatedly heard that his father has eight\r\nhundred a year, which dies with him? I am ashamed of you. Not on any\r\naccount.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the other, who was much older than her sister, and very\r\ninsipid and artificial, \xe2\x80\x98Lord Mutanhed has been introduced to me. I said\r\nI thought I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t engaged, ma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a sweet pet, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, tapping her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s cheek with her fan, \xe2\x80\x98and are always to be trusted. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimmensely rich, my dear. Bless you!\xe2\x80\x99 With these words Mrs. Colonel\r\nWugsby kissed her eldest daughter most affectionately, and frowning in a\r\nwarning manner upon the other, sorted her cards.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Pickwick! he had never played with three thorough-paced female\r\ncard-players before. They were so desperately sharp, that they quite\r\nfrightened him. If he played a wrong card, Miss Bolo looked a small\r\narmoury of daggers; if he stopped to consider which was the right one,\r\nLady Snuphanuph would throw herself back in her chair, and smile with a\r\nmingled glance of impatience and pity to Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, at which\r\nMrs. Colonel Wugsby would shrug up her shoulders, and cough, as much as\r\nto say she wondered whether he ever would begin. Then, at the end of\r\nevery hand, Miss Bolo would inquire with a dismal countenance and\r\nreproachful sigh, why Mr. Pickwick had not returned that diamond, or led\r\nthe club, or roughed the spade, or finessed the heart, or led through\r\nthe honour, or brought out the ace, or played up to the king, or some\r\nsuch thing; and in reply to all these grave charges, Mr. Pickwick would\r\nbe wholly unable to plead any justification whatever, having by this\r\ntime forgotten all about the game. People came and looked on, too, which\r\nmade Mr. Pickwick nervous. Besides all this, there was a great deal of\r\ndistracting conversation near the table, between Angelo Bantam and the\r\ntwo Misses Matinter, who, being single and singular, paid great court to\r\nthe Master of the Ceremonies, in the hope of getting a stray partner now\r\nand then. All these things, combined with the noises and interruptions\r\nof constant comings in and goings out, made Mr. Pickwick play rather\r\nbadly; the cards were against him, also; and when they left off at ten\r\nminutes past eleven, Miss Bolo rose from the table considerably\r\nagitated, and went straight home, in a flood of tears and a sedan-chair.\r\n\r\nBeing joined by his friends, who one and all protested that they had\r\nscarcely ever spent a more pleasant evening, Mr. Pickwick accompanied\r\nthem to the White Hart, and having soothed his feelings with something\r\nhot, went to bed, and to sleep, almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. THE CHIEF FEATURES OF WHICH WILL BE FOUND TO BE AN\r\nAUTHENTIC VERSION OF THE LEGEND OF PRINCE BLADUD, AND A MOST\r\nEXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY THAT BEFELL MR. WINKLE\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick contemplated a stay of at least two months in Bath, he\r\ndeemed it advisable to take private lodgings for himself and friends for\r\nthat period; and as a favourable opportunity offered for their securing,\r\non moderate terms, the upper portion of a house in the Royal Crescent,\r\nwhich was larger than they required, Mr. and Mrs. Dowler offered to\r\nrelieve them of a bedroom and sitting-room. This proposition was at once\r\naccepted, and in three days\xe2\x80\x99 time they were all located in their new\r\nabode, when Mr. Pickwick began to drink the waters with the utmost\r\nassiduity. Mr. Pickwick took them systematically. He drank a quarter of\r\na pint before breakfast, and then walked up a hill; and another quarter\r\nof a pint after breakfast, and then walked down a hill; and, after every\r\nfresh quarter of a pint, Mr. Pickwick declared, in the most solemn and\r\nemphatic terms, that he felt a great deal better; whereat his friends\r\nwere very much delighted, though they had not been previously aware that\r\nthere was anything the matter with him.\r\n\r\nThe Great Pump Room is a spacious saloon, ornamented with Corinthian\r\npillars, and a music-gallery, and a Tompion clock, and a statue of Nash,\r\nand a golden inscription, to which all the water-drinkers should attend,\r\nfor it appeals to them in the cause of a deserving charity. There is a\r\nlarge bar with a marble vase, out of which the pumper gets the water;\r\nand there are a number of yellow-looking tumblers, out of which the\r\ncompany get it; and it is a most edifying and satisfactory sight to\r\nbehold the perseverance and gravity with which they swallow it. There\r\nare baths near at hand, in which a part of the company wash themselves;\r\nand a band plays afterwards, to congratulate the remainder on their\r\nhaving done so. There is another pump room, into which infirm ladies and\r\ngentlemen are wheeled, in such an astonishing variety of chairs and\r\nchaises, that any adventurous individual who goes in with the regular\r\nnumber of toes, is in imminent danger of coming out without them; and\r\nthere is a third, into which the quiet people go, for it is less noisy\r\nthan either. There is an immensity of promenading, on crutches and off,\r\nwith sticks and without, and a great deal of conversation, and\r\nliveliness, and pleasantry.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, the regular water-drinkers, Mr. Pickwick among the\r\nnumber, met each other in the pump room, took their quarter of a pint,\r\nand walked constitutionally. At the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s promenade, Lord\r\nMutanhed, and the Honourable Mr. Crushton, the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph,\r\nMrs. Colonel Wugsby, and all the great people, and all the morning\r\nwater-drinkers, met in grand assemblage. After this, they walked out, or\r\ndrove out, or were pushed out in bath-chairs, and met one another again.\r\nAfter this, the gentlemen went to the reading-rooms, and met divisions\r\nof the mass. After this, they went home. If it were theatre-night,\r\nperhaps they met at the theatre; if it were assembly-night, they met at\r\nthe rooms; and if it were neither, they met the next day. A very\r\npleasant routine, with perhaps a slight tinge of sameness.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was sitting up by himself, after a day spent in this\r\nmanner, making entries in his journal, his friends having retired to\r\nbed, when he was roused by a gentle tap at the room door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Craddock, the landlady, peeping in;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but did you want anything more, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing more, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My young girl is gone to bed, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Craddock; \xe2\x80\x98and Mr. Dowler\r\nis good enough to say that he\xe2\x80\x99ll sit up for Mrs. Dowler, as the party\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t expected to be over till late; so I was thinking that if you\r\nwanted nothing more, Mr. Pickwick, I would go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By all means, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wish you good-night, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Craddock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nMrs. Craddock closed the door, and Mr. Pickwick resumed his writing.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time the entries were concluded. Mr. Pickwick\r\ncarefully rubbed the last page on the blotting-paper, shut up the book,\r\nwiped his pen on the bottom of the inside of his coat tail, and opened\r\nthe drawer of the inkstand to put it carefully away. There were a couple\r\nof sheets of writing-paper, pretty closely written over, in the inkstand\r\ndrawer, and they were folded so, that the title, which was in a good\r\nround hand, was fully disclosed to him. Seeing from this, that it was no\r\nprivate document; and as it seemed to relate to Bath, and was very\r\nshort: Mr. Pick-wick unfolded it, lighted his bedroom candle that it\r\nmight burn up well by the time he finished; and drawing his chair nearer\r\nthe fire, read as follows--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE LEGEND OF PRINCE BLADUD\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Less than two hundred years ago, on one of the public baths in this\r\ncity, there appeared an inscription in honour of its mighty founder, the\r\nrenowned Prince Bladud. That inscription is now erased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For many hundred years before that time, there had been handed down,\r\nfrom age to age, an old legend, that the illustrious prince being\r\nafflicted with leprosy, on his return from reaping a rich harvest of\r\nknowledge in Athens, shunned the court of his royal father, and\r\nconsorted moodily with husbandman and pigs. Among the herd (so said the\r\nlegend) was a pig of grave and solemn countenance, with whom the prince\r\nhad a fellow-feeling--for he too was wise--a pig of thoughtful and\r\nreserved demeanour; an animal superior to his fellows, whose grunt was\r\nterrible, and whose bite was sharp. The young prince sighed deeply as he\r\nlooked upon the countenance of the majestic swine; he thought of his\r\nroyal father, and his eyes were bedewed with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This sagacious pig was fond of bathing in rich, moist mud. Not in\r\nsummer, as common pigs do now, to cool themselves, and did even in those\r\ndistant ages (which is a proof that the light of civilisation had\r\nalready begun to dawn, though feebly), but in the cold, sharp days of\r\nwinter. His coat was ever so sleek, and his complexion so clear, that\r\nthe prince resolved to essay the purifying qualities of the same water\r\nthat his friend resorted to. He made the trial. Beneath that black mud,\r\nbubbled the hot springs of Bath. He washed, and was cured. Hastening to\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s court, he paid his best respects, and returning quickly\r\nhither, founded this city and its famous baths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship--but,\r\nalas! the waters had been his death. He had imprudently taken a bath at\r\ntoo high a temperature, and the natural philosopher was no more! He was\r\nsucceeded by Pliny, who also fell a victim to his thirst for knowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This was the legend. Listen to the true one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A great many centuries since, there flourished, in great state, the\r\nfamous and renowned Lud Hudibras, king of Britain. He was a mighty\r\nmonarch. The earth shook when he walked--he was so very stout. His\r\npeople basked in the light of his countenance--it was so red and\r\nglowing. He was, indeed, every inch a king. And there were a good many\r\ninches of him, too, for although he was not very tall, he was a\r\nremarkable size round, and the inches that he wanted in height, he made\r\nup in circumference. If any degenerate monarch of modern times could be\r\nin any way compared with him, I should say the venerable King Cole would\r\nbe that illustrious potentate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This good king had a queen, who eighteen years before, had had a son,\r\nwho was called Bladud. He was sent to a preparatory seminary in his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s dominions until he was ten years old, and was then despatched,\r\nin charge of a trusty messenger, to a finishing school at Athens; and as\r\nthere was no extra charge for remaining during the holidays, and no\r\nnotice required previous to the removal of a pupil, there he remained\r\nfor eight long years, at the expiration of which time, the king his\r\nfather sent the lord chamberlain over, to settle the bill, and to bring\r\nhim home; which, the lord chamberlain doing, was received with shouts,\r\nand pensioned immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When King Lud saw the prince his son, and found he had grown up such a\r\nfine young man, he perceived what a grand thing it would be to have him\r\nmarried without delay, so that his children might be the means of\r\nperpetuating the glorious race of Lud, down to the very latest ages of\r\nthe world. With this view, he sent a special embassy, composed of great\r\nnoblemen who had nothing particular to do, and wanted lucrative\r\nemployment, to a neighbouring king, and demanded his fair daughter in\r\nmarriage for his son; stating at the same time that he was anxious to be\r\non the most affectionate terms with his brother and friend, but that if\r\nthey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree in arranging this marriage, he should be under the\r\nunpleasant necessity of invading his kingdom and putting his eyes out.\r\nTo this, the other king (who was the weaker of the two) replied that he\r\nwas very much obliged to his friend and brother for all his goodness and\r\nmagnanimity, and that his daughter was quite ready to be married,\r\nwhenever Prince Bladud liked to come and fetch her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This answer no sooner reached Britain, than the whole nation was\r\ntransported with joy. Nothing was heard, on all sides, but the sounds of\r\nfeasting and revelry--except the chinking of money as it was paid in by\r\nthe people to the collector of the royal treasures, to defray the\r\nexpenses of the happy ceremony. It was upon this occasion that King Lud,\r\nseated on the top of his throne in full council, rose, in the exuberance\r\nof his feelings, and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the\r\nrichest wines and the court minstrels--an act of graciousness which has\r\nbeen, through the ignorance of traditionary historians, attributed to\r\nKing Cole, in those celebrated lines in which his Majesty is represented\r\nas\r\n\r\n\r\nCalling for his pipe, and calling for his pot, And calling for his\r\nfiddlers three.\r\n\r\nWhich is an obvious injustice to the memory of King Lud, and a dishonest\r\nexaltation of the virtues of King Cole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, in the midst of all this festivity and rejoicing, there was one\r\nindividual present, who tasted not when the sparkling wines were poured\r\nforth, and who danced not, when the minstrels played. This was no other\r\nthan Prince Bladud himself, in honour of whose happiness a whole people\r\nwere, at that very moment, straining alike their throats and purse-\r\nstrings. The truth was, that the prince, forgetting the undoubted right\r\nof the minister for foreign affairs to fall in love on his behalf, had,\r\ncontrary to every precedent of policy and diplomacy, already fallen in\r\nlove on his own account, and privately contracted himself unto the fair\r\ndaughter of a noble Athenian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here we have a striking example of one of the manifold advantages of\r\ncivilisation and refinement. If the prince had lived in later days, he\r\nmight at once have married the object of his father\xe2\x80\x99s choice, and then\r\nset himself seriously to work, to relieve himself of the burden which\r\nrested heavily upon him. He might have endeavoured to break her heart by\r\na systematic course of insult and neglect; or, if the spirit of her sex,\r\nand a proud consciousness of her many wrongs had upheld her under this\r\nill-treatment, he might have sought to take her life, and so get rid of\r\nher effectually. But neither mode of relief suggested itself to Prince\r\nBladud; so he solicited a private audience, and told his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their\r\npassions. King Lud flew into a frightful rage, tossed his crown up to\r\nthe ceiling, and caught it again--for in those days kings kept their\r\ncrowns on their heads, and not in the Tower--stamped the ground, rapped\r\nhis forehead, wondered why his own flesh and blood rebelled against him,\r\nand, finally, calling in his guards, ordered the prince away to instant\r\nConfinement in a lofty turret; a course of treatment which the kings of\r\nold very generally pursued towards their sons, when their matrimonial\r\ninclinations did not happen to point to the same quarter as their own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Prince Bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for the greater\r\npart of a year, with no better prospect before his bodily eyes than a\r\nstone wall, or before his mental vision than prolonged imprisonment, he\r\nnaturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape, which, after months of\r\npreparation, he managed to accomplish; considerately leaving his dinner-\r\nknife in the heart of his jailer, lest the poor fellow (who had a\r\nfamily) should be considered privy to his flight, and punished\r\naccordingly by the infuriated king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The monarch was frantic at the loss of his son. He knew not on whom to\r\nvent his grief and wrath, until fortunately bethinking himself of the\r\nlord chamberlain who had brought him home, he struck off his pension and\r\nhis head together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meanwhile, the young prince, effectually disguised, wandered on foot\r\nthrough his father\xe2\x80\x99s dominions, cheered and supported in all his\r\nhardships by sweet thoughts of the Athenian maid, who was the innocent\r\ncause of his weary trials. One day he stopped to rest in a country\r\nvillage; and seeing that there were gay dances going forward on the\r\ngreen, and gay faces passing to and fro, ventured to inquire of a\r\nreveller who stood near him, the reason for this rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cKnow you not, O stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply, \xe2\x80\x9cof the recent proclamation\r\nof our gracious king?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cProclamation! No. What proclamation?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the prince--for he had\r\ntravelled along the by and little-frequented ways, and knew nothing of\r\nwhat had passed upon the public roads, such as they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the peasant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe foreign lady that our prince wished to\r\nwed, is married to a foreign noble of her own country, and the king\r\nproclaims the fact, and a great public festival besides; for now, of\r\ncourse, Prince Bladud will come back and marry the lady his father\r\nchose, who they say is as beautiful as the noonday sun. Your health,\r\nsir. God save the king!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The prince remained to hear no more. He fled from the spot, and plunged\r\ninto the thickest recesses of a neighbouring wood. On, on, he wandered,\r\nnight and day; beneath the blazing sun, and the cold pale moon; through\r\nthe dry heat of noon, and the damp cold of night; in the gray light of\r\nmorn, and the red glare of eve. So heedless was he of time or object,\r\nthat being bound for Athens, he wandered as far out of his way as Bath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was no city where Bath stands, then. There was no vestige of\r\nhuman habitation, or sign of man\xe2\x80\x99s resort, to bear the name; but there\r\nwas the same noble country, the same broad expanse of hill and dale, the\r\nsame beautiful channel stealing on, far away, the same lofty mountains\r\nwhich, like the troubles of life, viewed at a distance, and partially\r\nobscured by the bright mist of its morning, lose their ruggedness and\r\nasperity, and seem all ease and softness. Moved by the gentle beauty of\r\nthe scene, the prince sank upon the green turf, and bathed his swollen\r\nfeet in his tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the unhappy Bladud, clasping his hands, and mournfully\r\nraising his eyes towards the sky, \xe2\x80\x9cwould that my wanderings might end\r\nhere! Would that these grateful tears with which I now mourn hope\r\nmisplaced, and love despised, might flow in peace for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wish was heard. It was in the time of the heathen deities, who used\r\noccasionally to take people at their words, with a promptness, in some\r\ncases, extremely awkward. The ground opened beneath the prince\xe2\x80\x99s feet;\r\nhe sank into the chasm; and instantaneously it closed upon his head for\r\never, save where his hot tears welled up through the earth, and where\r\nthey have continued to gush forth ever since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is observable that, to this day, large numbers of elderly ladies and\r\ngentlemen who have been disappointed in procuring partners, and almost\r\nas many young ones who are anxious to obtain them, repair annually to\r\nBath to drink the waters, from which they derive much strength and\r\ncomfort. This is most complimentary to the virtue of Prince Bladud\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntears, and strongly corroborative of the veracity of this legend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick yawned several times when he had arrived at the end of this\r\nlittle manuscript, carefully refolded, and replaced it in the inkstand\r\ndrawer, and then, with a countenance expressive of the utmost weariness,\r\nlighted his chamber candle, and went upstairs to bed.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at Mr. Dowler\xe2\x80\x99s door, according to custom, and knocked to say\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Dowler, \xe2\x80\x98going to bed? I wish I was. Dismal night. Windy;\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick went to his bedchamber, and Mr. Dowler resumed his seat\r\nbefore the fire, in fulfilment of his rash promise to sit up till his\r\nwife came home.\r\n\r\nThere are few things more worrying than sitting up for somebody,\r\nespecially if that somebody be at a party. You cannot help thinking how\r\nquickly the time passes with them, which drags so heavily with you; and\r\nthe more you think of this, the more your hopes of their speedy arrival\r\ndecline. Clocks tick so loud, too, when you are sitting up alone, and\r\nyou seem as if you had an under-garment of cobwebs on. First, something\r\ntickles your right knee, and then the same sensation irritates your\r\nleft. You have no sooner changed your position, than it comes again in\r\nthe arms; when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of queer\r\nshapes, you have a sudden relapse in the nose, which you rub as if to\r\nrub it off--as there is no doubt you would, if you could. Eyes, too, are\r\nmere personal inconveniences; and the wick of one candle gets an inch\r\nand a half long, while you are snuffing the other. These, and various\r\nother little nervous annoyances, render sitting up for a length of time\r\nafter everybody else has gone to bed, anything but a cheerful amusement.\r\n\r\nThis was just Mr. Dowler\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, as he sat before the fire, and felt\r\nhonestly indignant with all the inhuman people at the party who were\r\nkeeping him up. He was not put into better humour either, by the\r\nreflection that he had taken it into his head, early in the evening, to\r\nthink he had got an ache there, and so stopped at home. At length, after\r\nseveral droppings asleep, and fallings forward towards the bars, and\r\ncatchings backward soon enough to prevent being branded in the face, Mr.\r\nDowler made up his mind that he would throw himself on the bed in the\r\nback room and think--not sleep, of course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a heavy sleeper,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dowler, as he flung himself on the bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must keep awake. I suppose I shall hear a knock here. Yes. I thought\r\nso. I can hear the watchman. There he goes. Fainter now, though. A\r\nlittle fainter. He\xe2\x80\x99s turning the corner. Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 When Mr. Dowler arrived at\r\nthis point, he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating,\r\nand fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nJust as the clock struck three, there was blown into the crescent a\r\nsedan-chair with Mrs. Dowler inside, borne by one short, fat chairman,\r\nand one long, thin one, who had had much ado to keep their bodies\r\nperpendicular: to say nothing of the chair. But on that high ground, and\r\nin the crescent, which the wind swept round and round as if it were\r\ngoing to tear the paving stones up, its fury was tremendous. They were\r\nvery glad to set the chair down, and give a good round loud double-knock\r\nat the street door.\r\n\r\nThey waited some time, but nobody came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Servants is in the arms o\xe2\x80\x99 Porpus, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said the short chairman,\r\nwarming his hands at the attendant link-boy\xe2\x80\x99s torch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish he\xe2\x80\x99d give \xe2\x80\x98em a squeeze and wake \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the long one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Knock again, will you, if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Dowler from the\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x98Knock two or three times, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe short man was quite willing to get the job over, as soon as\r\npossible; so he stood on the step, and gave four or five most startling\r\ndouble-knocks, of eight or ten knocks a-piece, while the long man went\r\ninto the road, and looked up at the windows for a light.\r\n\r\nNobody came. It was all as silent and dark as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98You must knock again, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bell, is there, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 said the short chairman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, there is,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the link-boy, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-ringing at it\r\never so long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only a handle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Dowler, \xe2\x80\x98the wire\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish the servants\xe2\x80\x99 heads wos,\xe2\x80\x99 growled the long man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must trouble you to knock again, if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Dowler,\r\nwith the utmost politeness.\r\n\r\nThe short man did knock again several times, without producing the\r\nsmallest effect. The tall man, growing very impatient, then relieved\r\nhim, and kept on perpetually knocking double-knocks of two loud knocks\r\neach, like an insane postman.\r\n\r\nAt length Mr. Winkle began to dream that he was at a club, and that the\r\nmembers being very refractory, the chairman was obliged to hammer the\r\ntable a good deal to preserve order; then he had a confused notion of an\r\nauction room where there were no bidders, and the auctioneer was buying\r\neverything in; and ultimately he began to think it just within the\r\nbounds of possibility that somebody might be knocking at the street\r\ndoor. To make quite certain, however, he remained quiet in bed for ten\r\nminutes or so, and listened; and when he had counted two or three-and-\r\nthirty knocks, he felt quite satisfied, and gave himself a great deal of\r\ncredit for being so wakeful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rap rap-rap rap-rap rap-ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, rap!\xe2\x80\x99 went the knocker.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle jumped out of bed, wondering very much what could possibly be\r\nthe matter, and hastily putting on his stockings and slippers, folded\r\nhis dressing-gown round him, lighted a flat candle from the rush-light\r\nthat was burning in the fireplace, and hurried downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s somebody comin\xe2\x80\x99 at last, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the short chairman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I wos behind him vith a bradawl,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered the long one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Winkle, undoing the chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to ask questions, cast-iron head,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the long man,\r\nwith great disgust, taking it for granted that the inquirer was a\r\nfootman; \xe2\x80\x98but open the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, look sharp, timber eyelids,\xe2\x80\x99 added the other encouragingly.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, being half asleep, obeyed the command mechanically, opened\r\nthe door a little, and peeped out. The first thing he saw, was the red\r\nglare of the link-boy\xe2\x80\x99s torch. Startled by the sudden fear that the\r\nhouse might be on fire, he hastily threw the door wide open, and holding\r\nthe candle above his head, stared eagerly before him, not quite certain\r\nwhether what he saw was a sedan-chair or a fire-engine. At this instant\r\nthere came a violent gust of wind; the light was blown out; Mr. Winkle\r\nfelt himself irresistibly impelled on to the steps; and the door blew\r\nto, with a loud crash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, young man, now you _have _done it!\xe2\x80\x99 said the short chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, catching sight of a lady\xe2\x80\x99s face at the window of the sedan,\r\nturned hastily round, plied the knocker with all his might and main, and\r\ncalled frantically upon the chairman to take the chair away again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take it away, take it away,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s somebody coming\r\nout of another house; put me into the chair. Hide me! Do something with\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll this time he was shivering with cold; and every time he raised his\r\nhand to the knocker, the wind took the dressing-gown in a most\r\nunpleasant manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The people are coming down the crescent now. There are ladies with \xe2\x80\x98em;\r\ncover me up with something. Stand before me!\xe2\x80\x99 roared Mr. Winkle. But the\r\nchairmen were too much exhausted with laughing to afford him the\r\nslightest assistance, and the ladies were every moment approaching\r\nnearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle gave a last hopeless knock; the ladies were only a few doors\r\noff. He threw away the extinguished candle, which, all this time he had\r\nheld above his head, and fairly bolted into the sedan-chair where Mrs.\r\nDowler was.\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs. Craddock had heard the knocking and the voices at last; and,\r\nonly waiting to put something smarter on her head than her nightcap, ran\r\ndown into the front drawing-room to make sure that it was the right\r\nparty. Throwing up the window-sash as Mr. Winkle was rushing into the\r\nchair, she no sooner caught sight of what was going forward below, than\r\nshe raised a vehement and dismal shriek, and implored Mr. Dowler to get\r\nup directly, for his wife was running away with another gentleman.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Mr. Dowler bounced off the bed as abruptly as an India-rubber\r\nball, and rushing into the front room, arrived at one window just as Mr.\r\nPickwick threw up the other, when the first object that met the gaze of\r\nboth, was Mr. Winkle bolting into the sedan-chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Watchman,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Dowler furiously, \xe2\x80\x98stop him--hold him--keep him\r\ntight--shut him in, till I come down. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut his throat--give me a\r\nknife--from ear to ear, Mrs. Craddock--I will!\xe2\x80\x99 And breaking from the\r\nshrieking landlady, and from Mr. Pickwick, the indignant husband seized\r\na small supper-knife, and tore into the street.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Winkle didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for him. He no sooner heard the horrible\r\nthreat of the valorous Dowler, than he bounced out of the sedan, quite\r\nas quickly as he had bounced in, and throwing off his slippers into the\r\nroad, took to his heels and tore round the crescent, hotly pursued by\r\nDowler and the watchman. He kept ahead; the door was open as he came\r\nround the second time; he rushed in, slammed it in Dowler\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nmounted to his bedroom, locked the door, piled a wash-hand-stand, chest\r\nof drawers, and a table against it, and packed up a few necessaries\r\nready for flight with the first ray of morning.\r\n\r\nDowler came up to the outside of the door; avowed, through the keyhole,\r\nhis steadfast determination of cutting Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s throat next day;\r\nand, after a great confusion of voices in the drawing-room, amidst which\r\nthat of Mr. Pickwick was distinctly heard endeavouring to make peace,\r\nthe inmates dispersed to their several bed-chambers, and all was quiet\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that the inquiry may be made, where Mr. Weller was,\r\nall this time? We will state where he was, in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. HONOURABLY ACCOUNTS FOR MR. WELLER\xe2\x80\x99S ABSENCE, BY\r\nDESCRIBING A SOIREE TO WHICH HE WAS INVITED AND WENT; ALSO RELATES HOW\r\nHE WAS ENTRUSTED BY MR. PICKWICK WITH A PRIVATE MISSION OF DELICACY AND\r\nIMPORTANCE\r\n\r\nMr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Craddock, upon the morning of this very eventful\r\nday, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery odd that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeerd there must be somethin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nmatter, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t recollect any gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n in my circle of acquaintance\r\nas is capable o\xe2\x80\x99 writin\xe2\x80\x99 one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps something uncommon has taken place,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mrs. Craddock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must be somethin\xe2\x80\x99 wery uncommon indeed, as could perduce a letter\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 any friend o\xe2\x80\x99 mine,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, shaking his head dubiously;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98nothin\xe2\x80\x99 less than a nat\xe2\x80\x99ral conwulsion, as the young gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n observed\r\nven he wos took with fits. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be from the gov\xe2\x80\x99ner,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam,\r\nlooking at the direction. \xe2\x80\x98He always prints, I know, \xe2\x80\x98cos he learnt\r\nwritin\xe2\x80\x99 from the large bills in the booking-offices. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wery strange\r\nthing now, where this here letter can ha\xe2\x80\x99 come from.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Sam said this, he did what a great many people do when they are\r\nuncertain about the writer of a note--looked at the seal, and then at\r\nthe front, and then at the back, and then at the sides, and then at the\r\nsuperscription; and, as a last resource, thought perhaps he might as\r\nwell look at the inside, and try to find out from that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s wrote on gilt-edged paper,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, as he unfolded it, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nsealed in bronze vax vith the top of a door key. Now for it.\xe2\x80\x99 And, with\r\na very grave face, Mr. Weller slowly read as follows--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A select company of the Bath footmen presents their compliments to Mr.\r\nWeller, and requests the pleasure of his company this evening, to a\r\nfriendly swarry, consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual\r\ntrimmings. The swarry to be on table at half-past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\npunctually.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was inclosed in another note, which ran thus--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. John Smauker, the gentleman who had the pleasure of meeting Mr.\r\nWeller at the house of their mutual acquaintance, Mr. Bantam, a few days\r\nsince, begs to inclose Mr. Weller the herewith invitation. If Mr. Weller\r\nwill call on Mr. John Smauker at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mr. John Smauker will\r\nhave the pleasure of introducing Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Signed)           \xe2\x80\x98_John Smauker_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe envelope was directed to blank Weller, Esq., at Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s; and\r\nin a parenthesis, in the left hand corner, were the words \xe2\x80\x98airy bell,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas an instruction to the bearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98this is comin\xe2\x80\x99 it rayther powerful, this is. I never\r\nheerd a biled leg o\xe2\x80\x99 mutton called a swarry afore. I wonder wot they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncall a roast one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, without waiting to debate the point, Sam at once betook himself\r\ninto the presence of Mr. Pickwick, and requested leave of absence for\r\nthat evening, which was readily granted. With this permission and the\r\nstreet-door key, Sam Weller issued forth a little before the appointed\r\ntime, and strolled leisurely towards Queen Square, which he no sooner\r\ngained than he had the satisfaction of beholding Mr. John Smauker\r\nleaning his powdered head against a lamp-post at a short distance off,\r\nsmoking a cigar through an amber tube.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you do, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker, raising his hat\r\ngracefully with one hand, while he gently waved the other in a\r\ncondescending manner. \xe2\x80\x98How do you do, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, reasonably conwalessent,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98How do _you _find\r\nyourself, my dear feller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only so so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-workin\xe2\x80\x99 too hard,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I was fearful you\r\nwould; it won\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know; you must not give way to that \xe2\x80\x98ere\r\nuncompromisin\xe2\x80\x99 spirit o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much that, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. John Smauker, \xe2\x80\x98as bad\r\nwine; I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dissipating.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! that\xe2\x80\x99s it, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s a wery bad complaint, that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet the temptation, you see, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. John\r\nSmauker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plunged into the very vortex of society, you know, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. John Smauker, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dreadful, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s always the way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker; \xe2\x80\x98if your destiny leads\r\nyou into public life, and public station, you must expect to be\r\nsubjected to temptations which other people is free from, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely what my uncle said, ven he vent into the public line,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nremarked Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and wery right the old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n wos, for he drank\r\nhisself to death in somethin\xe2\x80\x99 less than a quarter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. John Smauker looked deeply indignant at any parallel being drawn\r\nbetween himself and the deceased gentleman in question; but, as Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface was in the most immovable state of calmness, he thought better of\r\nit, and looked affable again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we had better be walking,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smauker, consulting a\r\ncopper timepiece which dwelt at the bottom of a deep watch-pocket, and\r\nwas raised to the surface by means of a black string, with a copper key\r\nat the other end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98P\xe2\x80\x99raps we had,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98or they\xe2\x80\x99ll overdo the swarry, and that\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspile it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you drank the waters, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired his companion, as they\r\nwalked towards High Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you think of \xe2\x80\x98em, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought they was particklery unpleasant,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker, \xe2\x80\x98you disliked the killibeate taste,\r\nperhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about that \xe2\x80\x98ere,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I thought they\xe2\x80\x99d a wery\r\nstrong flavour o\xe2\x80\x99 warm flat irons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That _is_ the killibeate, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. John Smauker\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wery inexpressive word, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It may be, but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t much in the chimical line myself, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x99 And here, to the great horror of Mr. John Smauker, Sam Weller\r\nbegan to whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker, agonised at the\r\nexceeding ungenteel sound, \xe2\x80\x98will you take my arm?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, you\xe2\x80\x99re wery good, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t deprive you of it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nSam. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve rayther a way o\xe2\x80\x99 putting my hands in my pockets, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthe same to you.\xe2\x80\x99 As Sam said this, he suited the action to the word,\r\nand whistled far louder than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This way,\xe2\x80\x99 said his new friend, apparently much relieved as they turned\r\ndown a by-street; \xe2\x80\x98we shall soon be there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall we?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, quite unmoved by the announcement of his close\r\nvicinity to the select footmen of Bath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll see some very handsome uniforms, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. John\r\nSmauker; \xe2\x80\x98and perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll find some of the gentlemen rather high at\r\nfirst, you know, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll soon come round.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s wery kind on \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you know,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. John Smauker, with an air of sublime\r\nprotection--\xe2\x80\x98you know, as you\xe2\x80\x99re a stranger, perhaps, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be rather\r\nhard upon you at first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They won\xe2\x80\x99t be wery cruel, though, will they?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. John Smauker, pulling forth the fox\xe2\x80\x99s head, and\r\ntaking a gentlemanly pinch. \xe2\x80\x98There are some funny dogs among us, and\r\nthey will have their joke, you know; but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind \xe2\x80\x98em, you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and bear up agin such a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar knock down o\xe2\x80\x99 talent,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nSam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker, putting forth his fox\xe2\x80\x99s head, and\r\nelevating his own; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand by you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached a small greengrocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, which Mr. John\r\nSmauker entered, followed by Sam, who, the moment he got behind him,\r\nrelapsed into a series of the very broadest and most unmitigated grins,\r\nand manifested other demonstrations of being in a highly enviable state\r\nof inward merriment.\r\n\r\nCrossing the greengrocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and putting their hats on the stairs in\r\nthe little passage behind it, they walked into a small parlour; and here\r\nthe full splendour of the scene burst upon Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s view.\r\n\r\nA couple of tables were put together in the middle of the parlour,\r\ncovered with three or four cloths of different ages and dates of\r\nwashing, arranged to look as much like one as the circumstances of the\r\ncase would allow. Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight\r\npeople. Some of the knife handles were green, others red, and a few\r\nyellow; and as all the forks were black, the combination of colours was\r\nexceedingly striking. Plates for a corresponding number of guests were\r\nwarming behind the fender; and the guests themselves were warming before\r\nit: the chief and most important of whom appeared to be a stoutish\r\ngentleman in a bright crimson coat with long tails, vividly red\r\nbreeches, and a cocked hat, who was standing with his back to the fire,\r\nand had apparently just entered, for besides retaining his cocked hat on\r\nhis head, he carried in his hand a high stick, such as gentlemen of his\r\nprofession usually elevate in a sloping position over the roofs of\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Smauker, my lad, your fin,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman with the cocked hat.\r\n\r\nMr. Smauker dovetailed the top joint of his right-hand little finger\r\ninto that of the gentleman with the cocked hat, and said he was charmed\r\nto see him looking so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, they tell me I am looking pretty blooming,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the\r\ncocked hat, \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder, too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been following our old woman\r\nabout, two hours a day, for the last fortnight; and if a constant\r\ncontemplation of the manner in which she hooks-and-eyes that infernal\r\nlavender-coloured old gown of hers behind, isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to throw anybody\r\ninto a low state of despondency for life, stop my quarter\xe2\x80\x99s salary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this, the assembled selections laughed very heartily; and one\r\ngentleman in a yellow waistcoat, with a coach-trimming border, whispered\r\na neighbour in green-foil smalls, that Tuckle was in spirits to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tuckle, \xe2\x80\x98Smauker, my boy, you--\xe2\x80\x99 The remainder of\r\nthe sentence was forwarded into Mr. John Smauker\xe2\x80\x99s ear, by whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, dear me, I quite forgot,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. John Smauker. \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, my\r\nfriend Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorry to keep the fire off you, Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tuckle, with a\r\nfamiliar nod. \xe2\x80\x98Hope you\xe2\x80\x99re not cold, Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not by no means, Blazes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98It \xe2\x80\x98ud be a wery chilly subject\r\nas felt cold wen you stood opposite. You\xe2\x80\x99d save coals if they put you\r\nbehind the fender in the waitin\xe2\x80\x99-room at a public office, you would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs this retort appeared to convey rather a personal allusion to Mr.\r\nTuckle\xe2\x80\x99s crimson livery, that gentleman looked majestic for a few\r\nseconds, but gradually edging away from the fire, broke into a forced\r\nsmile, and said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery much obliged for your good opinion, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98We shall\r\nget on by degrees, I des-say. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try a better one by and bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a\r\ngentleman in orange-coloured plush, accompanied by another selection in\r\npurple cloth, with a great extent of stocking. The new-comers having\r\nbeen welcomed by the old ones, Mr. Tuckle put the question that supper\r\nbe ordered in, which was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe greengrocer and his wife then arranged upon the table a boiled leg\r\nof mutton, hot, with caper sauce, turnips, and potatoes. Mr. Tuckle took\r\nthe chair, and was supported at the other end of the board by the\r\ngentleman in orange plush. The greengrocer put on a pair of wash-leather\r\ngloves to hand the plates with, and stationed himself behind Mr.\r\nTuckle\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harris,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tuckle, in a commanding tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the greengrocer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you got your gloves on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then take the kiver off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe greengrocer did as he was told, with a show of great humility, and\r\nobsequiously handed Mr. Tuckle the carving-knife; in doing which, he\r\naccidentally gaped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tuckle, with great asperity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the crestfallen greengrocer, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to do it, Sir; I was up very late last night, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you what my opinion of you is, Harris,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tuckle, with a\r\nmost impressive air, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a wulgar beast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Harris, \xe2\x80\x98that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be severe with me,\r\ngentlemen. I am very much obliged to you indeed, gentlemen, for your\r\npatronage, and also for your recommendations, gentlemen, whenever\r\nadditional assistance in waiting is required. I hope, gentlemen, I give\r\nsatisfaction.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tuckle. \xe2\x80\x98Very far from it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We consider you an inattentive reskel,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman in the\r\norange plush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a low thief,\xe2\x80\x99 added the gentleman in the green-foil smalls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And an unreclaimable blaygaird,\xe2\x80\x99 added the gentleman in purple.\r\n\r\nThe poor greengrocer bowed very humbly while these little epithets were\r\nbestowed upon him, in the true spirit of the very smallest tyranny; and\r\nwhen everybody had said something to show his superiority, Mr. Tuckle\r\nproceeded to carve the leg of mutton, and to help the company.\r\n\r\nThis important business of the evening had hardly commenced, when the\r\ndoor was thrown briskly open, and another gentleman in a light-blue\r\nsuit, and leaden buttons, made his appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Against the rules,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tuckle. \xe2\x80\x98Too late, too late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; positively I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman in blue. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nappeal to the company. An affair of gallantry now, an appointment at the\r\ntheayter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman in the orange plush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; raly now, honour bright,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in blue. \xe2\x80\x98I made a promese\r\nto fetch our youngest daughter at half-past ten, and she is such an\r\nuncauminly fine gal, that I raly hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the \xe2\x80\x98art to disappint her. No\r\noffence to the present company, Sir, but a petticut, sir--a petticut,\r\nSir, is irrevokeable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I begin to suspect there\xe2\x80\x99s something in that quarter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tuckle, as\r\nthe new-comer took his seat next Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve remarked, once or twice,\r\nthat she leans very heavy on your shoulder when she gets in and out of\r\nthe carriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, raly, raly, Tuckle, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in blue. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nfair. I may have said to one or two friends that she wos a very divine\r\ncreechure, and had refused one or two offers without any hobvus cause,\r\nbut--no, no, no, indeed, Tuckle--before strangers, too--it\xe2\x80\x99s not right--\r\nyou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Delicacy, my dear friend, delicacy!\xe2\x80\x99 And the man in blue,\r\npulling up his neckerchief, and adjusting his coat cuffs, nodded and\r\nfrowned as if there were more behind, which he could say if he liked,\r\nbut was bound in honour to suppress.\r\n\r\nThe man in blue being a light-haired, stiff-necked, free and easy sort\r\nof footman, with a swaggering air and pert face, had attracted Mr.\r\nWeller\xe2\x80\x99s special attention at first, but when he began to come out in\r\nthis way, Sam felt more than ever disposed to cultivate his\r\nacquaintance; so he launched himself into the conversation at once, with\r\ncharacteristic independence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your health, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I like your conversation much. I think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s wery pretty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this the man in blue smiled, as if it were a compliment he was well\r\nused to; but looked approvingly on Sam at the same time, and said he\r\nhoped he should be better acquainted with him, for without any flattery\r\nat all he seemed to have the makings of a very nice fellow about him,\r\nand to be just the man after his own heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98What a lucky feller you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the gentleman in blue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That \xe2\x80\x98ere young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98She knows wot\xe2\x80\x99s wot, she does. Ah!\r\nI see.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller closed one eye, and shook his head from side to side,\r\nin a manner which was highly gratifying to the personal vanity of the\r\ngentleman in blue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re a cunning fellow, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said that individual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I leave all that \xe2\x80\x98ere to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal\r\nmore in your way than mine, as the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n on the right side o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ngarden vall said to the man on the wrong un, ven the mad bull vos a-\r\ncomin\xe2\x80\x99 up the lane.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman in blue, \xe2\x80\x98I think she has\r\nremarked my air and manner, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wery well be off o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you any little thing of that kind in hand, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the\r\nfavoured gentleman in blue, drawing a toothpick from his waistcoat\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no daughters at my place, else o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncourse I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 made up to vun on \xe2\x80\x98em. As it is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can\r\ndo with anythin\xe2\x80\x99 under a female markis. I might keep up with a young\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ooman o\xe2\x80\x99 large property as hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a title, if she made wery fierce love\r\nto me. Not else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course not, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman in blue, \xe2\x80\x98one can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ntroubled, you know; and _we_ know, Mr. Weller--we, who are men of the\r\nworld--that a good uniform must work its way with the women, sooner or\r\nlater. In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing, between you and me, that makes\r\nthe service worth entering into.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it, o\xe2\x80\x99 course.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen this confidential dialogue had gone thus far, glasses were placed\r\nround, and every gentleman ordered what he liked best, before the\r\npublic-house shut up. The gentleman in blue, and the man in orange, who\r\nwere the chief exquisites of the party, ordered \xe2\x80\x98cold shrub and water,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbut with the others, gin-and-water, sweet, appeared to be the favourite\r\nbeverage. Sam called the greengrocer a \xe2\x80\x98desp\xe2\x80\x99rate willin,\xe2\x80\x99 and ordered a\r\nlarge bowl of punch--two circumstances which seemed to raise him very\r\nmuch in the opinion of the selections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in blue, with an air of the most consummate\r\ndandyism, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the ladies; come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98The young mississes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere there was a loud cry of \xe2\x80\x98Order,\xe2\x80\x99 and Mr. John Smauker, as the\r\ngentleman who had introduced Mr. Weller into that company, begged to\r\ninform him that the word he had just made use of, was unparliamentary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which word was that \xe2\x80\x98ere, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mississes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. John Smauker, with an alarming frown. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t recognise such distinctions here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98then I\xe2\x80\x99ll amend the obserwation and call \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nthe dear creeturs, if Blazes vill allow me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSome doubt appeared to exist in the mind of the gentleman in the green-\r\nfoil smalls, whether the chairman could be legally appealed to, as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blazes,\xe2\x80\x99 but as the company seemed more disposed to stand upon their\r\nown rights than his, the question was not raised. The man with the\r\ncocked hat breathed short, and looked long at Sam, but apparently\r\nthought it as well to say nothing, in case he should get the worst of\r\nit. After a short silence, a gentleman in an embroidered coat reaching\r\ndown to his heels, and a waistcoat of the same which kept one half of\r\nhis legs warm, stirred his gin-and-water with great energy, and putting\r\nhimself upon his feet, all at once by a violent effort, said he was\r\ndesirous of offering a few remarks to the company, whereupon the person\r\nin the cocked hat had no doubt that the company would be very happy to\r\nhear any remarks that the man in the long coat might wish to offer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel a great delicacy, gentlemen, in coming for\xe2\x80\x99ard,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in\r\nthe long coat, \xe2\x80\x98having the misforchune to be a coachman, and being only\r\nadmitted as a honorary member of these agreeable swarrys, but I do feel\r\nmyself bound, gentlemen--drove into a corner, if I may use the\r\nexpression--to make known an afflicting circumstance which has come to\r\nmy knowledge; which has happened I may say within the soap of my\r\neveryday contemplation. Gentlemen, our friend Mr. Whiffers (everybody\r\nlooked at the individual in orange), our friend Mr. Whiffers has\r\nresigned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUniversal astonishment fell upon the hearers. Each gentleman looked in\r\nhis neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s face, and then transferred his glance to the upstanding\r\ncoachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may well be sapparised, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the coachman. \xe2\x80\x98I will not\r\nwenchure to state the reasons of this irrepairabel loss to the service,\r\nbut I will beg Mr. Whiffers to state them himself, for the improvement\r\nand imitation of his admiring friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe suggestion being loudly approved of, Mr. Whiffers explained. He said\r\nhe certainly could have wished to have continued to hold the appointment\r\nhe had just resigned. The uniform was extremely rich and expensive, the\r\nfemales of the family was most agreeable, and the duties of the\r\nsituation was not, he was bound to say, too heavy; the principal service\r\nthat was required of him, being, that he should look out of the hall\r\nwindow as much as possible, in company with another gentleman, who had\r\nalso resigned. He could have wished to have spared that company the\r\npainful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter, but as the\r\nexplanation had been demanded of him, he had no alternative but to\r\nstate, boldly and distinctly, that he had been required to eat cold\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive the disgust which this avowal awakened in\r\nthe bosoms of the hearers. Loud cries of \xe2\x80\x98Shame,\xe2\x80\x99 mingled with groans\r\nand hisses, prevailed for a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might\r\nbe traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition. He had a\r\ndistinct recollection of having once consented to eat salt butter, and\r\nhe had, moreover, on an occasion of sudden sickness in the house, so far\r\nforgotten himself as to carry a coal-scuttle up to the second floor. He\r\ntrusted he had not lowered himself in the good opinion of his friends by\r\nthis frank confession of his faults; and he hoped the promptness with\r\nwhich he had resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings, to which\r\nhe had referred, would reinstate him in their good opinion, if he had.\r\n\r\nMr. Whiffers\xe2\x80\x99s address was responded to, with a shout of admiration, and\r\nthe health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic\r\nmanner; for this, the martyr returned thanks, and proposed their\r\nvisitor, Mr. Weller--a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an\r\nintimate acquaintance with, but who was the friend of Mr. John Smauker,\r\nwhich was a sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of\r\ngentlemen whatever, or wherever. On this account, he should have been\r\ndisposed to have given Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s health with all the honours, if his\r\nfriends had been drinking wine; but as they were taking spirits by way\r\nof a change, and as it might be inconvenient to empty a tumbler at every\r\ntoast, he should propose that the honours be understood.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this speech, everybody took a sip in honour of Sam;\r\nand Sam having ladled out, and drunk, two full glasses of punch in\r\nhonour of himself, returned thanks in a neat speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery much obliged to you, old fellers,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, ladling away at the\r\npunch in the most unembarrassed manner possible, \xe2\x80\x98for this here\r\ncompliment; which, comin\xe2\x80\x99 from sich a quarter, is wery overvelmin\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheered a good deal on you as a body, but I will say, that I never\r\nthought you was sich uncommon nice men as I find you air. I only hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll take care o\xe2\x80\x99 yourselves, and not compromise nothin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\ndignity, which is a wery charmin\xe2\x80\x99 thing to see, when one\xe2\x80\x99s out a-\r\nwalkin\xe2\x80\x99, and has always made me wery happy to look at, ever since I was\r\na boy about half as high as the brass-headed stick o\xe2\x80\x99 my wery\r\nrespectable friend, Blazes, there. As to the wictim of oppression in the\r\nsuit o\xe2\x80\x99 brimstone, all I can say of him, is, that I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll get jist\r\nas good a berth as he deserves; in vitch case it\xe2\x80\x99s wery little cold\r\nswarry as ever he\xe2\x80\x99ll be troubled with agin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Sam sat down with a pleasant smile, and his speech having been\r\nvociferously applauded, the company broke up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 old feller?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam Weller\r\nto his friend, Mr. John Smauker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smauker; \xe2\x80\x98I promised Bantam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, wery well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing. P\xe2\x80\x99raps he\xe2\x80\x99d resign if\r\nyou disappinted him. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99, Blazes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the cocked hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot, and leave three-quarters of a bowl of punch behind you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98nonsense, set down agin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Tuckle was not proof against this invitation. He laid aside the\r\ncocked hat and stick which he had just taken up, and said he would have\r\none glass, for good fellowship\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nAs the gentleman in blue went home the same way as Mr. Tuckle, he was\r\nprevailed upon to stop too. When the punch was about half gone, Sam\r\nordered in some oysters from the green-grocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop; and the effect of\r\nboth was so extremely exhilarating, that Mr. Tuckle, dressed out with\r\nthe cocked hat and stick, danced the frog hornpipe among the shells on\r\nthe table, while the gentleman in blue played an accompaniment upon an\r\ningenious musical instrument formed of a hair-comb upon a curl-paper. At\r\nlast, when the punch was all gone, and the night nearly so, they sallied\r\nforth to see each other home. Mr. Tuckle no sooner got into the open\r\nair, than he was seized with a sudden desire to lie on the curbstone;\r\nSam thought it would be a pity to contradict him, and so let him have\r\nhis own way. As the cocked hat would have been spoiled if left there,\r\nSam very considerately flattened it down on the head of the gentleman in\r\nblue, and putting the big stick in his hand, propped him up against his\r\nown street-door, rang the bell, and walked quietly home.\r\n\r\nAt a much earlier hour next morning than his usual time of rising, Mr.\r\nPickwick walked downstairs completely dressed, and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller appeared in reply to the\r\nsummons, \xe2\x80\x98shut the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was an unfortunate occurrence here, last night, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98which gave Mr. Winkle some cause to apprehend violence from\r\nMr. Dowler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd from the old lady downstairs, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, with a most\r\nperplexed countenance, \xe2\x80\x98that in dread of this violence, Mr. Winkle has\r\ngone away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone avay!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Left the house early this morning, without the slightest previous\r\ncommunication with me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98And is gone, I know not\r\nwhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He should ha\xe2\x80\x99 stopped and fought it out, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam\r\ncontemptuously. \xe2\x80\x98It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take much to settle that \xe2\x80\x98ere Dowler, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I may have my doubts of his great\r\nbravery and determination also. But however that may be, Mr. Winkle is\r\ngone. He must be found, Sam. Found and brought back to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd s\xe2\x80\x99pose he won\xe2\x80\x99t come back, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must be made, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s to do it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words Mr. Weller left the room, and immediately afterwards\r\nwas heard to shut the street door. In two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time he returned with\r\nso much coolness as if he had been despatched on the most ordinary\r\nmessage possible, and brought the information that an individual, in\r\nevery respect answering Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s description, had gone over to\r\nBristol that morning, by the branch coach from the Royal Hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, grasping his hand, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a capital fellow;\r\nan invaluable fellow. You must follow him, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The instant you discover him, write to me immediately, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick. \xe2\x80\x98If he attempts to run away from you, knock him down, or lock\r\nhim up. You have my full authority, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll be wery careful, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that I am highly excited, highly\r\ndispleased, and naturally indignant, at the very extraordinary course he\r\nhas thought proper to pursue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that if he does not come back to\r\nthis very house, with you, he will come back with me, for I will come\r\nand fetch him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention that \xe2\x80\x98ere, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think you can find him, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking earnestly\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll find him if he\xe2\x80\x99s anyvere,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam, with great\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Then the sooner you go the better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these instructions, Mr. Pickwick placed a sum of money in the hands\r\nof his faithful servitor, and ordered him to start for Bristol\r\nimmediately, in pursuit of the fugitive.\r\n\r\nSam put a few necessaries in a carpet-bag, and was ready for starting.\r\nHe stopped when he had got to the end of the passage, and walking\r\nquietly back, thrust his head in at the parlour door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fully understands my instructions, do I, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s reg\xe2\x80\x99larly understood about the knockin\xe2\x80\x99 down, is it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Thoroughly. Do what you think necessary.\r\nYou have my orders.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam gave a nod of intelligence, and withdrawing his head from the door,\r\nset forth on his pilgrimage with a light heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. HOW MR. WINKLE, WHEN HE STEPPED OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN,\r\nWALKED GENTLY AND COMFORTABLY INTO THE FIRE\r\n\r\nThe ill-starred gentleman who had been the unfortunate cause of the\r\nunusual noise and disturbance which alarmed the inhabitants of the Royal\r\nCrescent in manner and form already described, after passing a night of\r\ngreat confusion and anxiety, left the roof beneath which his friends\r\nstill slumbered, bound he knew not whither. The excellent and\r\nconsiderate feelings which prompted Mr. Winkle to take this step can\r\nnever be too highly appreciated or too warmly extolled. \xe2\x80\x98If,\xe2\x80\x99 reasoned\r\nMr. Winkle with himself--\xe2\x80\x98if this Dowler attempts (as I have no doubt he\r\nwill) to carry into execution his threat of personal violence against\r\nmyself, it will be incumbent on me to call him out. He has a wife; that\r\nwife is attached to, and dependent on him. Heavens! If I should kill him\r\nin the blindness of my wrath, what would be my feelings ever\r\nafterwards!\xe2\x80\x99 This painful consideration operated so powerfully on the\r\nfeelings of the humane young man, as to cause his knees to knock\r\ntogether, and his countenance to exhibit alarming manifestations of\r\ninward emotion. Impelled by such reflections, he grasped his carpet-bag,\r\nand creeping stealthily downstairs, shut the detestable street door with\r\nas little noise as possible, and walked off. Bending his steps towards\r\nthe Royal Hotel, he found a coach on the point of starting for Bristol,\r\nand, thinking Bristol as good a place for his purpose as any other he\r\ncould go to, he mounted the box, and reached his place of destination in\r\nsuch time as the pair of horses, who went the whole stage and back\r\nagain, twice a day or more, could be reasonably supposed to arrive\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe took up his quarters at the Bush, and designing to postpone any\r\ncommunication by letter with Mr. Pickwick until it was probable that Mr.\r\nDowler\xe2\x80\x99s wrath might have in some degree evaporated, walked forth to\r\nview the city, which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any\r\nplace he had ever seen. Having inspected the docks and shipping, and\r\nviewed the cathedral, he inquired his way to Clifton, and being directed\r\nthither, took the route which was pointed out to him. But as the\r\npavements of Bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth, so its\r\nstreets are not altogether the straightest or least intricate; and Mr.\r\nWinkle, being greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings,\r\nlooked about him for a decent shop in which he could apply afresh for\r\ncounsel and instruction.\r\n\r\nHis eye fell upon a newly-painted tenement which had been recently\r\nconverted into something between a shop and a private house, and which a\r\nred lamp, projecting over the fanlight of the street door, would have\r\nsufficiently announced as the residence of a medical practitioner, even\r\nif the word \xe2\x80\x98Surgery\xe2\x80\x99 had not been inscribed in golden characters on a\r\nwainscot ground, above the window of what, in times bygone, had been the\r\nfront parlour. Thinking this an eligible place wherein to make his\r\ninquiries, Mr. Winkle stepped into the little shop where the gilt-\r\nlabelled drawers and bottles were; and finding nobody there, knocked\r\nwith a half-crown on the counter, to attract the attention of anybody\r\nwho might happen to be in the back parlour, which he judged to be the\r\ninnermost and peculiar sanctum of the establishment, from the repetition\r\nof the word surgery on the door--painted in white letters this time, by\r\nway of taking off the monotony.\r\n\r\nAt the first knock, a sound, as of persons fencing with fire-irons,\r\nwhich had until now been very audible, suddenly ceased; at the second, a\r\nstudious-looking young gentleman in green spectacles, with a very large\r\nbook in his hand, glided quietly into the shop, and stepping behind the\r\ncounter, requested to know the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to trouble you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98but will you have\r\nthe goodness to direct me to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 roared the studious young gentleman, throwing the large\r\nbook up into the air, and catching it with great dexterity at the very\r\nmoment when it threatened to smash to atoms all the bottles on the\r\ncounter. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a start!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was, without doubt; for Mr. Winkle was so very much astonished at\r\nthe extraordinary behaviour of the medical gentleman, that he\r\ninvoluntarily retreated towards the door, and looked very much disturbed\r\nat his strange reception.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x99 said the medical gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle murmured, in reply, that he had not that pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the medical gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98there are hopes for me yet; I\r\nmay attend half the old women in Bristol, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve decent luck. Get out,\r\nyou mouldy old villain, get out!\xe2\x80\x99 With this adjuration, which was\r\naddressed to the large book, the medical gentleman kicked the volume\r\nwith remarkable agility to the farther end of the shop, and, pulling off\r\nhis green spectacles, grinned the identical grin of Robert Sawyer,\r\nEsquire, formerly of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital in the Borough, with a private\r\nresidence in Lant Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you weren\xe2\x80\x99t down upon me?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer,\r\nshaking Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s hand with friendly warmth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word I was not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, returning his pressure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the name,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, calling his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the outer door, on which, in the same white paint,\r\nwere traced the words \xe2\x80\x98Sawyer, late Nockemorf.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It never caught my eye,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord, if I had known who you were, I should have rushed out, and caught\r\nyou in my arms,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer; \xe2\x80\x98but upon my life, I thought you were\r\nthe King\xe2\x80\x99s-taxes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98and I was just going to say that\r\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at home, but if you\xe2\x80\x99d leave a message I\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to give it to\r\nmyself; for he don\xe2\x80\x99t know me; no more does the Lighting and Paving. I\r\nthink the Church-rates guesses who I am, and I know the Water-works\r\ndoes, because I drew a tooth of his when I first came down here. But\r\ncome in, come in!\xe2\x80\x99 Chattering in this way, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed Mr.\r\nWinkle into the back room, where, amusing himself by boring little\r\ncircular caverns in the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker, sat no less\r\na person than Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98This is indeed a pleasure I did not expect.\r\nWhat a very nice place you have here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty well, pretty well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98I _passed_, soon after\r\nthat precious party, and my friends came down with the needful for this\r\nbusiness; so I put on a black suit of clothes, and a pair of spectacles,\r\nand came here to look as solemn as I could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a very snug little business you have, no doubt?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle\r\nknowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98So snug, that at the end of a few years you\r\nmight put all the profits in a wine-glass, and cover \xe2\x80\x98em over with a\r\ngooseberry leaf.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYou cannot surely mean that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98The stock itself--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDummies, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer; \xe2\x80\x98half the drawers have nothing\r\nin \xe2\x80\x98em, and the other half don\xe2\x80\x99t open.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fact--honour!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bob Sawyer, stepping out into the shop, and\r\ndemonstrating the veracity of the assertion by divers hard pulls at the\r\nlittle gilt knobs on the counterfeit drawers. \xe2\x80\x98Hardly anything real in\r\nthe shop but the leeches, and _they _are second-hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Winkle, much surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98else where\xe2\x80\x99s the use of appearances,\r\neh? But what will you take? Do as we do? That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Ben, my fine\r\nfellow, put your hand into the cupboard, and bring out the patent\r\ndigester.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen smiled his readiness, and produced from the closet at\r\nhis elbow a black bottle half full of brandy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t take water, of course?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s rather early. I should like to\r\nqualify it, if you have no objection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None in the least, if you can reconcile it to your conscience,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nBob Sawyer, tossing off, as he spoke, a glass of the liquor with great\r\nrelish. \xe2\x80\x98Ben, the pipkin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen drew forth, from the same hiding-place, a small brass\r\npipkin, which Bob Sawyer observed he prided himself upon, particularly\r\nbecause it looked so business-like. The water in the professional pipkin\r\nhaving been made to boil, in course of time, by various little\r\nshovelfuls of coal, which Mr. Bob Sawyer took out of a practicable\r\nwindow-seat, labelled \xe2\x80\x98Soda Water,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Winkle adulterated his brandy;\r\nand the conversation was becoming general, when it was interrupted by\r\nthe entrance into the shop of a boy, in a sober gray livery and a gold-\r\nlaced hat, with a small covered basket under his arm, whom Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer immediately hailed with, \xe2\x80\x98Tom, you vagabond, come here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy presented himself accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve been stopping to \xe2\x80\x9cover\xe2\x80\x9d all the posts in Bristol, you idle young\r\nscamp!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better not!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer, with a threatening aspect.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who do you suppose will ever employ a professional man, when they see\r\nhis boy playing at marbles in the gutter, or flying the garter in the\r\nhorse-road? Have you no feeling for your profession, you groveller? Did\r\nyou leave all the medicine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The powders for the child, at the large house with the new family, and\r\nthe pills to be taken four times a day at the ill-tempered old\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s with the gouty leg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then shut the door, and mind the shop.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, as the boy retired, \xe2\x80\x98things are not quite so\r\nbad as you would have me believe, either. There is _some _medicine to be\r\nsent out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer peeped into the shop to see that no stranger was within\r\nhearing, and leaning forward to Mr. Winkle, said, in a low tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He leaves it all at the wrong houses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle looked perplexed, and Bob Sawyer and his friend laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob. \xe2\x80\x98He goes up to a house, rings the area bell,\r\npokes a packet of medicine without a direction into the servant\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nand walks off. Servant takes it into the dining-parlour; master opens\r\nit, and reads the label: \xe2\x80\x9cDraught to be taken at bedtime--pills as\r\nbefore--lotion as usual--the powder. From Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s, late Nockemorf\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nPhysicians\xe2\x80\x99 prescriptions carefully prepared,\xe2\x80\x9d and all the rest of it.\r\nShows it to his wife--she reads the label; it goes down to the servants-\r\n-_they_ read the label. Next day, boy calls: \xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry--his mistake--\r\nimmense business--great many parcels to deliver--Mr. Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompliments--late Nockemorf.\xe2\x80\x9d The name gets known, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing,\r\nmy boy, in the medical way. Bless your heart, old fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nthan all the advertising in the world. We have got one four-ounce bottle\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s been to half the houses in Bristol, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98what an excellent plan!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Ben and I have hit upon a dozen such,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer, with\r\ngreat glee. \xe2\x80\x98The lamplighter has eighteenpence a week to pull the night-\r\nbell for ten minutes every time he comes round; and my boy always rushes\r\ninto the church just before the psalms, when the people have got nothing\r\nto do but look about \xe2\x80\x98em, and calls me out, with horror and dismay\r\ndepicted on his countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul,\xe2\x80\x9d everybody says, \xe2\x80\x9csomebody\r\ntaken suddenly ill! Sawyer, late Nockemorf, sent for. What a business\r\nthat young man has!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the termination of this disclosure of some of the mysteries of\r\nmedicine, Mr. Bob Sawyer and his friend, Ben Allen, threw themselves\r\nback in their respective chairs, and laughed boisterously. When they had\r\nenjoyed the joke to their heart\xe2\x80\x99s content, the discourse changed to\r\ntopics in which Mr. Winkle was more immediately interested.\r\n\r\nWe think we have hinted elsewhere, that Mr. Benjamin Allen had a way of\r\nbecoming sentimental after brandy. The case is not a peculiar one, as we\r\nourself can testify, having, on a few occasions, had to deal with\r\npatients who have been afflicted in a similar manner. At this precise\r\nperiod of his existence, Mr. Benjamin Allen had perhaps a greater\r\npredisposition to maudlinism than he had ever known before; the cause of\r\nwhich malady was briefly this. He had been staying nearly three weeks\r\nwith Mr. Bob Sawyer; Mr. Bob Sawyer was not remarkable for temperance,\r\nnor was Mr. Benjamin Allen for the ownership of a very strong head; the\r\nconsequence was that, during the whole space of time just mentioned, Mr.\r\nBenjamin Allen had been wavering between intoxication partial, and\r\nintoxication complete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen, taking advantage of Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer\xe2\x80\x99s temporary absence behind the counter, whither he had retired to\r\ndispense some of the second-hand leeches, previously referred to; \xe2\x80\x98my\r\ndear friend, I am very miserable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle professed his heartfelt regret to hear it, and begged to know\r\nwhether he could do anything to alleviate the sorrows of the suffering\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, my dear boy, nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben. \xe2\x80\x98You recollect Arabella,\r\nWinkle? My sister Arabella--a little girl, Winkle, with black eyes--when\r\nwe were down at Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you happened to notice\r\nher--a nice little girl, Winkle. Perhaps my features may recall her\r\ncountenance to your recollection?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle required nothing to recall the charming Arabella to his mind;\r\nand it was rather fortunate he did not, for the features of her brother\r\nBenjamin would unquestionably have proved but an indifferent refresher\r\nto his memory. He answered, with as much calmness as he could assume,\r\nthat he perfectly remembered the young lady referred to, and sincerely\r\ntrusted she was in good health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our friend Bob is a delightful fellow, Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 was the only reply of\r\nMr. Ben Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, not much relishing this close connection of the\r\ntwo names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I designed \xe2\x80\x98em for each other; they were made for each other, sent into\r\nthe world for each other, born for each other, Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben\r\nAllen, setting down his glass with emphasis. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a special destiny\r\nin the matter, my dear sir; there\xe2\x80\x99s only five years\xe2\x80\x99 difference between\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em, and both their birthdays are in August.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle was too anxious to hear what was to follow to express much\r\nwonderment at this extraordinary coincidence, marvellous as it was; so\r\nMr. Ben Allen, after a tear or two, went on to say that, notwithstanding\r\nall his esteem and respect and veneration for his friend, Arabella had\r\nunaccountably and undutifully evinced the most determined antipathy to\r\nhis person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen, in conclusion. \xe2\x80\x98I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nprior attachment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you any idea who the object of it might be?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Winkle,\r\nwith great trepidation.\r\n\r\nMr. Ben Allen seized the poker, flourished it in a warlike manner above\r\nhis head, inflicted a savage blow on an imaginary skull, and wound up by\r\nsaying, in a very expressive manner, that he only wished he could guess;\r\nthat was all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d show him what I thought of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen. And round went\r\nthe poker again, more fiercely than before.\r\n\r\nAll this was, of course, very soothing to the feelings of Mr. Winkle,\r\nwho remained silent for a few minutes; but at length mustered up\r\nresolution to inquire whether Miss Allen was in Kent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen, laying aside the poker, and looking very\r\ncunning; \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the place for a headstrong\r\ngirl; so, as I am her natural protector and guardian, our parents being\r\ndead, I have brought her down into this part of the country to spend a\r\nfew months at an old aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, in a nice, dull, close place. I think that\r\nwill cure her, my boy. If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her abroad for a little\r\nwhile, and see what that\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s is in Bristol, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 faltered Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, not in Bristol,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Ben Allen, jerking his thumb over\r\nhis right shoulder; \xe2\x80\x98over that way--down there. But, hush, here\xe2\x80\x99s Bob.\r\nNot a word, my dear friend, not a word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShort as this conversation was, it roused in Mr. Winkle the highest\r\ndegree of excitement and anxiety. The suspected prior attachment rankled\r\nin his heart. Could he be the object of it? Could it be for him that the\r\nfair Arabella had looked scornfully on the sprightly Bob Sawyer, or had\r\nhe a successful rival? He determined to see her, cost what it might; but\r\nhere an insurmountable objection presented itself, for whether the\r\nexplanatory \xe2\x80\x98over that way,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98down there,\xe2\x80\x99 of Mr. Ben Allen, meant\r\nthree miles off, or thirty, or three hundred, he could in no wise guess.\r\n\r\nBut he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then, for Bob\r\nSawyer\xe2\x80\x99s return was the immediate precursor of the arrival of a meat-pie\r\nfrom the baker\xe2\x80\x99s, of which that gentleman insisted on his staying to\r\npartake. The cloth was laid by an occasional charwoman, who officiated\r\nin the capacity of Mr. Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper; and a third knife and\r\nfork having been borrowed from the mother of the boy in the gray livery\r\n(for Mr. Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s domestic arrangements were as yet conducted on a\r\nlimited scale), they sat down to dinner; the beer being served up, as\r\nMr. Sawyer remarked, \xe2\x80\x98in its native pewter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Mr. Bob Sawyer ordered in the largest mortar in the shop,\r\nand proceeded to brew a reeking jorum of rum-punch therein, stirring up\r\nand amalgamating the materials with a pestle in a very creditable and\r\napothecary-like manner. Mr. Sawyer, being a bachelor, had only one\r\ntumbler in the house, which was assigned to Mr. Winkle as a compliment\r\nto the visitor, Mr. Ben Allen being accommodated with a funnel with a\r\ncork in the narrow end, and Bob Sawyer contented himself with one of\r\nthose wide-lipped crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic\r\ncharacters, in which chemists are wont to measure out their liquid drugs\r\nin compounding prescriptions. These preliminaries adjusted, the punch\r\nwas tasted, and pronounced excellent; and it having been arranged that\r\nBob Sawyer and Ben Allen should be considered at liberty to fill twice\r\nto Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s once, they started fair, with great satisfaction and\r\ngood-fellowship.\r\n\r\nThere was no singing, because Mr. Bob Sawyer said it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nprofessional; but to make amends for this deprivation there was so much\r\ntalking and laughing that it might have been heard, and very likely was,\r\nat the end of the street. Which conversation materially lightened the\r\nhours and improved the mind of Mr. Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s boy, who, instead of\r\ndevoting the evening to his ordinary occupation of writing his name on\r\nthe counter, and rubbing it out again, peeped through the glass door,\r\nand thus listened and looked on at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mirth of Mr. Bob Sawyer was rapidly ripening into the furious, Mr.\r\nBen Allen was fast relapsing into the sentimental, and the punch had\r\nwell-nigh disappeared altogether, when the boy hastily running in,\r\nannounced that a young woman had just come over, to say that Sawyer late\r\nNockemorf was wanted directly, a couple of streets off. This broke up\r\nthe party. Mr. Bob Sawyer, understanding the message, after some twenty\r\nrepetitions, tied a wet cloth round his head to sober himself, and,\r\nhaving partially succeeded, put on his green spectacles and issued\r\nforth. Resisting all entreaties to stay till he came back, and finding\r\nit quite impossible to engage Mr. Ben Allen in any intelligible\r\nconversation on the subject nearest his heart, or indeed on any other,\r\nMr. Winkle took his departure, and returned to the Bush.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of his mind, and the numerous meditations which Arabella had\r\nawakened, prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that\r\neffect upon him which it would have had under other circumstances. So,\r\nafter taking a glass of soda-water and brandy at the bar, he turned into\r\nthe coffee-room, dispirited rather than elevated by the occurrences of\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nSitting in front of the fire, with his back towards him, was a tallish\r\ngentleman in a greatcoat: the only other occupant of the room. It was\r\nrather a cool evening for the season of the year, and the gentleman drew\r\nhis chair aside to afford the new-comer a sight of the fire. What were\r\nMr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s feelings when, in doing so, he disclosed to view the face\r\nand figure of the vindictive and sanguinary Dowler!\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse was to give a violent pull at the nearest\r\nbell-handle, but that unfortunately happened to be immediately behind\r\nMr. Dowler\xe2\x80\x99s head. He had made one step towards it, before he checked\r\nhimself. As he did so, Mr. Dowler very hastily drew back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Winkle, Sir. Be calm. Don\xe2\x80\x99t strike me. I won\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. A blow!\r\nNever!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dowler, looking meeker than Mr. Winkle had expected in\r\na gentleman of his ferocity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A blow, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 stammered Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A blow, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98Compose your feelings. Sit down. Hear\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, trembling from head to foot, \xe2\x80\x98before I consent\r\nto sit down beside, or opposite you, without the presence of a waiter, I\r\nmust be secured by some further understanding. You used a threat against\r\nme last night, Sir, a dreadful threat, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Winkle turned very\r\npale indeed, and stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dowler, with a countenance almost as white as Mr.\r\nWinkle\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x98Circumstances were suspicious. They have been explained. I\r\nrespect your bravery. Your feeling is upright. Conscious innocence.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s my hand. Grasp it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, hesitating whether to give his hand or\r\nnot, and almost fearing that it was demanded in order that he might be\r\ntaken at an advantage, \xe2\x80\x98really, Sir, I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98You feel aggrieved. Very\r\nnatural. So should I. I was wrong. I beg your pardon. Be friendly.\r\nForgive me.\xe2\x80\x99 With this, Dowler fairly forced his hand upon Mr. Winkle,\r\nand shaking it with the utmost vehemence, declared he was a fellow of\r\nextreme spirit, and he had a higher opinion of him than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dowler, \xe2\x80\x98sit down. Relate it all. How did you find me? When\r\ndid you follow? Be frank. Tell me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s quite accidental,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, greatly perplexed by the\r\ncurious and unexpected nature of the interview. \xe2\x80\x98Quite.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98I woke this morning. I had forgotten my\r\nthreat. I laughed at the accident. I felt friendly. I said so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To whom?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To Mrs. Dowler. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made a vow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a\r\nrash one,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll apologise. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98I went downstairs. You were not to be found.\r\nPickwick looked gloomy. Shook his head. Hoped no violence would be\r\ncommitted. I saw it all. You felt yourself insulted. You had gone, for a\r\nfriend perhaps. Possibly for pistols. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI admire\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle coughed, and beginning to see how the land lay, assumed a\r\nlook of importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I left a note for you,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Dowler. \xe2\x80\x98I said I was sorry. So I was.\r\nPressing business called me here. You were not satisfied. You followed.\r\nYou required a verbal explanation. You were right. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now. My\r\nbusiness is finished. I go back to-morrow. Join me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Dowler progressed in his explanation, Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s countenance grew\r\nmore and more dignified. The mysterious nature of the commencement of\r\ntheir conversation was explained; Mr. Dowler had as great an objection\r\nto duelling as himself; in short, this blustering and awful personage\r\nwas one of the most egregious cowards in existence, and interpreting Mr.\r\nWinkle\xe2\x80\x99s absence through the medium of his own fears, had taken the same\r\nstep as himself, and prudently retired until all excitement of feeling\r\nshould have subsided.\r\n\r\nAs the real state of the case dawned upon Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s mind, he looked\r\nvery terrible, and said he was perfectly satisfied; but at the same\r\ntime, said so with an air that left Mr. Dowler no alternative but to\r\ninfer that if he had not been, something most horrible and destructive\r\nmust inevitably have occurred. Mr. Dowler appeared to be impressed with\r\na becoming sense of Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s magnanimity and condescension; and the\r\ntwo belligerents parted for the night, with many protestations of\r\neternal friendship.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when Mr. Winkle had been revelling some\r\ntwenty minutes in the full luxury of his first sleep, he was suddenly\r\nawakened by a loud knocking at his chamber door, which, being repeated\r\nwith increased vehemence, caused him to start up in bed, and inquire who\r\nwas there, and what the matter was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please, Sir, here\xe2\x80\x99s a young man which says he must see you directly,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nresponded the voice of the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A young man!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No mistake about that \xe2\x80\x98ere, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied another voice through the\r\nkeyhole; \xe2\x80\x98and if that wery same interestin\xe2\x80\x99 young creetur ain\xe2\x80\x99t let in\r\nvithout delay, it\xe2\x80\x99s wery possible as his legs vill enter afore his\r\ncountenance.\xe2\x80\x99 The young man gave a gentle kick at one of the lower\r\npanels of the door, after he had given utterance to this hint, as if to\r\nadd force and point to the remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that you, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle, springing out of bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite unpossible to identify any gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n vith any degree o\xe2\x80\x99 mental\r\nsatisfaction, vithout lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at him, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the voice\r\ndogmatically.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, not much doubting who the young man was, unlocked the door;\r\nwhich he had no sooner done than Mr. Samuel Weller entered with great\r\nprecipitation, and carefully relocking it on the inside, deliberately\r\nput the key in his waistcoat pocket; and, after surveying Mr. Winkle\r\nfrom head to foot, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a wery humorous young gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, you air, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by this conduct, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle\r\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x98Get out, sir, this instant. What do you mean, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Sam; \xe2\x80\x98come, Sir, this is rayther too rich, as\r\nthe young lady said when she remonstrated with the pastry-cook, arter\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d sold her a pork pie as had got nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but fat inside. What do I\r\nmean! Well, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bad \xe2\x80\x98un, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unlock that door, and leave this room immediately, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWinkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall leave this here room, sir, just precisely at the wery same\r\nmoment as you leaves it,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Sam, speaking in a forcible manner,\r\nand seating himself with perfect gravity. \xe2\x80\x98If I find it necessary to\r\ncarry you away, pick-a-back, o\xe2\x80\x99 course I shall leave it the least bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime possible afore you; but allow me to express a hope as you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreduce me to extremities; in saying wich, I merely quote wot the\r\nnobleman said to the fractious pennywinkle, ven he vouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of\r\nhis shell by means of a pin, and he conseqvently began to be afeered\r\nthat he should be obliged to crack him in the parlour door.\xe2\x80\x99 At the end\r\nof this address, which was unusually lengthy for him, Mr. Weller planted\r\nhis hands on his knees, and looked full in Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s face, with an\r\nexpression of countenance which showed that he had not the remotest\r\nintention of being trifled with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a amiably-disposed young man, Sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr.\r\nWeller, in a tone of moral reproof, \xe2\x80\x98to go inwolving our precious\r\ngovernor in all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 fanteegs, wen he\xe2\x80\x99s made up his mind to go\r\nthrough everythink for principle. You\xe2\x80\x99re far worse nor Dodson, Sir; and\r\nas for Fogg, I consider him a born angel to you!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller having\r\naccompanied this last sentiment with an emphatic slap on each knee,\r\nfolded his arms with a look of great disgust, and threw himself back in\r\nhis chair, as if awaiting the criminal\xe2\x80\x99s defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, extending his hand--his teeth\r\nchattering all the time he spoke, for he had been standing, during the\r\nwhole of Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s lecture, in his night-gear--\xe2\x80\x98my good fellow, I\r\nrespect your attachment to my excellent friend, and I am very sorry\r\nindeed to have added to his causes for disquiet. There, Sam, there!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, rather sulkily, but giving the proffered hand a\r\nrespectful shake at the same time--\xe2\x80\x98well, so you ought to be, and I am\r\nvery glad to find you air; for, if I can help it, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have him put\r\nupon by nobody, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98There! Now go to bed, Sam, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk further about this in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m wery sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98but I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not go to bed!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re going back to-night, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr.\r\nWinkle, greatly surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not unless you particklerly wish it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98but I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nthis here room. The governor\xe2\x80\x99s orders wos peremptory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98I must stop here two or three days;\r\nand more than that, Sam, you must stop here too, to assist me in gaining\r\nan interview with a young lady--Miss Allen, Sam; you remember her--whom\r\nI must and will see before I leave Bristol.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut in reply to each of these positions, Sam shook his head with great\r\nfirmness, and energetically replied, \xe2\x80\x98It can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of argument and representation on the part of Mr.\r\nWinkle, however, and a full disclosure of what had passed in the\r\ninterview with Dowler, Sam began to waver; and at length a compromise\r\nwas effected, of which the following were the main and principal\r\nconditions:--\r\n\r\nThat Sam should retire, and leave Mr. Winkle in the undisturbed\r\npossession of his apartment, on the condition that he had permission to\r\nlock the door on the outside, and carry off the key; provided always,\r\nthat in the event of an alarm of fire, or other dangerous contingency,\r\nthe door should be instantly unlocked. That a letter should be written\r\nto Mr. Pickwick early next morning, and forwarded per Dowler, requesting\r\nhis consent to Sam and Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s remaining at Bristol, for the\r\npurpose and with the object already assigned, and begging an answer by\r\nthe next coach--, if favourable, the aforesaid parties to remain\r\naccordingly, and if not, to return to Bath immediately on the receipt\r\nthereof. And, lastly, that Mr. Winkle should be understood as distinctly\r\npledging himself not to resort to the window, fireplace, or other\r\nsurreptitious mode of escape in the meanwhile. These stipulations having\r\nbeen concluded, Sam locked the door and departed.\r\n\r\nHe had nearly got downstairs, when he stopped, and drew the key from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I quite forgot about the knockin\xe2\x80\x99 down,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, half turning back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The governor distinctly said it was to be done. Amazin\xe2\x80\x99 stupid o\xe2\x80\x99 me,\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98ere! Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, brightening up, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s easily done to-\r\nmorrow, anyvays.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nApparently much consoled by this reflection, Mr. Weller once more\r\ndeposited the key in his pocket, and descending the remainder of the\r\nstairs without any fresh visitations of conscience, was soon, in common\r\nwith the other inmates of the house, buried in profound repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX. MR. SAMUEL WELLER, BEING INTRUSTED WITH A MISSION OF\r\nLOVE, PROCEEDS TO EXECUTE IT; WITH WHAT SUCCESS WILL HEREINAFTER APPEAR\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of next day, Sam kept Mr. Winkle steadily in sight,\r\nfully determined not to take his eyes off him for one instant, until he\r\nshould receive express instructions from the fountain-head. However\r\ndisagreeable Sam\xe2\x80\x99s very close watch and great vigilance were to Mr.\r\nWinkle, he thought it better to bear with them, than, by any act of\r\nviolent opposition, to hazard being carried away by force, which Mr.\r\nWeller more than once strongly hinted was the line of conduct that a\r\nstrict sense of duty prompted him to pursue. There is little reason to\r\ndoubt that Sam would very speedily have quieted his scruples, by bearing\r\nMr. Winkle back to Bath, bound hand and foot, had not Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprompt attention to the note, which Dowler had undertaken to deliver,\r\nforestalled any such proceeding. In short, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nevening, Mr. Pickwick himself walked into the coffee-room of the Bush\r\nTavern, and told Sam with a smile, to his very great relief, that he had\r\ndone quite right, and it was unnecessary for him to mount guard any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it better to come myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, addressing Mr.\r\nWinkle, as Sam disencumbered him of his great-coat and travelling-shawl,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to ascertain, before I gave my consent to Sam\xe2\x80\x99s employment in this\r\nmatter, that you are quite in earnest and serious, with respect to this\r\nyoung lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serious, from my heart--from my soul!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Winkle, with great\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with beaming eyes, \xe2\x80\x98we met her at our\r\nexcellent and hospitable friend\xe2\x80\x99s, Winkle. It would be an ill return to\r\ntamper lightly, and without due consideration, with this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffections. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not allow that, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not allow it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no such intention, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Winkle warmly. \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nconsidered the matter well, for a long time, and I feel that my\r\nhappiness is bound up in her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s wot we call tying it up in a small parcel, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr.\r\nWeller, with an agreeable smile.\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle looked somewhat stern at this interruption, and Mr. Pickwick\r\nangrily requested his attendant not to jest with one of the best\r\nfeelings of our nature; to which Sam replied, \xe2\x80\x98That he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, if he\r\nwas aware on it; but there were so many on \xe2\x80\x98em, that he hardly know\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwhich was the best ones wen he heerd \xe2\x80\x98em mentioned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle then recounted what had passed between himself and Mr. Ben\r\nAllen, relative to Arabella; stated that his object was to gain an\r\ninterview with the young lady, and make a formal disclosure of his\r\npassion; and declared his conviction, founded on certain dark hints and\r\nmutterings of the aforesaid Ben, that, wherever she was at present\r\nimmured, it was somewhere near the Downs. And this was his whole stock\r\nof knowledge or suspicion on the subject.\r\n\r\nWith this very slight clue to guide him, it was determined that Mr.\r\nWeller should start next morning on an expedition of discovery; it was\r\nalso arranged that Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle, who were less confident\r\nof their powers, should parade the town meanwhile, and accidentally drop\r\nin upon Mr. Bob Sawyer in the course of the day, in the hope of seeing\r\nor hearing something of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, next morning, Sam Weller issued forth upon his quest, in no\r\nway daunted by the very discouraging prospect before him; and away he\r\nwalked, up one street and down another--we were going to say, up one\r\nhill and down another, only it\xe2\x80\x99s all uphill at Clifton--without meeting\r\nwith anything or anybody that tended to throw the faintest light on the\r\nmatter in hand. Many were the colloquies into which Sam entered with\r\ngrooms who were airing horses on roads, and nursemaids who were airing\r\nchildren in lanes; but nothing could Sam elicit from either the first-\r\nmentioned or the last, which bore the slightest reference to the object\r\nof his artfully-prosecuted inquiries. There were a great many young\r\nladies in a great many houses, the greater part whereof were shrewdly\r\nsuspected by the male and female domestics to be deeply attached to\r\nsomebody, or perfectly ready to become so, if opportunity afforded. But\r\nas none among these young ladies was Miss Arabella Allen, the\r\ninformation left Sam at exactly the old point of wisdom at which he had\r\nstood before.\r\n\r\nSam struggled across the Downs against a good high wind, wondering\r\nwhether it was always necessary to hold your hat on with both hands in\r\nthat part of the country, and came to a shady by-place, about which were\r\nsprinkled several little villas of quiet and secluded appearance.\r\nOutside a stable door at the bottom of a long back lane without a\r\nthoroughfare, a groom in undress was idling about, apparently persuading\r\nhimself that he was doing something with a spade and a wheel-barrow. We\r\nmay remark, in this place, that we have scarcely ever seen a groom near\r\na stable, in his lazy moments, who has not been, to a greater or less\r\nextent, the victim of this singular delusion.\r\n\r\nSam thought he might as well talk to this groom as to any one else,\r\nespecially as he was very tired with walking, and there was a good large\r\nstone just opposite the wheel-barrow; so he strolled down the lane, and,\r\nseating himself on the stone, opened a conversation with the ease and\r\nfreedom for which he was remarkable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mornin\xe2\x80\x99, old friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Arternoon, you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the groom, casting a surly look at Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wery right, old friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98I _do_ mean arternoon. How\r\nare you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t find myself much the better for seeing of you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nthe ill-tempered groom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s wery odd--that is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98for you look so uncommon\r\ncheerful, and seem altogether so lively, that it does vun\xe2\x80\x99s heart good\r\nto see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe surly groom looked surlier still at this, but not sufficiently so to\r\nproduce any effect upon Sam, who immediately inquired, with a\r\ncountenance of great anxiety, whether his master\xe2\x80\x99s name was not Walker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the groom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor Brown, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor Vilson?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; nor that either,\xe2\x80\x99 said the groom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98then I\xe2\x80\x99m mistaken, and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the honour o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy acquaintance, which I thought he had. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wait here out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncompliment to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, as the groom wheeled in the barrow, and\r\nprepared to shut the gate. \xe2\x80\x98Ease afore ceremony, old boy; I\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d knock your head off for half-a-crown,\xe2\x80\x99 said the surly groom,\r\nbolting one half of the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have it done on those terms,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam. \xe2\x80\x98It \xe2\x80\x98ud\r\nbe worth a life\xe2\x80\x99s board wages at least, to you, and \xe2\x80\x98ud be cheap at\r\nthat. Make my compliments indoors. Tell \xe2\x80\x98em not to vait dinner for me,\r\nand say they needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind puttin\xe2\x80\x99 any by, for it\xe2\x80\x99ll be cold afore I come\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn reply to this, the groom waxing very wroth, muttered a desire to\r\ndamage somebody\xe2\x80\x99s person; but disappeared without carrying it into\r\nexecution, slamming the door angrily after him, and wholly unheeding\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate request, that he would leave him a lock of his hair\r\nbefore he went.\r\n\r\nSam continued to sit on the large stone, meditating upon what was best\r\nto be done, and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the\r\ndoors within five miles of Bristol, taking them at a hundred and fifty\r\nor two hundred a day, and endeavouring to find Miss Arabella by that\r\nexpedient, when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might\r\nhave sat there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it.\r\n\r\nInto the lane where he sat, there opened three or four garden gates,\r\nbelonging to as many houses, which though detached from each other, were\r\nonly separated by their gardens. As these were large and long, and well\r\nplanted with trees, the houses were not only at some distance off, but\r\nthe greater part of them were nearly concealed from view. Sam was\r\nsitting with his eyes fixed upon the dust-heap outside the next gate to\r\nthat by which the groom had disappeared, profoundly turning over in his\r\nmind the difficulties of his present undertaking, when the gate opened,\r\nand a female servant came out into the lane to shake some bedside\r\ncarpets.\r\n\r\nSam was so very busy with his own thoughts, that it is probable he would\r\nhave taken no more notice of the young woman than just raising his head\r\nand remarking that she had a very neat and pretty figure, if his\r\nfeelings of gallantry had not been most strongly roused by observing\r\nthat she had no one to help her, and that the carpets seemed too heavy\r\nfor her single strength. Mr. Weller was a gentleman of great gallantry\r\nin his own way, and he no sooner remarked this circumstance than he\r\nhastily rose from the large stone, and advanced towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, sliding up with an air of great respect, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspile that wery pretty figure out o\xe2\x80\x99 all perportion if you shake them\r\ncarpets by yourself. Let me help you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe young lady, who had been coyly affecting not to know that a\r\ngentleman was so near, turned round as Sam spoke--no doubt (indeed she\r\nsaid so, afterwards) to decline this offer from a perfect stranger--when\r\ninstead of speaking, she started back, and uttered a half-suppressed\r\nscream. Sam was scarcely less staggered, for in the countenance of the\r\nwell-shaped female servant, he beheld the very features of his\r\nvalentine, the pretty housemaid from Mr. Nupkins\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, Mary, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lauk, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, \xe2\x80\x98how you do frighten one!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam made no verbal answer to this complaint, nor can we precisely say\r\nwhat reply he did make. We merely know that after a short pause Mary\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Lor, do adun, Mr. Weller!\xe2\x80\x99 and that his hat had fallen off a few\r\nmoments before--from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer\r\nthat one kiss, or more, had passed between the parties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, how did you come here?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, when the conversation to which\r\nthis interruption had been offered, was resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 course I came to look arter you, my darlin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller;\r\nfor once permitting his passion to get the better of his veracity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how did you know I was here?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mary. \xe2\x80\x98Who could have told\r\nyou that I took another service at Ipswich, and that they afterwards\r\nmoved all the way here? Who _could _have told you that, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with a cunning look, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s the pint. Who\r\ncould ha\xe2\x80\x99 told me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Muzzle, was it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no.\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, with a solemn shake of the head, \xe2\x80\x98it warn\xe2\x80\x99t him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must have been the cook,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 course it must,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I never heard the like of that!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No more did I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98But Mary, my dear\xe2\x80\x99--here Sam\xe2\x80\x99s manner grew\r\nextremely affectionate--\xe2\x80\x98Mary, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got another affair in hand\r\nas is wery pressin\xe2\x80\x99. There\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 my governor\xe2\x80\x99s friends--Mr. Winkle,\r\nyou remember him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Him in the green coat?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, I remember him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s in a horrid state o\xe2\x80\x99 love; reg\xe2\x80\x99larly comfoozled,\r\nand done over vith it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98but that\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 if we could find out the young\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ooman;\xe2\x80\x99 and here Sam, with many digressions upon the personal beauty of\r\nMary, and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw\r\nher, gave a faithful account of Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s present predicament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, \xe2\x80\x98I never did!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 course not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and nobody never did, nor never vill\r\nneither; and here am I a-walkin\xe2\x80\x99 about like the wandering Jew--a\r\nsportin\xe2\x80\x99 character you have perhaps heerd on Mary, my dear, as vos\r\nalvays doin\xe2\x80\x99 a match agin\xe2\x80\x99 time, and never vent to sleep--looking arter\r\nthis here Miss Arabella Allen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss who?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, in great astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Arabella Allen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Goodness gracious!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, pointing to the garden door which the\r\nsulky groom had locked after him. \xe2\x80\x98Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s that very house; she\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nliving there these six weeks. Their upper house-maid, which is lady\xe2\x80\x99s-\r\nmaid too, told me all about it over the wash-house palin\xe2\x80\x99s before the\r\nfamily was out of bed, one mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot, the wery next door to you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The very next,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mary.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he\r\nfound it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for\r\nsupport; and divers little love passages had passed between them, before\r\nhe was sufficiently collected to return to the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam at length, \xe2\x80\x98if this don\xe2\x80\x99t beat cock-fightin\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnever vill, as the lord mayor said, ven the chief secretary o\xe2\x80\x99 state\r\nproposed his missis\xe2\x80\x99s health arter dinner. That wery next house! Wy,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a message to her as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-trying all day to deliver.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, \xe2\x80\x98but you can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver it now, because she only walks\r\nin the garden in the evening, and then only for a very little time; she\r\nnever goes out, without the old lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam ruminated for a few moments, and finally hit upon the following plan\r\nof operations; that he should return just at dusk--the time at which\r\nArabella invariably took her walk--and, being admitted by Mary into the\r\ngarden of the house to which she belonged, would contrive to scramble up\r\nthe wall, beneath the overhanging boughs of a large pear-tree, which\r\nwould effectually screen him from observation; would there deliver his\r\nmessage, and arrange, if possible, an interview on behalf of Mr. Winkle\r\nfor the ensuing evening at the same hour. Having made this arrangement\r\nwith great despatch, he assisted Mary in the long-deferred occupation of\r\nshaking the carpets.\r\n\r\nIt is not half as innocent a thing as it looks, that shaking little\r\npieces of carpet--at least, there may be no great harm in the shaking,\r\nbut the folding is a very insidious process. So long as the shaking\r\nlasts, and the two parties are kept the carpet\xe2\x80\x99s length apart, it is as\r\ninnocent an amusement as can well be devised; but when the folding\r\nbegins, and the distance between them gets gradually lessened from one\r\nhalf its former length to a quarter, and then to an eighth, and then to\r\na sixteenth, and then to a thirty-second, if the carpet be long enough,\r\nit becomes dangerous. We do not know, to a nicety, how many pieces of\r\ncarpet were folded in this instance, but we can venture to state that as\r\nmany pieces as there were, so many times did Sam kiss the pretty\r\nhousemaid.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller regaled himself with moderation at the nearest tavern until\r\nit was nearly dusk, and then returned to the lane without the\r\nthoroughfare. Having been admitted into the garden by Mary, and having\r\nreceived from that lady sundry admonitions concerning the safety of his\r\nlimbs and neck, Sam mounted into the pear-tree, to wait until Arabella\r\nshould come into sight.\r\n\r\nHe waited so long without this anxiously-expected event occurring, that\r\nhe began to think it was not going to take place at all, when he heard\r\nlight footsteps upon the gravel, and immediately afterwards beheld\r\nArabella walking pensively down the garden. As soon as she came nearly\r\nbelow the tree, Sam began, by way of gently indicating his presence, to\r\nmake sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be\r\nnatural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a\r\ncombination of inflammatory sore throat, croup, and whooping-cough, from\r\nhis earliest infancy.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the young lady cast a hurried glance towards the spot whence\r\nthe dreadful sounds proceeded; and her previous alarm being not at all\r\ndiminished when she saw a man among the branches, she would most\r\ncertainly have decamped, and alarmed the house, had not fear fortunately\r\ndeprived her of the power of moving, and caused her to sink down on a\r\ngarden seat, which happened by good luck to be near at hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 off,\xe2\x80\x99 soliloquised Sam in great perplexity. \xe2\x80\x98Wot a thing\r\nit is, as these here young creeturs will go a-faintin\xe2\x80\x99 avay just ven\r\nthey oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to. Here, young \xe2\x80\x98ooman, Miss Sawbones, Mrs. Vinkle,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether it was the magic of Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s name, or the coolness of the\r\nopen air, or some recollection of Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s voice, that revived\r\nArabella, matters not. She raised her head and languidly inquired,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that, and what do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, swinging himself on to the wall, and crouching there\r\nin as small a compass as he could reduce himself to, \xe2\x80\x98only me, miss,\r\nonly me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s servant!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wery same, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Vinkle reg\xe2\x80\x99larly sewed\r\nup vith desperation, miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, drawing nearer the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Ve thought ve should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been obliged to\r\nstrait-veskit him last night; he\xe2\x80\x99s been a-ravin\xe2\x80\x99 all day; and he says if\r\nhe can\xe2\x80\x99t see you afore to-morrow night\xe2\x80\x99s over, he vishes he may be\r\nsomethin\xe2\x80\x99 unpleasanted if he don\xe2\x80\x99t drownd hisself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, no, Mr. Weller!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s wot he says, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam coolly. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a man of his word,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion he\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, miss. He\xe2\x80\x99s heerd all about you from the\r\nsawbones in barnacles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From my brother!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, having some faint recognition of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know which is your brother, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Is it\r\nthe dirtiest vun o\xe2\x80\x99 the two?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Arabella, \xe2\x80\x98go on. Make haste, pray.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s heerd all about it from him; and it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngov\xe2\x80\x99nor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t see him wery quick, the sawbones as\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-speakin\xe2\x80\x99 on, \xe2\x80\x98ull get as much extra lead in his head as\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrayther damage the dewelopment o\xe2\x80\x99 the orgins if they ever put it in\r\nspirits artervards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, what can I do to prevent these dreadful quarrels!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed\r\nArabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the suspicion of a priory \xe2\x80\x98tachment as is the cause of it all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better see him, miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how?--where?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Arabella. \xe2\x80\x98I dare not leave the house alone. My\r\nbrother is so unkind, so unreasonable! I know how strange my talking\r\nthus to you may appear, Mr. Weller, but I am very, very unhappy--\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhere poor Arabella wept so bitterly that Sam grew chivalrous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It may seem wery strange talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to me about these here affairs, miss,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Sam, with great vehemence; \xe2\x80\x98but all I can say is, that I\xe2\x80\x99m not only\r\nready but villin\xe2\x80\x99 to do anythin\xe2\x80\x99 as\xe2\x80\x99ll make matters agreeable; and if\r\nchuckin\xe2\x80\x99 either o\xe2\x80\x99 them sawboneses out o\xe2\x80\x99 winder \xe2\x80\x98ull do it, I\xe2\x80\x99m the\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x99 As Sam Weller said this, he tucked up his wristbands, at the\r\nimminent hazard of falling off the wall in so doing, to intimate his\r\nreadiness to set to work immediately.\r\n\r\nFlattering as these professions of good feeling were, Arabella\r\nresolutely declined (most unaccountably, as Sam thought) to avail\r\nherself of them. For some time she strenuously refused to grant Mr.\r\nWinkle the interview Sam had so pathetically requested; but at length,\r\nwhen the conversation threatened to be interrupted by the unwelcome\r\narrival of a third party, she hurriedly gave him to understand, with\r\nmany professions of gratitude, that it was barely possible she might be\r\nin the garden an hour later, next evening. Sam understood this perfectly\r\nwell; and Arabella, bestowing upon him one of her sweetest smiles,\r\ntripped gracefully away, leaving Mr. Weller in a state of very great\r\nadmiration of her charms, both personal and mental.\r\n\r\nHaving descended in safety from the wall, and not forgotten to devote a\r\nfew moments to his own particular business in the same department, Mr.\r\nWeller then made the best of his way back to the Bush, where his\r\nprolonged absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must be careful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, after listening attentively to\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s tale, \xe2\x80\x98not for our sakes, but for that of the young lady. We must\r\nbe very cautious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_We_!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, with marked emphasis.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s momentary look of indignation at the tone of this remark,\r\nsubsided into his characteristic expression of benevolence, as he\r\nreplied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_We_, Sir! I shall accompany you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick mildly. \xe2\x80\x98In affording you this interview, the\r\nyoung lady has taken a natural, perhaps, but still a very imprudent\r\nstep. If I am present at the meeting--a mutual friend, who is old enough\r\nto be the father of both parties--the voice of calumny can never be\r\nraised against her hereafter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own\r\nforesight, as he spoke thus. Mr. Winkle was touched by this little trait\r\nof his delicate respect for the young _protegee _of his friend, and took\r\nhis hand with a feeling of regard, akin to veneration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You _SHALL _ go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Sam, have my greatcoat and shawl ready,\r\nand order a conveyance to be at the door to-morrow evening, rather\r\nearlier than is absolutely necessary, in order that we may be in good\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller touched his hat, as an earnest of his obedience, and withdrew\r\nto make all needful preparations for the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe coach was punctual to the time appointed; and Mr. Weller, after duly\r\ninstalling Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle inside, took his seat on the box\r\nby the driver. They alighted, as had been agreed on, about a quarter of\r\na mile from the place of rendezvous, and desiring the coachman to await\r\ntheir return, proceeded the remaining distance on foot.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage of the undertaking that Mr. Pickwick, with many\r\nsmiles and various other indications of great self-satisfaction,\r\nproduced from one of his coat pockets a dark lantern, with which he had\r\nspecially provided himself for the occasion, and the great mechanical\r\nbeauty of which he proceeded to explain to Mr. Winkle, as they walked\r\nalong, to the no small surprise of the few stragglers they met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should have been the better for something of this kind, in my last\r\ngarden expedition, at night; eh, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking good-\r\nhumouredly round at his follower, who was trudging behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery nice things, if they\xe2\x80\x99re managed properly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nWeller; \xe2\x80\x98but wen you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be seen, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re more useful\r\narter the candle\xe2\x80\x99s gone out, than wen it\xe2\x80\x99s alight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick appeared struck by Sam\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, for he put the lantern\r\ninto his pocket again, and they walked on in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Down here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Let me lead the way. This is the lane,\r\nSir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDown the lane they went, and dark enough it was. Mr. Pickwick brought\r\nout the lantern, once or twice, as they groped their way along, and\r\nthrew a very brilliant little tunnel of light before them, about a foot\r\nin diameter. It was very pretty to look at, but seemed to have the\r\neffect of rendering surrounding objects rather darker than before.\r\n\r\nAt length they arrived at the large stone. Here Sam recommended his\r\nmaster and Mr. Winkle to seat themselves, while he reconnoitred, and\r\nascertained whether Mary was yet in waiting.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of five or ten minutes, Sam returned to say that the\r\ngate was opened, and all quiet. Following him with stealthy tread, Mr.\r\nPickwick and Mr. Winkle soon found themselves in the garden. Here\r\neverybody said, \xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 a good many times; and that being done, no one\r\nseemed to have any very distinct apprehension of what was to be done\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Miss Allen in the garden yet, Mary?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle, much\r\nagitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the pretty housemaid. \xe2\x80\x98The best thing to be\r\ndone, sir, will be for Mr. Weller to give you a hoist up into the tree,\r\nand perhaps Mr. Pickwick will have the goodness to see that nobody comes\r\nup the lane, while I watch at the other end of the garden. Goodness\r\ngracious, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That \xe2\x80\x98ere blessed lantern \xe2\x80\x98ull be the death on us all,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam\r\npeevishly. \xe2\x80\x98Take care wot you\xe2\x80\x99re a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 on, sir; you\xe2\x80\x99re a-sendin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nblaze o\xe2\x80\x99 light, right into the back parlour winder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, turning hastily aside, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\ndo that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the next house, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my heart!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning round again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the stable, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll think the place is afire,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSam. \xe2\x80\x98Shut it up, sir, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the most extraordinary lantern I ever met with, in all my life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexclaimed Mr. Pickwick, greatly bewildered by the effects he had so\r\nunintentionally produced. \xe2\x80\x98I never saw such a powerful reflector.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll be vun too powerful for us, if you keep blazin\xe2\x80\x99 avay in that\r\nmanner, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, as Mr. Pickwick, after various unsuccessful\r\nefforts, managed to close the slide. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps. Now, Mr. Winkle, sir, up vith you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I must speak to her first. Help me up,\r\nSam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gently, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, planting his head against the wall, and making\r\na platform of his back. \xe2\x80\x98Step atop o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere flower-pot, Sir. Now\r\nthen, up vith you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I shall hurt you, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Lend him a hand, Mr. Winkle, sir.\r\nSteady, sir, steady! That\xe2\x80\x99s the time o\xe2\x80\x99 day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Sam spoke, Mr. Pickwick, by exertions almost supernatural in a\r\ngentleman of his years and weight, contrived to get upon Sam\xe2\x80\x99s back; and\r\nSam gently raising himself up, and Mr. Pickwick holding on fast by the\r\ntop of the wall, while Mr. Winkle clasped him tight by the legs, they\r\ncontrived by these means to bring his spectacles just above the level of\r\nthe coping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking over the wall, and catching sight\r\nof Arabella, on the other side, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened, my dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, pray go away, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x98Tell them all to\r\ngo away. I am so dreadfully frightened. Dear, dear Mr. Pickwick, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop there. You\xe2\x80\x99ll fall down and kill yourself, I know you will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick soothingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is not the least cause for fear, I assure you. Stand firm, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr. Pickwick, looking down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be longer than you can\r\nconweniently help, sir. You\xe2\x80\x99re rayther heavy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only another moment, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I merely wished you to know, my dear, that I should not have allowed my\r\nyoung friend to see you in this clandestine way, if the situation in\r\nwhich you are placed had left him any alternative; and, lest the\r\nimpropriety of this step should cause you any uneasiness, my love, it\r\nmay be a satisfaction to you, to know that I am present. That\xe2\x80\x99s all, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, Mr. Pickwick, I am very much obliged to you for your kindness\r\nand consideration,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Arabella, drying her tears with her\r\nhandkerchief. She would probably have said much more, had not Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s head disappeared with great swiftness, in consequence of a\r\nfalse step on Sam\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder which brought him suddenly to the ground.\r\nHe was up again in an instant however; and bidding Mr. Winkle make haste\r\nand get the interview over, ran out into the lane to keep watch, with\r\nall the courage and ardour of youth. Mr. Winkle himself, inspired by the\r\noccasion, was on the wall in a moment, merely pausing to request Sam to\r\nbe careful of his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care on him, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Leave him to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is he? What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless his old gaiters,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam, looking out at the garden door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a-keepin\xe2\x80\x99 guard in the lane vith that \xe2\x80\x98ere dark lantern, like a\r\namiable Guy Fawkes! I never see such a fine creetur in my days. Blessed\r\nif I don\xe2\x80\x99t think his heart must ha\xe2\x80\x99 been born five-and-twenty year arter\r\nhis body, at least!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle stayed not to hear the encomium upon his friend. He had\r\ndropped from the wall; thrown himself at Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s feet; and by this\r\ntime was pleading the sincerity of his passion with an eloquence worthy\r\neven of Mr. Pickwick himself.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were going on in the open air, an elderly gentleman\r\nof scientific attainments was seated in his library, two or three houses\r\noff, writing a philosophical treatise, and ever and anon moistening his\r\nclay and his labours with a glass of claret from a venerable-looking\r\nbottle which stood by his side. In the agonies of composition, the\r\nelderly gentleman looked sometimes at the carpet, sometimes at the\r\nceiling, and sometimes at the wall; and when neither carpet, ceiling,\r\nnor wall afforded the requisite degree of inspiration, he looked out of\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nIn one of these pauses of invention, the scientific gentleman was gazing\r\nabstractedly on the thick darkness outside, when he was very much\r\nsurprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air, at\r\na short distance above the ground, and almost instantaneously vanish.\r\nAfter a short time the phenomenon was repeated, not once or twice, but\r\nseveral times; at last the scientific gentleman, laying down his pen,\r\nbegan to consider to what natural causes these appearances were to be\r\nassigned.\r\n\r\nThey were not meteors; they were too low. They were not glow-worms; they\r\nwere too high. They were not will-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-wisps; they were not fireflies;\r\nthey were not fireworks. What could they be? Some extraordinary and\r\nwonderful phenomenon of nature, which no philosopher had ever seen\r\nbefore; something which it had been reserved for him alone to discover,\r\nand which he should immortalise his name by chronicling for the benefit\r\nof posterity. Full of this idea, the scientific gentleman seized his pen\r\nagain, and committed to paper sundry notes of these unparalleled\r\nappearances, with the date, day, hour, minute, and precise second at\r\nwhich they were visible: all of which were to form the data of a\r\nvoluminous treatise of great research and deep learning, which should\r\nastonish all the atmospherical wiseacres that ever drew breath in any\r\npart of the civilised globe.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself back in his easy-chair, wrapped in contemplations of\r\nhis future greatness. The mysterious light appeared more brilliantly\r\nthan before, dancing, to all appearance, up and down the lane, crossing\r\nfrom side to side, and moving in an orbit as eccentric as comets\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe scientific gentleman was a bachelor. He had no wife to call in and\r\nastonish, so he rang the bell for his servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pruffle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the scientific gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98there is something very\r\nextraordinary in the air to-night? Did you see that?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nscientific gentleman, pointing out of the window, as the light again\r\nbecame visible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I did, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think of it, Pruffle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think of it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. You have been bred up in this country. What should you say was the\r\ncause for those lights, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated Pruffle\xe2\x80\x99s reply that he\r\ncould assign no cause for them at all. Pruffle meditated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should say it was thieves, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pruffle at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a fool, and may go downstairs,\xe2\x80\x99 said the scientific gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pruffle. And down he went.\r\n\r\nBut the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the\r\ningenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world, which must\r\ninevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious Mr. Pruffle\r\nwere not stifled in its birth. He put on his hat and walked quickly down\r\nthe garden, determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom.\r\n\r\nNow, shortly before the scientific gentleman walked out into the garden,\r\nMr. Pickwick had run down the lane as fast as he could, to convey a\r\nfalse alarm that somebody was coming that way; occasionally drawing back\r\nthe slide of the dark lantern to keep himself from the ditch. The alarm\r\nwas no sooner given, than Mr. Winkle scrambled back over the wall, and\r\nArabella ran into the house; the garden gate was shut, and the three\r\nadventurers were making the best of their way down the lane, when they\r\nwere startled by the scientific gentleman unlocking his garden gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold hard,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Sam, who was, of course, the first of the party.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show a light for just vun second, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick did as he was desired, and Sam, seeing a man\xe2\x80\x99s head peeping\r\nout very cautiously within half a yard of his own, gave it a gentle tap\r\nwith his clenched fist, which knocked it, with a hollow sound, against\r\nthe gate. Having performed this feat with great suddenness and\r\ndexterity, Mr. Weller caught Mr. Pickwick up on his back, and followed\r\nMr. Winkle down the lane at a pace which, considering the burden he\r\ncarried, was perfectly astonishing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you got your vind back agin, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, when they had\r\nreached the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite. Quite, now,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then come along, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, setting his master on his feet again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come betveen us, sir. Not half a mile to run. Think you\xe2\x80\x99re vinnin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\ncup, sir. Now for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Mr. Pickwick made the very best use of his legs. It may\r\nbe confidently stated that a pair of black gaiters never got over the\r\nground in better style than did those of Mr. Pickwick on this memorable\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe coach was waiting, the horses were fresh, the roads were good, and\r\nthe driver was willing. The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush\r\nbefore Mr. Pickwick had recovered his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In with you at once, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, as he helped his master out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop a second in the street, arter that \xe2\x80\x98ere exercise. Beg your\r\npardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Sam, touching his hat as Mr. Winkle descended,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98hope there warn\xe2\x80\x99t a priory \xe2\x80\x98tachment, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle grasped his humble friend by the hand, and whispered in his\r\near, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Sam; quite right.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon which Mr. Weller struck\r\nthree distinct blows upon his nose in token of intelligence, smiled,\r\nwinked, and proceeded to put the steps up, with a countenance expressive\r\nof lively satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAs to the scientific gentleman, he demonstrated, in a masterly treatise,\r\nthat these wonderful lights were the effect of electricity; and clearly\r\nproved the same by detailing how a flash of fire danced before his eyes\r\nwhen he put his head out of the gate, and how he received a shock which\r\nstunned him for a quarter of an hour afterwards; which demonstration\r\ndelighted all the scientific associations beyond measure, and caused him\r\nto be considered a light of science ever afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL. INTRODUCES MR. PICKWICK TO A NEW AND NOT UNINTERESTING SCENE\r\nIN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the period which Mr. Pickwick had assigned as the\r\nduration of the stay at Bath passed over without the occurrence of\r\nanything material. Trinity term commenced. On the expiration of its\r\nfirst week, Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to London; and the\r\nformer gentleman, attended of course by Sam, straightway repaired to his\r\nold quarters at the George and Vulture.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning after their arrival, just as all the clocks in the\r\ncity were striking nine individually, and somewhere about nine hundred\r\nand ninety-nine collectively, Sam was taking the air in George Yard,\r\nwhen a queer sort of fresh-painted vehicle drove up, out of which there\r\njumped with great agility, throwing the reins to a stout man who sat\r\nbeside him, a queer sort of gentleman, who seemed made for the vehicle,\r\nand the vehicle for him.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope. It was not\r\nwhat is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a taxed cart,\r\nnor a chaise-cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet; and yet it had something\r\nof the character of each and every of these machines. It was painted a\r\nbright yellow, with the shafts and wheels picked out in black; and the\r\ndriver sat in the orthodox sporting style, on cushions piled about two\r\nfeet above the rail. The horse was a bay, a well-looking animal enough;\r\nbut with something of a flash and dog-fighting air about him,\r\nnevertheless, which accorded both with the vehicle and his master.\r\n\r\nThe master himself was a man of about forty, with black hair, and\r\ncarefully combed whiskers. He was dressed in a particularly gorgeous\r\nmanner, with plenty of articles of jewellery about him--all about three\r\nsizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen--and a rough\r\ngreatcoat to crown the whole. Into one pocket of this greatcoat, he\r\nthrust his left hand the moment he dismounted, while from the other he\r\ndrew forth, with his right, a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief,\r\nwith which he whisked a speck or two of dust from his boots, and then,\r\ncrumpling it in his hand, swaggered up the court.\r\n\r\nIt had not escaped Sam\xe2\x80\x99s attention that, when this person dismounted, a\r\nshabby-looking man in a brown greatcoat shorn of divers buttons, who had\r\nbeen previously slinking about, on the opposite side of the way, crossed\r\nover, and remained stationary close by. Having something more than a\r\nsuspicion of the object of the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s visit, Sam preceded him to\r\nthe George and Vulture, and, turning sharp round, planted himself in the\r\ncentre of the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in the rough coat, in an imperious\r\ntone, attempting at the same time to push his way past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Sir, wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, returning the push with\r\ncompound interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, none of this, my man; this won\xe2\x80\x99t do with me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the owner of\r\nthe rough coat, raising his voice, and turning white. \xe2\x80\x98Here, Smouch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, wot\xe2\x80\x99s amiss here?\xe2\x80\x99 growled the man in the brown coat, who had\r\nbeen gradually sneaking up the court during this short dialogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only some insolence of this young man\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said the principal, giving\r\nSam another push.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, none o\xe2\x80\x99 this gammon,\xe2\x80\x99 growled Smouch, giving him another, and a\r\nharder one.\r\n\r\nThis last push had the effect which it was intended by the experienced\r\nMr. Smouch to produce; for while Sam, anxious to return the compliment,\r\nwas grinding that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s body against the door-post, the principal\r\ncrept past, and made his way to the bar, whither Sam, after bandying a\r\nfew epithetical remarks with Mr. Smouch, followed at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-morning, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the principal, addressing the young lady\r\nat the bar, with Botany Bay ease, and New South Wales gentility; \xe2\x80\x98which\r\nis Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s room, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show him up,\xe2\x80\x99 said the barmaid to a waiter, without deigning another\r\nlook at the exquisite, in reply to his inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe waiter led the way upstairs as he was desired, and the man in the\r\nrough coat followed, with Sam behind him, who, in his progress up the\r\nstaircase, indulged in sundry gestures indicative of supreme contempt\r\nand defiance, to the unspeakable gratification of the servants and other\r\nlookers-on. Mr. Smouch, who was troubled with a hoarse cough, remained\r\nbelow, and expectorated in the passage.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was fast asleep in bed, when his early visitor, followed by\r\nSam, entered the room. The noise they made, in so doing, awoke him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shaving-water, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, from within the curtains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shave you directly, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said the visitor, drawing one of\r\nthem back from the bed\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an execution against you, at\r\nthe suit of Bardell.--Here\xe2\x80\x99s the warrant.--Common Pleas.--Here\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\ncard. I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll come over to my house.\xe2\x80\x99 Giving Mr. Pickwick a\r\nfriendly tap on the shoulder, the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s officer (for such he was)\r\nthrew his card on the counterpane, and pulled a gold toothpick from his\r\nwaistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Namby\xe2\x80\x99s the name,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s deputy, as Mr. Pickwick took his\r\nspectacles from under the pillow, and put them on, to read the card.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Namby, Bell Alley, Coleman Street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this point, Sam Weller, who had had his eyes fixed hitherto on Mr.\r\nNamby\xe2\x80\x99s shining beaver, interfered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you a Quaker?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know I am, before I\xe2\x80\x99ve done with you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the\r\nindignant officer. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you manners, my fine fellow, one of these\r\nfine mornings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same to you. Take your hat off.\xe2\x80\x99 With\r\nthis, Mr. Weller, in the most dexterous manner, knocked Mr. Namby\xe2\x80\x99s hat\r\nto the other side of the room, with such violence, that he had very\r\nnearly caused him to swallow the gold toothpick into the bargain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Observe this, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said the disconcerted officer, gasping for\r\nbreath. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been assaulted in the execution of my dooty by your\r\nservant in your chamber. I\xe2\x80\x99m in bodily fear. I call you to witness\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t witness nothin\xe2\x80\x99, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Shut your eyes up tight,\r\nSir. I\xe2\x80\x99d pitch him out o\xe2\x80\x99 winder, only he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fall far enough,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98cause o\xe2\x80\x99 the leads outside.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, in an angry voice, as his attendant made\r\nvarious demonstrations of hostilities, \xe2\x80\x98if you say another word, or\r\noffer the slightest interference with this person, I discharge you that\r\ninstant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Take that hat up again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut this Sam flatly and positively refused to do; and, after he had been\r\nseverely reprimanded by his master, the officer, being in a hurry,\r\ncondescended to pick it up himself, venting a great variety of threats\r\nagainst Sam meanwhile, which that gentleman received with perfect\r\ncomposure, merely observing that if Mr. Namby would have the goodness to\r\nput his hat on again, he would knock it into the latter end of next\r\nweek. Mr. Namby, perhaps thinking that such a process might be\r\nproductive of inconvenience to himself, declined to offer the\r\ntemptation, and, soon after, called up Smouch. Having informed him that\r\nthe capture was made, and that he was to wait for the prisoner until he\r\nshould have finished dressing, Namby then swaggered out, and drove away.\r\nSmouch, requesting Mr. Pickwick in a surly manner \xe2\x80\x98to be as alive as he\r\ncould, for it was a busy time,\xe2\x80\x99 drew up a chair by the door and sat\r\nthere, until he had finished dressing. Sam was then despatched for a\r\nhackney-coach, and in it the triumvirate proceeded to Coleman Street. It\r\nwas fortunate the distance was short; for Mr. Smouch, besides possessing\r\nno very enchanting conversational powers, was rendered a decidedly\r\nunpleasant companion in a limited space, by the physical weakness to\r\nwhich we have elsewhere adverted.\r\n\r\nThe coach having turned into a very narrow and dark street, stopped\r\nbefore a house with iron bars to all the windows; the door-posts of\r\nwhich were graced by the name and title of \xe2\x80\x98Namby, Officer to the\r\nSheriffs of London\xe2\x80\x99; the inner gate having been opened by a gentleman\r\nwho might have passed for a neglected twin-brother of Mr. Smouch, and\r\nwho was endowed with a large key for the purpose, Mr. Pickwick was shown\r\ninto the \xe2\x80\x98coffee-room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis coffee-room was a front parlour, the principal features of which\r\nwere fresh sand and stale tobacco smoke. Mr. Pickwick bowed to the three\r\npersons who were seated in it when he entered; and having despatched Sam\r\nfor Perker, withdrew into an obscure corner, and looked thence with some\r\ncuriosity upon his new companions.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a mere boy of nineteen or twenty, who, though it was\r\nyet barely ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, was drinking gin-and-water, and smoking a cigar-\r\n-amusements to which, judging from his inflamed countenance, he had\r\ndevoted himself pretty constantly for the last year or two of his life.\r\nOpposite him, engaged in stirring the fire with the toe of his right\r\nboot, was a coarse, vulgar young man of about thirty, with a sallow face\r\nand harsh voice; evidently possessed of that knowledge of the world, and\r\ncaptivating freedom of manner, which is to be acquired in public-house\r\nparlours, and at low billiard tables. The third tenant of the apartment\r\nwas a middle-aged man in a very old suit of black, who looked pale and\r\nhaggard, and paced up and down the room incessantly; stopping, now and\r\nthen, to look with great anxiety out of the window as if he expected\r\nsomebody, and then resuming his walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better have the loan of my razor this morning, Mr. Ayresleigh,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the man who was stirring the fire, tipping the wink to his friend\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, no, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t want it; I expect I shall be out, in the course\r\nof an hour or so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other in a hurried manner. Then, walking\r\nagain up to the window, and once more returning disappointed, he sighed\r\ndeeply, and left the room; upon which the other two burst into a loud\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I never saw such a game as that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman who had\r\noffered the razor, whose name appeared to be Price. \xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Price\r\nconfirmed the assertion with an oath, and then laughed again, when of\r\ncourse the boy (who thought his companion one of the most dashing\r\nfellows alive) laughed also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d hardly think, would you now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Price, turning towards Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that that chap\xe2\x80\x99s been here a week yesterday, and never once\r\nshaved himself yet, because he feels so certain he\xe2\x80\x99s going out in half\r\nan hour\xe2\x80\x99s time, thinks he may as well put it off till he gets home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor man!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Are his chances of getting out of his\r\ndifficulties really so great?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chances be d----d,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Price; \xe2\x80\x98he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t half the ghost of one. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give _that _for his chance of walking about the streets this\r\ntime ten years.\xe2\x80\x99 With this, Mr. Price snapped his fingers\r\ncontemptuously, and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me a sheet of paper, Crookey,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Price to the attendant,\r\nwho in dress and general appearance looked something between a bankrupt\r\nglazier, and a drover in a state of insolvency; \xe2\x80\x98and a glass of brandy-\r\nand-water, Crookey, d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to write to my father, and I\r\nmust have a stimulant, or I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able to pitch it strong enough\r\ninto the old boy.\xe2\x80\x99 At this facetious speech, the young boy, it is almost\r\nneedless to say, was fairly convulsed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Price. \xe2\x80\x98Never say die. All fun, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prime!\xe2\x80\x99 said the young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve got some spirit about you, you have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Price. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nsomething of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rather think I have!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy. He had looked at it through\r\nthe dirty panes of glass in a bar door.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue, as well\r\nas with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried\r\non, was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a\r\nprivate sitting-room, when two or three strangers of genteel appearance\r\nentered, at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire, and\r\nwhispering to Mr. Price that they had come to \xe2\x80\x98make it all right\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nhim, joined them at a table in the farther end of the room.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that matters were not going to be made all\r\nright quite so speedily as the young gentleman anticipated; for a very\r\nlong conversation ensued, of which Mr. Pickwick could not avoid hearing\r\ncertain angry fragments regarding dissolute conduct, and repeated\r\nforgiveness. At last, there were very distinct allusions made by the\r\noldest gentleman of the party to one Whitecross Street, at which the\r\nyoung gentleman, notwithstanding his primeness and his spirit, and his\r\nknowledge of life into the bargain, reclined his head upon the table,\r\nand howled dismally.\r\n\r\nVery much satisfied with this sudden bringing down of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvalour, and this effectual lowering of his tone, Mr. Pickwick rang the\r\nbell, and was shown, at his own request, into a private room furnished\r\nwith a carpet, table, chairs, sideboard and sofa, and ornamented with a\r\nlooking-glass, and various old prints. Here he had the advantage of\r\nhearing Mrs. Namby\xe2\x80\x99s performance on a square piano overhead, while the\r\nbreakfast was getting ready; when it came, Mr. Perker came too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, \xe2\x80\x98nailed at last, eh? Come,\r\ncome, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sorry for it either, because now you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the absurdity\r\nof this conduct. I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted down the amount of the taxed costs and\r\ndamages for which the ca-sa was issued, and we had better settle at once\r\nand lose no time. Namby is come home by this time, I dare say. What say\r\nyou, my dear sir? Shall I draw a cheque, or will you?\xe2\x80\x99 The little man\r\nrubbed his hands with affected cheerfulness as he said this, but\r\nglancing at Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, could not forbear at the same\r\ntime casting a desponding look towards Sam Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98let me hear no more of this, I beg. I see\r\nno advantage in staying here, so I shall go to prison to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t go to Whitecross Street, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible! There are sixty beds in a ward; and the bolt\xe2\x80\x99s on, sixteen\r\nhours out of the four-and-twenty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather go to some other place of confinement if I can,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98If not, I must make the best I can of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can go to the Fleet, my dear Sir, if you\xe2\x80\x99re determined to go\r\nsomewhere,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go there directly I have finished\r\nmy breakfast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop, my dear Sir; not the least occasion for being in such a\r\nviolent hurry to get into a place that most other men are as eager to\r\nget out of,\xe2\x80\x99 said the good-natured little attorney. \xe2\x80\x98We must have a\r\nhabeas-corpus. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be no judge at chambers till four o\xe2\x80\x99clock this\r\nafternoon. You must wait till then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with unmoved patience. \xe2\x80\x98Then we will\r\nhave a chop here, at two. See about it, Sam, and tell them to be\r\npunctual.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick remaining firm, despite all the remonstrances and arguments\r\nof Perker, the chops appeared and disappeared in due course; he was then\r\nput into another hackney coach, and carried off to Chancery Lane, after\r\nwaiting half an hour or so for Mr. Namby, who had a select dinner-party\r\nand could on no account be disturbed before.\r\n\r\nThere were two judges in attendance at Serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s Inn--one King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench,\r\nand one Common Pleas--and a great deal of business appeared to be\r\ntransacting before them, if the number of lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerks who were\r\nhurrying in and out with bundles of papers, afforded any test. When they\r\nreached the low archway which forms the entrance to the inn, Perker was\r\ndetained a few moments parlaying with the coachman about the fare and\r\nthe change; and Mr. Pickwick, stepping to one side to be out of the way\r\nof the stream of people that were pouring in and out, looked about him\r\nwith some curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe people that attracted his attention most, were three or four men of\r\nshabby-genteel appearance, who touched their hats to many of the\r\nattorneys who passed, and seemed to have some business there, the nature\r\nof which Mr. Pickwick could not divine. They were curious-looking\r\nfellows. One was a slim and rather lame man in rusty black, and a white\r\nneckerchief; another was a stout, burly person, dressed in the same\r\napparel, with a great reddish-black cloth round his neck; a third was a\r\nlittle weazen, drunken-looking body, with a pimply face. They were\r\nloitering about, with their hands behind them, and now and then with an\r\nanxious countenance whispered something in the ear of some of the\r\ngentlemen with papers, as they hurried by. Mr. Pickwick remembered to\r\nhave very often observed them lounging under the archway when he had\r\nbeen walking past; and his curiosity was quite excited to know to what\r\nbranch of the profession these dingy-looking loungers could possibly\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nHe was about to propound the question to Namby, who kept close beside\r\nhim, sucking a large gold ring on his little finger, when Perker bustled\r\nup, and observing that there was no time to lose, led the way into the\r\ninn. As Mr. Pickwick followed, the lame man stepped up to him, and\r\ncivilly touching his hat, held out a written card, which Mr. Pickwick,\r\nnot wishing to hurt the man\xe2\x80\x99s feelings by refusing, courteously accepted\r\nand deposited in his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, turning round before he entered one of the offices,\r\nto see that his companions were close behind him. \xe2\x80\x98In here, my dear sir.\r\nHallo, what do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis last question was addressed to the lame man, who, unobserved by Mr.\r\nPickwick, made one of the party. In reply to it, the lame man touched\r\nhis hat again, with all imaginable politeness, and motioned towards Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t want you, my dear friend,\r\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t want you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lame man. \xe2\x80\x98The gentleman took my\r\ncard. I hope you will employ me, sir. The gentleman nodded to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe judged by the gentleman himself. You nodded to me, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh, nonsense. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t nod to anybody, Pickwick? A mistake, a\r\nmistake,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gentleman handed me his card,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, producing it\r\nfrom his waistcoat pocket. \xe2\x80\x98I accepted it, as the gentleman seemed to\r\nwish it--in fact I had some curiosity to look at it when I should be at\r\nleisure. I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little attorney burst into a loud laugh, and returning the card to\r\nthe lame man, informing him it was all a mistake, whispered to Mr.\r\nPickwick as the man turned away in dudgeon, that he was only a bail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A what!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A bail,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A bail!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes, my dear sir--half a dozen of \xe2\x80\x98em here. Bail you to any amount, and\r\nonly charge half a crown. Curious trade, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker,\r\nregaling himself with a pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Am I to understand that these men earn a livelihood by waiting\r\nabout here, to perjure themselves before the judges of the land, at the\r\nrate of half a crown a crime?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, quite aghast at\r\nthe disclosure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know about perjury, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the\r\nlittle gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Harsh word, my dear sir, very harsh word indeed. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na legal fiction, my dear sir, nothing more.\xe2\x80\x99 Saying which, the attorney\r\nshrugged his shoulders, smiled, took a second pinch of snuff, and led\r\nthe way into the office of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s clerk.\r\n\r\nThis was a room of specially dirty appearance, with a very low ceiling\r\nand old panelled walls; and so badly lighted, that although it was broad\r\nday outside, great tallow candles were burning on the desks. At one end,\r\nwas a door leading to the judge\xe2\x80\x99s private apartment, round which were\r\ncongregated a crowd of attorneys and managing clerks, who were called\r\nin, in the order in which their respective appointments stood upon the\r\nfile. Every time this door was opened to let a party out, the next party\r\nmade a violent rush to get in; and, as in addition to the numerous\r\ndialogues which passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the\r\njudge, a variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part\r\nof those who had seen him, there was as much noise as could well be\r\nraised in an apartment of such confined dimensions.\r\n\r\nNor were the conversations of these gentlemen the only sounds that broke\r\nupon the ear. Standing on a box behind a wooden bar at another end of\r\nthe room was a clerk in spectacles who was \xe2\x80\x98taking the affidavits\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nlarge batches of which were, from time to time, carried into the private\r\nroom by another clerk for the judge\xe2\x80\x99s signature. There were a large\r\nnumber of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 clerks to be sworn, and it being a moral\r\nimpossibility to swear them all at once, the struggles of these\r\ngentlemen to reach the clerk in spectacles, were like those of a crowd\r\nto get in at the pit door of a theatre when Gracious Majesty honours it\r\nwith its presence. Another functionary, from time to time, exercised his\r\nlungs in calling over the names of those who had been sworn, for the\r\npurpose of restoring to them their affidavits after they had been signed\r\nby the judge, which gave rise to a few more scuffles; and all these\r\nthings going on at the same time, occasioned as much bustle as the most\r\nactive and excitable person could desire to behold. There were yet\r\nanother class of persons--those who were waiting to attend summonses\r\ntheir employers had taken out, which it was optional to the attorney on\r\nthe opposite side to attend or not--and whose business it was, from time\r\nto time, to cry out the opposite attorney\xe2\x80\x99s name; to make certain that\r\nhe was not in attendance without their knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor example. Leaning against the wall, close beside the seat Mr.\r\nPickwick had taken, was an office-lad of fourteen, with a tenor voice;\r\nnear him a common-law clerk with a bass one.\r\n\r\nA clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers, and stared about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sniggle and Blink,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the tenor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Porkin and Snob,\xe2\x80\x99 growled the bass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stumpy and Deacon,\xe2\x80\x99 said the new-comer.\r\n\r\nNobody answered; the next man who came in, was bailed by the whole\r\nthree; and he in his turn shouted for another firm; and then somebody\r\nelse roared in a loud voice for another; and so forth.\r\n\r\nAll this time, the man in the spectacles was hard at work, swearing the\r\nclerks; the oath being invariably administered, without any effort at\r\npunctuation, and usually in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take the book in your right hand this is your name and hand-writing you\r\nswear that the contents of this your affidavit are true so help you God\r\na shilling you must get change I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose they are getting the _Habeas-\r\ncorpus_ ready?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and I vish they\xe2\x80\x99d bring out the have-his-carcase. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwery unpleasant keepin\xe2\x80\x99 us vaitin\xe2\x80\x99 here. I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 got half a dozen have-\r\nhis-carcases ready, pack\xe2\x80\x99d up and all, by this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat sort of cumbrous and unmanageable machine, Sam Weller imagined a\r\nhabeas-corpus to be, does not appear; for Perker, at that moment, walked\r\nup and took Mr. Pickwick away.\r\n\r\nThe usual forms having been gone through, the body of Samuel Pickwick\r\nwas soon afterwards confided to the custody of the tipstaff, to be by\r\nhim taken to the warden of the Fleet Prison, and there detained until\r\nthe amount of the damages and costs in the action of Bardell against\r\nPickwick was fully paid and satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98will be a very long time. Sam,\r\ncall another hackney-coach. Perker, my dear friend, good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall go with you, and see you safe there,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I would rather go without any other\r\nattendant than Sam. As soon as I get settled, I will write and let you\r\nknow, and I shall expect you immediately. Until then, good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick said this, he got into the coach which had by this time\r\narrived, followed by the tipstaff. Sam having stationed himself on the\r\nbox, it rolled away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A most extraordinary man that!\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, as he stopped to pull on\r\nhis gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a bankrupt he\xe2\x80\x99d make, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Lowten, who was standing\r\nnear. \xe2\x80\x98How he would bother the commissioners! He\xe2\x80\x99d set \xe2\x80\x98em at defiance\r\nif they talked of committing him, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe attorney did not appear very much delighted with his clerk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofessional estimate of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s character, for he walked away\r\nwithout deigning any reply.\r\n\r\nThe hackney-coach jolted along Fleet Street, as hackney-coaches usually\r\ndo. The horses \xe2\x80\x98went better\xe2\x80\x99, the driver said, when they had anything\r\nbefore them (they must have gone at a most extraordinary pace when there\r\nwas nothing), and so the vehicle kept behind a cart; when the cart\r\nstopped, it stopped; and when the cart went on again, it did the same.\r\nMr. Pickwick sat opposite the tipstaff; and the tipstaff sat with his\r\nhat between his knees, whistling a tune, and looking out of the coach\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nTime performs wonders. By the powerful old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s aid, even a\r\nhackney-coach gets over half a mile of ground. They stopped at length,\r\nand Mr. Pickwick alighted at the gate of the Fleet.\r\n\r\nThe tipstaff, just looking over his shoulder to see that his charge was\r\nfollowing close at his heels, preceded Mr. Pickwick into the prison;\r\nturning to the left, after they had entered, they passed through an open\r\ndoor into a lobby, from which a heavy gate, opposite to that by which\r\nthey had entered, and which was guarded by a stout turnkey with the key\r\nin his hand, led at once into the interior of the prison.\r\n\r\nHere they stopped, while the tipstaff delivered his papers; and here Mr.\r\nPickwick was apprised that he would remain, until he had undergone the\r\nceremony, known to the initiated as \xe2\x80\x98sitting for your portrait.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sitting for my portrait?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having your likeness taken, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stout turnkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re capital hands at likenesses here. Take \xe2\x80\x98em in no time, and always\r\nexact. Walk in, sir, and make yourself at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick complied with the invitation, and sat himself down; when\r\nMr. Weller, who stationed himself at the back of the chair, whispered\r\nthat the sitting was merely another term for undergoing an inspection by\r\nthe different turnkeys, in order that they might know prisoners from\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98then I wish the artists would come.\r\nThis is rather a public place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They von\xe2\x80\x99t be long, Sir, I des-say,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a Dutch\r\nclock, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I see,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a bird-cage, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Veels vithin veels, a prison in a\r\nprison. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller made this philosophical remark, Mr. Pickwick was aware\r\nthat his sitting had commenced. The stout turnkey having been relieved\r\nfrom the lock, sat down, and looked at him carelessly, from time to\r\ntime, while a long thin man who had relieved him, thrust his hands\r\nbeneath his coat tails, and planting himself opposite, took a good long\r\nview of him. A third rather surly-looking gentleman, who had apparently\r\nbeen disturbed at his tea, for he was disposing of the last remnant of a\r\ncrust and butter when he came in, stationed himself close to Mr.\r\nPickwick; and, resting his hands on his hips, inspected him narrowly;\r\nwhile two others mixed with the group, and studied his features with\r\nmost intent and thoughtful faces. Mr. Pickwick winced a good deal under\r\nthe operation, and appeared to sit very uneasily in his chair; but he\r\nmade no remark to anybody while it was being performed, not even to Sam,\r\nwho reclined upon the back of the chair, reflecting, partly on the\r\nsituation of his master, and partly on the great satisfaction it would\r\nhave afforded him to make a fierce assault upon all the turnkeys there\r\nassembled, one after the other, if it were lawful and peaceable so to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nAt length the likeness was completed, and Mr. Pickwick was informed that\r\nhe might now proceed into the prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where am I to sleep to-night?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know about to-night,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the stout turnkey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll be chummed on somebody to-morrow, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be all snug\r\nand comfortable. The first night\xe2\x80\x99s generally rather unsettled, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be set all squares to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, it was discovered that one of the turnkeys had a\r\nbed to let, which Mr. Pickwick could have for that night. He gladly\r\nagreed to hire it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99ll come with me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show it you at once,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a large \xe2\x80\x98un; but it\xe2\x80\x99s an out-and-outer to sleep in. This way,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey passed through the inner gate, and descended a short flight of\r\nsteps. The key was turned after them; and Mr. Pickwick found himself,\r\nfor the first time in his life, within the walls of a debtors\xe2\x80\x99 prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI. WHAT BEFELL MR. PICKWICK WHEN HE GOT INTO THE FLEET; WHAT\r\nPRISONERS HE SAW THERE, AND HOW HE PASSED THE NIGHT\r\n\r\nMr. Tom Roker, the gentleman who had accompanied Mr. Pickwick into the\r\nprison, turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of the\r\nlittle flight of steps, and led the way, through an iron gate which\r\nstood open, and up another short flight of steps, into a long narrow\r\ngallery, dirty and low, paved with stone, and very dimly lighted by a\r\nwindow at each remote end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and\r\nlooking carelessly over his shoulder to Mr. Pickwick--\xe2\x80\x98this here is the\r\nhall flight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, looking down a dark and filthy staircase,\r\nwhich appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults,\r\nbeneath the ground, \xe2\x80\x98and those, I suppose, are the little cellars where\r\nthe prisoners keep their small quantities of coals. Unpleasant places to\r\nhave to go down to; but very convenient, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if they was convenient,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the gentleman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98seeing that a few people live there, pretty snug. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Fair, that\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t really mean to say that human\r\nbeings live down in those wretched dungeons?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Roker, with indignant astonishment; \xe2\x80\x98why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Live!--live down there!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Live down there! Yes, and die down there, too, very often!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nRoker; \xe2\x80\x98and what of that? Who\xe2\x80\x99s got to say anything agin it? Live down\r\nthere! Yes, and a wery good place it is to live in, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr. Pickwick in saying this, and\r\nmoreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations\r\nconcerning his own eyes, limbs, and circulating fluids, the latter\r\ngentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further. Mr.\r\nRoker then proceeded to mount another staircase, as dirty as that which\r\nled to the place which has just been the subject of discussion, in which\r\nascent he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, pausing for breath when they reached another\r\ngallery of the same dimensions as the one below, \xe2\x80\x98this is the coffee-\r\nroom flight; the one above\xe2\x80\x99s the third, and the one above that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ntop; and the room where you\xe2\x80\x99re a-going to sleep to-night is the warden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, and it\xe2\x80\x99s this way--come on.\xe2\x80\x99 Having said all this in a breath, Mr.\r\nRoker mounted another flight of stairs with Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller\r\nfollowing at his heels.\r\n\r\nThese staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some\r\nlittle distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area\r\nbounded by a high brick wall, with iron _chevaux-de-frise_ at the top.\r\nThis area, it appeared from Mr. Roker\xe2\x80\x99s statement, was the racket-\r\nground; and it further appeared, on the testimony of the same gentleman,\r\nthat there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was\r\nnearest Farringdon Street, denominated and called \xe2\x80\x98the Painted Ground,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfrom the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblance of\r\nvarious men-of-war in full sail, and other artistical effects achieved\r\nin bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours.\r\n\r\nHaving communicated this piece of information, apparently more for the\r\npurpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact, than with any\r\nspecific view of enlightening Mr. Pickwick, the guide, having at length\r\nreached another gallery, led the way into a small passage at the extreme\r\nend, opened a door, and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no\r\nmeans inviting, containing eight or nine iron bedsteads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, holding the door open, and looking triumphantly\r\nround at Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a room!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s face, however, betokened such a very trifling portion of\r\nsatisfaction at the appearance of his lodging, that Mr. Roker looked,\r\nfor a reciprocity of feeling, into the countenance of Samuel Weller,\r\nwho, until now, had observed a dignified silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a room, young man,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Roker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think to find such a room as this in the Farringdon Hotel,\r\nwould you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, with a complacent smile.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one\r\neye; which might be considered to mean, either that he would have\r\nthought it, or that he would not have thought it, or that he had never\r\nthought anything at all about it, as the observer\xe2\x80\x99s imagination\r\nsuggested. Having executed this feat, and reopened his eye, Mr. Weller\r\nproceeded to inquire which was the individual bedstead that Mr. Roker\r\nhad so flatteringly described as an out-and-outer to sleep in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Roker, pointing to a very rusty one in a\r\ncorner. \xe2\x80\x98It would make any one go to sleep, that bedstead would, whether\r\nthey wanted to or not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, eyeing the piece of furniture in question\r\nwith a look of excessive disgust--\xe2\x80\x98I should think poppies was nothing to\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I s\xe2\x80\x99pose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with a sidelong glance at his master, as if to\r\nsee whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken by\r\nwhat passed, \xe2\x80\x98I s\xe2\x80\x99pose the other gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men as sleeps here _are\r\n_gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing but it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker. \xe2\x80\x98One of \xe2\x80\x98em takes his twelve pints of\r\nale a day, and never leaves off smoking even at his meals.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must be a first-rater,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A1,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Roker.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, even by this intelligence, Mr. Pickwick smilingly\r\nannounced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead\r\nfor that night; and Mr. Roker, after informing him that he could retire\r\nto rest at whatever hour he thought proper, without any further notice\r\nor formality, walked off, leaving him standing with Sam in the gallery.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dark; that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled in this\r\nplace which was never light, by way of compliment to the evening, which\r\nhad set in outside. As it was rather warm, some of the tenants of the\r\nnumerous little rooms which opened into the gallery on either hand, had\r\nset their doors ajar. Mr. Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along,\r\nwith great curiosity and interest. Here, four or five great hulking\r\nfellows, just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke, were engaged in\r\nnoisy and riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or\r\nplaying at all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards. In the adjoining\r\nroom, some solitary tenant might be seen poring, by the light of a\r\nfeeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers,\r\nyellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the\r\nhundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for the\r\nperusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or whose\r\nheart it would never touch. In a third, a man, with his wife and a whole\r\ncrowd of children, might be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground,\r\nor upon a few chairs, for the younger ones to pass the night in. And in\r\na fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, the noise, and the\r\nbeer, and the tobacco smoke, and the cards, all came over again in\r\ngreater force than before.\r\n\r\nIn the galleries themselves, and more especially on the stair-cases,\r\nthere lingered a great number of people, who came there, some because\r\ntheir rooms were empty and lonesome, others because their rooms were\r\nfull and hot; the greater part because they were restless and\r\nuncomfortable, and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what\r\nto do with themselves. There were many classes of people here, from the\r\nlabouring man in his fustian jacket, to the broken-down spendthrift in\r\nhis shawl dressing-gown, most appropriately out at elbows; but there was\r\nthe same air about them all--a kind of listless, jail-bird, careless\r\nswagger, a vagabondish who\xe2\x80\x99s-afraid sort of bearing, which is wholly\r\nindescribable in words, but which any man can understand in one moment\r\nif he wish, by setting foot in the nearest debtors\xe2\x80\x99 prison, and looking\r\nat the very first group of people he sees there, with the same interest\r\nas Mr. Pickwick did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It strikes me, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, leaning over the iron rail at\r\nthe stair-head, \xe2\x80\x98it strikes me, Sam, that imprisonment for debt is\r\nscarcely any punishment at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think not, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see how these fellows drink, and smoke, and roar,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nPickwick. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s quite impossible that they can mind it much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the wery thing, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam, \xe2\x80\x98they don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nit; it\xe2\x80\x99s a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar holiday to them--all porter and skittles. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing; them down-\r\nhearted fellers as can\xe2\x80\x99t svig avay at the beer, nor play at skittles\r\nneither; them as vould pay if they could, and gets low by being boxed\r\nup. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you wot it is, sir; them as is always a-idlin\xe2\x80\x99 in public-\r\nhouses it don\xe2\x80\x99t damage at all, and them as is alvays a-workin\xe2\x80\x99 wen they\r\ncan, it damages too much. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unekal,\xe2\x80\x9d as my father used to say wen\r\nhis grog worn\xe2\x80\x99t made half-and-half: \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s unekal, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the fault\r\non it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreflection, \xe2\x80\x98quite right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98P\xe2\x80\x99raps, now and then, there\xe2\x80\x99s some honest people as likes it,\xe2\x80\x99 observed\r\nMr. Weller, in a ruminative tone, \xe2\x80\x98but I never heerd o\xe2\x80\x99 one as I can\r\ncall to mind, \xe2\x80\x98cept the little dirty-faced man in the brown coat; and\r\nthat was force of habit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And who was he?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the wery point as nobody never know\xe2\x80\x99d,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what did he do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, he did wot many men as has been much better know\xe2\x80\x99d has done in\r\ntheir time, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98he run a match agin the constable, and\r\nvun it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In other words, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98he got into debt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just that, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and in course o\xe2\x80\x99 time he come here in\r\nconsekens. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t much--execution for nine pound nothin\xe2\x80\x99, multiplied\r\nby five for costs; but hows\xe2\x80\x99ever here he stopped for seventeen year. If\r\nhe got any wrinkles in his face, they were stopped up vith the dirt, for\r\nboth the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the end o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat time as they wos at the beginnin\xe2\x80\x99. He wos a wery peaceful,\r\ninoffendin\xe2\x80\x99 little creetur, and wos alvays a-bustlin\xe2\x80\x99 about for\r\nsomebody, or playin\xe2\x80\x99 rackets and never vinnin\xe2\x80\x99; till at last the\r\nturnkeys they got quite fond on him, and he wos in the lodge ev\xe2\x80\x99ry\r\nnight, a-chattering vith \xe2\x80\x98em, and tellin\xe2\x80\x99 stories, and all that \xe2\x80\x98ere.\r\nVun night he wos in there as usual, along vith a wery old friend of his,\r\nas wos on the lock, ven he says all of a sudden, \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t seen the\r\nmarket outside, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d he says (Fleet Market wos there at that time)--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t seen the market outside, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cfor seventeen year.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow you ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d says the turnkey, smoking his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to\r\nsee it for a minit, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWery probable,\xe2\x80\x9d says the turnkey,\r\nsmoking his pipe wery fierce, and making believe he warn\xe2\x80\x99t up to wot the\r\nlittle man wanted. \xe2\x80\x9cBill,\xe2\x80\x9d says the little man, more abrupt than afore,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the fancy in my head. Let me see the public streets once more\r\nafore I die; and if I ain\xe2\x80\x99t struck with apoplexy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in five\r\nminits by the clock.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd wot \xe2\x80\x98ud become o\xe2\x80\x99 me if you _wos _struck with\r\napoplexy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey. \xe2\x80\x9cWy,\xe2\x80\x9d says the little creetur, \xe2\x80\x9cwhoever\r\nfound me, \xe2\x80\x98ud bring me home, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my card in my pocket, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. 20, Coffee-room Flight\xe2\x80\x9d: and that wos true, sure enough,\r\nfor wen he wanted to make the acquaintance of any new-comer, he used to\r\npull out a little limp card vith them words on it and nothin\xe2\x80\x99 else; in\r\nconsideration of vich, he vos alvays called Number Tventy. The turnkey\r\ntakes a fixed look at him, and at last he says in a solemn manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTventy,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll trust you; you Won\xe2\x80\x99t get your old friend into\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy; I hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve somethin\xe2\x80\x99 better behind here,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nthe little man; and as he said it he hit his little vesket wery hard,\r\nand then a tear started out o\xe2\x80\x99 each eye, which wos wery extraordinary,\r\nfor it wos supposed as water never touched his face. He shook the\r\nturnkey by the hand; out he vent--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And never came back again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wrong for vunce, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98for back he come, two\r\nminits afore the time, a-bilin\xe2\x80\x99 with rage, sayin\xe2\x80\x99 how he\xe2\x80\x99d been nearly\r\nrun over by a hackney-coach that he warn\xe2\x80\x99t used to it; and he was blowed\r\nif he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write to the lord mayor. They got him pacified at last;\r\nand for five years arter that, he never even so much as peeped out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe lodge gate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the expiration of that time he died, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98He got a curiosity to go and taste\r\nthe beer at a new public-house over the way, and it wos such a wery nice\r\nparlour, that he took it into his head to go there every night, which he\r\ndid for a long time, always comin\xe2\x80\x99 back reg\xe2\x80\x99lar about a quarter of an\r\nhour afore the gate shut, which was all wery snug and comfortable. At\r\nlast he began to get so precious jolly, that he used to forget how the\r\ntime vent, or care nothin\xe2\x80\x99 at all about it, and he went on gettin\xe2\x80\x99 later\r\nand later, till vun night his old friend wos just a-shuttin\xe2\x80\x99 the gate--\r\nhad turned the key in fact--wen he come up. \xe2\x80\x9cHold hard, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you come home yet, Tventy?\xe2\x80\x9d says the turnkey, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\r\nwos in, long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d says the little man, with a smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you wot it is, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d says the turnkey,\r\nopenin\xe2\x80\x99 the gate wery slow and sulky, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my \xe2\x80\x98pinion as you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\ninto bad company o\xe2\x80\x99 late, which I\xe2\x80\x99m wery sorry to see. Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto do nothing harsh,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you can\xe2\x80\x99t confine yourself to\r\nsteady circles, and find your vay back at reg\xe2\x80\x99lar hours, as sure as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a-standin\xe2\x80\x99 there, I\xe2\x80\x99ll shut you out altogether!\xe2\x80\x9d The little man\r\nwas seized vith a wiolent fit o\xe2\x80\x99 tremblin\xe2\x80\x99, and never vent outside the\r\nprison walls artervards!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Sam concluded, Mr. Pickwick slowly retraced his steps downstairs.\r\nAfter a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which, as it was now\r\ndark, was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr. Weller that he thought it\r\nhigh time for him to withdraw for the night; requesting him to seek a\r\nbed in some adjacent public-house, and return early in the morning, to\r\nmake arrangements for the removal of his master\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe from the\r\nGeorge and Vulture. This request Mr. Samuel Weller prepared to obey,\r\nwith as good a grace as he could assume, but with a very considerable\r\nshow of reluctance nevertheless. He even went so far as to essay sundry\r\nineffectual hints regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the\r\ngravel for that night; but finding Mr. Pickwick obstinately deaf to any\r\nsuch suggestions, finally withdrew.\r\n\r\nThere is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited\r\nand uncomfortable--not for lack of society, for the prison was very\r\nfull, and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good-\r\nfellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony of\r\nintroduction; but he was alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt the\r\ndepression of spirits and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on the\r\nreflection that he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of\r\nliberation. As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the\r\nsharpness of Dodson & Fogg, it never for an instant entered his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room gallery, and\r\nwalked slowly to and fro. The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell\r\nof tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating. There was a perpetual slamming\r\nand banging of doors as the people went in and out; and the noise of\r\ntheir voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through the passages\r\nconstantly. A young woman, with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely\r\nable to crawl, from emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the\r\npassage in conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see\r\nher in. As they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female sob\r\nbitterly; and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was\r\ncompelled to lean against the wall for support, while the man took the\r\nchild in his arms, and tried to soothe her.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s heart was really too full to bear it, and he went\r\nupstairs to bed.\r\n\r\nNow, although the warder\xe2\x80\x99s room was a very uncomfortable one (being, in\r\nevery point of decoration and convenience, several hundred degrees\r\ninferior to the common infirmary of a county jail), it had at present\r\nthe merit of being wholly deserted save by Mr. Pickwick himself. So, he\r\nsat down at the foot of his little iron bedstead, and began to wonder\r\nhow much a year the warder made out of the dirty room. Having satisfied\r\nhimself, by mathematical calculation, that the apartment was about equal\r\nin annual value to the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of\r\nLondon, he took to wondering what possible temptation could have induced\r\na dingy-looking fly that was crawling over his pantaloons, to come into\r\na close prison, when he had the choice of so many airy situations--a\r\ncourse of meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion that\r\nthe insect was insane. After settling this point, he began to be\r\nconscious that he was getting sleepy; whereupon he took his nightcap out\r\nof the pocket in which he had had the precaution to stow it in the\r\nmorning, and, leisurely undressing himself, got into bed and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo! Heel over toe--cut and shuffle--pay away at it, Zephyr! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsmothered if the opera house isn\xe2\x80\x99t your proper hemisphere. Keep it up!\r\nHooray!\xe2\x80\x99 These expressions, delivered in a most boisterous tone, and\r\naccompanied with loud peals of laughter, roused Mr. Pickwick from one of\r\nthose sound slumbers which, lasting in reality some half-hour, seem to\r\nthe sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month.\r\n\r\nThe voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such\r\nviolence that the windows rattled in their frames, and the bedsteads\r\ntrembled again. Mr. Pickwick started up, and remained for some minutes\r\nfixed in mute astonishment at the scene before him.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the floor of the room, a man in a broad-skirted green coat, with\r\ncorduroy knee-smalls and gray cotton stockings, was performing the most\r\npopular steps of a hornpipe, with a slang and burlesque caricature of\r\ngrace and lightness, which, combined with the very appropriate character\r\nof his costume, was inexpressibly absurd. Another man, evidently very\r\ndrunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions, was\r\nsitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he could recollect of\r\na comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling and\r\nexpression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was\r\napplauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and\r\nencouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused\r\nMr. Pickwick from his sleep.\r\n\r\nThis last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never\r\ncan be seen in full perfection but in such places--they may be met with,\r\nin an imperfect state, occasionally about stable-yards and Public-\r\nhouses; but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot-beds,\r\nwhich would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature\r\nfor the sole purpose of rearing them.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall fellow, with an olive complexion, long dark hair, and very\r\nthick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin. He wore no neckerchief, as\r\nhe had been playing rackets all day, and his open shirt collar displayed\r\ntheir full luxuriance. On his head he wore one of the common\r\neighteenpenny French skull-caps, with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom,\r\nvery happily in keeping with a common fustian coat. His legs, which,\r\nbeing long, were afflicted with weakness, graced a pair of Oxford-\r\nmixture trousers, made to show the full symmetry of those limbs. Being\r\nsomewhat negligently braced, however, and, moreover, but imperfectly\r\nbuttoned, they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a\r\npair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled\r\nwhite stockings. There was a rakish, vagabond smartness, and a kind of\r\nboastful rascality, about the whole man, that was worth a mine of gold.\r\n\r\nThis figure was the first to perceive that Mr. Pickwick was looking on;\r\nupon which he winked to the Zephyr, and entreated him, with mock\r\ngravity, not to wake the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, bless the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s honest heart and soul!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Zephyr,\r\nturning round and affecting the extremity of surprise; \xe2\x80\x98the gentleman is\r\nawake. Hem, Shakespeare! How do you do, Sir? How is Mary and Sarah, sir?\r\nand the dear old lady at home, Sir? Will you have the kindness to put my\r\ncompliments into the first little parcel you\xe2\x80\x99re sending that way, sir,\r\nand say that I would have sent \xe2\x80\x98em before, only I was afraid they might\r\nbe broken in the wagon, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t overwhelm the gentlemen with ordinary civilities when you see\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s anxious to have something to drink,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman with the\r\nwhiskers, with a jocose air. \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask the gentleman what he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, I quite forgot,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other. \xe2\x80\x98What will you take, sir?\r\nWill you take port wine, sir, or sherry wine, sir? I can recommend the\r\nale, sir; or perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like to taste the porter, sir? Allow me to\r\nhave the felicity of hanging up your nightcap, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this, the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s head, and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man,\r\nwho, firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous\r\nassembly, continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most\r\nmelancholy strains imaginable.\r\n\r\nTaking a man\xe2\x80\x99s nightcap from his brow by violent means, and adjusting it\r\non the head of an unknown gentleman, of dirty exterior, however\r\ningenious a witticism in itself, is unquestionably one of those which\r\ncome under the denomination of practical jokes. Viewing the matter\r\nprecisely in this light, Mr. Pickwick, without the slightest intimation\r\nof his purpose, sprang vigorously out of bed, struck the Zephyr so smart\r\na blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the\r\ncommodity which sometimes bears his name, and then, recapturing his\r\nnightcap, boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, gasping no less from excitement than from the\r\nexpenditure of so much energy, \xe2\x80\x98come on--both of you--both of you!\xe2\x80\x99 With\r\nthis liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving\r\nmotion to his clenched fists, by way of appalling his antagonists with a\r\ndisplay of science.\r\n\r\nIt might have been Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s very unexpected gallantry, or it might\r\nhave been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed,\r\nand fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his\r\nadversaries. Touched they were; for, instead of then and there making an\r\nattempt to commit man-slaughter, as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed\r\nthey would have done, they paused, stared at each other a short time,\r\nand finally laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a trump, and I like you all the better for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nZephyr. \xe2\x80\x98Now jump into bed again, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch the rheumatics. No\r\nmalice, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, extending a hand the size of the yellow\r\nclump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with great alacrity; for, now that\r\nthe excitement was over, he began to feel rather cool about the legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Allow me the H-onour,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman with the whiskers, presenting\r\nhis dexter hand, and aspirating the h.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With much pleasure, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; and having executed a very\r\nlong and solemn shake, he got into bed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Smangle, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with the whiskers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mine is Mivins,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man in the stockings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am delighted to hear it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem,\xe2\x80\x99 coughed Mr. Smangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you speak, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I did not, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle.\r\n\r\nAll this was very genteel and pleasant; and, to make matters still more\r\ncomfortable, Mr. Smangle assured Mr. Pickwick a great many more times\r\nthat he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman;\r\nwhich sentiment, indeed, did him infinite credit, as he could be in no\r\nwise supposed to understand them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you going through the court, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Smangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Through the what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Through the court--Portugal Street--the Court for Relief of--you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98No, I am not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Going out, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Mr. Mivins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I refuse to pay some damages, and\r\nam here in consequence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle, \xe2\x80\x98paper has been my ruin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A stationer, I presume, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stationer! No, no; confound and curse me! Not so low as that. No trade.\r\nWhen I say paper, I mean bills.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you use the word in that sense. I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damme! A gentleman must expect reverses,\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle. \xe2\x80\x98What of that?\r\nHere am I in the Fleet Prison. Well; good. What then? I\xe2\x80\x99m none the worse\r\nfor that, am I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Mivins. And he was quite right; for, so far\r\nfrom Mr. Smangle being any the worse for it, he was something the\r\nbetter, inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place, he had attained\r\ngratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery, which, long\r\nbefore that, had found their way to the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; but come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle; \xe2\x80\x98this is dry work. Let\xe2\x80\x99s rinse our\r\nmouths with a drop of burnt sherry; the last-comer shall stand it,\r\nMivins shall fetch it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll help to drink it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a fair and\r\ngentlemanlike division of labour, anyhow. Curse me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUnwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr. Pickwick gladly assented to the\r\nproposition, and consigned the money to Mr. Mivins, who, as it was\r\nnearly eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on\r\nhis errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Smangle, the moment his friend had left the room;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what did you give him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half a sovereign,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle;--\xe2\x80\x98infernal\r\npleasant. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody more so; but--\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Smangle stopped\r\nshort, and shook his head dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any probability of his appropriating the money\r\nto his own use?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no! Mind, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that; I expressly say that he\xe2\x80\x99s a devilish\r\ngentlemanly fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle. \xe2\x80\x98But I think, perhaps, if\r\nsomebody went down, just to see that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t dip his beak into the jug\r\nby accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he\r\ncame upstairs, it would be as well. Here, you sir, just run downstairs,\r\nand look after that gentleman, will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis request was addressed to a little timid-looking, nervous man, whose\r\nappearance bespoke great poverty, and who had been crouching on his\r\nbedstead all this while, apparently stupefied by the novelty of his\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know where the coffee-room is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle; \xe2\x80\x98just run down, and\r\ntell that gentleman you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to help him up with the jug. Or--stop--\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what--I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how we\xe2\x80\x99ll do him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle, with\r\na cunning look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Send down word that he\xe2\x80\x99s to spend the change in cigars. Capital\r\nthought. Run and tell him that; d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear? They shan\xe2\x80\x99t be wasted,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Smangle, turning to Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ smoke \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and, withal, performed\r\nwith such immovable composure and coolness, that Mr. Pickwick would have\r\nhad no wish to disturb it, even if he had had the power. In a short time\r\nMr. Mivins returned, bearing the sherry, which Mr. Smangle dispensed in\r\ntwo little cracked mugs; considerately remarking, with reference to\r\nhimself, that a gentleman must not be particular under such\r\ncircumstances, and that, for his part, he was not too proud to drink out\r\nof the jug. In which, to show his sincerity, he forthwith pledged the\r\ncompany in a draught which half emptied it.\r\n\r\nAn excellent understanding having been by these means promoted, Mr.\r\nSmangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers\r\nromantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged,\r\ninvolving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse, and a\r\nmagnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the\r\nnobility and gentry of these kingdoms.\r\n\r\nLong before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman\r\nwere concluded, Mr. Mivins had betaken himself to bed, and had set in\r\nsnoring for the night, leaving the timid stranger and Mr. Pickwick to\r\nthe full benefit of Mr. Smangle\xe2\x80\x99s experiences.\r\n\r\nNor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have\r\nbeen by the moving passages narrated. Mr. Pickwick had been in a state\r\nof slumber for some time, when he had a faint perception of the drunken\r\nman bursting out afresh with the comic song, and receiving from Mr.\r\nSmangle a gentle intimation, through the medium of the water-jug, that\r\nhis audience was not musically disposed. Mr. Pickwick then once again\r\ndropped off to sleep, with a confused consciousness that Mr. Smangle was\r\nstill engaged in relating a long story, the chief point of which\r\nappeared to be that, on some occasion particularly stated and set forth,\r\nhe had \xe2\x80\x98done\xe2\x80\x99 a bill and a gentleman at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII. ILLUSTRATIVE, LIKE THE PRECEDING ONE, OF THE OLD PROVERB,\r\nTHAT ADVERSITY BRINGS A MAN ACQUAINTED WITH STRANGE BEDFELLOWS--\r\nLIKEWISE CONTAINING MR. PICKWICK\xe2\x80\x99S EXTRAORDINARY AND STARTLING\r\nANNOUNCEMENT TO MR. SAMUEL WELLER\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pickwick opened his eyes next morning, the first object upon\r\nwhich they rested was Samuel Weller, seated upon a small black\r\nportmanteau, intently regarding, apparently in a condition of profound\r\nabstraction, the stately figure of the dashing Mr. Smangle; while Mr.\r\nSmangle himself, who was already partially dressed, was seated on his\r\nbedstead, occupied in the desperately hopeless attempt of staring Mr.\r\nWeller out of countenance. We say desperately hopeless, because Sam,\r\nwith a comprehensive gaze which took in Mr. Smangle\xe2\x80\x99s cap, feet, head,\r\nface, legs, and whiskers, all at the same time, continued to look\r\nsteadily on, with every demonstration of lively satisfaction, but with\r\nno more regard to Mr. Smangle\xe2\x80\x99s personal sentiments on the subject than\r\nhe would have displayed had he been inspecting a wooden statue, or a\r\nstraw-embowelled Guy Fawkes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; will you know me again?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle, with a frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d svear to you anyveres, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be impertinent to a gentleman, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not on no account,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me wen he wakes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe upon the wery best extra-super behaviour!\xe2\x80\x99 This observation, having a\r\nremote tendency to imply that Mr. Smangle was no gentleman, kindled his\r\nire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mivins!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Smangle, with a passionate air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the office?\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman from his couch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who the devil is this fellow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Gad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Mivins, looking lazily out from under the bed-clothes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ought to ask _you _that. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he any business here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Smangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then knock him downstairs, and tell him not to presume to get up till I\r\ncome and kick him,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Mivins; with this prompt advice that\r\nexcellent gentleman again betook himself to slumber.\r\n\r\nThe conversation exhibiting these unequivocal symptoms of verging on the\r\npersonal, Mr. Pickwick deemed it a fit point at which to interpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has anything new occurred since last night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 partickler, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, glancing at Mr. Smangle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhiskers; \xe2\x80\x98the late prewailance of a close and confined atmosphere has\r\nbeen rayther favourable to the growth of veeds, of an alarmin\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nsangvinary natur; but vith that \xe2\x80\x98ere exception things is quiet enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall get up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98give me some clean things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhatever hostile intentions Mr. Smangle might have entertained, his\r\nthoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the portmanteau; the\r\ncontents of which appeared to impress him at once with a most favourable\r\nopinion, not only of Mr. Pickwick, but of Sam also, who, he took an\r\nearly opportunity of declaring in a tone of voice loud enough for that\r\neccentric personage to overhear, was a regular thoroughbred original,\r\nand consequently the very man after his own heart. As to Mr. Pickwick,\r\nthe affection he conceived for him knew no limits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now is there anything I can do for you, my dear Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing that I am aware of, I am obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No linen that you want sent to the washerwoman\xe2\x80\x99s? I know a delightful\r\nwasherwoman outside, that comes for my things twice a week; and, by\r\nJove!--how devilish lucky!--this is the day she calls. Shall I put any\r\nof those little things up with mine? Don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about the\r\ntrouble. Confound and curse it! if one gentleman under a cloud is not to\r\nput himself a little out of the way to assist another gentleman in the\r\nsame condition, what\xe2\x80\x99s human nature?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus spake Mr. Smangle, edging himself meanwhile as near as possible to\r\nthe portmanteau, and beaming forth looks of the most fervent and\r\ndisinterested friendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you want to give out for the man to brush, my dear\r\ncreature, is there?\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Smangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 whatever, my fine feller,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam, taking the reply into\r\nhis own mouth. \xe2\x80\x98P\xe2\x80\x99raps if vun of us wos to brush, without troubling the\r\nman, it \xe2\x80\x98ud be more agreeable for all parties, as the schoolmaster said\r\nwhen the young gentleman objected to being flogged by the butler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can send in my little box to the washer-woman\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nis there?\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle, turning from Sam to Mr. Pickwick, with an air\r\nof some discomfiture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 whatever, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Sam; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeered the little box must\r\nbe chock full o\xe2\x80\x99 your own as it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look at that\r\nparticular portion of Mr. Smangle\xe2\x80\x99s attire, by the appearance of which\r\nthe skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s linen is generally\r\ntested, that he was fain to turn upon his heel, and, for the present at\r\nany rate, to give up all design on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s purse and wardrobe. He\r\naccordingly retired in dudgeon to the racket-ground, where he made a\r\nlight and whole-some breakfast on a couple of the cigars which had been\r\npurchased on the previous night.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivins, who was no smoker, and whose account for small articles of\r\nchandlery had also reached down to the bottom of the slate, and been\r\n\xe2\x80\x98carried over\xe2\x80\x99 to the other side, remained in bed, and, in his own\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x98took it out in sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter breakfasting in a small closet attached to the coffee-room, which\r\nbore the imposing title of the Snuggery, the temporary inmate of which,\r\nin consideration of a small additional charge, had the unspeakable\r\nadvantage of overhearing all the conversation in the coffee-room\r\naforesaid; and, after despatching Mr. Weller on some necessary errands,\r\nMr. Pickwick repaired to the lodge, to consult Mr. Roker concerning his\r\nfuture accommodation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Accommodation, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman, consulting a large book.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plenty of that, Mr. Pickwick. Your chummage ticket will be on twenty-\r\nseven, in the third.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98My what, did you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your chummage ticket,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Roker; \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re up to that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not quite,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s as plain as Salisbury. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\nchummage ticket upon twenty-seven in the third, and them as is in the\r\nroom will be your chums.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are there many of them?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Roker.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick coughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of \xe2\x80\x98em\xe2\x80\x99s a parson,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, filling up a little piece of\r\npaper as he spoke; \xe2\x80\x98another\xe2\x80\x99s a butcher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A butcher,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Roker, giving the nib of his pen a tap on the\r\ndesk to cure it of a disinclination to mark. \xe2\x80\x98What a thorough-paced goer\r\nhe used to be sure-ly! You remember Tom Martin, Neddy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Roker,\r\nappealing to another man in the lodge, who was paring the mud off his\r\nshoes with a five-and-twenty-bladed pocket-knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the party addressed, with a strong emphasis\r\non the personal pronoun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my dear eyes!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, shaking his head slowly from side\r\nto side, and gazing abstractedly out of the grated windows before him,\r\nas if he were fondly recalling some peaceful scene of his early youth;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it seems but yesterday that he whopped the coal-heaver down Fox-under-\r\nthe-Hill by the wharf there. I think I can see him now, a-coming up the\r\nStrand between the two street-keepers, a little sobered by the bruising,\r\nwith a patch o\xe2\x80\x99 winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid, and that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ere lovely bulldog, as pinned the little boy arterwards, a-following at\r\nhis heels. What a rum thing time is, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Neddy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe gentleman to whom these observations were addressed, who appeared of\r\na taciturn and thoughtful cast, merely echoed the inquiry; Mr. Roker,\r\nshaking off the poetical and gloomy train of thought into which he had\r\nbeen betrayed, descended to the common business of life, and resumed his\r\npen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know what the third gentlemen is?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, not\r\nvery much gratified by this description of his future associates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is that Simpson, Neddy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, turning to his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What Simpson?\xe2\x80\x99 said Neddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, him in twenty-seven in the third, that this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nbe chummed on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, him!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Neddy; \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s nothing exactly. He _was _a horse\r\nchaunter: he\xe2\x80\x99s a leg now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so I thought,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Roker, closing the book, and placing\r\nthe small piece of paper in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hands. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery much perplexed by this summary disposition of this person, Mr.\r\nPickwick walked back into the prison, revolving in his mind what he had\r\nbetter do. Convinced, however, that before he took any other steps it\r\nwould be advisable to see, and hold personal converse with, the three\r\ngentlemen with whom it was proposed to quarter him, he made the best of\r\nhis way to the third flight.\r\n\r\nAfter groping about in the gallery for some time, attempting in the dim\r\nlight to decipher the numbers on the different doors, he at length\r\nappealed to a pot-boy, who happened to be pursuing his morning\r\noccupation of gleaning for pewter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which is twenty-seven, my good fellow?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Five doors farther on,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the pot-boy. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s the likeness of a\r\nman being hung, and smoking the while, chalked outside the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuided by this direction, Mr. Pickwick proceeded slowly along the\r\ngallery until he encountered the \xe2\x80\x98portrait of a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 above\r\ndescribed, upon whose countenance he tapped, with the knuckle of his\r\nforefinger--gently at first, and then audibly. After repeating this\r\nprocess several times without effect, he ventured to open the door and\r\npeep in.\r\n\r\nThere was only one man in the room, and he was leaning out of window as\r\nfar as he could without overbalancing himself, endeavouring, with great\r\nperseverance, to spit upon the crown of the hat of a personal friend on\r\nthe parade below. As neither speaking, coughing, sneezing, knocking, nor\r\nany other ordinary mode of attracting attention, made this person aware\r\nof the presence of a visitor, Mr. Pickwick, after some delay, stepped up\r\nto the window, and pulled him gently by the coat tail. The individual\r\nbrought in his head and shoulders with great swiftness, and surveying\r\nMr. Pickwick from head to foot, demanded in a surly tone what the--\r\nsomething beginning with a capital H--he wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, consulting his ticket--\xe2\x80\x98I believe this\r\nis twenty-seven in the third?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrejoined Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hand it over,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick complied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think Roker might have chummed you somewhere else,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Simpson\r\n(for it was the leg), after a very discontented sort of a pause.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick thought so also; but, under all the circumstances, he\r\nconsidered it a matter of sound policy to be silent.\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson mused for a few moments after this, and then, thrusting his\r\nhead out of the window, gave a shrill whistle, and pronounced some word\r\naloud, several times. What the word was, Mr. Pickwick could not\r\ndistinguish; but he rather inferred that it must be some nickname which\r\ndistinguished Mr. Martin, from the fact of a great number of gentlemen\r\non the ground below, immediately proceeding to cry \xe2\x80\x98Butcher!\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nimitation of the tone in which that useful class of society are wont,\r\ndiurnally, to make their presence known at area railings.\r\n\r\nSubsequent occurrences confirmed the accuracy of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpression; for, in a few seconds, a gentleman, prematurely broad for\r\nhis years, clothed in a professional blue jean frock and top-boots with\r\ncircular toes, entered the room nearly out of breath, closely followed\r\nby another gentleman in very shabby black, and a sealskin cap. The\r\nlatter gentleman, who fastened his coat all the way up to his chin by\r\nmeans of a pin and a button alternately, had a very coarse red face, and\r\nlooked like a drunken chaplain; which, indeed, he was.\r\n\r\nThese two gentlemen having by turns perused Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s billet, the\r\none expressed his opinion that it was \xe2\x80\x98a rig,\xe2\x80\x99 and the other his\r\nconviction that it was \xe2\x80\x98a go.\xe2\x80\x99 Having recorded their feelings in these\r\nvery intelligible terms, they looked at Mr. Pickwick and each other in\r\nawkward silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s an aggravating thing, just as we got the beds so snug,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nchaplain, looking at three dirty mattresses, each rolled up in a\r\nblanket; which occupied one corner of the room during the day, and\r\nformed a kind of slab, on which were placed an old cracked basin, ewer,\r\nand soap-dish, of common yellow earthenware, with a blue flower--\xe2\x80\x98very\r\naggravating.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Martin expressed the same opinion in rather stronger terms; Mr.\r\nSimpson, after having let a variety of expletive adjectives loose upon\r\nsociety without any substantive to accompany them, tucked up his\r\nsleeves, and began to wash the greens for dinner.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Mr. Pickwick had been eyeing the room, which\r\nwas filthily dirty, and smelt intolerably close. There was no vestige of\r\neither carpet, curtain, or blind. There was not even a closet in it.\r\nUnquestionably there were but few things to put away, if there had been\r\none; but, however few in number, or small in individual amount, still,\r\nremnants of loaves and pieces of cheese, and damp towels, and scrags of\r\nmeat, and articles of wearing apparel, and mutilated crockery, and\r\nbellows without nozzles, and toasting-forks without prongs, do present\r\nsomewhat of an uncomfortable appearance when they are scattered about\r\nthe floor of a small apartment, which is the common sitting and sleeping\r\nroom of three idle men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose this can be managed somehow,\xe2\x80\x99 said the butcher, after a\r\npretty long silence. \xe2\x80\x98What will you take to go out?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98What did you say? I hardly\r\nunderstand you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will you take to be paid out?\xe2\x80\x99 said the butcher. \xe2\x80\x98The regular\r\nchummage is two-and-six. Will you take three bob?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a bender,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested the clerical gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that; it\xe2\x80\x99s only twopence a piece more,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nMartin. \xe2\x80\x98What do you say, now? We\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you out for three-and-sixpence\r\na week. Come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And stand a gallon of beer down,\xe2\x80\x99 chimed in Mr. Simpson. \xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And drink it on the spot,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chaplain. \xe2\x80\x98Now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really am so wholly ignorant of the rules of this place,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nMr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that I do not yet comprehend you. Can I live anywhere\r\nelse? I thought I could not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this inquiry Mr. Martin looked, with a countenance of excessive\r\nsurprise, at his two friends, and then each gentleman pointed with his\r\nright thumb over his left shoulder. This action imperfectly described in\r\nwords by the very feeble term of \xe2\x80\x98over the left,\xe2\x80\x99 when performed by any\r\nnumber of ladies or gentlemen who are accustomed to act in unison, has a\r\nvery graceful and airy effect; its expression is one of light and\r\nplayful sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Can _you!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Martin, with a smile of pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if I knew as little of life as that, I\xe2\x80\x99d eat my hat and swallow\r\nthe buckle whole,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerical gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So would I,\xe2\x80\x99 added the sporting one solemnly.\r\n\r\nAfter this introductory preface, the three chums informed Mr. Pickwick,\r\nin a breath, that money was, in the Fleet, just what money was out of\r\nit; that it would instantly procure him almost anything he desired; and\r\nthat, supposing he had it, and had no objection to spend it, if he only\r\nsignified his wish to have a room to himself, he might take possession\r\nof one, furnished and fitted to boot, in half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\n\r\nWith this the parties separated, very much to their common satisfaction;\r\nMr. Pickwick once more retracing his steps to the lodge, and the three\r\ncompanions adjourning to the coffee-room, there to spend the five\r\nshillings which the clerical gentleman had, with admirable prudence and\r\nforesight, borrowed of him for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knowed it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, with a chuckle, when Mr. Pickwick stated\r\nthe object with which he had returned. \xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say so, Neddy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knowed you\xe2\x80\x99d want a room for yourself, bless you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see. You\xe2\x80\x99ll want some furniture. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hire that of me, I\r\nsuppose? That\xe2\x80\x99s the reg\xe2\x80\x99lar thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a capital room up in the coffee-room flight, that belongs to a\r\nChancery prisoner,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll stand you in a pound a week.\r\nI suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just step there with me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Roker, taking up his hat with great\r\nalacrity; \xe2\x80\x98the matter\xe2\x80\x99s settled in five minutes. Lord! why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsay at first that you was willing to come down handsome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe matter was soon arranged, as the turnkey had foretold. The Chancery\r\nprisoner had been there long enough to have lost his friends, fortune,\r\nhome, and happiness, and to have acquired the right of having a room to\r\nhimself. As he laboured, however, under the inconvenience of often\r\nwanting a morsel of bread, he eagerly listened to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproposal to rent the apartment, and readily covenanted and agreed to\r\nyield him up the sole and undisturbed possession thereof, in\r\nconsideration of the weekly payment of twenty shillings; from which fund\r\nhe furthermore contracted to pay out any person or persons that might be\r\nchummed upon it.\r\n\r\nAs they struck the bargain, Mr. Pickwick surveyed him with a painful\r\ninterest. He was a tall, gaunt, cadaverous man, in an old greatcoat and\r\nslippers, with sunken cheeks, and a restless, eager eye. His lips were\r\nbloodless, and his bones sharp and thin. God help him! the iron teeth of\r\nconfinement and privation had been slowly filing him down for twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where will you live meanwhile, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as he laid\r\nthe amount of the first week\xe2\x80\x99s rent, in advance, on the tottering table.\r\n\r\nThe man gathered up the money with a trembling hand, and replied that he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know yet; he must go and see where he could move his bed to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand gently and\r\ncompassionately on his arm--\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid you will have to live in some\r\nnoisy, crowded place. Now, pray, consider this room your own when you\r\nwant quiet, or when any of your friends come to see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friends!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the man, in a voice which rattled in his throat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if I lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the world; tight\r\nscrewed down and soldered in my coffin; rotting in the dark and filthy\r\nditch that drags its slime along, beneath the foundations of this\r\nprison; I could not be more forgotten or unheeded than I am here. I am a\r\ndead man; dead to society, without the pity they bestow on those whose\r\nsouls have passed to judgment. Friends to see me! My God! I have sunk,\r\nfrom the prime of life into old age, in this place, and there is not one\r\nto raise his hand above my bed when I lie dead upon it, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\na blessing he is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe excitement, which had cast an unwonted light over the man\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nwhile he spoke, subsided as he concluded; and pressing his withered\r\nhands together in a hasty and disordered manner, he shuffled from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rides rather rusty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! they\xe2\x80\x99re like\r\nthe elephants. They feel it now and then, and it makes \xe2\x80\x98em wild!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving made this deeply-sympathising remark, Mr. Roker entered upon his\r\narrangements with such expedition, that in a short time the room was\r\nfurnished with a carpet, six chairs, a table, a sofa bedstead, a tea-\r\nkettle, and various small articles, on hire, at the very reasonable rate\r\nof seven-and-twenty shillings and sixpence per week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, is there anything more we can do for you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Roker,\r\nlooking round with great satisfaction, and gaily chinking the first\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s hire in his closed fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, who had been musing deeply for some time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are there any people here who run on errands, and so forth?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Outside, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Roker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I mean who are able to go outside. Not prisoners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, there is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Roker. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate devil, who has got\r\na friend on the poor side, that\xe2\x80\x99s glad to do anything of that sort. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen running odd jobs, and that, for the last two months. Shall I send\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Stay; no. The poor side, you\r\nsay? I should like to see it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to him myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe poor side of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s prison is, as its name imports, that in\r\nwhich the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined. A\r\nprisoner having declared upon the poor side, pays neither rent nor\r\nchummage. His fees, upon entering and leaving the jail, are reduced in\r\namount, and he becomes entitled to a share of some small quantities of\r\nfood: to provide which, a few charitable persons have, from time to\r\ntime, left trifling legacies in their wills. Most of our readers will\r\nremember, that, until within a very few years past, there was a kind of\r\niron cage in the wall of the Fleet Prison, within which was posted some\r\nman of hungry looks, who, from time to time, rattled a money-box, and\r\nexclaimed in a mournful voice, \xe2\x80\x98Pray, remember the poor debtors; pray\r\nremember the poor debtors.\xe2\x80\x99 The receipts of this box, when there were\r\nany, were divided among the poor prisoners; and the men on the poor side\r\nrelieved each other in this degrading office.\r\n\r\nAlthough this custom has been abolished, and the cage is now boarded up,\r\nthe miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy persons remains\r\nthe same. We no longer suffer them to appeal at the prison gates to the\r\ncharity and compassion of the passersby; but we still leave unblotted\r\nthe leaves of our statute book, for the reverence and admiration of\r\nsucceeding ages, the just and wholesome law which declares that the\r\nsturdy felon shall be fed and clothed, and that the penniless debtor\r\nshall be left to die of starvation and nakedness. This is no fiction.\r\nNot a week passes over our head, but, in every one of our prisons for\r\ndebt, some of these men must inevitably expire in the slow agonies of\r\nwant, if they were not relieved by their fellow-prisoners.\r\n\r\nTurning these things in his mind, as he mounted the narrow staircase at\r\nthe foot of which Roker had left him, Mr. Pickwick gradually worked\r\nhimself to the boiling-over point; and so excited was he with his\r\nreflections on this subject, that he had burst into the room to which he\r\nhad been directed, before he had any distinct recollection, either of\r\nthe place in which he was, or of the object of his visit.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once; but he\r\nhad no sooner cast his eye on the figure of a man who was brooding over\r\nthe dusty fire, than, letting his hat fall on the floor, he stood\r\nperfectly fixed and immovable with astonishment.\r\n\r\nYes; in tattered garments, and without a coat; his common calico shirt,\r\nyellow and in rags; his hair hanging over his face; his features changed\r\nwith suffering, and pinched with famine--there sat Mr. Alfred Jingle;\r\nhis head resting on his hands, his eyes fixed upon the fire, and his\r\nwhole appearance denoting misery and dejection!\r\n\r\nNear him, leaning listlessly against the wall, stood a strong-built\r\ncountryman, flicking with a worn-out hunting-whip the top-boot that\r\nadorned his right foot; his left being thrust into an old slipper.\r\nHorses, dogs, and drink had brought him there, pell-mell. There was a\r\nrusty spur on the solitary boot, which he occasionally jerked into the\r\nempty air, at the same time giving the boot a smart blow, and muttering\r\nsome of the sounds by which a sportsman encourages his horse. He was\r\nriding, in imagination, some desperate steeplechase at that moment. Poor\r\nwretch! He never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his costly stud,\r\nwith half the speed at which he had torn along the course that ended in\r\nthe Fleet.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the room an old man was seated on a small wooden\r\nbox, with his eyes riveted on the floor, and his face settled into an\r\nexpression of the deepest and most hopeless despair. A young girl--his\r\nlittle grand-daughter--was hanging about him, endeavouring, with a\r\nthousand childish devices, to engage his attention; but the old man\r\nneither saw nor heard her. The voice that had been music to him, and the\r\neyes that had been light, fell coldly on his senses. His limbs were\r\nshaking with disease, and the palsy had fastened on his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two or three other men in the room, congregated in a little\r\nknot, and noiselessly talking among themselves. There was a lean and\r\nhaggard woman, too--a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s wife--who was watering, with great\r\nsolicitude, the wretched stump of a dried-up, withered plant, which, it\r\nwas plain to see, could never send forth a green leaf again--too true an\r\nemblem, perhaps, of the office she had come there to discharge.\r\n\r\nSuch were the objects which presented themselves to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s view,\r\nas he looked round him in amazement. The noise of some one stumbling\r\nhastily into the room, roused him. Turning his eyes towards the door,\r\nthey encountered the new-comer; and in him, through his rags and dirt,\r\nhe recognised the familiar features of Mr. Job Trotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Job aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle, starting from his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr ----! So it is--queer place--strange things--serves me right--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr. Jingle thrust his hands into the place where his trousers pockets\r\nused to be, and, dropping his chin upon his breast, sank back into his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was affected; the two men looked so very miserable. The\r\nsharp, involuntary glance Jingle had cast at a small piece of raw loin\r\nof mutton, which Job had brought in with him, said more of their reduced\r\nstate than two hours\xe2\x80\x99 explanation could have done. Mr. Pickwick looked\r\nmildly at Jingle, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to speak to you in private. Will you step out for an\r\ninstant?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle, rising hastily. \xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t step far--no danger of\r\noverwalking yourself here--spike park--grounds pretty--romantic, but not\r\nextensive--open for public inspection--family always in town--\r\nhousekeeper desperately careful--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have forgotten your coat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as they walked out to\r\nthe staircase, and closed the door after them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98Spout--dear relation--uncle Tom--couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it--\r\nmust eat, you know. Wants of nature--and all that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone, my dear sir--last coat--can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Lived on a pair of boots,\r\nwhole fortnight. Silk umbrella--ivory handle--week--fact--honour--ask\r\nJob--knows it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lived for three weeks upon a pair of boots, and a silk umbrella with an\r\nivory handle!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had only heard of such things\r\nin shipwrecks or read of them in Constable\xe2\x80\x99s Miscellany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle, nodding his head. \xe2\x80\x98Pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s shop--duplicates\r\nhere--small sums--mere nothing--all rascals.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, much relieved by this explanation; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nunderstand you. You have pawned your wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything--Job\xe2\x80\x99s too--all shirts gone--never mind--saves washing.\r\nNothing soon--lie in bed--starve--die--inquest--little bone-house--poor\r\nprisoner--common necessaries--hush it up--gentlemen of the jury--\r\nwarden\xe2\x80\x99s tradesmen--keep it snug--natural death--coroner\xe2\x80\x99s order--\r\nworkhouse funeral--serve him right--all over--drop the curtain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJingle delivered this singular summary of his prospects in life, with\r\nhis accustomed volubility, and with various twitches of the countenance\r\nto counterfeit smiles. Mr. Pickwick easily perceived that his\r\nrecklessness was assumed, and looking him full, but not unkindly, in the\r\nface, saw that his eyes were moist with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle, pressing his hand, and turning his head\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x98Ungrateful dog--boyish to cry--can\xe2\x80\x99t help it--bad fever--weak--\r\nill--hungry. Deserved it all--but suffered much--very.\xe2\x80\x99 Wholly unable to\r\nkeep up appearances any longer, and perhaps rendered worse by the effort\r\nhe had made, the dejected stroller sat down on the stairs, and, covering\r\nhis face with his hands, sobbed like a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with considerable emotion, \xe2\x80\x98we will see\r\nwhat can be done, when I know all about the matter. Here, Job; where is\r\nthat fellow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, presenting himself on the staircase. We have\r\ndescribed him, by the bye, as having deeply-sunken eyes, in the best of\r\ntimes. In his present state of want and distress, he looked as if those\r\nfeatures had gone out of town altogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, trying to look stern, with four\r\nlarge tears running down his waistcoat. \xe2\x80\x98Take that, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTake what? In the ordinary acceptation of such language, it should have\r\nbeen a blow. As the world runs, it ought to have been a sound, hearty\r\ncuff; for Mr. Pickwick had been duped, deceived, and wronged by the\r\ndestitute outcast who was now wholly in his power. Must we tell the\r\ntruth? It was something from Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat pocket, which\r\nchinked as it was given into Job\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and the giving of which,\r\nsomehow or other imparted a sparkle to the eye, and a swelling to the\r\nheart, of our excellent old friend, as he hurried away.\r\n\r\nSam had returned when Mr. Pickwick reached his own room, and was\r\ninspecting the arrangements that had been made for his comfort, with a\r\nkind of grim satisfaction which was very pleasant to look upon. Having a\r\ndecided objection to his master\xe2\x80\x99s being there at all, Mr. Weller\r\nappeared to consider it a high moral duty not to appear too much pleased\r\nwith anything that was done, said, suggested, or proposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty comfortable now, eh, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty vell, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Sam, looking round him in a disparaging\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you seen Mr. Tupman and our other friends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I _have _seen \xe2\x80\x98em, sir, and they\xe2\x80\x99re a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 to-morrow, and wos\r\nwery much surprised to hear they warn\xe2\x80\x99t to come to-day,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have brought the things I wanted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller in reply pointed to various packages which he had arranged,\r\nas neatly as he could, in a corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, after a little hesitation; \xe2\x80\x98listen\r\nto what I am going to say, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98fire away, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have felt from the first, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with much\r\nsolemnity, \xe2\x80\x98that this is not the place to bring a young man to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor an old \xe2\x80\x98un neither, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but old men may come here\r\nthrough their own heedlessness and unsuspicion, and young men may be\r\nbrought here by the selfishness of those they serve. It is better for\r\nthose young men, in every point of view, that they should not remain\r\nhere. Do you understand me, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vy no, Sir, I do _not_,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x98I think I see your\r\ndrift; and if I do see your drift, it\xe2\x80\x99s my \xe2\x80\x98pinion that you\xe2\x80\x99re a-comin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit a great deal too strong, as the mail-coachman said to the snowstorm,\r\nven it overtook him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see you comprehend me, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Independently of my\r\nwish that you should not be idling about a place like this, for years to\r\ncome, I feel that for a debtor in the Fleet to be attended by his\r\nmanservant is a monstrous absurdity. Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98for a\r\ntime you must leave me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, for a time, eh, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller rather sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, for the time that I remain here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Your wages I\r\nshall continue to pay. Any one of my three friends will be happy to take\r\nyou, were it only out of respect to me. And if I ever do leave this\r\nplace, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick, with assumed cheerfulness--\xe2\x80\x98if I do, I\r\npledge you my word that you shall return to me instantly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you wot it is, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, in a grave and\r\nsolemn voice. \xe2\x80\x98This here sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing won\xe2\x80\x99t do at all, so don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhear no more about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI am serious, and resolved, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You air, air you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller firmly. \xe2\x80\x98Wery good, Sir;\r\nthen so am I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus speaking, Mr. Weller fixed his hat on his head with great\r\nprecision, and abruptly left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick, calling after him, \xe2\x80\x98Sam! Here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the long gallery ceased to re-echo the sound of footsteps. Sam\r\nWeller was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII. SHOWING HOW MR. SAMUEL WELLER GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES\r\n\r\nIn a lofty room, ill-lighted and worse ventilated, situated in Portugal\r\nStreet, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields, there sit nearly the whole year round,\r\none, two, three, or four gentlemen in wigs, as the case may be, with\r\nlittle writing-desks before them, constructed after the fashion of those\r\nused by the judges of the land, barring the French polish. There is a\r\nbox of barristers on their right hand; there is an enclosure of\r\ninsolvent debtors on their left; and there is an inclined plane of most\r\nespecially dirty faces in their front. These gentlemen are the\r\nCommissioners of the Insolvent Court, and the place in which they sit,\r\nis the Insolvent Court itself.\r\n\r\nIt is, and has been, time out of mind, the remarkable fate of this court\r\nto be, somehow or other, held and understood, by the general consent of\r\nall the destitute shabby-genteel people in London, as their common\r\nresort, and place of daily refuge. It is always full. The steams of beer\r\nand spirits perpetually ascend to the ceiling, and, being condensed by\r\nthe heat, roll down the walls like rain; there are more old suits of\r\nclothes in it at one time, than will be offered for sale in all\r\nHoundsditch in a twelvemonth; more unwashed skins and grizzly beards\r\nthan all the pumps and shaving-shops between Tyburn and Whitechapel\r\ncould render decent, between sunrise and sunset.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that any of these people have the least shadow\r\nof business in, or the remotest connection with, the place they so\r\nindefatigably attend. If they had, it would be no matter of surprise,\r\nand the singularity of the thing would cease. Some of them sleep during\r\nthe greater part of the sitting; others carry small portable dinners\r\nwrapped in pocket-handkerchiefs or sticking out of their worn-out\r\npockets, and munch and listen with equal relish; but no one among them\r\nwas ever known to have the slightest personal interest in any case that\r\nwas ever brought forward. Whatever they do, there they sit from the\r\nfirst moment to the last. When it is heavy, rainy weather, they all come\r\nin, wet through; and at such times the vapours of the court are like\r\nthose of a fungus-pit.\r\n\r\nA casual visitor might suppose this place to be a temple dedicated to\r\nthe Genius of Seediness. There is not a messenger or process-server\r\nattached to it, who wears a coat that was made for him; not a tolerably\r\nfresh, or wholesome-looking man in the whole establishment, except a\r\nlittle white-headed apple-faced tipstaff, and even he, like an ill-\r\nconditioned cherry preserved in brandy, seems to have artificially dried\r\nand withered up into a state of preservation to which he can lay no\r\nnatural claim. The very barristers\xe2\x80\x99 wigs are ill-powdered, and their\r\ncurls lack crispness.\r\n\r\nBut the attorneys, who sit at a large bare table below the\r\ncommissioners, are, after all, the greatest curiosities. The\r\nprofessional establishment of the more opulent of these gentlemen,\r\nconsists of a blue bag and a boy; generally a youth of the Jewish\r\npersuasion. They have no fixed offices, their legal business being\r\ntransacted in the parlours of public-houses, or the yards of prisons,\r\nwhither they repair in crowds, and canvass for customers after the\r\nmanner of omnibus cads. They are of a greasy and mildewed appearance;\r\nand if they can be said to have any vices at all, perhaps drinking and\r\ncheating are the most conspicuous among them. Their residences are\r\nusually on the outskirts of \xe2\x80\x98the Rules,\xe2\x80\x99 chiefly lying within a circle\r\nof one mile from the obelisk in St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Fields. Their looks are not\r\nprepossessing, and their manners are peculiar.\r\n\r\nMr. Solomon Pell, one of this learned body, was a fat, flabby, pale man,\r\nin a surtout which looked green one minute, and brown the next, with a\r\nvelvet collar of the same chameleon tints. His forehead was narrow, his\r\nface wide, his head large, and his nose all on one side, as if Nature,\r\nindignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth, had\r\ngiven it an angry tweak which it had never recovered. Being short-necked\r\nand asthmatic, however, he respired principally through this feature;\r\nso, perhaps, what it wanted in ornament, it made up in usefulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure to bring him through it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you, though?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the person to whom the assurance was pledged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certain sure,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pell; \xe2\x80\x98but if he\xe2\x80\x99d gone to any irregular\r\npractitioner, mind you, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have answered for the consequences.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the other, with open mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell; and he pursed up his lips,\r\nfrowned, and shook his head mysteriously.\r\n\r\nNow, the place where this discourse occurred was the public-house just\r\nopposite to the Insolvent Court; and the person with whom it was held\r\nwas no other than the elder Mr. Weller, who had come there, to comfort\r\nand console a friend, whose petition to be discharged under the act, was\r\nto be that day heard, and whose attorney he was at that moment\r\nconsulting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And vere is George?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Pell jerked his head in the direction of a back parlour, whither Mr.\r\nWeller at once repairing, was immediately greeted in the warmest and\r\nmost flattering manner by some half-dozen of his professional brethren,\r\nin token of their gratification at his arrival. The insolvent gentleman,\r\nwho had contracted a speculative but imprudent passion for horsing long\r\nstages, which had led to his present embarrassments, looked extremely\r\nwell, and was soothing the excitement of his feelings with shrimps and\r\nporter.\r\n\r\nThe salutation between Mr. Weller and his friends was strictly confined\r\nto the freemasonry of the craft; consisting of a jerking round of the\r\nright wrist, and a tossing of the little finger into the air at the same\r\ntime. We once knew two famous coachmen (they are dead now, poor fellows)\r\nwho were twins, and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment\r\nexisted. They passed each other on the Dover road, every day, for\r\ntwenty-four years, never exchanging any other greeting than this; and\r\nyet, when one died, the other pined away, and soon afterwards followed\r\nhim!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, George,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller senior, taking off his upper coat, and\r\nseating himself with his accustomed gravity. \xe2\x80\x98How is it? All right\r\nbehind, and full inside?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, old feller,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the embarrassed gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the gray mare made over to anybody?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller anxiously.\r\n\r\nGeorge nodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Coach taken care on, also?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Con-signed in a safe quarter,\xe2\x80\x99 replied George, wringing the heads off\r\nhalf a dozen shrimps, and swallowing them without any more ado.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Alvays see to the drag ven you\r\ngo downhill. Is the vay-bill all clear and straight for\xe2\x80\x99erd?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The schedule, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, guessing at Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nschedule is as plain and satisfactory as pen and ink can make it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller nodded in a manner which bespoke his inward approval of these\r\narrangements; and then, turning to Mr. Pell, said, pointing to his\r\nfriend George--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ven do you take his cloths off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pell, \xe2\x80\x98he stands third on the opposed list, and I\r\nshould think it would be his turn in about half an hour. I told my clerk\r\nto come over and tell us when there was a chance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller surveyed the attorney from head to foot with great\r\nadmiration, and said emphatically--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what\xe2\x80\x99ll you take, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, really,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pell, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re very--. Upon my word and\r\nhonour, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the habit of--. It\xe2\x80\x99s so very early in the morning,\r\nthat, actually, I am almost--. Well, you may bring me threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orth of\r\nrum, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe officiating damsel, who had anticipated the order before it was\r\ngiven, set the glass of spirits before Pell, and retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell, looking round upon the company, \xe2\x80\x98success to\r\nyour friend! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to boast, gentlemen; it\xe2\x80\x99s not my way; but I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help saying, that, if your friend hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been fortunate enough to\r\nfall into hands that--But I won\xe2\x80\x99t say what I was going to say.\r\nGentlemen, my service to you.\xe2\x80\x99 Having emptied the glass in a twinkling,\r\nMr. Pell smacked his lips, and looked complacently round on the\r\nassembled coachmen, who evidently regarded him as a species of divinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the legal authority. \xe2\x80\x98What was I a-saying,\r\ngentlemen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you was remarkin\xe2\x80\x99 as you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have no objection to another\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the same, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with grave facetiousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Mr. Pell. \xe2\x80\x98Not bad, not bad. A professional man, too!\r\nAt this time of the morning, it would be rather too good a--Well, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know, my dear--you may do that again, if you please. Hem!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis last sound was a solemn and dignified cough, in which Mr. Pell,\r\nobserving an indecent tendency to mirth in some of his auditors,\r\nconsidered it due to himself to indulge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The late Lord Chancellor, gentlemen, was very fond of me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And wery creditable in him, too,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr. Pell\xe2\x80\x99s client. \xe2\x80\x98Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he be?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Why, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said a very red-faced man, who had said nothing yet,\r\nand who looked extremely unlikely to say anything more. \xe2\x80\x98Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA murmur of assent ran through the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell, \xe2\x80\x98dining with him on one\r\noccasion; there was only us two, but everything as splendid as if twenty\r\npeople had been expected--the great seal on a dumb-waiter at his right\r\nhand, and a man in a bag-wig and suit of armour guarding the mace with a\r\ndrawn sword and silk stockings--which is perpetually done, gentlemen,\r\nnight and day; when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cPell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cno false delicacy, Pell.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a man of talent; you can get anybody through the Insolvent Court,\r\nPell; and your country should be proud of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Those were his very\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou flatter me.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cPell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I do,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m damned.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he say that?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98I say Parliament ought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 took it\r\nup; and if he\xe2\x80\x99d been a poor man, they would ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x99 argued Mr. Pell, \xe2\x80\x98it was in confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, after a little reflection. \xe2\x80\x98If he\r\ndamned hisself in confidence, o\xe2\x80\x99 course that was another thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell. \xe2\x80\x98The distinction\xe2\x80\x99s obvious, you will\r\nperceive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alters the case entirely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Go on, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo, I will not go on, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell, in a low and serious tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have reminded me, Sir, that this conversation was private--private\r\nand confidential, gentlemen. Gentlemen, I am a professional man. It may\r\nbe that I am a good deal looked up to, in my profession--it may be that\r\nI am not. Most people know. I say nothing. Observations have already\r\nbeen made, in this room, injurious to the reputation of my noble friend.\r\nYou will excuse me, gentlemen; I was imprudent. I feel that I have no\r\nright to mention this matter without his concurrence. Thank you, Sir;\r\nthank you.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus delivering himself, Mr. Pell thrust his hands into his\r\npockets, and, frowning grimly around, rattled three halfpence with\r\nterrible determination.\r\n\r\nThis virtuous resolution had scarcely been formed, when the boy and the\r\nblue bag, who were inseparable companions, rushed violently into the\r\nroom, and said (at least the boy did, for the blue bag took no part in\r\nthe announcement) that the case was coming on directly. The intelligence\r\nwas no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street,\r\nand began to fight their way into court--a preparatory ceremony, which\r\nhas been calculated to occupy, in ordinary cases, from twenty-five\r\nminutes to thirty.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller, being stout, cast himself at once into the crowd, with the\r\ndesperate hope of ultimately turning up in some place which would suit\r\nhim. His success was not quite equal to his expectations; for having\r\nneglected to take his hat off, it was knocked over his eyes by some\r\nunseen person, upon whose toes he had alighted with considerable force.\r\nApparently this individual regretted his impetuosity immediately\r\nafterwards, for, muttering an indistinct exclamation of surprise, he\r\ndragged the old man out into the hall, and, after a violent struggle,\r\nreleased his head and face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Samivel!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller, when he was thus enabled to behold his\r\nrescuer.\r\n\r\nSam nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a dutiful and affectionate little boy, you are, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98to come a-bonnetin\xe2\x80\x99 your father in his old age?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How should I know who you wos?\xe2\x80\x99 responded the son. \xe2\x80\x98Do you s\xe2\x80\x99pose I wos\r\nto tell you by the weight o\xe2\x80\x99 your foot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, that\xe2\x80\x99s wery true, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, mollified at once;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but wot are you a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 on here? Your gov\xe2\x80\x99nor can\xe2\x80\x99t do no good here,\r\nSammy. They won\xe2\x80\x99t pass that werdick, they won\xe2\x80\x99t pass it, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99 And Mr.\r\nWeller shook his head with legal solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot a perwerse old file it is!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam, \xe2\x80\x98always a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 on about\r\nwerdicks and alleybis and that. Who said anything about the werdick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller made no reply, but once more shook his head most learnedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave off rattlin\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere nob o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to come\r\noff the springs altogether,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam impatiently, \xe2\x80\x98and behave\r\nreasonable. I vent all the vay down to the Markis o\xe2\x80\x99 Granby, arter you,\r\nlast night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see the Marchioness o\xe2\x80\x99 Granby, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller,\r\nwith a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I did,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How wos the dear creetur a-lookin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery queer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I think she\xe2\x80\x99s a-injurin\xe2\x80\x99 herself gradivally\r\nvith too much o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere pine-apple rum, and other strong medicines of\r\nthe same natur.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 said the senior earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the junior.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller seized his son\xe2\x80\x99s hand, clasped it, and let it fall. There was\r\nan expression on his countenance in doing so--not of dismay or\r\napprehension, but partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of\r\nhope. A gleam of resignation, and even of cheerfulness, passed over his\r\nface too, as he slowly said, \xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t quite certain, Sammy; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to say I wos altogether positive, in case of any subsekent\r\ndisappointment, but I rayther think, my boy, I rayther think, that the\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s got the liver complaint!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does he look bad?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s uncommon pale,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99cept about the nose, which\r\nis redder than ever. His appetite is wery so-so, but he imbibes\r\nwonderful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSome thoughts of the rum appeared to obtrude themselves on Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, as he said this; for he looked gloomy and thoughtful; but he very\r\nshortly recovered, as was testified by a perfect alphabet of winks, in\r\nwhich he was only wont to indulge when particularly pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98about my affair. Just open them ears o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t say nothin\xe2\x80\x99 till I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x99 With this preface, Sam related,\r\nas succinctly as he could, the last memorable conversation he had had\r\nwith Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop there by himself, poor creetur!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the elder Mr. Weller,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98without nobody to take his part! It can\xe2\x80\x99t be done, Samivel, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 course it can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 asserted Sam: \xe2\x80\x98I know\xe2\x80\x99d that, afore I came.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhy, they\xe2\x80\x99ll eat him up alive, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\nSam nodded his concurrence in the opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He goes in rayther raw, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller metaphorically, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll come out, done so ex-ceedin\xe2\x80\x99 brown, that his most formiliar\r\nfriends won\xe2\x80\x99t know him. Roast pigeon\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to it, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Sam Weller nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-prophecyin\xe2\x80\x99 away, wery fine, like a\r\nred-faced Nixon, as the sixpenny books gives picters on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who wos he, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind who he was,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Sam; \xe2\x80\x98he warn\xe2\x80\x99t a coachman; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI know\xe2\x80\x99d a ostler o\xe2\x80\x99 that name,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It warn\xe2\x80\x99t him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98This here gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n was a prophet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s a prophet?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly on his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, a man as tells what\xe2\x80\x99s a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to happen,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d know\xe2\x80\x99d him, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98P\xe2\x80\x99raps he might ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthrow\xe2\x80\x99d a small light on that \xe2\x80\x98ere liver complaint as we wos a-speakin\xe2\x80\x99\r\non, just now. Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever, if he\xe2\x80\x99s dead, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t left the bisness to\r\nnobody, there\xe2\x80\x99s an end on it. Go on, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-prophecyin\xe2\x80\x99 avay about wot\xe2\x80\x99ll happen to\r\nthe gov\xe2\x80\x99ner if he\xe2\x80\x99s left alone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see any way o\xe2\x80\x99 takin\xe2\x80\x99 care on\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with a reflective visage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No vay at all?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No vay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98unless\xe2\x80\x99--and a gleam of intelligence lighted\r\nup his countenance as he sank his voice to a whisper, and applied his\r\nmouth to the ear of his offspring--\xe2\x80\x98unless it is getting him out in a\r\nturn-up bedstead, unbeknown to the turnkeys, Sammy, or dressin\xe2\x80\x99 him up\r\nlike a old \xe2\x80\x98ooman vith a green wail.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam Weller received both of these suggestions with unexpected contempt,\r\nand again propounded his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98if he von\xe2\x80\x99t let you stop there, I see no\r\nvay at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s no thoroughfare, Sammy, no thoroughfare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you wot it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you for\r\nthe loan of five-and-twenty pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot good\xe2\x80\x99ll that do?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98P\xe2\x80\x99raps you may ask for it five minits\r\narterwards; p\xe2\x80\x99raps I may say I von\xe2\x80\x99t pay, and cut up rough. You von\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink o\xe2\x80\x99 arrestin\xe2\x80\x99 your own son for the money, and sendin\xe2\x80\x99 him off to\r\nthe Fleet, will you, you unnat\xe2\x80\x99ral wagabone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this reply of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s, the father and son exchanged a complete code of\r\ntelegraph nods and gestures, after which, the elder Mr. Weller sat\r\nhimself down on a stone step and laughed till he was purple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot a old image it is!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam, indignant at this loss of time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you a-settin\xe2\x80\x99 down there for, con-wertin\xe2\x80\x99 your face into a\r\nstreet-door knocker, wen there\xe2\x80\x99s so much to be done. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the boot, Sammy, in the boot,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, composing his\r\nfeatures. \xe2\x80\x98Hold my hat, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving divested himself of this encumbrance, Mr. Weller gave his body a\r\nsudden wrench to one side, and by a dexterous twist, contrived to get\r\nhis right hand into a most capacious pocket, from whence, after a great\r\ndeal of panting and exertion, he extricated a pocket-book of the large\r\noctavo size, fastened by a huge leathern strap. From this ledger he drew\r\nforth a couple of whiplashes, three or four buckles, a little sample-bag\r\nof corn, and, finally, a small roll of very dirty bank-notes, from which\r\nhe selected the required amount, which he handed over to Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, when the whip-lashes, and the\r\nbuckles, and the samples, had been all put back, and the book once more\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the same pocket, \xe2\x80\x98now, Sammy, I know a\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n here, as\xe2\x80\x99ll do the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 the bisness for us, in no time--a\r\nlimb o\xe2\x80\x99 the law, Sammy, as has got brains like the frogs, dispersed all\r\nover his body, and reachin\xe2\x80\x99 to the wery tips of his fingers; a friend of\r\nthe Lord Chancellorship\xe2\x80\x99s, Sammy, who\xe2\x80\x99d only have to tell him what he\r\nwanted, and he\xe2\x80\x99d lock you up for life, if that wos all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98none o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None o\xe2\x80\x99 wot?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, none o\xe2\x80\x99 them unconstitootional ways o\xe2\x80\x99 doin\xe2\x80\x99 it,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Sam.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The have-his-carcass, next to the perpetual motion, is vun of the\r\nblessedest things as wos ever made. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that \xe2\x80\x98ere in the\r\nnewspapers wery of\xe2\x80\x99en.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, wot\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do vith it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just this here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98that I\xe2\x80\x99ll patronise the inwention, and go\r\nin, that vay. No visperin\xe2\x80\x99s to the Chancellorship--I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the\r\nnotion. It mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be altogether safe, vith reference to gettin\xe2\x80\x99 out\r\nagin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDeferring to his son\xe2\x80\x99s feeling upon this point, Mr. Weller at once\r\nsought the erudite Solomon Pell, and acquainted him with his desire to\r\nissue a writ, instantly, for the _sum _of twenty-five pounds, and costs\r\nof process; to be executed without delay upon the body of one Samuel\r\nWeller; the charges thereby incurred, to be paid in advance to Solomon\r\nPell.\r\n\r\nThe attorney was in high glee, for the embarrassed coach-horser was\r\nordered to be discharged forthwith. He highly approved of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattachment to his master; declared that it strongly reminded him of his\r\nown feelings of devotion to his friend, the Chancellor; and at once led\r\nthe elder Mr. Weller down to the Temple, to swear the affidavit of debt,\r\nwhich the boy, with the assistance of the blue bag, had drawn up on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sam, having been formally introduced to the whitewashed\r\ngentleman and his friends, as the offspring of Mr. Weller, of the Belle\r\nSavage, was treated with marked distinction, and invited to regale\r\nhimself with them in honour of the occasion--an invitation which he was\r\nby no means backward in accepting.\r\n\r\nThe mirth of gentlemen of this class is of a grave and quiet character,\r\nusually; but the present instance was one of peculiar festivity, and\r\nthey relaxed in proportion. After some rather tumultuous toasting of the\r\nChief Commissioner and Mr. Solomon Pell, who had that day displayed such\r\ntranscendent abilities, a mottled-faced gentleman in a blue shawl\r\nproposed that somebody should sing a song. The obvious suggestion was,\r\nthat the mottled-faced gentleman, being anxious for a song, should sing\r\nit himself; but this the mottled-faced gentleman sturdily, and somewhat\r\noffensively, declined to do. Upon which, as is not unusual in such\r\ncases, a rather angry colloquy ensued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the coach-horser, \xe2\x80\x98rather than disturb the harmony of\r\nthis delightful occasion, perhaps Mr. Samuel Weller will oblige the\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Raly, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not wery much in the habit o\xe2\x80\x99 singin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwithout the instrument; but anythin\xe2\x80\x99 for a quiet life, as the man said\r\nwen he took the sitivation at the lighthouse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this prelude, Mr. Samuel Weller burst at once into the following\r\nwild and beautiful legend, which, under the impression that it is not\r\ngenerally known, we take the liberty of quoting. We would beg to call\r\nparticular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and\r\nfourth lines, which not only enables the singer to take breath at those\r\npoints, but greatly assists the metre.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMANCE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBold Turpin vunce, on Hounslow Heath, His bold mare Bess bestrode--er;\r\nVen there he see\xe2\x80\x99d the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s coach A-coming along the road--er. So he\r\ngallops close to the \xe2\x80\x98orse\xe2\x80\x99s legs, And he claps his head vithin; And the\r\nBishop says, \xe2\x80\x98Sure as eggs is eggs, This here\xe2\x80\x99s the bold Turpin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\nAnd the Bishop says, \xe2\x80\x98Sure as eggs is eggs, This here\xe2\x80\x99s the bold\r\nTurpin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSays Turpin, \xe2\x80\x98You shall eat your words, With a sarse of leaden bul--\r\nlet;\xe2\x80\x99 So he puts a pistol to his mouth, And he fires it down his gul--\r\nlet. The coachman he not likin\xe2\x80\x99 the job, Set off at full gal-lop, But\r\nDick put a couple of balls in his nob, And perwailed on him to stop.\r\n\r\nCHORUS (sarcastically)\r\n\r\nBut Dick put a couple of balls in his nob, And perwailed on him to stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I maintain that that \xe2\x80\x98ere song\xe2\x80\x99s personal to the cloth,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nmottled-faced gentleman, interrupting it at this point. \xe2\x80\x98I demand the\r\nname o\xe2\x80\x99 that coachman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody know\xe2\x80\x99d,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got his card in his pocket.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I object to the introduction o\xe2\x80\x99 politics,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mottled-faced\r\ngentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I submit that, in the present company, that \xe2\x80\x98ere song\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npolitical; and, wot\xe2\x80\x99s much the same, that it ain\xe2\x80\x99t true. I say that that\r\ncoachman did not run away; but that he died game--game as pheasants; and\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t hear nothin\xe2\x80\x99 said to the contrairey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the mottled-faced gentleman spoke with great energy and\r\ndetermination, and as the opinions of the company seemed divided on the\r\nsubject, it threatened to give rise to fresh altercation, when Mr.\r\nWeller and Mr. Pell most opportunely arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The officer will be here at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t run away meanwhile, eh? Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98P\xe2\x80\x99raps my cruel pa \xe2\x80\x98ull relent afore then,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, with a broad\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not I,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not on no account,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the inexorable creditor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give bills for the amount, at sixpence a month,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t take \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha, ha! very good, very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Solomon Pell, who was\r\nmaking out his little bill of costs; \xe2\x80\x98a very amusing incident indeed!\r\nBenjamin, copy that.\xe2\x80\x99 And Mr. Pell smiled again, as he called Mr.\r\nWeller\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the amount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the professional gentleman, taking up\r\nanother of the greasy notes as Mr. Weller took it from the pocket-book.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three ten and one ten is five. Much obliged to you, Mr. Weller. Your\r\nson is a most deserving young man, very much so indeed, Sir. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very\r\npleasant trait in a young man\xe2\x80\x99s character, very much so,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr.\r\nPell, smiling smoothly round, as he buttoned up the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot a game it is!\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller, with a chuckle. \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nreg\xe2\x80\x99lar prodigy son!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prodigal--prodigal son, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Mr. Pell, mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with dignity. \xe2\x80\x98I know wot\xe2\x80\x99s o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nSir. Wen I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy the time the officer arrived, Sam had made himself so extremely\r\npopular, that the congregated gentlemen determined to see him to prison\r\nin a body. So off they set; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in\r\narm, the officer in front, and eight stout coachmen bringing up the\r\nrear. At Serjeant\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Coffee-house the whole party halted to refresh,\r\nand, the legal arrangements being completed, the procession moved on\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSome little commotion was occasioned in Fleet Street, by the pleasantry\r\nof the eight gentlemen in the flank, who persevered in walking four\r\nabreast; it was also found necessary to leave the mottled-faced\r\ngentleman behind, to fight a ticket-porter, it being arranged that his\r\nfriends should call for him as they came back. Nothing but these little\r\nincidents occurred on the way. When they reached the gate of the Fleet,\r\nthe cavalcade, taking the time from the plaintiff, gave three tremendous\r\ncheers for the defendant, and, after having shaken hands all round, left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSam, having been formally delivered into the warder\xe2\x80\x99s custody, to the\r\nintense astonishment of Roker, and to the evident emotion of even the\r\nphlegmatic Neddy, passed at once into the prison, walked straight to his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s room, and knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nSam appeared, pulled off his hat, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Sam, my good lad!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, evidently delighted to see\r\nhis humble friend again; \xe2\x80\x98I had no intention of hurting your feelings\r\nyesterday, my faithful fellow, by what I said. Put down your hat, Sam,\r\nand let me explain my meaning, a little more at length.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t presently do, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but why not now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d rayther not now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cause--\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because of what?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, alarmed at his follower\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x98Speak out, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cause,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam--\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little bisness as I want to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What business?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, surprised at Sam\xe2\x80\x99s confused\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 partickler, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, if it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing particular,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\ncan speak with me first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I\xe2\x80\x99d better see arter it at once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, still hesitating.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick looked amazed, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact is--\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, stopping short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Speak out, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, the fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with a desperate effort, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter see arter my bed afore I do anythin\xe2\x80\x99 else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Your bed!_\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my bed, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a prisoner. I was arrested this\r\nhere wery arternoon for debt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You arrested for debt!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, sinking into a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, for debt, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98And the man as puts me in, \xe2\x80\x98ull\r\nnever let me out till you go yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my heart and soul!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot I say, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam. \xe2\x80\x98If it\xe2\x80\x99s forty years to come, I shall be\r\na prisoner, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad on it; and if it had been Newgate, it\r\nwould ha\xe2\x80\x99 been just the same. Now the murder\xe2\x80\x99s out, and, damme, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan end on it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, which he repeated with great emphasis and violence,\r\nSam Weller dashed his hat upon the ground, in a most unusual state of\r\nexcitement; and then, folding his arms, looked firmly and fixedly in his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV. TREATS OF DIVERS LITTLE MATTERS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE\r\nFLEET, AND OF MR. WINKLE\xe2\x80\x99S MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOUR; AND SHOWS HOW THE POOR\r\nCHANCERY PRISONER OBTAINED HIS RELEASE AT LAST\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick felt a great deal too much touched by the warmth of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattachment, to be able to exhibit any manifestation of anger or\r\ndispleasure at the precipitate course he had adopted, in voluntarily\r\nconsigning himself to a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s prison for an indefinite period. The\r\nonly point on which he persevered in demanding an explanation, was, the\r\nname of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s detaining creditor; but this Mr. Weller as perseveringly\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It ain\xe2\x80\x99t o\xe2\x80\x99 no use, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, again and again; \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s a malicious,\r\nbad-disposed, vorldly-minded, spiteful, windictive creetur, with a hard\r\nheart as there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no soft\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99, as the wirtuous clergyman remarked of\r\nthe old gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n with the dropsy, ven he said, that upon the whole he\r\nthought he\xe2\x80\x99d rayther leave his property to his vife than build a chapel\r\nvith it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But consider, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick remonstrated, \xe2\x80\x98the sum is so small\r\nthat it can very easily be paid; and having made up my mind that you\r\nshall stop with me, you should recollect how much more useful you would\r\nbe, if you could go outside the walls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWery much obliged to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller gravely; \xe2\x80\x98but I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrayther not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather not do what, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, I\xe2\x80\x99d rayther not let myself down to ask a favour o\xe2\x80\x99 this here\r\nunremorseful enemy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it is no favour asking him to take his money, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 reasoned Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam, \xe2\x80\x98but it \xe2\x80\x98ud be a wery great favour\r\nto pay it, and he don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve none; that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his nose with an air of some vexation, Mr.\r\nWeller thought it prudent to change the theme of the discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I takes my determination on principle, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and you\r\ntakes yours on the same ground; wich puts me in mind o\xe2\x80\x99 the man as\r\nkilled his-self on principle, wich o\xe2\x80\x99 course you\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd on, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr.\r\nWeller paused when he arrived at this point, and cast a comical look at\r\nhis master out of the corners of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d in the case, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, gradually\r\nbreaking into a smile, in spite of the uneasiness which Sam\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy\r\nhad given him. \xe2\x80\x98The fame of the gentleman in question, never reached my\r\nears.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98You astonish me, Sir; he wos a clerk\r\nin a gov\xe2\x80\x99ment office, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he wos, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98and a wery pleasant gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n\r\ntoo--one o\xe2\x80\x99 the precise and tidy sort, as puts their feet in little\r\nIndia-rubber fire-buckets wen it\xe2\x80\x99s wet weather, and never has no other\r\nbosom friends but hare-skins; he saved up his money on principle, wore a\r\nclean shirt ev\xe2\x80\x99ry day on principle; never spoke to none of his relations\r\non principle, \xe2\x80\x98fear they shou\xe2\x80\x99d want to borrow money of him; and wos\r\naltogether, in fact, an uncommon agreeable character. He had his hair\r\ncut on principle vunce a fortnight, and contracted for his clothes on\r\nthe economic principle--three suits a year, and send back the old uns.\r\nBeing a wery reg\xe2\x80\x99lar gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, he din\xe2\x80\x99d ev\xe2\x80\x99ry day at the same place,\r\nwhere it was one-and-nine to cut off the joint, and a wery good one-and-\r\nnine\xe2\x80\x99s worth he used to cut, as the landlord often said, with the tears\r\na-tricklin\xe2\x80\x99 down his face, let alone the way he used to poke the fire in\r\nthe vinter time, which wos a dead loss o\xe2\x80\x99 four-pence ha\xe2\x80\x99penny a day, to\r\nsay nothin\xe2\x80\x99 at all o\xe2\x80\x99 the aggrawation o\xe2\x80\x99 seein\xe2\x80\x99 him do it.

Finding all gentle remonstrance useless, Mr.\r\nPickwick at length yielded a reluctant consent to his taking lodgings by\r\nthe week, of a bald-headed cobbler, who rented a small slip room in one\r\nof the upper galleries. To this humble apartment Mr. Weller moved a\r\nmattress and bedding, which he hired of Mr. Roker; and, by the time he\r\nlay down upon it at night, was as much at home as if he had been bred in\r\nthe prison, and his whole family had vegetated therein for three\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you always smoke arter you goes to bed, old cock?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr.\r\nWeller of his landlord, when they had both retired for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I does, young bantam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cobbler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to in-quire wy you make up your bed under that \xe2\x80\x98ere\r\ndeal table?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cause I was always used to a four-poster afore I came here, and I find\r\nthe legs of the table answer just as well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cobbler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a character, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got anything of the kind belonging to me,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the\r\ncobbler, shaking his head; \xe2\x80\x98and if you want to meet with a good one, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll find some difficulty in suiting yourself at this register\r\noffice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe above short dialogue took place as Mr. Weller lay extended on his\r\nmattress at one end of the room, and the cobbler on his, at the other;\r\nthe apartment being illumined by the light of a rush-candle, and the\r\ncobbler\xe2\x80\x99s pipe, which was glowing below the table, like a red-hot coal.\r\nThe conversation, brief as it was, predisposed Mr. Weller strongly in\r\nhis landlord\xe2\x80\x99s favour; and, raising himself on his elbow, he took a more\r\nlengthened survey of his appearance than he had yet had either time or\r\ninclination to make.\r\n\r\nHe was a sallow man--all cobblers are; and had a strong bristly beard--\r\nall cobblers have. His face was a queer, good-tempered, crooked-featured\r\npiece of workmanship, ornamented with a couple of eyes that must have\r\nworn a very joyous expression at one time, for they sparkled yet. The\r\nman was sixty, by years, and Heaven knows how old by imprisonment, so\r\nthat his having any look approaching to mirth or contentment, was\r\nsingular enough. He was a little man, and, being half doubled up as he\r\nlay in bed, looked about as long as he ought to have been without his\r\nlegs. He had a great red pipe in his mouth, and was smoking, and staring\r\nat the rush-light, in a state of enviable placidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you been here long?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, breaking the silence which had\r\nlasted for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Twelve year,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cobbler, biting the end of his pipe as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Contempt?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\nThe cobbler nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with some sternness, \xe2\x80\x98wot do you persevere in\r\nbein\xe2\x80\x99 obstinit for, vastin\xe2\x80\x99 your precious life away, in this here\r\nmagnified pound? Wy don\xe2\x80\x99t you give in, and tell the Chancellorship that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re wery sorry for makin\xe2\x80\x99 his court contemptible, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t do so\r\nno more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth, while he smiled,\r\nand then brought it back to its old place again; but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, urging his question strenuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cobbler, \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand these matters. What\r\ndo you suppose ruined me, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, trimming the rush-light, \xe2\x80\x98I s\xe2\x80\x99pose the beginnin\xe2\x80\x99 wos,\r\nthat you got into debt, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never owed a farden,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cobbler; \xe2\x80\x98try again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98you bought houses, wich is delicate English\r\nfor goin\xe2\x80\x99 mad; or took to buildin\xe2\x80\x99, wich is a medical term for bein\xe2\x80\x99\r\nincurable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cobbler shook his head and said, \xe2\x80\x98Try again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to law, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never in my life,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cobbler. \xe2\x80\x98The fact is, I was ruined by\r\nhaving money left me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98that von\xe2\x80\x99t do. I wish some rich enemy \xe2\x80\x98ud try\r\nto vork my destruction in that \xe2\x80\x98ere vay. I\xe2\x80\x99d let him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I dare say you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cobbler, quietly smoking\r\nhis pipe. \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if I was you; but it\xe2\x80\x99s true for all that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How wos it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, half induced to believe the fact already, by\r\nthe look the cobbler gave him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just this,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cobbler; \xe2\x80\x98an old gentleman that I worked for,\r\ndown in the country, and a humble relation of whose I married--she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead, God bless her, and thank Him for it!--was seized with a fit and\r\nwent off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, who was growing sleepy after the numerous events\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How should I know where he went?\xe2\x80\x99 said the cobbler, speaking through\r\nhis nose in an intense enjoyment of his pipe. \xe2\x80\x98He went off dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cobbler, \xe2\x80\x98he left five thousand pound behind him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And wery gen-teel in him so to do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of which,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the cobbler, \xe2\x80\x98he left to me, \xe2\x80\x98cause I married\r\nhis relation, you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And being surrounded by a great number of nieces and nevys, as was\r\nalways quarrelling and fighting among themselves for the property, he\r\nmakes me his executor, and leaves the rest to me in trust, to divide it\r\namong \xe2\x80\x98em as the will prowided.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot do you mean by leavin\xe2\x80\x99 it on trust?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, waking up a\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x98If it ain\xe2\x80\x99t ready-money, were\xe2\x80\x99s the use on it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a law term, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cobbler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s wery little\r\ntrust at that shop. Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever, go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWell,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cobbler, \xe2\x80\x98when I was going to take out a probate of the\r\nwill, the nieces and nevys, who was desperately disappointed at not\r\ngetting all the money, enters a caveat against it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A legal instrument, which is as much as to say, it\xe2\x80\x99s no go,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nthe cobbler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98a sort of brother-in-law o\xe2\x80\x99 the have-his-carcass.\r\nWell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the cobbler, \xe2\x80\x98finding that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree among\r\nthemselves, and consequently couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get up a case against the will,\r\nthey withdrew the caveat, and I paid all the legacies. I\xe2\x80\x99d hardly done\r\nit, when one nevy brings an action to set the will aside. The case comes\r\non, some months afterwards, afore a deaf old gentleman, in a back room\r\nsomewhere down by Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Churchyard; and arter four counsels had taken a\r\nday a-piece to bother him regularly, he takes a week or two to consider,\r\nand read the evidence in six volumes, and then gives his judgment that\r\nhow the testator was not quite right in his head, and I must pay all the\r\nmoney back again, and all the costs. I appealed; the case come on before\r\nthree or four very sleepy gentlemen, who had heard it all before in the\r\nother court, where they\xe2\x80\x99re lawyers without work; the only difference\r\nbeing, that, there, they\xe2\x80\x99re called doctors, and in the other place\r\ndelegates, if you understand that; and they very dutifully confirmed the\r\ndecision of the old gentleman below. After that, we went into Chancery,\r\nwhere we are still, and where I shall always be. My lawyers have had all\r\nmy thousand pound long ago; and what between the estate, as they call\r\nit, and the costs, I\xe2\x80\x99m here for ten thousand, and shall stop here, till\r\nI die, mending shoes. Some gentlemen have talked of bringing it before\r\nParliament, and I dare say would have done it, only they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to\r\ncome to me, and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t power to go to them, and they got tired of my\r\nlong letters, and dropped the business. And this is God\xe2\x80\x99s truth, without\r\none word of suppression or exaggeration, as fifty people, both in this\r\nplace and out of it, very well know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cobbler paused to ascertain what effect his story had produced on\r\nSam; but finding that he had dropped asleep, knocked the ashes out of\r\nhis pipe, sighed, put it down, drew the bed-clothes over his head, and\r\nwent to sleep, too.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was sitting at breakfast, alone, next morning (Sam being\r\nbusily engaged in the cobbler\xe2\x80\x99s room, polishing his master\xe2\x80\x99s shoes and\r\nbrushing the black gaiters) when there came a knock at the door, which,\r\nbefore Mr. Pickwick could cry \xe2\x80\x98Come in!\xe2\x80\x99 was followed by the appearance\r\nof a head of hair and a cotton-velvet cap, both of which articles of\r\ndress he had no difficulty in recognising as the personal property of\r\nMr. Smangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said that worthy, accompanying the inquiry with a score\r\nor two of nods; \xe2\x80\x98I say--do you expect anybody this morning? Three men--\r\ndevilish gentlemanly fellows--have been asking after you downstairs, and\r\nknocking at every door on the hall flight; for which they\xe2\x80\x99ve been most\r\ninfernally blown up by the collegians that had the trouble of opening\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me! How very foolish of them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, rising. \xe2\x80\x98Yes; I\r\nhave no doubt they are some friends whom I rather expected to see,\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friends of yours!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Smangle, seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say no more. Curse me, they\xe2\x80\x99re friends of mine from this minute, and\r\nfriends of Mivins\xe2\x80\x99s, too. Infernal pleasant, gentlemanly dog, Mivins,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle, with great feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know so little of the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, hesitating,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know you do,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Smangle, clasping Mr. Pickwick by the\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x98You shall know him better. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be delighted with him. That\r\nman, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle, with a solemn countenance, \xe2\x80\x98has comic powers\r\nthat would do honour to Drury Lane Theatre.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, by Jove he has!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Smangle. \xe2\x80\x98Hear him come the four cats in\r\nthe wheel-barrow--four distinct cats, sir, I pledge you my honour. Now\r\nyou know that\xe2\x80\x99s infernal clever! Damme, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help liking a man,\r\nwhen you see these traits about him. He\xe2\x80\x99s only one fault--that little\r\nfailing I mentioned to you, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Smangle shook his head in a confidential and sympathising manner\r\nat this juncture, Mr. Pickwick felt that he was expected to say\r\nsomething, so he said, \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 and looked restlessly at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Mr. Smangle, with a long-drawn sigh. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s delightful\r\ncompany, that man is, sir. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know better company anywhere; but he\r\nhas that one drawback. If the ghost of his grandfather, Sir, was to rise\r\nbefore him this minute, he\xe2\x80\x99d ask him for the loan of his acceptance on\r\nan eightpenny stamp.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDear me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Smangle; \xe2\x80\x98and if he\xe2\x80\x99d the power of raising him again,\r\nhe would, in two months and three days from this time, to renew the\r\nbill!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those are very remarkable traits,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nthat while we are talking here, my friends may be in a state of great\r\nperplexity at not finding me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll show \xe2\x80\x98em the way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Smangle, making for the door. \xe2\x80\x98Good-day. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t disturb you while they\xe2\x80\x99re here, you know. By the bye--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Smangle pronounced the last three words, he stopped suddenly,\r\nreclosed the door which he had opened, and, walking softly back to Mr.\r\nPickwick, stepped close up to him on tiptoe, and said, in a very soft\r\nwhisper--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it convenient to lend me half-a-crown till the latter\r\nend of next week, could you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick could scarcely forbear smiling, but managing to preserve\r\nhis gravity, he drew forth the coin, and placed it in Mr. Smangle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalm; upon which, that gentleman, with many nods and winks, implying\r\nprofound mystery, disappeared in quest of the three strangers, with whom\r\nhe presently returned; and having coughed thrice, and nodded as many\r\ntimes, as an assurance to Mr. Pickwick that he would not forget to pay,\r\nhe shook hands all round, in an engaging manner, and at length took\r\nhimself off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear friends,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, shaking hands alternately with Mr.\r\nTupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass, who were the three visitors in\r\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x98I am delighted to see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe triumvirate were much affected. Mr. Tupman shook his head\r\ndeploringly, Mr. Snodgrass drew forth his handkerchief, with undisguised\r\nemotion; and Mr. Winkle retired to the window, and sniffed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mornin\xe2\x80\x99, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, entering at the moment with the shoes\r\nand gaiters. \xe2\x80\x98Avay vith melincholly, as the little boy said ven his\r\nschoolmissus died. Velcome to the college, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This foolish fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, tapping Sam on the head as he\r\nknelt down to button up his master\xe2\x80\x99s gaiters--\xe2\x80\x98this foolish fellow has\r\ngot himself arrested, in order to be near me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the three friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a--stand steady, sir, if you please--\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a prisoner, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n. Con-fined, as the lady said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A prisoner!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Winkle, with unaccountable vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 responded Sam, looking up. \xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had hoped, Sam, that--Nothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle\r\nprecipitately.\r\n\r\nThere was something so very abrupt and unsettled in Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s manner,\r\nthat Mr. Pickwick involuntarily looked at his two friends for an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, answering this mute appeal aloud. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nhas been much excited for two days past, and his whole demeanour very\r\nunlike what it usually is. We feared there must be something the matter,\r\nbut he resolutely denies it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, colouring beneath Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s gaze; \xe2\x80\x98there\r\nis really nothing. I assure you there is nothing, my dear sir. It will\r\nbe necessary for me to leave town, for a short time, on private\r\nbusiness, and I had hoped to have prevailed upon you to allow Sam to\r\naccompany me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick looked more astonished than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 faltered Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98that Sam would have had no objection to\r\ndo so; but, of course, his being a prisoner here, renders it impossible.\r\nSo I must go alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Winkle said these words, Mr. Pickwick felt, with some\r\nastonishment, that Sam\xe2\x80\x99s fingers were trembling at the gaiters, as if he\r\nwere rather surprised or startled. Sam looked up at Mr. Winkle, too,\r\nwhen he had finished speaking; and though the glance they exchanged was\r\ninstantaneous, they seemed to understand each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know anything of this, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, beginning to button with\r\nextraordinary assiduity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure so far, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heerd\r\nanythin\xe2\x80\x99 on the subject afore this moment. If I makes any guess about\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 added Sam, looking at Mr. Winkle, \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any right to say\r\nwhat it is, \xe2\x80\x98fear it should be a wrong \xe2\x80\x98un.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of\r\na friend, however intimate a friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, after a short\r\nsilence; \xe2\x80\x98at present let me merely say, that I do not understand this at\r\nall. There. We have had quite enough of the subject.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus expressing himself, Mr. Pickwick led the conversation to different\r\ntopics, and Mr. Winkle gradually appeared more at ease, though still\r\nvery far from being completely so. They had all so much to converse\r\nabout, that the morning very quickly passed away; and when, at three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mr. Weller produced upon the little dining-table, a roast leg\r\nof mutton and an enormous meat-pie, with sundry dishes of vegetables,\r\nand pots of porter, which stood upon the chairs or the sofa bedstead, or\r\nwhere they could, everybody felt disposed to do justice to the meal,\r\nnotwithstanding that the meat had been purchased, and dressed, and the\r\npie made, and baked, at the prison cookery hard by.\r\n\r\nTo these succeeded a bottle or two of very good wine, for which a\r\nmessenger was despatched by Mr. Pickwick to the Horn Coffee-house, in\r\nDoctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons. The bottle or two, indeed, might be more properly\r\ndescribed as a bottle or six, for by the time it was drunk, and tea\r\nover, the bell began to ring for strangers to withdraw.\r\n\r\nBut, if Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour had been unaccountable in the morning, it\r\nbecame perfectly unearthly and solemn when, under the influence of his\r\nfeelings, and his share of the bottle or six, he prepared to take leave\r\nof his friend. He lingered behind, until Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass\r\nhad disappeared, and then fervently clenched Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hand, with\r\nan expression of face in which deep and mighty resolve was fearfully\r\nblended with the very concentrated essence of gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, my dear Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle between his set teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless you, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the warm-hearted Mr. Pickwick, as\r\nhe returned the pressure of his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Tupman from the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, directly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle. \xe2\x80\x98Good-night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nThere was another good-night, and another, and half a dozen more after\r\nthat, and still Mr. Winkle had fast hold of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and was\r\nlooking into his face with the same strange expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick at last, when his arm was\r\nquite sore with shaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then, good-night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, attempting to disengage his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend, my benefactor, my honoured companion,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mr. Winkle,\r\ncatching at his wrist. \xe2\x80\x98Do not judge me harshly; do not, when you hear\r\nthat, driven to extremity by hopeless obstacles, I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Tupman, reappearing at the door. \xe2\x80\x98Are you coming,\r\nor are we to be locked in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, I am ready,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle. And with a violent effort he\r\ntore himself away.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick was gazing down the passage after them in silent\r\nastonishment, Sam Weller appeared at the stair-head, and whispered for\r\none moment in Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly, depend upon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, sir. You won\xe2\x80\x99t forget, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wish you luck, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, touching his hat. \xe2\x80\x98I should very much\r\nliked to ha\xe2\x80\x99 joined you, Sir; but the gov\xe2\x80\x99nor, o\xe2\x80\x99 course, is paramount.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very much to your credit that you remain here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle.\r\nWith these words they disappeared down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, going back into his room, and\r\nseating himself at the table in a musing attitude. \xe2\x80\x98What can that young\r\nman be going to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had sat ruminating about the matter for some time, when the voice of\r\nRoker, the turnkey, demanded whether he might come in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By all means,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you a softer pillow, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, \xe2\x80\x98instead of the\r\ntemporary one you had last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Will you take a glass of wine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wery good, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Roker, accepting the proffered\r\nglass. \xe2\x80\x98Yours, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say that your landlord\xe2\x80\x99s wery bad to-night, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nRoker, setting down the glass, and inspecting the lining of his hat\r\npreparatory to putting it on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! The Chancery prisoner!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He won\xe2\x80\x99t be a Chancery prisoner wery long, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Roker, turning\r\nhis hat round, so as to get the maker\xe2\x80\x99s name right side upwards, as he\r\nlooked into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You make my blood run cold,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s been consumptive for a long time past,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Roker, \xe2\x80\x98and he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaken wery bad in the breath to-night. The doctor said, six months ago,\r\nthat nothing but change of air could save him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98has this man been slowly\r\nmurdered by the law for six months?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Roker, weighing the hat by the brim\r\nin both hands. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99d have been took the same, wherever he was.\r\nHe went into the infirmary, this morning; the doctor says his strength\r\nis to be kept up as much as possible; and the warden\xe2\x80\x99s sent him wine and\r\nbroth and that, from his own house. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the warden\xe2\x80\x99s fault, you\r\nknow, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, however,\xe2\x80\x99 said Roker, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x98that it\xe2\x80\x99s all up\r\nwith him. I offered Neddy two six-penn\xe2\x80\x99orths to one upon it just now,\r\nbut he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it, and quite right. Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Sir. Good-night,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98Where is this infirmary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just over where you slept, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Roker. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you, if you\r\nlike to come.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Pickwick snatched up his hat without speaking, and\r\nfollowed at once.\r\n\r\nThe turnkey led the way in silence; and gently raising the latch of the\r\nroom door, motioned Mr. Pickwick to enter. It was a large, bare,\r\ndesolate room, with a number of stump bedsteads made of iron, on one of\r\nwhich lay stretched the shadow of a man--wan, pale, and ghastly. His\r\nbreathing was hard and thick, and he moaned painfully as it came and\r\nwent. At the bedside sat a short old man in a cobbler\xe2\x80\x99s apron, who, by\r\nthe aid of a pair of horn spectacles, was reading from the Bible aloud.\r\nIt was the fortunate legatee.\r\n\r\nThe sick man laid his hand upon his attendant\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and motioned him to\r\nstop. He closed the book, and laid it on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Open the window,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sick man.\r\n\r\nHe did so. The noise of carriages and carts, the rattle of wheels, the\r\ncries of men and boys, all the busy sounds of a mighty multitude\r\ninstinct with life and occupation, blended into one deep murmur, floated\r\ninto the room. Above the hoarse loud hum, arose, from time to time, a\r\nboisterous laugh; or a scrap of some jingling song, shouted forth, by\r\none of the giddy crowd, would strike upon the ear, for an instant, and\r\nthen be lost amidst the roar of voices and the tramp of footsteps; the\r\nbreaking of the billows of the restless sea of life, that rolled heavily\r\non, without. These are melancholy sounds to a quiet listener at any\r\ntime; but how melancholy to the watcher by the bed of death!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no air here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man faintly. \xe2\x80\x98The place pollutes it. It\r\nwas fresh round about, when I walked there, years ago; but it grows hot\r\nand heavy in passing these walls. I cannot breathe it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have breathed it together, for a long time,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence, during which the two spectators approached\r\nthe bed. The sick man drew a hand of his old fellow-prisoner towards\r\nhim, and pressing it affectionately between both his own, retained it in\r\nhis grasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 he gasped after a while, so faintly that they bent their ears\r\nclose over the bed to catch the half-formed sounds his pale lips gave\r\nvent to--\xe2\x80\x98I hope my merciful Judge will bear in mind my heavy punishment\r\non earth. Twenty years, my friend, twenty years in this hideous grave!\r\nMy heart broke when my child died, and I could not even kiss him in his\r\nlittle coffin. My loneliness since then, in all this noise and riot, has\r\nbeen very dreadful. May God forgive me! He has seen my solitary,\r\nlingering death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe folded his hands, and murmuring something more they could not hear,\r\nfell into a sleep--only a sleep at first, for they saw him smile.\r\n\r\nThey whispered together for a little time, and the turnkey, stooping\r\nover the pillow, drew hastily back. \xe2\x80\x98He has got his discharge, by G--!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the man.\r\n\r\nHe had. But he had grown so like death in life, that they knew not when\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV. DESCRIPTIVE OF AN AFFECTING INTERVIEW BETWEEN MR. SAMUEL\r\nWELLER AND A FAMILY PARTY. MR. PICKWICK MAKES A TOUR OF THE DIMINUTIVE\r\nWORLD HE INHABITS, AND RESOLVES TO MIX WITH IT, IN FUTURE, AS LITTLE AS\r\nPOSSIBLE\r\n\r\nA few mornings after his incarceration, Mr. Samuel Weller, having\r\narranged his master\xe2\x80\x99s room with all possible care, and seen him\r\ncomfortably seated over his books and papers, withdrew to employ himself\r\nfor an hour or two to come, as he best could. It was a fine morning, and\r\nit occurred to Sam that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten\r\nhis next quarter of an hour or so, as well as any little amusement in\r\nwhich he could indulge.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, he betook himself to the tap. Having\r\npurchased the beer, and obtained, moreover, the day-but-one-before-\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s paper, he repaired to the skittle-ground, and seating\r\nhimself on a bench, proceeded to enjoy himself in a very sedate and\r\nmethodical manner.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he took a refreshing draught of the beer, and then he\r\nlooked up at a window, and bestowed a platonic wink on a young lady who\r\nwas peeling potatoes thereat. Then he opened the paper, and folded it so\r\nas to get the police reports outwards; and this being a vexatious and\r\ndifficult thing to do, when there is any wind stirring, he took another\r\ndraught of the beer when he had accomplished it. Then, he read two lines\r\nof the paper, and stopped short to look at a couple of men who were\r\nfinishing a game at rackets, which, being concluded, he cried out \xe2\x80\x98wery\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x99 in an approving manner, and looked round upon the spectators, to\r\nascertain whether their sentiments coincided with his own. This involved\r\nthe necessity of looking up at the windows also; and as the young lady\r\nwas still there, it was an act of common politeness to wink again, and\r\nto drink to her good health in dumb show, in another draught of the\r\nbeer, which Sam did; and having frowned hideously upon a small boy who\r\nhad noted this latter proceeding with open eyes, he threw one leg over\r\nthe other, and, holding the newspaper in both hands, began to read in\r\nreal earnest.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly composed himself into the needful state of abstraction,\r\nwhen he thought he heard his own name proclaimed in some distant\r\npassage. Nor was he mistaken, for it quickly passed from mouth to mouth,\r\nand in a few seconds the air teemed with shouts of \xe2\x80\x98Weller!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere!\xe2\x80\x99 roared Sam, in a stentorian voice. \xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Who wants\r\nhim? Has an express come to say that his country house is afire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somebody wants you in the hall,\xe2\x80\x99 said a man who was standing by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just mind that \xe2\x80\x98ere paper and the pot, old feller, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a-comin\xe2\x80\x99. Blessed, if they was a-callin\xe2\x80\x99 me to the bar, they\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make more noise about it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAccompanying these words with a gentle rap on the head of the young\r\ngentleman before noticed, who, unconscious of his close vicinity to the\r\nperson in request, was screaming \xe2\x80\x98Weller!\xe2\x80\x99 with all his might, Sam\r\nhastened across the ground, and ran up the steps into the hall. Here,\r\nthe first object that met his eyes was his beloved father sitting on a\r\nbottom stair, with his hat in his hand, shouting out \xe2\x80\x98Weller!\xe2\x80\x99 in his\r\nvery loudest tone, at half-minute intervals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot are you a-roarin\xe2\x80\x99 at?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam impetuously, when the old gentleman\r\nhad discharged himself of another shout; \xe2\x80\x98making yourself so precious\r\nhot that you looks like a aggrawated glass-blower. Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98I began to be afeerd that you\xe2\x80\x99d gone\r\nfor a walk round the Regency Park, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98none o\xe2\x80\x99 them taunts agin the wictim o\xe2\x80\x99 avarice, and\r\ncome off that \xe2\x80\x98ere step.

Wot are you bustin\xe2\x80\x99 vith, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, wiping his forehead, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeerd that vun o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthese days I shall laugh myself into a appleplexy, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, then, wot do you do it for?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Now, then, wot have you\r\ngot to say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who do you think\xe2\x80\x99s come here with me, Samivel?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller,\r\ndrawing back a pace or two, pursing up his mouth, and extending his\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pell?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller shook his head, and his red cheeks expanded with the laughter\r\nthat was endeavouring to find a vent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mottled-faced man, p\xe2\x80\x99raps?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Sam.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Weller shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who then?\xe2\x80\x99asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your mother-in-law,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller; and it was lucky he did say it,\r\nor his cheeks must inevitably have cracked, from their most unnatural\r\ndistension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your mother-in-law, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98and the red-nosed man, my\r\nboy; and the red-nosed man. Ho! ho! ho!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this, Mr. Weller launched into convulsions of laughter, while Sam\r\nregarded him with a broad grin gradually over-spreading his whole\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ve come to have a little serious talk with you, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller, wiping his eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let out nothin\xe2\x80\x99 about the unnat\xe2\x80\x99ral\r\ncreditor, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot, don\xe2\x80\x99t they know who it is?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit on it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vere are they?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, reciprocating all the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s grins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the snuggery,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Catch the red-nosed man a-goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanyvere but vere the liquors is; not he, Samivel, not he. Ve\xe2\x80\x99d a wery\r\npleasant ride along the road from the Markis this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Weller, when he felt himself equal to the task of speaking in an\r\narticulate manner. \xe2\x80\x98I drove the old piebald in that \xe2\x80\x98ere little chay-\r\ncart as belonged to your mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s first wenter, into vich a harm-\r\ncheer wos lifted for the shepherd; and I\xe2\x80\x99m blessed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller,\r\nwith a look of deep scorn--\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m blessed if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring a portable\r\nflight o\xe2\x80\x99 steps out into the road a-front o\xe2\x80\x99 our door for him, to get up\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do mean that, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father, \xe2\x80\x98and I vish you could ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nseen how tight he held on by the sides wen he did get up, as if he wos\r\nafeerd o\xe2\x80\x99 being precipitayted down full six foot, and dashed into a\r\nmillion hatoms. He tumbled in at last, however, and avay ve vent; and I\r\nrayther think--I say I rayther think, Samivel--that he found his-self a\r\nlittle jolted ven ve turned the corners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose you happened to drive up agin a post or two?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeerd,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, in a rapture of winks--\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeerd I\r\ntook vun or two on \xe2\x80\x98em, Sammy; he wos a-flyin\xe2\x80\x99 out o\xe2\x80\x99 the arm-cheer all\r\nthe way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the old gentleman shook his head from side to side, and was seized\r\nwith a hoarse internal rumbling, accompanied with a violent swelling of\r\nthe countenance, and a sudden increase in the breadth of all his\r\nfeatures; symptoms which alarmed his son not a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened, Sammy, don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old\r\ngentleman, when by dint of much struggling, and various convulsive\r\nstamps upon the ground, he had recovered his voice. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only a kind o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nquiet laugh as I\xe2\x80\x99m a-tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to come, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s wot it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99d better not try to come it\r\nagin. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find it rayther a dangerous inwention.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you like it, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with the tears still running down his cheeks,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it \xe2\x80\x98ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a wery great accommodation to me if I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 done\r\nit, and \xe2\x80\x98ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 saved a good many vords atween your mother-in-law and\r\nme, sometimes; but I\xe2\x80\x99m afeerd you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Sammy, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much in the\r\nappleplexy line--a deal too much, Samivel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis conversation brought them to the door of the snuggery, into which\r\nSam--pausing for an instant to look over his shoulder, and cast a sly\r\nleer at his respected progenitor, who was still giggling behind--at once\r\nled the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother-in-law,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, politely saluting the lady, \xe2\x80\x98wery much\r\nobliged to you for this here wisit.--Shepherd, how air you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Samuel!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98This is dreadful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit on it, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.--\xe2\x80\x98Is it, shepherd?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins raised his hands, and turned up his eyes, until the whites-\r\n-or rather the yellows--were alone visible; but made no reply in words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this here gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n troubled with any painful complaint?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam,\r\nlooking to his mother-in-law for explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The good man is grieved to see you here, Samuel,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I was afeerd, from his manner, that\r\nhe might ha\xe2\x80\x99 forgotten to take pepper vith that \xe2\x80\x98ere last cowcumber he\r\neat. Set down, Sir, ve make no extra charge for settin\xe2\x80\x99 down, as the\r\nking remarked wen he blowed up his ministers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins ostentatiously, \xe2\x80\x98I fear you are not\r\nsoftened by imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98wot wos you graciously pleased to\r\nhobserve?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I apprehend, young man, that your nature is no softer for this\r\nchastening,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re wery kind to say so. I hope my natur is _NOT\r\n_ a soft vun, Sir. Wery much obliged to you for your good opinion, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this point of the conversation, a sound, indecorously approaching to\r\na laugh, was heard to proceed from the chair in which the elder Mr.\r\nWeller was seated; upon which Mrs. Weller, on a hasty consideration of\r\nall the circumstances of the case, considered it her bounden duty to\r\nbecome gradually hysterical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. W. (the old gentleman was seated in a corner);\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Weller! Come forth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery much obleeged to you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98but I\xe2\x80\x99m quite\r\ncomfortable vere I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUpon this, Mrs. Weller burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s gone wrong, mum?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Samuel!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98your father makes me wretched. Will\r\nnothing do him good?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you hear this here?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Lady vants to know vether nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ull do you good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery much indebted to Mrs. Weller for her po-lite inquiries, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I think a pipe vould benefit me a good deal.\r\nCould I be accommodated, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Weller let fall some more tears, and Mr. Stiggins groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo! Here\xe2\x80\x99s this unfortunate gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n took ill agin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam,\r\nlooking round. \xe2\x80\x98Vere do you feel it now, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the same place, young man,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Stiggins, \xe2\x80\x98in the same\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vere may that be, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, with great outward simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the buzzim, young man,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Stiggins, placing his umbrella\r\non his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nAt this affecting reply, Mrs. Weller, being wholly unable to suppress\r\nher feelings, sobbed aloud, and stated her conviction that the red-nosed\r\nman was a saint; whereupon Mr. Weller, senior, ventured to suggest, in\r\nan undertone, that he must be the representative of the united parishes\r\nof St. Simon Without and St. Walker Within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afeered, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98that this here gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, with the twist\r\nin his countenance, feels rather thirsty, with the melancholy spectacle\r\nafore him. Is it the case, mum?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe worthy lady looked at Mr. Stiggins for a reply; that gentleman, with\r\nmany rollings of the eye, clenched his throat with his right hand, and\r\nmimicked the act of swallowing, to intimate that he was athirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid, Samuel, that his feelings have made him so indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs. Weller mournfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s your usual tap, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear young friend,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Stiggins, \xe2\x80\x98all taps is\r\nvanities!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too true, too true, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller, murmuring a groan, and\r\nshaking her head assentingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I des-say they may be, sir; but wich is your\r\npartickler wanity? Wich wanity do you like the flavour on best, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear young friend,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Stiggins, \xe2\x80\x98I despise them all.\r\nIf,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins--\xe2\x80\x98if there is any one of them less odious than\r\nanother, it is the liquor called rum. Warm, my dear young friend, with\r\nthree lumps of sugar to the tumbler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery sorry to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98that they don\xe2\x80\x99t allow that\r\nparticular wanity to be sold in this here establishment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, the hardness of heart of these inveterate men!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr.\r\nStiggins. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, the accursed cruelty of these inhuman persecutors!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Stiggins again cast up his eyes, and rapped his\r\nbreast with his umbrella; and it is but justice to the reverend\r\ngentleman to say, that his indignation appeared very real and unfeigned\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Weller and the red-nosed gentleman had commented on this\r\ninhuman usage in a very forcible manner, and had vented a variety of\r\npious and holy execrations against its authors, the latter recommended a\r\nbottle of port wine, warmed with a little water, spice, and sugar, as\r\nbeing grateful to the stomach, and savouring less of vanity than many\r\nother compounds. It was accordingly ordered to be prepared, and pending\r\nits preparation the red-nosed man and Mrs. Weller looked at the elder W.\r\nand groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll find your spirits rose\r\nby this here lively wisit. Wery cheerful and improvin\xe2\x80\x99 conwersation,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a reprobate,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98and I desire you won\xe2\x80\x99t address no\r\nmore o\xe2\x80\x99 them ungraceful remarks to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo far from being edified by this very proper reply, the elder Mr.\r\nWeller at once relapsed into a broad grin; and this inexorable conduct\r\ncausing the lady and Mr. Stiggins to close their eyes, and rock\r\nthemselves to and fro on their chairs, in a troubled manner, he\r\nfurthermore indulged in several acts of pantomime, indicative of a\r\ndesire to pummel and wring the nose of the aforesaid Stiggins, the\r\nperformance of which, appeared to afford him great mental relief. The\r\nold gentleman very narrowly escaped detection in one instance; for Mr.\r\nStiggins happening to give a start on the arrival of the negus, brought\r\nhis head in smart contact with the clenched fist with which Mr. Weller\r\nhad been describing imaginary fireworks in the air, within two inches of\r\nhis ear, for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot are you a-reachin\xe2\x80\x99 out, your hand for the tumbler in that \xe2\x80\x98ere\r\nsawage way for?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with great promptitude. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhit the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to do it, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, in some degree abashed\r\nby the very unexpected occurrence of the incident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try an in\xe2\x80\x99ard application, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, as the red-nosed gentleman\r\nrubbed his head with a rueful visage. \xe2\x80\x98Wot do you think o\xe2\x80\x99 that, for a\r\ngo o\xe2\x80\x99 wanity, warm, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins made no verbal answer, but his manner was expressive. He\r\ntasted the contents of the glass which Sam had placed in his hand, put\r\nhis umbrella on the floor, and tasted it again, passing his hand\r\nplacidly across his stomach twice or thrice; he then drank the whole at\r\na breath, and smacking his lips, held out the tumbler for more.\r\n\r\nNor was Mrs. Weller behind-hand in doing justice to the composition. The\r\ngood lady began by protesting that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch a drop--then took\r\na small drop--then a large drop--then a great many drops; and her\r\nfeelings being of the nature of those substances which are powerfully\r\naffected by the application of strong waters, she dropped a tear with\r\nevery drop of negus, and so got on, melting the feelings down, until at\r\nlength she had arrived at a very pathetic and decent pitch of misery.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Weller observed these signs and tokens with many\r\nmanifestations of disgust, and when, after a second jug of the same, Mr.\r\nStiggins began to sigh in a dismal manner, he plainly evinced his\r\ndisapprobation of the whole proceedings, by sundry incoherent ramblings\r\nof speech, among which frequent angry repetitions of the word \xe2\x80\x98gammon\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwere alone distinguishable to the ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you wot it is, Samivel, my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the old gentleman\r\ninto his son\xe2\x80\x99s ear, after a long and steadfast contemplation of his lady\r\nand Mr. Stiggins; \xe2\x80\x98I think there must be somethin\xe2\x80\x99 wrong in your mother-\r\nin-law\xe2\x80\x99s inside, as vell as in that o\xe2\x80\x99 the red-nosed man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean this here, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98that wot they\r\ndrink, don\xe2\x80\x99t seem no nourishment to \xe2\x80\x98em; it all turns to warm water, and\r\ncomes a-pourin\xe2\x80\x99 out o\xe2\x80\x99 their eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Pend upon it, Sammy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nconstitootional infirmity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Weller delivered this scientific opinion with many confirmatory\r\nfrowns and nods; which, Mrs. Weller remarking, and concluding that they\r\nbore some disparaging reference either to herself or to Mr. Stiggins, or\r\nto both, was on the point of becoming infinitely worse, when Mr.\r\nStiggins, getting on his legs as well as he could, proceeded to deliver\r\nan edifying discourse for the benefit of the company, but more\r\nespecially of Mr. Samuel, whom he adjured in moving terms to be upon his\r\nguard in that sink of iniquity into which he was cast; to abstain from\r\nall hypocrisy and pride of heart; and to take in all things exact\r\npattern and copy by him (Stiggins), in which case he might calculate on\r\narriving, sooner or later at the comfortable conclusion, that, like him,\r\nhe was a most estimable and blameless character, and that all his\r\nacquaintances and friends were hopelessly abandoned and profligate\r\nwretches. Which consideration, he said, could not but afford him the\r\nliveliest satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe furthermore conjured him to avoid, above all things, the vice of\r\nintoxication, which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine, and to\r\nthose poisonous and baleful drugs which being chewed in the mouth, are\r\nsaid to filch away the memory. At this point of his discourse, the\r\nreverend and red-nosed gentleman became singularly incoherent, and\r\nstaggering to and fro in the excitement of his eloquence, was fain to\r\ncatch at the back of a chair to preserve his perpendicular.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard against\r\nthose false prophets and wretched mockers of religion, who, without\r\nsense to expound its first doctrines, or hearts to feel its first\r\nprinciples, are more dangerous members of society than the common\r\ncriminal; imposing, as they necessarily do, upon the weakest and worst\r\ninformed, casting scorn and contempt on what should be held most sacred,\r\nand bringing into partial disrepute large bodies of virtuous and well-\r\nconducted persons of many excellent sects and persuasions. But as he\r\nleaned over the back of the chair for a considerable time, and closing\r\none eye, winked a good deal with the other, it is presumed that he\r\nthought all this, but kept it to himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the delivery of the oration, Mrs. Weller sobbed and wept at the\r\nend of the paragraphs; while Sam, sitting cross-legged on a chair and\r\nresting his arms on the top rail, regarded the speaker with great\r\nsuavity and blandness of demeanour; occasionally bestowing a look of\r\nrecognition on the old gentleman, who was delighted at the beginning,\r\nand went to sleep about half-way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brayvo; wery pretty!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, when the red-nosed man having finished,\r\npulled his worn gloves on, thereby thrusting his fingers through the\r\nbroken tops till the knuckles were disclosed to view. \xe2\x80\x98Wery pretty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it may do you good, Samuel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Weller solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it vill, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could hope that it would do your father good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nWeller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, senior. \xe2\x80\x98How do you find yourself\r\narter it, my love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scoffer!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Benighted man!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Reverend Mr. Stiggins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I don\xe2\x80\x99t get no better light than that \xe2\x80\x98ere moonshine o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn, my\r\nworthy creetur,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s wery likely as I shall\r\ncontiney to be a night coach till I\xe2\x80\x99m took off the road altogether. Now,\r\nMrs. We, if the piebald stands at livery much longer, he\xe2\x80\x99ll stand at\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 as we go back, and p\xe2\x80\x99raps that \xe2\x80\x98ere harm-cheer \xe2\x80\x98ull be tipped\r\nover into some hedge or another, with the shepherd in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this supposition, the Reverend Mr. Stiggins, in evident\r\nconsternation, gathered up his hat and umbrella, and proposed an\r\nimmediate departure, to which Mrs. Weller assented. Sam walked with them\r\nto the lodge gate, and took a dutiful leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A-do, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s a-do?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sammy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, good-bye, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s wot you\xe2\x80\x99re aimin\xe2\x80\x99 at, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Weller, looking cautiously round; \xe2\x80\x98my duty to\r\nyour gov\xe2\x80\x99nor, and tell him if he thinks better o\xe2\x80\x99 this here bis\xe2\x80\x99ness, to\r\ncom-moonicate vith me. Me and a cab\xe2\x80\x99net-maker has dewised a plan for\r\ngettin\xe2\x80\x99 him out. A pianner, Samivel--a pianner!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller,\r\nstriking his son on the chest with the back of his hand, and falling\r\nback a step or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A pianner-forty, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller, in a still more\r\nmysterious manner, \xe2\x80\x98as he can have on hire; vun as von\xe2\x80\x99t play, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And wot \xe2\x80\x98ud be the good o\xe2\x80\x99 that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let him send to my friend, the cabinet-maker, to fetch it back, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Are you avake, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no vurks in it,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered his father. \xe2\x80\x98It \xe2\x80\x98ull hold him\r\neasy, vith his hat and shoes on, and breathe through the legs, vich his\r\nholler. Have a passage ready taken for \xe2\x80\x98Merriker. The \xe2\x80\x98Merrikin gov\xe2\x80\x99ment\r\nwill never give him up, ven vunce they find as he\xe2\x80\x99s got money to spend,\r\nSammy. Let the gov\xe2\x80\x99nor stop there, till Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s dead, or Mr.\r\nDodson and Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s hung (wich last ewent I think is the most likely to\r\nhappen first, Sammy), and then let him come back and write a book about\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Merrikins as\xe2\x80\x99ll pay all his expenses and more, if he blows \xe2\x80\x98em up\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller delivered this hurried abstract of his plot with great\r\nvehemence of whisper; and then, as if fearful of weakening the effect of\r\nthe tremendous communication by any further dialogue, he gave the\r\ncoachman\xe2\x80\x99s salute, and vanished.\r\n\r\nSam had scarcely recovered his usual composure of countenance, which had\r\nbeen greatly disturbed by the secret communication of his respected\r\nrelative, when Mr. Pickwick accosted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going for a walk round the prison, and I wish you to attend me. I\r\nsee a prisoner we know coming this way, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wich, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n vith the head o\xe2\x80\x99 hair,\r\nor the interestin\xe2\x80\x99 captive in the stockin\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98He is an older friend of yours, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 mine, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You recollect the gentleman very well, I dare say, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nPickwick, \xe2\x80\x98or else you are more unmindful of your old acquaintances than\r\nI think you are. Hush! not a word, Sam; not a syllable. Here he is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick spoke, Jingle walked up. He looked less miserable than\r\nbefore, being clad in a half-worn suit of clothes, which, with Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, had been released from the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s. He wore\r\nclean linen too, and had had his hair cut. He was very pale and thin,\r\nhowever; and as he crept slowly up, leaning on a stick, it was easy to\r\nsee that he had suffered severely from illness and want, and was still\r\nvery weak. He took off his hat as Mr. Pickwick saluted him, and seemed\r\nmuch humbled and abashed at the sight of Sam Weller.\r\n\r\nFollowing close at his heels, came Mr. Job Trotter, in the catalogue of\r\nwhose vices, want of faith and attachment to his companion could at all\r\nevents find no place. He was still ragged and squalid, but his face was\r\nnot quite so hollow as on his first meeting with Mr. Pickwick, a few\r\ndays before. As he took off his hat to our benevolent old friend, he\r\nmurmured some broken expressions of gratitude, and muttered something\r\nabout having been saved from starving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, impatiently interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x98you can\r\nfollow with Sam. I want to speak to you, Mr. Jingle. Can you walk\r\nwithout his arm?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, sir--all ready--not too fast--legs shaky--head queer--round\r\nand round--earthquaky sort of feeling--very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, give me your arm,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jingle; \xe2\x80\x98won\xe2\x80\x99t indeed--rather not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98lean upon me, I desire, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSeeing that he was confused and agitated, and uncertain what to do, Mr.\r\nPickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided stroller\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\nthrough his, and leading him away, without saying another word about it.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time the countenance of Mr. Samuel Weller had\r\nexhibited an expression of the most overwhelming and absorbing\r\nastonishment that the imagination can portray. After looking from Job to\r\nJingle, and from Jingle to Job in profound silence, he softly ejaculated\r\nthe words, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I _am_ damn\xe2\x80\x99d!\xe2\x80\x99 which he repeated at least a score of\r\ntimes; after which exertion, he appeared wholly bereft of speech, and\r\nagain cast his eyes, first upon the one and then upon the other, in mute\r\nperplexity and bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a-comin\xe2\x80\x99, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, mechanically following his\r\nmaster; and still he lifted not his eyes from Mr. Job Trotter, who\r\nwalked at his side in silence.\r\n\r\nJob kept his eyes fixed on the ground for some time. Sam, with his glued\r\nto Job\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, ran up against the people who were walking about,\r\nand fell over little children, and stumbled against steps and railings,\r\nwithout appearing at all sensible of it, until Job, looking stealthily\r\nup, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you do, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It _is_ him!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam; and having established Job\xe2\x80\x99s identity\r\nbeyond all doubt, he smote his leg, and vented his feelings in a long,\r\nshrill whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Things has altered with me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think they had,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller, surveying his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s rags with undisguised wonder. \xe2\x80\x98This is rayther a change for\r\nthe worse, Mr. Trotter, as the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n said, wen he got two doubtful\r\nshillin\xe2\x80\x99s and sixpenn\xe2\x80\x99orth o\xe2\x80\x99 pocket-pieces for a good half-crown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x98There is no deception\r\nnow, Mr. Weller. Tears,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, with a look of momentary slyness--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tears are not the only proofs of distress, nor the best ones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, they ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam expressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They may be put on, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know they may,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98some people, indeed, has \xe2\x80\x98em always ready\r\nlaid on, and can pull out the plug wenever they likes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job; \xe2\x80\x98but these sort of things are not so easily\r\ncounterfeited, Mr. Weller, and it is a more painful process to get them\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x99 As he spoke, he pointed to his sallow, sunken cheeks, and, drawing\r\nup his coat sleeve, disclosed an arm which looked as if the bone could\r\nbe broken at a touch, so sharp and brittle did it appear, beneath its\r\nthin covering of flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot have you been a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 to yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, recoiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been doin\xe2\x80\x99 nothing for many weeks past,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job; and eating\r\nand drinking almost as little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam took one comprehensive glance at Mr. Trotter\xe2\x80\x99s thin face and\r\nwretched apparel; and then, seizing him by the arm, commenced dragging\r\nhim away with great violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are you going, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, vainly struggling in the\r\npowerful grasp of his old enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come on,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam; \xe2\x80\x98come on!\xe2\x80\x99 He deigned no further explanation till\r\nthey reached the tap, and then called for a pot of porter, which was\r\nspeedily produced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98drink that up, ev\xe2\x80\x99ry drop on it, and then turn the pot\r\nupside down, to let me see as you\xe2\x80\x99ve took the medicine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Down vith it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam peremptorily.\r\n\r\nThus admonished, Mr. Trotter raised the pot to his lips, and, by gentle\r\nand almost imperceptible degrees, tilted it into the air. He paused\r\nonce, and only once, to draw a long breath, but without raising his face\r\nfrom the vessel, which, in a few moments thereafter, he held out at\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length, bottom upward. Nothing fell upon the ground but a few\r\nparticles of froth, which slowly detached themselves from the rim, and\r\ntrickled lazily down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98How do you find yourself arter it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better, Sir. I think I am better,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 course you air,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam argumentatively. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s like puttin\xe2\x80\x99 gas in\r\na balloon. I can see with the naked eye that you gets stouter under the\r\noperation. Wot do you say to another o\xe2\x80\x99 the same dimensions?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather not, I am much obliged to you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job--\xe2\x80\x98much\r\nrather not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, then, wot do you say to some wittles?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks to your worthy governor, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trotter, \xe2\x80\x98we have half a\r\nleg of mutton, baked, at a quarter before three, with the potatoes under\r\nit to save boiling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot! Has _he_ been a-purwidin\xe2\x80\x99 for you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Sam emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job. \xe2\x80\x98More than that, Mr. Weller; my master being\r\nvery ill, he got us a room--we were in a kennel before--and paid for it,\r\nSir; and come to look at us, at night, when nobody should know. Mr.\r\nWeller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, with real tears in his eyes, for once, \xe2\x80\x98I could serve\r\nthat gentleman till I fell down dead at his feet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you, my friend! None o\xe2\x80\x99 that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJob Trotter looked amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None o\xe2\x80\x99 that, I say, young feller,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Sam firmly. \xe2\x80\x98No man serves\r\nhim but me. And now we\xe2\x80\x99re upon it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you into another secret\r\nbesides that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, as he paid for the beer. \xe2\x80\x98I never heerd, mind\r\nyou, or read of in story-books, nor see in picters, any angel in tights\r\nand gaiters--not even in spectacles, as I remember, though that may ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen done for anythin\xe2\x80\x99 I know to the contrairey--but mark my vords, Job\r\nTrotter, he\xe2\x80\x99s a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar thoroughbred angel for all that; and let me see\r\nthe man as wenturs to tell me he knows a better vun.\xe2\x80\x99 With this\r\ndefiance, Mr. Weller buttoned up his change in a side pocket, and, with\r\nmany confirmatory nods and gestures by the way, proceeded in search of\r\nthe subject of discourse.\r\n\r\nThey found Mr. Pickwick, in company with Jingle, talking very earnestly,\r\nand not bestowing a look on the groups who were congregated on the\r\nracket-ground; they were very motley groups too, and worth the looking\r\nat, if it were only in idle curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as Sam and his companion drew nigh, \xe2\x80\x98you will\r\nsee how your health becomes, and think about it meanwhile. Make the\r\nstatement out for me when you feel yourself equal to the task, and I\r\nwill discuss the subject with you when I have considered it. Now, go to\r\nyour room. You are tired, and not strong enough to be out long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Jingle, without one spark of his old animation--with nothing\r\neven of the dismal gaiety which he had assumed when Mr. Pickwick first\r\nstumbled on him in his misery--bowed low without speaking, and,\r\nmotioning to Job not to follow him just yet, crept slowly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Curious scene this, is it not, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking good-\r\nhumouredly round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery much so, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Wonders \xe2\x80\x98ull never cease,\xe2\x80\x99 added Sam,\r\nspeaking to himself. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m wery much mistaken if that \xe2\x80\x98ere Jingle worn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na-doin somethin\xe2\x80\x99 in the water-cart way!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe area formed by the wall in that part of the Fleet in which Mr.\r\nPickwick stood was just wide enough to make a good racket-court; one\r\nside being formed, of course, by the wall itself, and the other by that\r\nportion of the prison which looked (or rather would have looked, but for\r\nthe wall) towards St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral. Sauntering or sitting about, in\r\nevery possible attitude of listless idleness, were a great number of\r\ndebtors, the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98going up\xe2\x80\x99 before the Insolvent Court should arrive; while others had\r\nbeen remanded for various terms, which they were idling away as they\r\nbest could. Some were shabby, some were smart, many dirty, a few clean;\r\nbut there they all lounged, and loitered, and slunk about with as little\r\nspirit or purpose as the beasts in a menagerie.\r\n\r\nLolling from the windows which commanded a view of this promenade were a\r\nnumber of persons, some in noisy conversation with their acquaintance\r\nbelow, others playing at ball with some adventurous throwers outside,\r\nothers looking on at the racket-players, or watching the boys as they\r\ncried the game. Dirty, slipshod women passed and repassed, on their way\r\nto the cooking-house in one corner of the yard; children screamed, and\r\nfought, and played together, in another; the tumbling of the skittles,\r\nand the shouts of the players, mingled perpetually with these and a\r\nhundred other sounds; and all was noise and tumult--save in a little\r\nmiserable shed a few yards off, where lay, all quiet and ghastly, the\r\nbody of the Chancery prisoner who had died the night before, awaiting\r\nthe mockery of an inquest. The body! It is the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s term for the\r\nrestless, whirling mass of cares and anxieties, affections, hopes, and\r\ngriefs, that make up the living man. The law had his body; and there it\r\nlay, clothed in grave-clothes, an awful witness to its tender mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you like to see a whistling-shop, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Job Trotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s counter inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A vistlin\xe2\x80\x99 shop, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is that, Sam?--A bird-fancier\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless your heart, no, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job; \xe2\x80\x98a whistling-shop, Sir, is\r\nwhere they sell spirits.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Job Trotter briefly explained here, that\r\nall persons, being prohibited under heavy penalties from conveying\r\nspirits into debtors\xe2\x80\x99 prisons, and such commodities being highly prized\r\nby the ladies and gentlemen confined therein, it had occurred to some\r\nspeculative turnkey to connive, for certain lucrative considerations, at\r\ntwo or three prisoners retailing the favourite article of gin, for their\r\nown profit and advantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This plan, you see, Sir, has been gradually introduced into all the\r\nprisons for debt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Trotter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it has this wery great advantage,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98that the turnkeys\r\ntakes wery good care to seize hold o\xe2\x80\x99 ev\xe2\x80\x99rybody but them as pays \xe2\x80\x98em,\r\nthat attempts the willainy, and wen it gets in the papers they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\napplauded for their wigilance; so it cuts two ways--frightens other\r\npeople from the trade, and elewates their own characters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, but are these rooms never searched to ascertain whether any\r\nspirits are concealed in them?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cert\xe2\x80\x99nly they are, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98but the turnkeys knows\r\nbeforehand, and gives the word to the wistlers, and you may wistle for\r\nit wen you go to look.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy this time, Job had tapped at a door, which was opened by a gentleman\r\nwith an uncombed head, who bolted it after them when they had walked in,\r\nand grinned; upon which Job grinned, and Sam also; whereupon Mr.\r\nPickwick, thinking it might be expected of him, kept on smiling to the\r\nend of the interview.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the uncombed head appeared quite satisfied with this\r\nmute announcement of their business, and, producing a flat stone bottle,\r\nwhich might hold about a couple of quarts, from beneath his bedstead,\r\nfilled out three glasses of gin, which Job Trotter and Sam disposed of\r\nin a most workmanlike manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any more?\xe2\x80\x99 said the whistling gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No more,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job Trotter.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paid, the door was unbolted, and out they came; the\r\nuncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon Mr. Roker, who happened\r\nto be passing at the moment.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot, Mr. Pickwick wandered along all the galleries, up and\r\ndown all the staircases, and once again round the whole area of the\r\nyard. The great body of the prison population appeared to be Mivins, and\r\nSmangle, and the parson, and the butcher, and the leg, over and over,\r\nand over again. There were the same squalor, the same turmoil and noise,\r\nthe same general characteristics, in every corner; in the best and the\r\nworst alike. The whole place seemed restless and troubled; and the\r\npeople were crowding and flitting to and fro, like the shadows in an\r\nuneasy dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have seen enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as he threw himself into a\r\nchair in his little apartment. \xe2\x80\x98My head aches with these scenes, and my\r\nheart too. Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my own room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination. For three\r\nlong months he remained shut up, all day; only stealing out at night to\r\nbreathe the air, when the greater part of his fellow-prisoners were in\r\nbed or carousing in their rooms. His health was beginning to suffer from\r\nthe closeness of the confinement, but neither the often-repeated\r\nentreaties of Perker and his friends, nor the still more frequently-\r\nrepeated warnings and admonitions of Mr. Samuel Weller, could induce him\r\nto alter one jot of his inflexible resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI. RECORDS A TOUCHING ACT OF DELICATE FEELING, NOT UNMIXED\r\nWITH PLEASANTRY, ACHIEVED AND PERFORMED BY Messrs. DODSON AND FOGG\r\n\r\nIt was within a week of the close of the month of July, that a hackney\r\ncabriolet, number unrecorded, was seen to proceed at a rapid pace up\r\nGoswell Street; three people were squeezed into it besides the driver,\r\nwho sat in his own particular little dickey at the side; over the apron\r\nwere hung two shawls, belonging to two small vixenish-looking ladies\r\nunder the apron; between whom, compressed into a very small compass, was\r\nstowed away, a gentleman of heavy and subdued demeanour, who, whenever\r\nhe ventured to make an observation, was snapped up short by one of the\r\nvixenish ladies before-mentioned. Lastly, the two vixenish ladies and\r\nthe heavy gentleman were giving the driver contradictory directions, all\r\ntending to the one point, that he should stop at Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s door;\r\nwhich the heavy gentleman, in direct opposition to, and defiance of, the\r\nvixenish ladies, contended was a green door and not a yellow one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop at the house with a green door, driver,\xe2\x80\x99 said the heavy gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! You perwerse creetur!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed one of the vixenish ladies. \xe2\x80\x98Drive\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x98ouse with the yellow door, cabmin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUpon this the cabman, who in a sudden effort to pull up at the house\r\nwith the green door, had pulled the horse up so high that he nearly\r\npulled him backward into the cabriolet, let the animal\xe2\x80\x99s fore-legs down\r\nto the ground again, and paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now vere am I to pull up?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the driver. \xe2\x80\x98Settle it among\r\nyourselves. All I ask is, vere?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the contest was renewed with increased violence; and the horse\r\nbeing troubled with a fly on his nose, the cabman humanely employed his\r\nleisure in lashing him about on the head, on the counter-irritation\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most wotes carries the day!\xe2\x80\x99 said one of the vixenish ladies at length.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The \xe2\x80\x98ouse with the yellow door, cabman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut after the cabriolet had dashed up, in splendid style, to the house\r\nwith the yellow door, \xe2\x80\x98making,\xe2\x80\x99 as one of the vixenish ladies\r\ntriumphantly said, \xe2\x80\x98acterrally more noise than if one had come in one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown carriage,\xe2\x80\x99 and after the driver had dismounted to assist the ladies\r\nin getting out, the small round head of Master Thomas Bardell was thrust\r\nout of the one-pair window of a house with a red door, a few numbers\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aggrawatin\xe2\x80\x99 thing!\xe2\x80\x99 said the vixenish lady last-mentioned, darting a\r\nwithering glance at the heavy gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me, you creetur, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted the lady. \xe2\x80\x98The house\r\nwith the red door, cabmin. Oh! If ever a woman was troubled with a\r\nruffinly creetur, that takes a pride and a pleasure in disgracing his\r\nwife on every possible occasion afore strangers, I am that woman!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Raddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other little\r\nwoman, who was no other than Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have I been a-doing of?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Raddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me, don\xe2\x80\x99t, you brute, for fear I should be perwoked to\r\nforgit my sect and strike you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle.\r\n\r\nWhile this dialogue was going on, the driver was most ignominiously\r\nleading the horse, by the bridle, up to the house with the red door,\r\nwhich Master Bardell had already opened. Here was a mean and low way of\r\narriving at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house! No dashing up, with all the fire and fury\r\nof the animal; no jumping down of the driver; no loud knocking at the\r\ndoor; no opening of the apron with a crash at the very last moment, for\r\nfear of the ladies sitting in a draught; and then the man handing the\r\nshawls out, afterwards, as if he were a private coachman! The whole edge\r\nof the thing had been taken off--it was flatter than walking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Tommy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins, \xe2\x80\x98how\xe2\x80\x99s your poor dear mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s very well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Master Bardell. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s in the front\r\nparlour, all ready. I\xe2\x80\x99m ready too, I am.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Master Bardell put his\r\nhands in his pockets, and jumped off and on the bottom step of the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is anybody else a-goin\xe2\x80\x99, Tommy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins, arranging her\r\npelerine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Sanders is going, she is,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Tommy; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going too, I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drat the boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mrs. Cluppins. \xe2\x80\x98He thinks of nobody but\r\nhimself. Here, Tommy, dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Master Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who else is a-goin\xe2\x80\x99, lovey?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins, in an insinuating\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Mrs. Rogers is a-goin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Master Bardell, opening his eyes\r\nvery wide as he delivered the intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? The lady as has taken the lodgings!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\nMaster Bardell put his hands deeper down into his pockets, and nodded\r\nexactly thirty-five times, to imply that it was the lady-lodger, and no\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless us!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a party!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, if you knew what was in the cupboard, you\xe2\x80\x99d say so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Master\r\nBardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is there, Tommy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins coaxingly. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll tell _me_,\r\nTommy, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Master Bardell, shaking his head, and applying\r\nhimself to the bottom step again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drat the child!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Mrs. Cluppins. \xe2\x80\x98What a prowokin\xe2\x80\x99 little\r\nwretch it is! Come, Tommy, tell your dear Cluppy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother said I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Master Bardell, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to have\r\nsome, I am.\xe2\x80\x99 Cheered by this prospect, the precocious boy applied\r\nhimself to his infantile treadmill, with increased vigour.\r\n\r\nThe above examination of a child of tender years took place while Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Raddle and the cab-driver were having an altercation concerning\r\nthe fare, which, terminating at this point in favour of the cabman, Mrs.\r\nRaddle came up tottering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lauk, Mary Ann! what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s put me all over in such a tremble, Betsy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Raddle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Raddle ain\xe2\x80\x99t like a man; he leaves everythink to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was scarcely fair upon the unfortunate Mr. Raddle, who had been\r\nthrust aside by his good lady in the commencement of the dispute, and\r\nperemptorily commanded to hold his tongue. He had no opportunity of\r\ndefending himself, however, for Mrs. Raddle gave unequivocal signs of\r\nfainting; which, being perceived from the parlour window, Mrs. Bardell,\r\nMrs. Sanders, the lodger, and the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s servant, darted precipitately\r\nout, and conveyed her into the house, all talking at the same time, and\r\ngiving utterance to various expressions of pity and condolence, as if\r\nshe were one of the most suffering mortals on earth. Being conveyed into\r\nthe front parlour, she was there deposited on a sofa; and the lady from\r\nthe first floor running up to the first floor, returned with a bottle of\r\nsal-volatile, which, holding Mrs. Raddle tight round the neck, she\r\napplied in all womanly kindness and pity to her nose, until that lady\r\nwith many plunges and struggles was fain to declare herself decidedly\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Rogers, \xe2\x80\x98I know what her feelin\xe2\x80\x99s is, too\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAh, poor thing! so do I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders; and then all the ladies\r\nmoaned in unison, and said they knew what it was, and they pitied her\r\nfrom their hearts, they did. Even the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s little servant, who was\r\nthirteen years old and three feet high, murmured her sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what\xe2\x80\x99s been the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, what has decomposed you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mrs. Rogers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been a good deal flurried,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Raddle, in a\r\nreproachful manner. Thereupon the ladies cast indignant glances at Mr.\r\nRaddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, the fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 said that unhappy gentleman, stepping forward, \xe2\x80\x98when\r\nwe alighted at this door, a dispute arose with the driver of the\r\ncabrioily--\xe2\x80\x99 A loud scream from his wife, at the mention of this word,\r\nrendered all further explanation inaudible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better leave us to bring her round, Raddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99ll never get better as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll the ladies concurred in this opinion; so Mr. Raddle was pushed out\r\nof the room, and requested to give himself an airing in the back yard.\r\nWhich he did for about a quarter of an hour, when Mrs. Bardell announced\r\nto him with a solemn face that he might come in now, but that he must be\r\nvery careful how he behaved towards his wife. She knew he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\nbe unkind; but Mary Ann was very far from strong, and, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\ncare, he might lose her when he least expected it, which would be a very\r\ndreadful reflection for him afterwards; and so on. All this, Mr. Raddle\r\nheard with great submission, and presently returned to the parlour in a\r\nmost lamb-like manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Mrs. Rogers, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been\r\nintroduced, I declare! Mr. Raddle, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; Mrs. Cluppins, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; Mrs.\r\nRaddle, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which is Mrs. Cluppins\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Rogers graciously; for she was the lodger, and\r\nher servant was in waiting, so she was more gracious than intimate, in\r\nright of her position. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Raddle smiled sweetly, Mr. Raddle bowed, and Mrs. Cluppins said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98she was sure she was very happy to have an opportunity of being known\r\nto a lady which she had heerd so much in favour of, as Mrs. Rogers.\xe2\x80\x99 A\r\ncompliment which the last-named lady acknowledged with graceful\r\ncondescension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr. Raddle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you ought to feel very\r\nmuch honoured at you and Tommy being the only gentlemen to escort so\r\nmany ladies all the way to the Spaniards, at Hampstead. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nhe ought, Mrs. Rogers, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh, certainly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Rogers; after whom all the other\r\nladies responded, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I feel it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raddle, rubbing his hands, and\r\nevincing a slight tendency to brighten up a little. \xe2\x80\x98Indeed, to tell you\r\nthe truth, I said, as we was a-coming along in the cabrioily--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the recapitulation of the word which awakened so many painful\r\nrecollections, Mrs. Raddle applied her handkerchief to her eyes again,\r\nand uttered a half-suppressed scream; so that Mrs. Bardell frowned upon\r\nMr. Raddle, to intimate that he had better not say anything more, and\r\ndesired Mrs. Rogers\xe2\x80\x99s servant, with an air, to \xe2\x80\x98put the wine on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for displaying the hidden treasures of the closet,\r\nwhich comprised sundry plates of oranges and biscuits, and a bottle of\r\nold crusted port--that at one-and-nine--with another of the celebrated\r\nEast India sherry at fourteen-pence, which were all produced in honour\r\nof the lodger, and afforded unlimited satisfaction to everybody. After\r\ngreat consternation had been excited in the mind of Mrs. Cluppins, by an\r\nattempt on the part of Tommy to recount how he had been cross-examined\r\nregarding the cupboard then in action (which was fortunately nipped in\r\nthe bud by his imbibing half a glass of the old crusted \xe2\x80\x98the wrong way,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand thereby endangering his life for some seconds), the party walked\r\nforth in quest of a Hampstead stage. This was soon found, and in a\r\ncouple of hours they all arrived safely in the Spaniards Tea-gardens,\r\nwhere the luckless Mr. Raddle\xe2\x80\x99s very first act nearly occasioned his\r\ngood lady a relapse; it being neither more nor less than to order tea\r\nfor seven, whereas (as the ladies one and all remarked), what could have\r\nbeen easier than for Tommy to have drank out of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s cup--or\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s, if that was all--when the waiter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking, which\r\nwould have saved one head of tea, and the tea just as good!\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no help for it, and the tea-tray came, with seven\r\ncups and saucers, and bread-and-butter on the same scale. Mrs. Bardell\r\nwas unanimously voted into the chair, and Mrs. Rogers being stationed on\r\nher right hand, and Mrs. Raddle on her left, the meal proceeded with\r\ngreat merriment and success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How sweet the country is, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Mrs. Rogers; \xe2\x80\x98I almost\r\nwish I lived in it always.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Bardell, rather\r\nhastily; for it was not at all advisable, with reference to the\r\nlodgings, to encourage such notions; \xe2\x80\x98you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I should think you was a deal too lively and sought after, to be\r\ncontent with the country, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I am, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Perhaps I am,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the first-floor lodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For lone people as have got nobody to care for them, or take care of\r\nthem, or as have been hurt in their mind, or that kind of thing,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nobserved Mr. Raddle, plucking up a little cheerfulness, and looking\r\nround, \xe2\x80\x98the country is all very well. The country for a wounded spirit,\r\nthey say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, of all things in the world that the unfortunate man could have\r\nsaid, any would have been preferable to this. Of course Mrs. Bardell\r\nburst into tears, and requested to be led from the table instantly; upon\r\nwhich the affectionate child began to cry too, most dismally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would anybody believe, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Raddle, turning fiercely\r\nto the first-floor lodger, \xe2\x80\x98that a woman could be married to such a\r\nunmanly creetur, which can tamper with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings as he does,\r\nevery hour in the day, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Raddle, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs. Raddle, with great scorn and contempt.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go away. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the sight on you, you brute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must not flurry yourself, Mary Ann,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mrs. Cluppins. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nreally must consider yourself, my dear, which you never do. Now go away,\r\nRaddle, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good soul, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll only aggravate her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better take your tea by yourself, Sir, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nRogers, again applying the smelling-bottle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sanders, who, according to custom, was very busy with the bread-\r\nand-butter, expressed the same opinion, and Mr. Raddle quietly retired.\r\n\r\nAfter this, there was a great hoisting up of Master Bardell, who was\r\nrather a large size for hugging, into his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, in which\r\noperation he got his boots in the tea-board, and occasioned some\r\nconfusion among the cups and saucers. But that description of fainting\r\nfits, which is contagious among ladies, seldom lasts long; so when he\r\nhad been well kissed, and a little cried over, Mrs. Bardell recovered,\r\nset him down again, wondering how she could have been so foolish, and\r\npoured out some more tea.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, that the sound of approaching wheels was heard,\r\nand that the ladies, looking up, saw a hackney-coach stop at the garden\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More company!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Raddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Jackson, the young man from Dodson and Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried Mrs. Bardell. \xe2\x80\x98Why, gracious! Surely Mr. Pickwick can\xe2\x80\x99t have paid\r\nthe damages.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or hoffered marriage!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Cluppins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, how slow the gentleman is,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Rogers. \xe2\x80\x98Why\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he make haste!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the lady spoke these words, Mr. Jackson turned from the coach where\r\nhe had been addressing some observations to a shabby man in black\r\nleggings, who had just emerged from the vehicle with a thick ash stick\r\nin his hand, and made his way to the place where the ladies were seated;\r\nwinding his hair round the brim of his hat, as he came along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is anything the matter? Has anything taken place, Mr. Jackson?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs. Bardell eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing whatever, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Jackson. \xe2\x80\x98How de do, ladies? I\r\nhave to ask pardon, ladies, for intruding--but the law, ladies--the\r\nlaw.\xe2\x80\x99 With this apology Mr. Jackson smiled, made a comprehensive bow,\r\nand gave his hair another wind. Mrs. Rogers whispered Mrs. Raddle that\r\nhe was really an elegant young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I called in Goswell Street,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Jackson, \xe2\x80\x98and hearing that you\r\nwere here, from the slavey, took a coach and came on. Our people want\r\nyou down in the city directly, Mrs. Bardell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated that lady, starting at the sudden nature of the\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jackson, biting his lip. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very important and\r\npressing business, which can\xe2\x80\x99t be postponed on any account. Indeed,\r\nDodson expressly said so to me, and so did Fogg. I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept the coach on\r\npurpose for you to go back in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How very strange!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\nThe ladies agreed that it _was _ very strange, but were unanimously of\r\nopinion that it must be very important, or Dodson & Fogg would never\r\nhave sent; and further, that the business being urgent, she ought to\r\nrepair to Dodson & Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s without any delay.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain degree of pride and importance about being wanted by\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers in such a monstrous hurry, that was by no means\r\ndispleasing to Mrs. Bardell, especially as it might be reasonably\r\nsupposed to enhance her consequence in the eyes of the first-floor\r\nlodger. She simpered a little, affected extreme vexation and hesitation,\r\nand at last arrived at the conclusion that she supposed she must go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But won\xe2\x80\x99t you refresh yourself after your walk, Mr. Jackson?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nBardell persuasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, really there ain\xe2\x80\x99t much time to lose,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson; \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a friend here,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, looking towards the man with the ash\r\nstick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, ask your friend to come here, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell. \xe2\x80\x98Pray ask\r\nyour friend here, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Jackson, with some\r\nembarrassment of manner. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s not much used to ladies\xe2\x80\x99 society, and it\r\nmakes him bashful. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll order the waiter to deliver him anything\r\nshort, he won\xe2\x80\x99t drink it off at once, won\xe2\x80\x99t he!--only try him!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr.\r\nJackson\xe2\x80\x99s fingers wandered playfully round his nose at this portion of\r\nhis discourse, to warn his hearers that he was speaking ironically.\r\n\r\nThe waiter was at once despatched to the bashful gentleman, and the\r\nbashful gentleman took something; Mr. Jackson also took something, and\r\nthe ladies took something, for hospitality\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Mr. Jackson then said\r\nhe was afraid it was time to go; upon which, Mrs. Sanders, Mrs.\r\nCluppins, and Tommy (who it was arranged should accompany Mrs. Bardell,\r\nleaving the others to Mr. Raddle\xe2\x80\x99s protection), got into the coach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isaac,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson, as Mrs. Bardell prepared to get in, looking up at\r\nthe man with the ash stick, who was seated on the box, smoking a cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Mrs. Bardell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I know\xe2\x80\x99d that long ago,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bardell got in, Mr. Jackson got in after her, and away they drove.\r\nMrs. Bardell could not help ruminating on what Mr. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s friend had\r\nsaid. Shrewd creatures, those lawyers. Lord bless us, how they find\r\npeople out!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sad thing about these costs of our people\xe2\x80\x99s, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson,\r\nwhen Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders had fallen asleep; \xe2\x80\x98your bill of\r\ncosts, I mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry they can\xe2\x80\x99t get them,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Bardell. \xe2\x80\x98But if you\r\nlaw gentlemen do these things on speculation, why you must get a loss\r\nnow and then, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You gave them a _cognovit _for the amount of your costs, after the\r\ntrial, I\xe2\x80\x99m told!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Just as a matter of form,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson drily. \xe2\x80\x98Quite a matter of form. Quite.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn they drove, and Mrs. Bardell fell asleep. She was awakened, after\r\nsome time, by the stopping of the coach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless us!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady. \xe2\x80\x98Are we at Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Court?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re not going quite so far,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson. \xe2\x80\x98Have the goodness to\r\nstep out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Bardell, not yet thoroughly awake, complied. It was a curious\r\nplace: a large wall, with a gate in the middle, and a gas-light burning\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, ladies,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the man with the ash stick, looking into the coach,\r\nand shaking Mrs. Sanders to wake her, \xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 Rousing her friend, Mrs.\r\nSanders alighted. Mrs. Bardell, leaning on Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and leading\r\nTommy by the hand, had already entered the porch. They followed.\r\n\r\nThe room they turned into was even more odd-looking than the porch. Such\r\na number of men standing about! And they stared so!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What place is this?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mrs. Bardell, pausing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only one of our public offices,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson, hurrying her through\r\na door, and looking round to see that the other women were following.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look sharp, Isaac!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Safe and sound,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man with the ash stick. The door swung\r\nheavily after them, and they descended a small flight of steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here we are at last. All right and tight, Mrs. Bardell!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jackson,\r\nlooking exultingly round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Bardell, with a palpitating heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just this,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jackson, drawing her a little on one side; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe frightened, Mrs. Bardell. There never was a more delicate man than\r\nDodson, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, or a more humane man than Fogg. It was their duty in the\r\nway of business, to take you in execution for them costs; but they were\r\nanxious to spare your feelings as much as they could. What a comfort it\r\nmust be, to you, to think how it\xe2\x80\x99s been done! This is the Fleet, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\nWish you good-night, Mrs. Bardell. Good-night, Tommy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Jackson hurried away in company with the man with the ash stick\r\nanother man, with a key in his hand, who had been looking on, led the\r\nbewildered female to a second short flight of steps leading to a\r\ndoorway. Mrs. Bardell screamed violently; Tommy roared; Mrs. Cluppins\r\nshrunk within herself; and Mrs. Sanders made off, without more ado. For\r\nthere stood the injured Mr. Pickwick, taking his nightly allowance of\r\nair; and beside him leant Samuel Weller, who, seeing Mrs. Bardell, took\r\nhis hat off with mock reverence, while his master turned indignantly on\r\nhis heel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother the woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the turnkey to Weller; \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99s just come\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A prisoner!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, quickly replacing his hat. \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nplaintives? What for? Speak up, old feller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dodson and Fogg,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man; \xe2\x80\x98execution on _cognovit _for costs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, Job, Job!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Sam, dashing into the passage. \xe2\x80\x98Run to Mr.\r\nPerker\xe2\x80\x99s, Job. I want him directly. I see some good in this. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngame. Hooray! vere\xe2\x80\x99s the gov\xe2\x80\x99nor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut there was no reply to these inquiries, for Job had started furiously\r\noff, the instant he received his commission, and Mrs. Bardell had\r\nfainted in real downright earnest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII. IS CHIEFLY DEVOTED TO MATTERS OF BUSINESS, AND THE\r\nTEMPORAL ADVANTAGE OF DODSON AND FOGG--MR. WINKLE REAPPEARS UNDER\r\nEXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES--MR. PICKWICK\xe2\x80\x99S BENEVOLENCE PROVES STRONGER\r\nTHAN HIS OBSTINACY\r\n\r\nJob Trotter, abating nothing of his speed, ran up Holborn, sometimes in\r\nthe middle of the road, sometimes on the pavement, sometimes in the\r\ngutter, as the chances of getting along varied with the press of men,\r\nwomen, children, and coaches, in each division of the thoroughfare, and,\r\nregardless of all obstacles stopped not for an instant until he reached\r\nthe gate of Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. Notwithstanding all the expedition he had used,\r\nhowever, the gate had been closed a good half-hour when he reached it,\r\nand by the time he had discovered Mr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s laundress, who lived with\r\na married daughter, who had bestowed her hand upon a non-resident\r\nwaiter, who occupied the one-pair of some number in some street closely\r\nadjoining to some brewery somewhere behind Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Lane, it was\r\nwithin fifteen minutes of closing the prison for the night. Mr. Lowten\r\nhad still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of the Magpie and\r\nStump; and Job had scarcely accomplished this object, and communicated\r\nSam Weller\xe2\x80\x99s message, when the clock struck ten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s too late now. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get in to-night;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got the key of the street, my friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job. \xe2\x80\x98I can sleep anywhere. But won\xe2\x80\x99t it be\r\nbetter to see Mr. Perker to-night, so that we may be there, the first\r\nthing in the morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Lowten, after a little consideration, \xe2\x80\x98if it was in\r\nanybody else\xe2\x80\x99s case, Perker wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be best pleased at my going up to\r\nhis house; but as it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s, I think I may venture to take a\r\ncab and charge it to the office.\xe2\x80\x99 Deciding on this line of conduct, Mr.\r\nLowten took up his hat, and begging the assembled company to appoint a\r\ndeputy-chairman during his temporary absence, led the way to the nearest\r\ncoach-stand. Summoning the cab of most promising appearance, he directed\r\nthe driver to repair to Montague Place, Russell Square.\r\n\r\nMr. Perker had had a dinner-party that day, as was testified by the\r\nappearance of lights in the drawing-room windows, the sound of an\r\nimproved grand piano, and an improvable cabinet voice issuing therefrom,\r\nand a rather overpowering smell of meat which pervaded the steps and\r\nentry. In fact, a couple of very good country agencies happening to come\r\nup to town, at the same time, an agreeable little party had been got\r\ntogether to meet them, comprising Mr. Snicks, the Life Office Secretary,\r\nMr. Prosee, the eminent counsel, three solicitors, one commissioner of\r\nbankrupts, a special pleader from the Temple, a small-eyed peremptory\r\nyoung gentleman, his pupil, who had written a lively book about the law\r\nof demises, with a vast quantity of marginal notes and references; and\r\nseveral other eminent and distinguished personages. From this society,\r\nlittle Mr. Perker detached himself, on his clerk being announced in a\r\nwhisper; and repairing to the dining-room, there found Mr. Lowten and\r\nJob Trotter looking very dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen\r\ncandle, which the gentleman who condescended to appear in plush shorts\r\nand cottons for a quarterly stipend, had, with a becoming contempt for\r\nthe clerk and all things appertaining to \xe2\x80\x98the office,\xe2\x80\x99 placed upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Lowten,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mr. Perker, shutting the door, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter? No important letter come in a parcel, is there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lowten. \xe2\x80\x98This is a messenger from Mr. Pickwick, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From Pickwick, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, turning quickly to Job. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nwhat is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dodson and Fogg have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution for her costs,\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Perker, putting his hands in his pockets, and reclining\r\nagainst the sideboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job. \xe2\x80\x98It seems they got a cognovit out of her, for the\r\namount of \xe2\x80\x98em, directly after the trial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jove!\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, taking both hands out of his pockets, and\r\nstriking the knuckles of his right against the palm of his left,\r\nemphatically, \xe2\x80\x98those are the cleverest scamps I ever had anything to do\r\nwith!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sharpest practitioners I ever knew, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Lowten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sharp!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Perker. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing where to have them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very true, Sir, there is not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lowten; and then, both master\r\nand man pondered for a few seconds, with animated countenances, as if\r\nthey were reflecting upon one of the most beautiful and ingenious\r\ndiscoveries that the intellect of man had ever made. When they had in\r\nsome measure recovered from their trance of admiration, Job Trotter\r\ndischarged himself of the rest of his commission. Perker nodded his head\r\nthoughtfully, and pulled out his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At ten precisely, I will be there,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man. \xe2\x80\x98Sam is quite\r\nright. Tell him so. Will you take a glass of wine, Lowten?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo, thank you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean yes, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, turning to the sideboard\r\nfor a decanter and glasses.\r\n\r\nAs Lowten _did _mean yes, he said no more on the subject, but inquired\r\nof Job, in an audible whisper, whether the portrait of Perker, which\r\nhung opposite the fireplace, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a wonderful likeness, to which Job\r\nof course replied that it was. The wine being by this time poured out,\r\nLowten drank to Mrs. Perker and the children, and Job to Perker. The\r\ngentleman in the plush shorts and cottons considering it no part of his\r\nduty to show the people from the office out, consistently declined to\r\nanswer the bell, and they showed themselves out. The attorney betook\r\nhimself to his drawing-room, the clerk to the Magpie and Stump, and Job\r\nto Covent Garden Market to spend the night in a vegetable basket.\r\n\r\nPunctually at the appointed hour next morning, the good-humoured little\r\nattorney tapped at Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s door, which was opened with great\r\nalacrity by Sam Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Perker, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, announcing the visitor to Mr. Pickwick, who\r\nwas sitting at the window in a thoughtful attitude. \xe2\x80\x98Wery glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlooked in accidentally, Sir. I rather think the gov\xe2\x80\x99nor wants to have a\r\nword and a half with you, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerker bestowed a look of intelligence on Sam, intimating that he\r\nunderstood he was not to say he had been sent for; and beckoning him to\r\napproach, whispered briefly in his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that \xe2\x80\x98ere, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, starting back in excessive\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nPerker nodded and smiled.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Weller looked at the little lawyer, then at Mr. Pickwick,\r\nthen at the ceiling, then at Perker again; grinned, laughed outright,\r\nand finally, catching up his hat from the carpet, without further\r\nexplanation, disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does this mean?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, looking at Perker with\r\nastonishment. \xe2\x80\x98What has put Sam into this extraordinary state?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, nothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker. \xe2\x80\x98Come, my dear Sir, draw up your\r\nchair to the table. I have a good deal to say to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What papers are those?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, as the little man\r\ndeposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The papers in Bardell and Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, undoing the knot\r\nwith his teeth.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick grated the legs of his chair against the ground; and\r\nthrowing himself into it, folded his hands and looked sternly--if Mr.\r\nPickwick ever could look sternly--at his legal friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear the name of the cause?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man,\r\nstill busying himself with the knot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I do not indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Perker, \xe2\x80\x98because it will form the subject of\r\nour conversation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather that the subject should be never mentioned between us,\r\nPerker,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, untying the bundle, and\r\nglancing eagerly at Mr. Pickwick out of the corners of his eyes. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nmust be mentioned. I have come here on purpose. Now, are you ready to\r\nhear what I have to say, my dear Sir? No hurry; if you are not, I can\r\nwait. I have this morning\xe2\x80\x99s paper here. Your time shall be mine. There!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHereupon, the little man threw one leg over the other, and made a show\r\nof beginning to read with great composure and application.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a sigh, but softening into a smile\r\nat the same time. \xe2\x80\x98Say what you have to say; it\xe2\x80\x99s the old story, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With a difference, my dear Sir; with a difference,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Perker,\r\ndeliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bardell, the plaintiff in the action, is within these walls, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it,\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Perker. \xe2\x80\x98And you know how she comes here, I\r\nsuppose; I mean on what grounds, and at whose suit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; at least I have heard Sam\xe2\x80\x99s account of the matter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, with affected carelessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam\xe2\x80\x99s account of the matter,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, \xe2\x80\x98is, I will venture to\r\nsay, a perfectly correct one. Well now, my dear Sir, the first question\r\nI have to ask, is, whether this woman is to remain here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To remain here!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To remain here, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Perker, leaning back in his\r\nchair and looking steadily at his client.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you ask me?\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98It rests with Dodson and\r\nFogg; you know that very well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know nothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Perker firmly. \xe2\x80\x98It does _not\r\n_rest with Dodson and Fogg; you know the men, my dear Sir, as well as I\r\ndo. It rests solely, wholly, and entirely with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With me!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, rising nervously from his chair, and\r\nreseating himself directly afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe little man gave a double-knock on the lid of his snuff-box, opened\r\nit, took a great pinch, shut it up again, and repeated the words, \xe2\x80\x98With\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the little man, who seemed to gather\r\nconfidence from the snuff--\xe2\x80\x98I say, that her speedy liberation or\r\nperpetual imprisonment rests with you, and with you alone. Hear me out,\r\nmy dear Sir, if you please, and do not be so very energetic, for it will\r\nonly put you into a perspiration and do no good whatever. I say,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Perker, checking off each position on a different finger, as\r\nhe laid it down--\xe2\x80\x98I say that nobody but you can rescue her from this den\r\nof wretchedness; and that you can only do that, by paying the costs of\r\nthis suit--both of plaintive and defendant--into the hands of these\r\nFreeman Court sharks. Now pray be quiet, my dear sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, whose face had been undergoing most surprising changes\r\nduring this speech, and was evidently on the verge of a strong burst of\r\nindignation, calmed his wrath as well as he could. Perker, strengthening\r\nhis argumentative powers with another pinch of snuff, proceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have seen the woman, this morning. By paying the costs, you can\r\nobtain a full release and discharge from the damages; and further--this\r\nI know is a far greater object of consideration with you, my dear sir--a\r\nvoluntary statement, under her hand, in the form of a letter to me, that\r\nthis business was, from the very first, fomented, and encouraged, and\r\nbrought about, by these men, Dodson and Fogg; that she deeply regrets\r\never having been the instrument of annoyance or injury to you; and that\r\nshe entreats me to intercede with you, and implore your pardon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I pay her costs for her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick indignantly. \xe2\x80\x98A valuable\r\ndocument, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d in the case, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x98There is\r\nthe very letter I speak of. Brought to my office by another woman at\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning, before I had set foot in this place, or held\r\nany communication with Mrs. Bardell, upon my honour.\xe2\x80\x99 Selecting the\r\nletter from the bundle, the little lawyer laid it at Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nelbow, and took snuff for two consecutive minutes, without winking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this all you have to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not quite,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot undertake to say, at this moment,\r\nwhether the wording of the cognovit, the nature of the ostensible\r\nconsideration, and the proof we can get together about the whole conduct\r\nof the suit, will be sufficient to justify an indictment for conspiracy.\r\nI fear not, my dear Sir; they are too clever for that, I doubt. I do\r\nmean to say, however, that the whole facts, taken together, will be\r\nsufficient to justify you, in the minds of all reasonable men. And now,\r\nmy dear Sir, I put it to you. This one hundred and fifty pounds, or\r\nwhatever it may be--take it in round numbers--is nothing to you. A jury\r\nhad decided against you; well, their verdict is wrong, but still they\r\ndecided as they thought right, and it _is_ against you. You have now an\r\nopportunity, on easy terms, of placing yourself in a much higher\r\nposition than you ever could, by remaining here; which would only be\r\nimputed, by people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you, to sheer dogged, wrongheaded,\r\nbrutal obstinacy; nothing else, my dear Sir, believe me. Can you\r\nhesitate to avail yourself of it, when it restores you to your friends,\r\nyour old pursuits, your health and amusements; when it liberates your\r\nfaithful and attached servant, whom you otherwise doom to imprisonment\r\nfor the whole of your life; and above all, when it enables you to take\r\nthe very magnanimous revenge--which I know, my dear sir, is one after\r\nyour own heart--of releasing this woman from a scene of misery and\r\ndebauchery, to which no man should ever be consigned, if I had my will,\r\nbut the infliction of which on any woman, is even more frightful and\r\nbarbarous. Now I ask you, my dear sir, not only as your legal adviser,\r\nbut as your very true friend, will you let slip the occasion of\r\nattaining all these objects, and doing all this good, for the paltry\r\nconsideration of a few pounds finding their way into the pockets of a\r\ncouple of rascals, to whom it makes no manner of difference, except that\r\nthe more they gain, the more they\xe2\x80\x99ll seek, and so the sooner be led into\r\nsome piece of knavery that must end in a crash? I have put these\r\nconsiderations to you, my dear Sir, very feebly and imperfectly, but I\r\nask you to think of them. Turn them over in your mind as long as you\r\nplease. I wait here most patiently for your answer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Pickwick could reply, before Mr. Perker had taken one\r\ntwentieth part of the snuff with which so unusually long an address\r\nimperatively required to be followed up, there was a low murmuring of\r\nvoices outside, and then a hesitating knock at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently roused by\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s appeal; \xe2\x80\x98what an annoyance that door is! Who is that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam Weller, putting in his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to you just now, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I am engaged\r\nat this moment, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98But here\xe2\x80\x99s a lady here,\r\nSir, as says she\xe2\x80\x99s somethin\xe2\x80\x99 wery partickler to disclose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any lady,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with\r\nvisions of Mrs. Bardell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make too sure o\xe2\x80\x99 that, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr. Weller, shaking his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x98If you know\xe2\x80\x99d who was near, sir, I rayther think you\xe2\x80\x99d change\r\nyour note; as the hawk remarked to himself vith a cheerful laugh, ven he\r\nheerd the robin-redbreast a-singin\xe2\x80\x99 round the corner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you see her, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in his hand\r\nas if he had some curious live animal on the other side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose I must,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking at Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then, all in to begin!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Sound the gong, draw up the\r\ncurtain, and enter the two conspiraytors.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Sam Weller spoke, he threw the door open, and there rushed\r\ntumultuously into the room, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, leading after him by\r\nthe hand, the identical young lady who at Dingley Dell had worn the\r\nboots with the fur round the tops, and who, now a very pleasing compound\r\nof blushes and confusion, and lilac silk, and a smart bonnet, and a rich\r\nlace veil, looked prettier than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Arabella Allen!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, rising from his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, dropping on his knees. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Winkle. Pardon,\r\nmy dear friend, pardon!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses, and\r\nperhaps would not have done so, but for the corroborative testimony\r\nafforded by the smiling countenance of Perker, and the bodily presence,\r\nin the background, of Sam and the pretty housemaid; who appeared to\r\ncontemplate the proceedings with the liveliest satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr. Pickwick!\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, in a low voice, as if alarmed at the\r\nsilence. \xe2\x80\x98Can you forgive my imprudence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick returned no verbal response to this appeal; but he took off\r\nhis spectacles in great haste, and seizing both the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nin his, kissed her a great number of times--perhaps a greater number\r\nthan was absolutely necessary--and then, still retaining one of her\r\nhands, told Mr. Winkle he was an audacious young dog, and bade him get\r\nup. This, Mr. Winkle, who had been for some seconds scratching his nose\r\nwith the brim of his hat, in a penitent manner, did; whereupon Mr.\r\nPickwick slapped him on the back several times, and then shook hands\r\nheartily with Perker, who, not to be behind-hand in the compliments of\r\nthe occasion, saluted both the bride and the pretty housemaid with right\r\ngood-will, and, having wrung Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s hand most cordially, wound up\r\nhis demonstrations of joy by taking snuff enough to set any half-dozen\r\nmen with ordinarily-constructed noses, a-sneezing for life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, my dear girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98how has all this come about?\r\nCome! Sit down, and let me hear it all. How well she looks, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she,\r\nPerker?\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick, surveying Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s face with a look of as\r\nmuch pride and exultation, as if she had been his daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Delightful, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the little man. \xe2\x80\x98If I were not a\r\nmarried man myself, I should be disposed to envy you, you dog.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus\r\nexpressing himself, the little lawyer gave Mr. Winkle a poke in the\r\nchest, which that gentleman reciprocated; after which they both laughed\r\nvery loudly, but not so loudly as Mr. Samuel Weller, who had just\r\nrelieved his feelings by kissing the pretty housemaid under cover of the\r\ncupboard door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can never be grateful enough to you, Sam, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella,\r\nwith the sweetest smile imaginable. \xe2\x80\x98I shall not forget your exertions\r\nin the garden at Clifton.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say nothin\xe2\x80\x99 wotever about it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I only\r\nassisted natur, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; as the doctor said to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother, after\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d bled him to death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary, my dear, sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, cutting short these\r\ncompliments. \xe2\x80\x98Now then; how long have you been married, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nArabella looked bashfully at her lord and master, who replied, \xe2\x80\x98Only\r\nthree days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only three days, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Why, what have you been doing\r\nthese three months?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Perker; \xe2\x80\x98come, account for this idleness.\r\nYou see Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s only astonishment is, that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all over,\r\nmonths ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why the fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, looking at his blushing young\r\nwife, \xe2\x80\x98that I could not persuade Bella to run away, for a long time. And\r\nwhen I had persuaded her, it was a long time more before we could find\r\nan opportunity. Mary had to give a month\xe2\x80\x99s warning, too, before she\r\ncould leave her place next door, and we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have done it\r\nwithout her assistance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who by this time had resumed his\r\nspectacles, and was looking from Arabella to Winkle, and from Winkle to\r\nArabella, with as much delight depicted in his countenance as\r\nwarmheartedness and kindly feeling can communicate to the human face--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98upon my word! you seem to have been very systematic in your\r\nproceedings. And is your brother acquainted with all this, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Arabella, changing colour. \xe2\x80\x98Dear Mr. Pickwick, he\r\nmust only know it from you--from your lips alone. He is so violent, so\r\nprejudiced, and has been so--so anxious in behalf of his friend, Mr.\r\nSawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 added Arabella, looking down, \xe2\x80\x98that I fear the consequences\r\ndreadfully.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker gravely. \xe2\x80\x98You must take this matter in\r\nhand for them, my dear sir. These young men will respect you, when they\r\nwould listen to nobody else. You must prevent mischief, my dear Sir. Hot\r\nblood, hot blood.\xe2\x80\x99 And the little man took a warning pinch, and shook\r\nhis head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You forget, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick gently, \xe2\x80\x98you forget that I am a\r\nprisoner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed I do not, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Arabella. \xe2\x80\x98I never have\r\nforgotten it. I have never ceased to think how great your sufferings\r\nmust have been in this shocking place. But I hoped that what no\r\nconsideration for yourself would induce you to do, a regard to our\r\nhappiness might. If my brother hears of this, first, from you, I feel\r\ncertain we shall be reconciled. He is my only relation in the world, Mr.\r\nPickwick, and unless you plead for me, I fear I have lost even him. I\r\nhave done wrong, very, very wrong, I know.\xe2\x80\x99 Here poor Arabella hid her\r\nface in her handkerchief, and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s nature was a good deal worked upon, by these same tears;\r\nbut when Mrs. Winkle, drying her eyes, took to coaxing and entreating in\r\nthe sweetest tones of a very sweet voice, he became particularly\r\nrestless, and evidently undecided how to act, as was evinced by sundry\r\nnervous rubbings of his spectacle-glasses, nose, tights, head, and\r\ngaiters.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of these symptoms of indecision, Mr. Perker (to whom,\r\nit appeared, the young couple had driven straight that morning) urged\r\nwith legal point and shrewdness that Mr. Winkle, senior, was still\r\nunacquainted with the important rise in life\xe2\x80\x99s flight of steps which his\r\nson had taken; that the future expectations of the said son depended\r\nentirely upon the said Winkle, senior, continuing to regard him with\r\nundiminished feelings of affection and attachment, which it was very\r\nunlikely he would, if this great event were long kept a secret from him;\r\nthat Mr. Pickwick, repairing to Bristol to seek Mr. Allen, might, with\r\nequal reason, repair to Birmingham to seek Mr. Winkle, senior; lastly,\r\nthat Mr. Winkle, senior, had good right and title to consider Mr.\r\nPickwick as in some degree the guardian and adviser of his son, and that\r\nit consequently behoved that gentleman, and was indeed due to his\r\npersonal character, to acquaint the aforesaid Winkle, senior,\r\npersonally, and by word of mouth, with the whole circumstances of the\r\ncase, and with the share he had taken in the transaction.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass arrived, most opportunely, in this stage of\r\nthe pleadings, and as it was necessary to explain to them all that had\r\noccurred, together with the various reasons pro and con, the whole of\r\nthe arguments were gone over again, after which everybody urged every\r\nargument in his own way, and at his own length. And, at last, Mr.\r\nPickwick, fairly argued and remonstrated out of all his resolutions, and\r\nbeing in imminent danger of being argued and remonstrated out of his\r\nwits, caught Arabella in his arms, and declaring that she was a very\r\namiable creature, and that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how it was, but he had always\r\nbeen very fond of her from the first, said he could never find it in his\r\nheart to stand in the way of young people\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, and they might do\r\nwith him as they pleased.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s first act, on hearing this concession, was to despatch Job\r\nTrotter to the illustrious Mr. Pell, with an authority to deliver to the\r\nbearer the formal discharge which his prudent parent had had the\r\nforesight to leave in the hands of that learned gentleman, in case it\r\nshould be, at any time, required on an emergency; his next proceeding\r\nwas, to invest his whole stock of ready-money in the purchase of five-\r\nand-twenty gallons of mild porter, which he himself dispensed on the\r\nracket-ground to everybody who would partake of it; this done, he\r\nhurra\xe2\x80\x99d in divers parts of the building until he lost his voice, and\r\nthen quietly relapsed into his usual collected and philosophical\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock that afternoon, Mr. Pickwick took a last look at his\r\nlittle room, and made his way, as well as he could, through the throng\r\nof debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand, until\r\nhe reached the lodge steps. He turned here, to look about him, and his\r\neye lightened as he did so. In all the crowd of wan, emaciated faces, he\r\nsaw not one which was not happier for his sympathy and charity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, beckoning one young man towards him, \xe2\x80\x98this\r\nis Mr. Jingle, whom I spoke to you about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, looking hard at Jingle. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nwill see me again, young man, to-morrow. I hope you may live to remember\r\nand feel deeply, what I shall have to communicate, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJingle bowed respectfully, trembled very much as he took Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproffered hand, and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Job you know, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, presenting that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know the rascal,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x98See after your\r\nfriend, and be in the way to-morrow at one. Do you hear? Now, is there\r\nanything more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98You have delivered the little parcel\r\nI gave you for your old landlord, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98He bust out a-cryin\xe2\x80\x99, Sir, and said you wos\r\nwery gen\xe2\x80\x99rous and thoughtful, and he only wished you could have him\r\ninnockilated for a gallopin\xe2\x80\x99 consumption, for his old friend as had\r\nlived here so long wos dead, and he\xe2\x80\x99d noweres to look for another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor fellow, poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98God bless you, my\r\nfriends!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick uttered this adieu, the crowd raised a loud shout. Many\r\namong them were pressing forward to shake him by the hand again, when he\r\ndrew his arm through Perker\xe2\x80\x99s, and hurried from the prison, far more sad\r\nand melancholy, for the moment, than when he had first entered it. Alas!\r\nhow many sad and unhappy beings had he left behind!\r\n\r\nA happy evening was that for at least one party in the George and\r\nVulture; and light and cheerful were two of the hearts that emerged from\r\nits hospitable door next morning. The owners thereof were Mr. Pickwick\r\nand Sam Weller, the former of whom was speedily deposited inside a\r\ncomfortable post-coach, with a little dickey behind, in which the latter\r\nmounted with great agility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 called out Mr. Weller to his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, thrusting his head out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish them horses had been three months and better in the Fleet, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Sam?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Weller, rubbing his hands, \xe2\x80\x98how they would go\r\nif they had been!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII. RELATES HOW MR. PICKWICK, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SAMUEL\r\nWELLER, ESSAYED TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF MR. BENJAMIN ALLEN, AND TO\r\nMOLLIFY THE WRATH OF MR. ROBERT SAWYER\r\n\r\nMr. Ben Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer sat together in the little surgery\r\nbehind the shop, discussing minced veal and future prospects, when the\r\ndiscourse, not unnaturally, turned upon the practice acquired by Bob the\r\naforesaid, and his present chances of deriving a competent independence\r\nfrom the honourable profession to which he had devoted himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Bob Sawyer, pursuing the thread of the\r\nsubject--\xe2\x80\x98which, I think, Ben, are rather dubious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s rather dubious?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Ben Allen, at the same time\r\nsharpening his intellect with a draught of beer. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s dubious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, the chances,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forgot,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen. \xe2\x80\x98The beer has reminded me that I forgot,\r\nBob--yes; they _are _dubious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful how the poor people patronise me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer\r\nreflectively. \xe2\x80\x98They knock me up, at all hours of the night; they take\r\nmedicine to an extent which I should have conceived impossible; they put\r\non blisters and leeches with a perseverance worthy of a better cause;\r\nthey make additions to their families, in a manner which is quite awful.\r\nSix of those last-named little promissory notes, all due on the same\r\nday, Ben, and all intrusted to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very gratifying, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen, holding his plate\r\nfor some more minced veal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, very,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob; \xe2\x80\x98only not quite so much so as the confidence of\r\npatients with a shilling or two to spare would be. This business was\r\ncapitally described in the advertisement, Ben. It is a practice, a very\r\nextensive practice--and that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bob,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen, laying down his knife and fork, and fixing\r\nhis eyes on the visage of his friend, \xe2\x80\x98Bob, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must make yourself, with as little delay as possible, master of\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s one thousand pounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three per cent. consolidated bank annuities, now standing in her name\r\nin the book or books of the governor and company of the Bank of\r\nEngland,\xe2\x80\x99 added Bob Sawyer, in legal phraseology.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben. \xe2\x80\x98She has it when she comes of age, or marries.\r\nShe wants a year of coming of age, and if you plucked up a spirit she\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t want a month of being married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a very charming and delightful creature,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Mr. Robert\r\nSawyer, in reply; \xe2\x80\x98and has only one fault that I know of, Ben. It\r\nhappens, unfortunately, that that single blemish is a want of taste. She\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion that she don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she does like,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben\r\nAllen contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps not,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Mr. Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion that she\r\ndoes know what she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like, and that\xe2\x80\x99s of more importance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen, setting his teeth together, and speaking\r\nmore like a savage warrior who fed on raw wolf\xe2\x80\x99s flesh which he carved\r\nwith his fingers, than a peaceable young gentleman who ate minced veal\r\nwith a knife and fork--\xe2\x80\x98I wish I knew whether any rascal really has been\r\ntampering with her, and attempting to engage her affections. I think I\r\nshould assassinate him, Bob.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d put a bullet in him, if I found him out,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Sawyer, stopping\r\nin the course of a long draught of beer, and looking malignantly out of\r\nthe porter pot. \xe2\x80\x98If that didn\xe2\x80\x99t do his business, I\xe2\x80\x99d extract it\r\nafterwards, and kill him that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen gazed abstractedly on his friend for some minutes in\r\nsilence, and then said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have never proposed to her, point-blank, Bob?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Because I saw it would be of no use,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Robert Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall do it, before you are twenty-four hours older,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Ben,\r\nwith desperate calmness. \xe2\x80\x98She shall have you, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll know the reason\r\nwhy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll exert my authority.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98we shall see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall see, my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Ben Allen fiercely. He paused for\r\na few seconds, and added in a voice broken by emotion, \xe2\x80\x98You have loved\r\nher from a child, my friend. You loved her when we were boys at school\r\ntogether, and, even then, she was wayward and slighted your young\r\nfeelings. Do you recollect, with all the eagerness of a child\xe2\x80\x99s love,\r\none day pressing upon her acceptance, two small caraway-seed biscuits\r\nand one sweet apple, neatly folded into a circular parcel with the leaf\r\nof a copy-book?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She slighted that, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She did,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bob. \xe2\x80\x98She said I had kept the parcel so long in the\r\npockets of my corduroys, that the apple was unpleasantly warm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Allen gloomily. \xe2\x80\x98Upon which we ate it ourselves,\r\nin alternate bites.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBob Sawyer intimated his recollection of the circumstance last alluded\r\nto, by a melancholy frown; and the two friends remained for some time\r\nabsorbed, each in his own meditations.\r\n\r\nWhile these observations were being exchanged between Mr. Bob Sawyer and\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen; and while the boy in the gray livery, marvelling at\r\nthe unwonted prolongation of the dinner, cast an anxious look, from time\r\nto time, towards the glass door, distracted by inward misgivings\r\nregarding the amount of minced veal which would be ultimately reserved\r\nfor his individual cravings; there rolled soberly on through the streets\r\nof Bristol, a private fly, painted of a sad green colour, drawn by a\r\nchubby sort of brown horse, and driven by a surly-looking man with his\r\nlegs dressed like the legs of a groom, and his body attired in the coat\r\nof a coachman. Such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging\r\nto, and maintained by, old ladies of economic habits; and in this\r\nvehicle sat an old lady who was its mistress and proprietor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Martin!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, calling to the surly man, out of the front\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said the surly man, touching his hat to the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was going there,\xe2\x80\x99 said the surly man.\r\n\r\nThe old lady nodded the satisfaction which this proof of the surly man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforesight imparted to her feelings; and the surly man giving a smart\r\nlash to the chubby horse, they all repaired to Mr. Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Martin!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, when the fly stopped at the door of Mr.\r\nRobert Sawyer, late Nockemorf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said Martin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask the lad to step out, and mind the horse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to mind the horse myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martin, laying his whip on\r\nthe roof of the fly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t permit it, on any account,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady; \xe2\x80\x98your testimony\r\nwill be very important, and I must take you into the house with me. You\r\nmust not stir from my side during the whole interview. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Martin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; what are you stopping for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Martin. So saying, the surly man leisurely descended\r\nfrom the wheel, on which he had been poising himself on the tops of the\r\ntoes of his right foot, and having summoned the boy in the gray livery,\r\nopened the coach door, flung down the steps, and thrusting in a hand\r\nenveloped in a dark wash-leather glove, pulled out the old lady with as\r\nmuch unconcern in his manner as if she were a bandbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old lady. \xe2\x80\x98I am so flurried, now I have got\r\nhere, Martin, that I\xe2\x80\x99m all in a tremble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Martin coughed behind the dark wash-leather gloves, but expressed no\r\nsympathy; so the old lady, composing herself, trotted up Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer\xe2\x80\x99s steps, and Mr. Martin followed. Immediately on the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentering the shop, Mr. Benjamin Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been\r\nputting the spirits-and-water out of sight, and upsetting nauseous drugs\r\nto take off the smell of the tobacco smoke, issued hastily forth in a\r\ntransport of pleasure and affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear aunt,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen, \xe2\x80\x98how kind of you to look in\r\nupon us! Mr. Sawyer, aunt; my friend Mr. Bob Sawyer whom I have spoken\r\nto you about, regarding--you know, aunt.\xe2\x80\x99 And here Mr. Ben Allen, who\r\nwas not at the moment extraordinarily sober, added the word \xe2\x80\x98Arabella,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin what was meant to be a whisper, but which was an especially audible\r\nand distinct tone of speech which nobody could avoid hearing, if anybody\r\nwere so disposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Benjamin,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, struggling with a great shortness\r\nof breath, and trembling from head to foot, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, my dear,\r\nbut I think I had better speak to Mr. Sawyer, alone, for a moment. Only\r\nfor one moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bob,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Allen, \xe2\x80\x98will you take my aunt into the surgery?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Bob, in a most professional voice. \xe2\x80\x98Step this\r\nway, my dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. We shall be able to set\r\nyou to rights in a very short time, I have no doubt, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Here, my\r\ndear ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Now then!\xe2\x80\x99 With this, Mr. Bob Sawyer having handed the old\r\nlady to a chair, shut the door, drew another chair close to her, and\r\nwaited to hear detailed the symptoms of some disorder from which he saw\r\nin perspective a long train of profits and advantages.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the old lady did, was to shake her head a great many\r\ntimes, and began to cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nervous,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer complacently. \xe2\x80\x98Camphor-julep and water three\r\ntimes a day, and composing draught at night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to begin, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x98It is so\r\nvery painful and distressing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need not begin, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98I can anticipate\r\nall you would say. The head is in fault.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be very sorry to think it was the heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady,\r\nwith a slight groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the slightest danger of that, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nstomach is the primary cause.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Sawyer!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the old lady, starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the least doubt of it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bob, looking wondrous wise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Medicine, in time, my dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, would have prevented it all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, more flurried than before, \xe2\x80\x98this\r\nconduct is either great impertinence to one in my situation, Sir, or it\r\narises from your not understanding the object of my visit. If it had\r\nbeen in the power of medicine, or any foresight I could have used, to\r\nprevent what has occurred, I should certainly have done so. I had better\r\nsee my nephew at once,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, twirling her reticule\r\nindignantly, and rising as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a moment, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I have not\r\nunderstood you. What _is_ the matter, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My niece, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady: \xe2\x80\x98your friend\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, all impatience; for the old lady, although much\r\nagitated, spoke with the most tantalising deliberation, as old ladies\r\noften do. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Left my home, Mr. Sawyer, three days ago, on a pretended visit to my\r\nsister, another aunt of hers, who keeps the large boarding-school, just\r\nbeyond the third mile-stone, where there is a very large laburnum-tree\r\nand an oak gate,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, stopping in this place to dry her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, devil take the laburnum-tree, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, quite forgetting\r\nhis professional dignity in his anxiety. \xe2\x80\x98Get on a little faster; put a\r\nlittle more steam on, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, pray.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This morning,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady slowly--\xe2\x80\x98this morning, she--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She came back, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, with great animation. \xe2\x80\x98Did\r\nshe come back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, she did not; she wrote,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did she say?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Bob eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She said, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old lady--\xe2\x80\x98and it is this I want to\r\nprepare Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s mind for, gently and by degrees; she said that she\r\nwas--I have got the letter in my pocket, Mr. Sawyer, but my glasses are\r\nin the carriage, and I should only waste your time if I attempted to\r\npoint out the passage to you, without them; she said, in short, Mr.\r\nSawyer, that she was married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat!\xe2\x80\x99 said, or rather shouted, Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Married,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the old lady.\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer stopped to hear no more; but darting from the surgery\r\ninto the outer shop, cried in a stentorian voice, \xe2\x80\x98Ben, my boy, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbolted!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Ben Allen, who had been slumbering behind the counter, with his head\r\nhalf a foot or so below his knees, no sooner heard this appalling\r\ncommunication, than he made a precipitate rush at Mr. Martin, and,\r\ntwisting his hand in the neck-cloth of that taciturn servitor, expressed\r\nan obliging intention of choking him where he stood. This intention,\r\nwith a promptitude often the effect of desperation, he at once commenced\r\ncarrying into execution, with much vigour and surgical skill.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin, who was a man of few words and possessed but little power of\r\neloquence or persuasion, submitted to this operation with a very calm\r\nand agreeable expression of countenance, for some seconds; finding,\r\nhowever, that it threatened speedily to lead to a result which would\r\nplace it beyond his power to claim any wages, board or otherwise, in all\r\ntime to come, he muttered an inarticulate remonstrance and felled Mr.\r\nBenjamin Allen to the ground. As that gentleman had his hands entangled\r\nin his cravat, he had no alternative but to follow him to the floor.\r\nThere they both lay struggling, when the shop door opened, and the party\r\nwas increased by the arrival of two most unexpected visitors, to wit,\r\nMr. Pickwick and Mr. Samuel Weller.\r\n\r\nThe impression at once produced on Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s mind by what he saw,\r\nwas, that Mr. Martin was hired by the establishment of Sawyer, late\r\nNockemorf, to take strong medicine, or to go into fits and be\r\nexperimentalised upon, or to swallow poison now and then with the view\r\nof testing the efficacy of some new antidotes, or to do something or\r\nother to promote the great science of medicine, and gratify the ardent\r\nspirit of inquiry burning in the bosoms of its two young professors. So,\r\nwithout presuming to interfere, Sam stood perfectly still, and looked\r\non, as if he were mightily interested in the result of the then pending\r\nexperiment. Not so, Mr. Pickwick. He at once threw himself on the\r\nastonished combatants, with his accustomed energy, and loudly called\r\nupon the bystanders to interpose.\r\n\r\nThis roused Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been hitherto quite paralysed by the\r\nfrenzy of his companion. With that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, Mr. Pickwick\r\nraised Ben Allen to his feet. Mr. Martin finding himself alone on the\r\nfloor, got up, and looked about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Allen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98what is the matter, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Allen, with haughty defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, looking at Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98Is he\r\nunwell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Bob could reply, Mr. Ben Allen seized Mr. Pickwick by the hand,\r\nand murmured, in sorrowful accents, \xe2\x80\x98My sister, my dear Sir; my sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, is that all!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98We shall easily arrange that\r\nmatter, I hope. Your sister is safe and well, and I am here, my dear\r\nSir, to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorry to do anythin\xe2\x80\x99 as may cause an interruption to such wery pleasant\r\nproceedin\xe2\x80\x99s, as the king said wen he dissolved the parliament,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninterposed Mr. Weller, who had been peeping through the glass door; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s another experiment here, sir. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a wenerable old lady a--\r\nlyin\xe2\x80\x99 on the carpet waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for dissection, or galwinism, or some other\r\nrewivin\xe2\x80\x99 and scientific inwention.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forgot,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen. \xe2\x80\x98It is my aunt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Poor lady! Gently Sam, gently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Strange sitivation for one o\xe2\x80\x99 the family,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam Weller,\r\nhoisting the aunt into a chair. \xe2\x80\x98Now depitty sawbones, bring out the\r\nwollatilly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe latter observation was addressed to the boy in gray, who, having\r\nhanded over the fly to the care of the street-keeper, had come back to\r\nsee what all the noise was about. Between the boy in gray, and Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer, and Mr. Benjamin Allen (who having frightened his aunt into a\r\nfainting fit, was affectionately solicitous for her recovery) the old\r\nlady was at length restored to consciousness; then Mr. Ben Allen,\r\nturning with a puzzled countenance to Mr. Pickwick, asked him what he\r\nwas about to say, when he had been so alarmingly interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are all friends here, I presume?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, clearing his\r\nvoice, and looking towards the man of few words with the surly\r\ncountenance, who drove the fly with the chubby horse.\r\n\r\nThis reminded Mr. Bob Sawyer that the boy in gray was looking on, with\r\neyes wide open, and greedy ears. The incipient chemist having been\r\nlifted up by his coat collar, and dropped outside the door, Bob Sawyer\r\nassured Mr. Pickwick that he might speak without reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your sister, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, turning to Benjamin\r\nAllen, \xe2\x80\x98is in London; well and happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her happiness is no object to me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Benjamin Allen, with a\r\nflourish of the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her husband _is_ an object to _me_, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98He shall be\r\nan object to me, sir, at twelve paces, and a pretty object I\xe2\x80\x99ll make of\r\nhim, sir--a mean-spirited scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x99 This, as it stood, was a very\r\npretty denunciation, and magnanimous withal; but Mr. Bob Sawyer rather\r\nweakened its effect, by winding up with some general observations\r\nconcerning the punching of heads and knocking out of eyes, which were\r\ncommonplace by comparison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98before you apply those epithets to the\r\ngentleman in question, consider, dispassionately, the extent of his\r\nfault, and above all remember that he is a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98His name!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Ben Allen. \xe2\x80\x98His name!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Nathaniel Winkle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen deliberately crushed his spectacles beneath the heel\r\nof his boot, and having picked up the pieces, and put them into three\r\nseparate pockets, folded his arms, bit his lips, and looked in a\r\nthreatening manner at the bland features of Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it, Sir, who have encouraged and brought about this\r\nmatch?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it\xe2\x80\x99s this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s servant, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted the old\r\nlady, \xe2\x80\x98who has been skulking about my house, and endeavouring to entrap\r\nmy servants to conspire against their mistress.--Martin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said the surly man, coming forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the young man you saw in the lane, whom you told me about, this\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Martin, who, as it has already appeared, was a man of few words,\r\nlooked at Sam Weller, nodded his head, and growled forth, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller, who was never proud, gave a smile of friendly\r\nrecognition as his eyes encountered those of the surly groom, and\r\nadmitted in courteous terms, that he had \xe2\x80\x98knowed him afore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this is the faithful creature,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen, \xe2\x80\x98whom I\r\nhad nearly suffocated!--Mr. Pickwick, how dare you allow your fellow to\r\nbe employed in the abduction of my sister? I demand that you explain\r\nthis matter, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Explain it, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bob Sawyer fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A regular plant,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A disgraceful imposition,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing but a do,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Martin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray hear me,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr. Pickwick, as Mr. Ben Allen fell into a chair\r\nthat patients were bled in, and gave way to his pocket-handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave rendered no assistance in this matter, beyond being present at one\r\ninterview between the young people which I could not prevent, and from\r\nwhich I conceived my presence would remove any slight colouring of\r\nimpropriety that it might otherwise have had; this is the whole share I\r\nhave had in the transaction, and I had no suspicion that an immediate\r\nmarriage was even contemplated. Though, mind,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick,\r\nhastily checking himself--\xe2\x80\x98mind, I do not say I should have prevented\r\nit, if I had known that it was intended.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You hear that, all of you; you hear that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope they do,\xe2\x80\x99 mildly observed Mr. Pickwick, looking round, \xe2\x80\x98and,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadded that gentleman, his colour mounting as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x98I hope they hear\r\nthis, Sir, also. That from what has been stated to me, sir, I assert\r\nthat you were by no means justified in attempting to force your sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninclinations as you did, and that you should rather have endeavoured by\r\nyour kindness and forbearance to have supplied the place of other nearer\r\nrelations whom she had never known, from a child. As regards my young\r\nfriend, I must beg to add, that in every point of worldly advantage he\r\nis, at least, on an equal footing with yourself, if not on a much better\r\none, and that unless I hear this question discussed with becoming temper\r\nand moderation, I decline hearing any more said upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish to make a wery few remarks in addition to wot has been put\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x99ard by the honourable gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n as has jist give over,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller, stepping forth, \xe2\x80\x98wich is this here: a indiwidual in company has\r\ncalled me a feller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That has nothing whatever to do with the matter, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr.\r\nPickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Pray hold your tongue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say nothin\xe2\x80\x99 on that \xe2\x80\x98ere pint, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but merely this here. P\xe2\x80\x99raps that gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n may think as there wos a\r\npriory \xe2\x80\x98tachment; but there worn\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the sort, for the young\r\nlady said in the wery beginnin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the keepin\xe2\x80\x99 company, that she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide him. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s cut him out, and it \xe2\x80\x98ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been jist the\r\nwery same for him if the young lady had never seen Mr. Vinkle. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I wished to say, sir, and I hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve now made that \xe2\x80\x98ere\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s mind easy.\r\n\r\nA short pause followed these consolatory remarks of Mr. Weller. Then Mr.\r\nBen Allen rising from his chair, protested that he would never see\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s face again; while Mr. Bob Sawyer, despite Sam\xe2\x80\x99s flattering\r\nassurance, vowed dreadful vengeance on the happy bridegroom.\r\n\r\nBut, just when matters were at their height, and threatening to remain\r\nso, Mr. Pickwick found a powerful assistant in the old lady, who,\r\nevidently much struck by the mode in which he had advocated her niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncause, ventured to approach Mr. Benjamin Allen with a few comforting\r\nreflections, of which the chief were, that after all, perhaps, it was\r\nwell it was no worse; the least said the soonest mended, and upon her\r\nword she did not know that it was so very bad after all; what was over\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be begun, and what couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cured must be endured; with\r\nvarious other assurances of the like novel and strengthening\r\ndescription. To all of these, Mr. Benjamin Allen replied that he meant\r\nno disrespect to his aunt, or anybody there, but if it were all the same\r\nto them, and they would allow him to have his own way, he would rather\r\nhave the pleasure of hating his sister till death, and after it.\r\n\r\nAt length, when this determination had been announced half a hundred\r\ntimes, the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic,\r\nwished to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her\r\nyears or station, and that she should be obliged to beg and pray, in\r\nthat way, of her own nephew, whom she remembered about five-and-twenty\r\nyears before he was born, and whom she had known, personally, when he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t a tooth in his head; to say nothing of her presence on the first\r\noccasion of his having his hair cut, and assistance at numerous other\r\ntimes and ceremonies during his babyhood, of sufficient importance to\r\nfound a claim upon his affection, obedience, and sympathies, for ever.\r\n\r\nWhile the good lady was bestowing this objurgation on Mr. Ben Allen, Bob\r\nSawyer and Mr. Pickwick had retired in close conversation to the inner\r\nroom, where Mr. Sawyer was observed to apply himself several times to\r\nthe mouth of a black bottle, under the influence of which, his features\r\ngradually assumed a cheerful and even jovial expression. And at last he\r\nemerged from the room, bottle in hand, and, remarking that he was very\r\nsorry to say he had been making a fool of himself, begged to propose the\r\nhealth and happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Winkle, whose felicity, so far from\r\nenvying, he would be the first to congratulate them upon. Hearing this,\r\nMr. Ben Allen suddenly arose from his chair, and, seizing the black\r\nbottle, drank the toast so heartily, that, the liquor being strong, he\r\nbecame nearly as black in the face as the bottle. Finally, the black\r\nbottle went round till it was empty, and there was so much shaking of\r\nhands and interchanging of compliments, that even the metal-visaged Mr.\r\nMartin condescended to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, rubbing his hands, \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a jolly\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that I must return to my inn. I have\r\nnot been accustomed to fatigue lately, and my journey has tired me\r\nexceedingly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll take some tea, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, with\r\nirresistible sweetness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, I would rather not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman. The truth is,\r\nthat the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s evidently increasing admiration was Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprincipal inducement for going away. He thought of Mrs. Bardell; and\r\nevery glance of the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes threw him into a cold perspiration.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick could by no means be prevailed upon to stay, it was\r\narranged at once, on his own proposition, that Mr. Benjamin Allen should\r\naccompany him on his journey to the elder Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s, and that the\r\ncoach should be at the door, at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock next morning. He then took\r\nhis leave, and, followed by Samuel Weller, repaired to the Bush. It is\r\nworthy of remark, that Mr. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s face was horribly convulsed as he\r\nshook hands with Sam at parting, and that he gave vent to a smile and an\r\noath simultaneously; from which tokens it has been inferred by those who\r\nwere best acquainted with that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarities, that he\r\nexpressed himself much pleased with Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s society, and requested\r\nthe honour of his further acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I order a private room, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, when they reached the\r\nBush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, no, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98as I dined in the coffee-room,\r\nand shall go to bed soon, it is hardly worth while. See who there is in\r\nthe travellers\xe2\x80\x99 room, Sam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller departed on his errand, and presently returned to say that\r\nthere was only a gentleman with one eye; and that he and the landlord\r\nwere drinking a bowl of bishop together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will join them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a queer customer, the vun-eyed vun, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Weller, as\r\nhe led the way. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a-gammonin\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere landlord, he is, sir, till\r\nhe don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know wether he\xe2\x80\x99s a-standing on the soles of his boots\r\nor the crown of his hat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe individual to whom this observation referred, was sitting at the\r\nupper end of the room when Mr. Pickwick entered, and was smoking a large\r\nDutch pipe, with his eye intently fixed on the round face of the\r\nlandlord; a jolly-looking old personage, to whom he had recently been\r\nrelating some tale of wonder, as was testified by sundry disjointed\r\nexclamations of, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed it! The strangest thing\r\nI ever heard! Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have supposed it possible!\xe2\x80\x99 and other expressions\r\nof astonishment which burst spontaneously from his lips, as he returned\r\nthe fixed gaze of the one-eyed man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Servant, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the one-eyed man to Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Fine night,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very much so indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, as the waiter placed a\r\nsmall decanter of brandy, and some hot water before him.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Pickwick was mixing his brandy-and-water, the one-eyed man\r\nlooked round at him earnestly, from time to time, and at length said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t recollect you,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say not,\xe2\x80\x99 said the one-eyed man. \xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know me, but I knew\r\ntwo friends of yours that were stopping at the Peacock at Eatanswill, at\r\nthe time of the election.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the one-eyed man. \xe2\x80\x98I mentioned a little circumstance to\r\nthem about a friend of mine of the name of Tom Smart. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard them speak of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Often,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98He was your uncle, I think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; only a friend of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the one-eyed man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was a wonderful man, that uncle of yours, though,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the\r\nlandlord shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I think he was; I think I may say he was,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the one-eyed\r\nman. \xe2\x80\x98I could tell you a story about that same uncle, gentlemen, that\r\nwould rather surprise you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Let us hear it, by all means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe one-eyed bagman ladled out a glass of negus from the bowl, and drank\r\nit; smoked a long whiff out of the Dutch pipe; and then, calling to Sam\r\nWeller who was lingering near the door, that he needn\xe2\x80\x99t go away unless\r\nhe wanted to, because the story was no secret, fixed his eye upon the\r\nlandlord\xe2\x80\x99s, and proceeded, in the words of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX. CONTAINING THE STORY OF THE BAGMAN\xe2\x80\x99S UNCLE\r\n\r\nMy uncle, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bagman, \xe2\x80\x98was one of the merriest,\r\npleasantest, cleverest fellows, that ever lived. I wish you had known\r\nhim, gentlemen. On second thoughts, gentlemen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish you had\r\nknown him, for if you had, you would have been all, by this time, in the\r\nordinary course of nature, if not dead, at all events so near it, as to\r\nhave taken to stopping at home and giving up company, which would have\r\ndeprived me of the inestimable pleasure of addressing you at this\r\nmoment. Gentlemen, I wish your fathers and mothers had known my uncle.\r\nThey would have been amazingly fond of him, especially your respectable\r\nmothers; I know they would. If any two of his numerous virtues\r\npredominated over the many that adorned his character, I should say they\r\nwere his mixed punch and his after-supper song. Excuse my dwelling on\r\nthese melancholy recollections of departed worth; you won\xe2\x80\x99t see a man\r\nlike my uncle every day in the week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have always considered it a great point in my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s character,\r\ngentlemen, that he was the intimate friend and companion of Tom Smart,\r\nof the great house of Bilson and Slum, Cateaton Street, City. My uncle\r\ncollected for Tiggin and Welps, but for a long time he went pretty near\r\nthe same journey as Tom; and the very first night they met, my uncle\r\ntook a fancy for Tom, and Tom took a fancy for my uncle. They made a bet\r\nof a new hat before they had known each other half an hour, who should\r\nbrew the best quart of punch and drink it the quickest. My uncle was\r\njudged to have won the making, but Tom Smart beat him in the drinking by\r\nabout half a salt-spoonful. They took another quart apiece to drink each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s health in, and were staunch friends ever afterwards. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndestiny in these things, gentlemen; we can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In personal appearance, my uncle was a trifle shorter than the middle\r\nsize; he was a thought stouter too, than the ordinary run of people, and\r\nperhaps his face might be a shade redder. He had the jolliest face you\r\never saw, gentleman: something like Punch, with a handsome nose and\r\nchin; his eyes were always twinkling and sparkling with good-humour; and\r\na smile--not one of your unmeaning wooden grins, but a real, merry,\r\nhearty, good-tempered smile--was perpetually on his countenance. He was\r\npitched out of his gig once, and knocked, head first, against a\r\nmilestone. There he lay, stunned, and so cut about the face with some\r\ngravel which had been heaped up alongside it, that, to use my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown strong expression, if his mother could have revisited the earth, she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known him. Indeed, when I come to think of the matter,\r\ngentlemen, I feel pretty sure she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, for she died when my uncle\r\nwas two years and seven months old, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very likely that,\r\neven without the gravel, his top-boots would have puzzled the good lady\r\nnot a little; to say nothing of his jolly red face. However, there he\r\nlay, and I have heard my uncle say, many a time, that the man said who\r\npicked him up that he was smiling as merrily as if he had tumbled out\r\nfor a treat, and that after they had bled him, the first faint\r\nglimmerings of returning animation, were his jumping up in bed, bursting\r\nout into a loud laugh, kissing the young woman who held the basin, and\r\ndemanding a mutton chop and a pickled walnut. He was very fond of\r\npickled walnuts, gentlemen. He said he always found that, taken without\r\nvinegar, they relished the beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle\xe2\x80\x99s great journey was in the fall of the leaf, at which time he\r\ncollected debts, and took orders, in the north; going from London to\r\nEdinburgh, from Edinburgh to Glasgow, from Glasgow back to Edinburgh,\r\nand thence to London by the smack. You are to understand that his second\r\nvisit to Edinburgh was for his own pleasure. He used to go back for a\r\nweek, just to look up his old friends; and what with breakfasting with\r\nthis one, lunching with that, dining with the third, and supping with\r\nanother, a pretty tight week he used to make of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether\r\nany of you, gentlemen, ever partook of a real substantial hospitable\r\nScotch breakfast, and then went out to a slight lunch of a bushel of\r\noysters, a dozen or so of bottled ale, and a noggin or two of whiskey to\r\nclose up with. If you ever did, you will agree with me that it requires\r\na pretty strong head to go out to dinner and supper afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But bless your hearts and eyebrows, all this sort of thing was nothing\r\nto my uncle! He was so well seasoned, that it was mere child\xe2\x80\x99s play. I\r\nhave heard him say that he could see the Dundee people out, any day, and\r\nwalk home afterwards without staggering; and yet the Dundee people have\r\nas strong heads and as strong punch, gentlemen, as you are likely to\r\nmeet with, between the poles. I have heard of a Glasgow man and a Dundee\r\nman drinking against each other for fifteen hours at a sitting. They\r\nwere both suffocated, as nearly as could be ascertained, at the same\r\nmoment, but with this trifling exception, gentlemen, they were not a bit\r\nthe worse for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One night, within four-and-twenty hours of the time when he had settled\r\nto take shipping for London, my uncle supped at the house of a very old\r\nfriend of his, a Bailie Mac something and four syllables after it, who\r\nlived in the old town of Edinburgh. There were the bailie\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and\r\nthe bailie\xe2\x80\x99s three daughters, and the bailie\xe2\x80\x99s grown-up son, and three\r\nor four stout, bushy eye-browed, canny, old Scotch fellows, that the\r\nbailie had got together to do honour to my uncle, and help to make\r\nmerry. It was a glorious supper. There was kippered salmon, and Finnan\r\nhaddocks, and a lamb\xe2\x80\x99s head, and a haggis--a celebrated Scotch dish,\r\ngentlemen, which my uncle used to say always looked to him, when it came\r\nto table, very much like a Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s stomach--and a great many other\r\nthings besides, that I forget the names of, but very good things,\r\nnotwithstanding. The lassies were pretty and agreeable; the bailie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife was one of the best creatures that ever lived; and my uncle was in\r\nthoroughly good cue. The consequence of which was, that the young ladies\r\ntittered and giggled, and the old lady laughed out loud, and the bailie\r\nand the other old fellows roared till they were red in the face, the\r\nwhole mortal time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite recollect how many tumblers of whiskey-\r\ntoddy each man drank after supper; but this I know, that about one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, the bailie\xe2\x80\x99s grown-up son became insensible\r\nwhile attempting the first verse of \xe2\x80\x9cWillie brewed a peck o\xe2\x80\x99 maut\xe2\x80\x9d; and\r\nhe having been, for half an hour before, the only other man visible\r\nabove the mahogany, it occurred to my uncle that it was almost time to\r\nthink about going, especially as drinking had set in at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nin order that he might get home at a decent hour. But, thinking it might\r\nnot be quite polite to go just then, my uncle voted himself into the\r\nchair, mixed another glass, rose to propose his own health, addressed\r\nhimself in a neat and complimentary speech, and drank the toast with\r\ngreat enthusiasm. Still nobody woke; so my uncle took a little drop\r\nmore--neat this time, to prevent the toddy from disagreeing with him--\r\nand, laying violent hands on his hat, sallied forth into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a wild, gusty night when my uncle closed the bailie\xe2\x80\x99s door, and\r\nsettling his hat firmly on his head to prevent the wind from taking it,\r\nthrust his hands into his pockets, and looking upward, took a short\r\nsurvey of the state of the weather. The clouds were drifting over the\r\nmoon at their giddiest speed; at one time wholly obscuring her; at\r\nanother, suffering her to burst forth in full splendour and shed her\r\nlight on all the objects around; anon, driving over her again, with\r\nincreased velocity, and shrouding everything in darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, this\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, addressing himself to the weather, as if he\r\nfelt himself personally offended. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not at all the kind of thing\r\nfor my voyage. It will not do at any price,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, very\r\nimpressively. Having repeated this, several times, he recovered his\r\nbalance with some difficulty--for he was rather giddy with looking up\r\ninto the sky so long--and walked merrily on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The bailie\xe2\x80\x99s house was in the Canongate, and my uncle was going to the\r\nother end of Leith Walk, rather better than a mile\xe2\x80\x99s journey. On either\r\nside of him, there shot up against the dark sky, tall, gaunt, straggling\r\nhouses, with time-stained fronts, and windows that seemed to have shared\r\nthe lot of eyes in mortals, and to have grown dim and sunken with age.\r\nSix, seven, eight storey high, were the houses; storey piled upon\r\nstorey, as children build with cards--throwing their dark shadows over\r\nthe roughly paved road, and making the dark night darker. A few oil\r\nlamps were scattered at long distances, but they only served to mark the\r\ndirty entrance to some narrow close, or to show where a common stair\r\ncommunicated, by steep and intricate windings, with the various flats\r\nabove. Glancing at all these things with the air of a man who had seen\r\nthem too often before, to think them worthy of much notice now, my uncle\r\nwalked up the middle of the street, with a thumb in each waistcoat\r\npocket, indulging from time to time in various snatches of song, chanted\r\nforth with such good-will and spirit, that the quiet honest folk started\r\nfrom their first sleep and lay trembling in bed till the sound died away\r\nin the distance; when, satisfying themselves that it was only some\r\ndrunken ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-weel finding his way home, they covered themselves up\r\nwarm and fell asleep again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the\r\nstreet, with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, gentlemen, because, as\r\nhe often used to say (and with great reason too) there is nothing at all\r\nextraordinary in this story, unless you distinctly understand at the\r\nbeginning, that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, my uncle walked on with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets,\r\ntaking the middle of the street to himself, and singing, now a verse of\r\na love song, and then a verse of a drinking one, and when he was tired\r\nof both, whistling melodiously, until he reached the North Bridge,\r\nwhich, at this point, connects the old and new towns of Edinburgh. Here\r\nhe stopped for a minute, to look at the strange, irregular clusters of\r\nlights piled one above the other, and twinkling afar off so high, that\r\nthey looked like stars, gleaming from the castle walls on the one side\r\nand the Calton Hill on the other, as if they illuminated veritable\r\ncastles in the air; while the old picturesque town slept heavily on, in\r\ngloom and darkness below: its palace and chapel of Holyrood, guarded day\r\nand night, as a friend of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s used to say, by old Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s Seat,\r\ntowering, surly and dark, like some gruff genius, over the ancient city\r\nhe has watched so long. I say, gentlemen, my uncle stopped here, for a\r\nminute, to look about him; and then, paying a compliment to the weather,\r\nwhich had a little cleared up, though the moon was sinking, walked on\r\nagain, as royally as before; keeping the middle of the road with great\r\ndignity, and looking as if he would very much like to meet with somebody\r\nwho would dispute possession of it with him. There was nobody at all\r\ndisposed to contest the point, as it happened; and so, on he went, with\r\nhis thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, like a lamb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When my uncle reached the end of Leith Walk, he had to cross a pretty\r\nlarge piece of waste ground which separated him from a short street\r\nwhich he had to turn down to go direct to his lodging. Now, in this\r\npiece of waste ground, there was, at that time, an enclosure belonging\r\nto some wheelwright who contracted with the Post Office for the purchase\r\nof old, worn-out mail coaches; and my uncle, being very fond of coaches,\r\nold, young, or middle-aged, all at once took it into his head to step\r\nout of his road for no other purpose than to peep between the palings at\r\nthese mails--about a dozen of which he remembered to have seen, crowded\r\ntogether in a very forlorn and dismantled state, inside. My uncle was a\r\nvery enthusiastic, emphatic sort of person, gentlemen; so, finding that\r\nhe could not obtain a good peep between the palings he got over them,\r\nand sitting himself quietly down on an old axle-tree, began to\r\ncontemplate the mail coaches with a deal of gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There might be a dozen of them, or there might be more--my uncle was\r\nnever quite certain on this point, and being a man of very scrupulous\r\nveracity about numbers, didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to say--but there they stood, all\r\nhuddled together in the most desolate condition imaginable. The doors\r\nhad been torn from their hinges and removed; the linings had been\r\nstripped off, only a shred hanging here and there by a rusty nail; the\r\nlamps were gone, the poles had long since vanished, the ironwork was\r\nrusty, the paint was worn away; the wind whistled through the chinks in\r\nthe bare woodwork; and the rain, which had collected on the roofs, fell,\r\ndrop by drop, into the insides with a hollow and melancholy sound. They\r\nwere the decaying skeletons of departed mails, and in that lonely place,\r\nat that time of night, they looked chill and dismal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle rested his head upon his hands, and thought of the busy,\r\nbustling people who had rattled about, years before, in the old coaches,\r\nand were now as silent and changed; he thought of the numbers of people\r\nto whom one of these crazy, mouldering vehicles had borne, night after\r\nnight, for many years, and through all weathers, the anxiously expected\r\nintelligence, the eagerly looked-for remittance, the promised assurance\r\nof health and safety, the sudden announcement of sickness and death. The\r\nmerchant, the lover, the wife, the widow, the mother, the school-boy,\r\nthe very child who tottered to the door at the postman\xe2\x80\x99s knock--how had\r\nthey all looked forward to the arrival of the old coach. And where were\r\nthey all now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, my uncle used to _say _that he thought all this at the time,\r\nbut I rather suspect he learned it out of some book afterwards, for he\r\ndistinctly stated that he fell into a kind of doze, as he sat on the old\r\naxle-tree looking at the decayed mail coaches, and that he was suddenly\r\nawakened by some deep church bell striking two. Now, my uncle was never\r\na fast thinker, and if he had thought all these things, I am quite\r\ncertain it would have taken him till full half-past two o\xe2\x80\x99clock at the\r\nvery least. I am, therefore, decidedly of opinion, gentlemen, that my\r\nuncle fell into a kind of doze, without having thought about anything at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be this as it may, a church bell struck two. My uncle woke, rubbed his\r\neyes, and jumped up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In one instant, after the clock struck two, the whole of this deserted\r\nand quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary life and\r\nanimation. The mail coach doors were on their hinges, the lining was\r\nreplaced, the ironwork was as good as new, the paint was restored, the\r\nlamps were alight; cushions and greatcoats were on every coach-box,\r\nporters were thrusting parcels into every boot, guards were stowing away\r\nletter-bags, hostlers were dashing pails of water against the renovated\r\nwheels; numbers of men were pushing about, fixing poles into every\r\ncoach; passengers arrived, portmanteaus were handed up, horses were put\r\nto; in short, it was perfectly clear that every mail there, was to be\r\noff directly. Gentlemen, my uncle opened his eyes so wide at all this,\r\nthat, to the very last moment of his life, he used to wonder how it fell\r\nout that he had ever been able to shut \xe2\x80\x98em again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNow then!\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, as my uncle felt a hand on his shoulder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re booked for one inside. You\xe2\x80\x99d better get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI booked!\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, turning round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle, gentlemen, could say nothing, he was so very much astonished.\r\nThe queerest thing of all was that although there was such a crowd of\r\npersons, and although fresh faces were pouring in, every moment, there\r\nwas no telling where they came from. They seemed to start up, in some\r\nstrange manner, from the ground, or the air, and disappear in the same\r\nway. When a porter had put his luggage in the coach, and received his\r\nfare, he turned round and was gone; and before my uncle had well begun\r\nto wonder what had become of him, half a dozen fresh ones started up,\r\nand staggered along under the weight of parcels, which seemed big enough\r\nto crush them. The passengers were all dressed so oddly too! Large,\r\nbroad-skirted laced coats, with great cuffs and no collars; and wigs,\r\ngentlemen--great formal wigs with a tie behind. My uncle could make\r\nnothing of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNow, are you going to get in?\xe2\x80\x9d said the person who had addressed my\r\nuncle before. He was dressed as a mail guard, with a wig on his head and\r\nmost enormous cuffs to his coat, and had a lantern in one hand, and a\r\nhuge blunderbuss in the other, which he was going to stow away in his\r\nlittle arm-chest. \xe2\x80\x9c_are _you going to get in, Jack Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nguard, holding the lantern to my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHollo!\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, falling back a step or two. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s familiar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so on the way-bill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there a \xe2\x80\x98Mister\xe2\x80\x99 before it?\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle. For he felt,\r\ngentlemen, that for a guard he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, to call him Jack Martin, was\r\na liberty which the Post Office wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sanctioned if they had\r\nknown it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there is not,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the guard coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIs the fare paid?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cThen here goes! Which coach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard, pointing to an old-fashioned Edinburgh and\r\nLondon mail, which had the steps down and the door open. \xe2\x80\x9cStop! Here are\r\nthe other passengers. Let them get in first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the guard spoke, there all at once appeared, right in front of my\r\nuncle, a young gentleman in a powdered wig, and a sky-blue coat trimmed\r\nwith silver, made very full and broad in the skirts, which were lined\r\nwith buckram. Tiggin and Welps were in the printed calico and waistcoat\r\npiece line, gentlemen, so my uncle knew all the materials at once. He\r\nwore knee breeches, and a kind of leggings rolled up over his silk\r\nstockings, and shoes with buckles; he had ruffles at his wrists, a\r\nthree-cornered hat on his head, and a long taper sword by his side. The\r\nflaps of his waist-coat came half-way down his thighs, and the ends of\r\nhis cravat reached to his waist. He stalked gravely to the coach door,\r\npulled off his hat, and held it above his head at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, cocking\r\nhis little finger in the air at the same time, as some affected people\r\ndo, when they take a cup of tea. Then he drew his feet together, and\r\nmade a low, grave bow, and then put out his left hand. My uncle was just\r\ngoing to step forward, and shake it heartily, when he perceived that\r\nthese attentions were directed, not towards him, but to a young lady who\r\njust then appeared at the foot of the steps, attired in an old-fashioned\r\ngreen velvet dress with a long waist and stomacher. She had no bonnet on\r\nher head, gentlemen, which was muffled in a black silk hood, but she\r\nlooked round for an instant as she prepared to get into the coach, and\r\nsuch a beautiful face as she disclosed, my uncle had never seen--not\r\neven in a picture. She got into the coach, holding up her dress with one\r\nhand; and as my uncle always said with a round oath, when he told the\r\nstory, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed it possible that legs and feet could\r\nhave been brought to such a state of perfection unless he had seen them\r\nwith his own eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, in this one glimpse of the beautiful face, my uncle saw that the\r\nyoung lady cast an imploring look upon him, and that she appeared\r\nterrified and distressed. He noticed, too, that the young fellow in the\r\npowdered wig, notwithstanding his show of gallantry, which was all very\r\nfine and grand, clasped her tight by the wrist when she got in, and\r\nfollowed himself immediately afterwards. An uncommonly ill-looking\r\nfellow, in a close brown wig, and a plum-coloured suit, wearing a very\r\nlarge sword, and boots up to his hips, belonged to the party; and when\r\nhe sat himself down next to the young lady, who shrank into a corner at\r\nhis approach, my uncle was confirmed in his original impression that\r\nsomething dark and mysterious was going forward, or, as he always said\r\nhimself, that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was a screw loose somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s quite surprising\r\nhow quickly he made up his mind to help the lady at any peril, if she\r\nneeded any help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDeath and lightning!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young gentleman, laying his hand\r\nupon his sword as my uncle entered the coach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBlood and thunder!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the other gentleman. With this, he whipped\r\nhis sword out, and made a lunge at my uncle without further ceremony. My\r\nuncle had no weapon about him, but with great dexterity he snatched the\r\nill-looking gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s three-cornered hat from his head, and, receiving\r\nthe point of his sword right through the crown, squeezed the sides\r\ntogether, and held it tight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPink him behind!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the ill-looking gentleman to his companion, as\r\nhe struggled to regain his sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe had better not,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my uncle, displaying the heel of one of his\r\nshoes, in a threatening manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kick his brains out, if he has\r\nany--, or fracture his skull if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Exerting all his strength,\r\nat this moment, my uncle wrenched the ill-looking man\xe2\x80\x99s sword from his\r\ngrasp, and flung it clean out of the coach window, upon which the\r\nyounger gentleman vociferated, \xe2\x80\x9cDeath and lightning!\xe2\x80\x9d again, and laid\r\nhis hand upon the hilt of his sword, in a very fierce manner, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndraw it. Perhaps, gentlemen, as my uncle used to say with a smile,\r\nperhaps he was afraid of alarming the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, taking his seat deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to have any death, with or without lightning, in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nand we have had quite blood and thundering enough for one journey; so,\r\nif you please, we\xe2\x80\x99ll sit in our places like quiet insides. Here, guard,\r\npick up that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s carving-knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As quickly as my uncle said the words, the guard appeared at the coach\r\nwindow, with the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s sword in his hand. He held up his lantern,\r\nand looked earnestly in my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s face, as he handed it in, when, by\r\nits light, my uncle saw, to his great surprise, that an immense crowd of\r\nmail-coach guards swarmed round the window, every one of whom had his\r\neyes earnestly fixed upon him too. He had never seen such a sea of white\r\nfaces, red bodies, and earnest eyes, in all his born days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the strangest sort of thing I ever had anything to do with,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought my uncle; \xe2\x80\x9callow me to return you your hat, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The ill-looking gentleman received his three-cornered hat in silence,\r\nlooked at the hole in the middle with an inquiring air, and finally\r\nstuck it on the top of his wig with a solemnity the effect of which was\r\na trifle impaired by his sneezing violently at the moment, and jerking\r\nit off again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the guard with the lantern, mounting into his little\r\nseat behind. Away they went. My uncle peeped out of the coach window as\r\nthey emerged from the yard, and observed that the other mails, with\r\ncoachmen, guards, horses, and passengers, complete, were driving round\r\nand round in circles, at a slow trot of about five miles an hour. My\r\nuncle burned with indignation, gentlemen. As a commercial man, he felt\r\nthat the mail-bags were not to be trifled with, and he resolved to\r\nmemorialise the Post Office on the subject, the very instant he reached\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At present, however, his thoughts were occupied with the young lady who\r\nsat in the farthest corner of the coach, with her face muffled closely\r\nin her hood; the gentleman with the sky-blue coat sitting opposite to\r\nher; the other man in the plum-coloured suit, by her side; and both\r\nwatching her intently. If she so much as rustled the folds of her hood,\r\nhe could hear the ill-looking man clap his hand upon his sword, and\r\ncould tell by the other\xe2\x80\x99s breathing (it was so dark he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see his\r\nface) that he was looking as big as if he were going to devour her at a\r\nmouthful. This roused my uncle more and more, and he resolved, come what\r\nmight, to see the end of it. He had a great admiration for bright eyes,\r\nand sweet faces, and pretty legs and feet; in short, he was fond of the\r\nwhole sex. It runs in our family, gentleman--so am I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many were the devices which my uncle practised, to attract the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention, or at all events, to engage the mysterious gentlemen in\r\nconversation. They were all in vain; the gentlemen wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk, and\r\nthe lady didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare. He thrust his head out of the coach window at\r\nintervals, and bawled out to know why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t go faster. But he\r\ncalled till he was hoarse; nobody paid the least attention to him. He\r\nleaned back in the coach, and thought of the beautiful face, and the\r\nfeet and legs. This answered better; it whiled away the time, and kept\r\nhim from wondering where he was going, and how it was that he found\r\nhimself in such an odd situation. Not that this would have worried him\r\nmuch, anyway--he was a mighty free and easy, roving, devil-may-care sort\r\nof person, was my uncle, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All of a sudden the coach stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cHollo!\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthe wind now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAlight here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard, letting down the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do nothing of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then stop where you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The passengers had regarded this colloquy with great attention, and,\r\nfinding that my uncle was determined not to alight, the younger man\r\nsqueezed past him, to hand the lady out. At this moment, the ill-looking\r\nman was inspecting the hole in the crown of his three-cornered hat. As\r\nthe young lady brushed past, she dropped one of her gloves into my\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and softly whispered, with her lips so close to his face\r\nthat he felt her warm breath on his nose, the single word \xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Gentlemen, my uncle leaped out of the coach at once, with such violence\r\nthat it rocked on the springs again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought better of it, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard, when he\r\nsaw my uncle standing on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle looked at the guard for a few seconds, in some doubt whether\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better to wrench his blunderbuss from him, fire it in the\r\nface of the man with the big sword, knock the rest of the company over\r\nthe head with the stock, snatch up the young lady, and go off in the\r\nsmoke. On second thoughts, however, he abandoned this plan, as being a\r\nshade too melodramatic in the execution, and followed the two mysterious\r\nmen, who, keeping the lady between them, were now entering an old house\r\nin front of which the coach had stopped. They turned into the passage,\r\nand my uncle followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of all the ruinous and desolate places my uncle had ever beheld, this\r\nwas the most so. It looked as if it had once been a large house of\r\nentertainment; but the roof had fallen in, in many places, and the\r\nstairs were steep, rugged, and broken. There was a huge fireplace in the\r\nroom into which they walked, and the chimney was blackened with smoke;\r\nbut no warm blaze lighted it up now. The white feathery dust of burned\r\nwood was still strewed over the hearth, but the stove was cold, and all\r\nwas dark and gloomy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, as he looked about him, \xe2\x80\x9ca mail travelling at\r\nthe rate of six miles and a half an hour, and stopping for an indefinite\r\ntime at such a hole as this, is rather an irregular sort of proceeding,\r\nI fancy. This shall be made known. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle said this in a pretty loud voice, and in an open, unreserved\r\nsort of manner, with the view of engaging the two strangers in\r\nconversation if he could. But, neither of them took any more notice of\r\nhim than whispering to each other, and scowling at him as they did so.\r\nThe lady was at the farther end of the room, and once she ventured to\r\nwave her hand, as if beseeching my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At length the two strangers advanced a little, and the conversation\r\nbegan in earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know this is a private room, I suppose, fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngentleman in sky-blue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not, fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined my uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, if this is a private\r\nroom specially ordered for the occasion, I should think the public room\r\nmust be a _very _comfortable one;\xe2\x80\x9d with this, my uncle sat himself down\r\nin a high-backed chair, and took such an accurate measure of the\r\ngentleman, with his eyes, that Tiggin and Welps could have supplied him\r\nwith printed calico for a suit, and not an inch too much or too little,\r\nfrom that estimate alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cQuit this room,\xe2\x80\x9d said both men together, grasping their swords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, not at all appearing to comprehend their meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cQuit the room, or you are a dead man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ill-looking fellow\r\nwith the large sword, drawing it at the same time and flourishing it in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDown with him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman in sky-blue, drawing his sword\r\nalso, and falling back two or three yards. \xe2\x80\x9cDown with him!\xe2\x80\x9d The lady\r\ngave a loud scream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my uncle was always remarkable for great boldness, and great\r\npresence of mind. All the time that he had appeared so indifferent to\r\nwhat was going on, he had been looking slily about for some missile or\r\nweapon of defence, and at the very instant when the swords were drawn,\r\nhe espied, standing in the chimney-corner, an old basket-hilted rapier\r\nin a rusty scabbard. At one bound, my uncle caught it in his hand, drew\r\nit, flourished it gallantly above his head, called aloud to the lady to\r\nkeep out of the way, hurled the chair at the man in sky-blue, and the\r\nscabbard at the man in plum-colour, and taking advantage of the\r\nconfusion, fell upon them both, pell-mell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, there is an old story--none the worse for being true--\r\nregarding a fine young Irish gentleman, who being asked if he could play\r\nthe fiddle, replied he had no doubt he could, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly\r\nsay, for certain, because he had never tried. This is not inapplicable\r\nto my uncle and his fencing. He had never had a sword in his hand\r\nbefore, except once when he played Richard the Third at a private\r\ntheatre, upon which occasion it was arranged with Richmond that he was\r\nto be run through, from behind, without showing fight at all. But here\r\nhe was, cutting and slashing with two experienced swordsman, thrusting,\r\nand guarding, and poking, and slicing, and acquitting himself in the\r\nmost manful and dexterous manner possible, although up to that time he\r\nhad never been aware that he had the least notion of the science. It\r\nonly shows how true the old saying is, that a man never knows what he\r\ncan do till he tries, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The noise of the combat was terrific; each of the three combatants\r\nswearing like troopers, and their swords clashing with as much noise as\r\nif all the knives and steels in Newport market were rattling together,\r\nat the same time. When it was at its very height, the lady (to encourage\r\nmy uncle most probably) withdrew her hood entirely from her face, and\r\ndisclosed a countenance of such dazzling beauty, that he would have\r\nfought against fifty men, to win one smile from it and die. He had done\r\nwonders before, but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At this very moment, the gentleman in sky-blue turning round, and\r\nseeing the young lady with her face uncovered, vented an exclamation of\r\nrage and jealousy, and, turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom,\r\npointed a thrust at her heart, which caused my uncle to utter a cry of\r\napprehension that made the building ring. The lady stepped lightly\r\naside, and snatching the young man\xe2\x80\x99s sword from his hand, before he had\r\nrecovered his balance, drove him to the wall, and running it through\r\nhim, and the panelling, up to the very hilt, pinned him there, hard and\r\nfast. It was a splendid example. My uncle, with a loud shout of triumph,\r\nand a strength that was irresistible, made his adversary retreat in the\r\nsame direction, and plunging the old rapier into the very centre of a\r\nlarge red flower in the pattern of his waistcoat, nailed him beside his\r\nfriend; there they both stood, gentlemen, jerking their arms and legs\r\nabout in agony, like the toy-shop figures that are moved by a piece of\r\npack-thread. My uncle always said, afterwards, that this was one of the\r\nsurest means he knew of, for disposing of an enemy; but it was liable to\r\none objection on the ground of expense, inasmuch as it involved the loss\r\nof a sword for every man disabled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe mail, the mail!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady, running up to my uncle and\r\nthrowing her beautiful arms round his neck; \xe2\x80\x9cwe may yet escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMay!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my uncle; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, my dear, there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody else to kill, is\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d My uncle was rather disappointed, gentlemen, for he thought a\r\nlittle quiet bit of love-making would be agreeable after the\r\nslaughtering, if it were only to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not an instant to lose here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\n(pointing to the young gentleman in sky-blue) is the only son of the\r\npowerful Marquess of Filletoville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll never come to the title,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\nuncle, looking coolly at the young gentleman as he stood fixed up\r\nagainst the wall, in the cockchafer fashion that I have described. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave cut off the entail, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI have been torn from my home and my friends by these villains,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe young lady, her features glowing with indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wretch\r\nwould have married me by violence in another hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cConfound his impudence!\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, bestowing a very contemptuous\r\nlook on the dying heir of Filletoville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAs you may guess from what you have seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nparty were prepared to murder me if I appealed to any one for\r\nassistance. If their accomplices find us here, we are lost. Two minutes\r\nhence may be too late. The mail!\xe2\x80\x9d With these words, overpowered by her\r\nfeelings, and the exertion of sticking the young Marquess of\r\nFilletoville, she sank into my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s arms. My uncle caught her up, and\r\nbore her to the house door. There stood the mail, with four long-tailed,\r\nflowing-maned, black horses, ready harnessed; but no coachman, no guard,\r\nno hostler even, at the horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, I hope I do no injustice to my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s memory, when I\r\nexpress my opinion, that although he was a bachelor, he had held some\r\nladies in his arms before this time; I believe, indeed, that he had\r\nrather a habit of kissing barmaids; and I know, that in one or two\r\ninstances, he had been seen by credible witnesses, to hug a landlady in\r\na very perceptible manner. I mention the circumstance, to show what a\r\nvery uncommon sort of person this beautiful young lady must have been,\r\nto have affected my uncle in the way she did; he used to say, that as\r\nher long dark hair trailed over his arm, and her beautiful dark eyes\r\nfixed themselves upon his face when she recovered, he felt so strange\r\nand nervous that his legs trembled beneath him. But who can look in a\r\nsweet, soft pair of dark eyes, without feeling queer? I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\ngentlemen. I am afraid to look at some eyes I know, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never leave me,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle. And he meant it too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear preserver!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, kind, brave\r\npreserver!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, interrupting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your mouth looks so beautiful when you speak,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined my\r\nuncle, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I shall be rude enough to kiss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The young lady put up her hand as if to caution my uncle not to do so,\r\nand said--No, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything--she smiled. When you are looking\r\nat a pair of the most delicious lips in the world, and see them gently\r\nbreak into a roguish smile--if you are very near them, and nobody else\r\nby--you cannot better testify your admiration of their beautiful form\r\nand colour than by kissing them at once. My uncle did so, and I honour\r\nhim for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady, starting. \xe2\x80\x9cThe noise of wheels, and\r\nhorses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, listening. He had a good ear for wheels, and\r\nthe trampling of hoofs; but there appeared to be so many horses and\r\ncarriages rattling towards them, from a distance, that it was impossible\r\nto form a guess at their number. The sound was like that of fifty\r\nbrakes, with six blood cattle in each.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWe are pursued!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady, clasping her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\npursued. I have no hope but in you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was such an expression of terror in her beautiful face, that my\r\nuncle made up his mind at once. He lifted her into the coach, told her\r\nnot to be frightened, pressed his lips to hers once more, and then\r\nadvising her to draw up the window to keep the cold air out, mounted to\r\nthe box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cStay, love,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, from the coach-box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady; \xe2\x80\x9conly a word. Only one\r\nword, dearest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMust I get down?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired my uncle. The lady made no answer, but she\r\nsmiled again. Such a smile, gentlemen! It beat the other one, all to\r\nnothing. My uncle descended from his perch in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle, looking in at the coach window.\r\nThe lady happened to bend forward at the same time, and my uncle thought\r\nshe looked more beautiful than she had done yet. He was very close to\r\nher just then, gentlemen, so he really ought to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWill you never love any one but me--never marry any one beside?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle swore a great oath that he never would marry anybody else, and\r\nthe young lady drew in her head, and pulled up the window. He jumped\r\nupon the box, squared his elbows, adjusted the ribands, seized the whip\r\nwhich lay on the roof, gave one flick to the off leader, and away went\r\nthe four long-tailed, flowing-maned black horses, at fifteen good\r\nEnglish miles an hour, with the old mail-coach behind them. Whew! How\r\nthey tore along!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The noise behind grew louder. The faster the old mail went, the faster\r\ncame the pursuers--men, horses, dogs, were leagued in the pursuit. The\r\nnoise was frightful, but, above all, rose the voice of the young lady,\r\nurging my uncle on, and shrieking, \xe2\x80\x9cFaster! Faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They whirled past the dark trees, as feathers would be swept before a\r\nhurricane. Houses, gates, churches, haystacks, objects of every kind\r\nthey shot by, with a velocity and noise like roaring waters suddenly let\r\nloose. But still the noise of pursuit grew louder, and still my uncle\r\ncould hear the young lady wildly screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cFaster! Faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle plied whip and rein, and the horses flew onward till they were\r\nwhite with foam; and yet the noise behind increased; and yet the young\r\nlady cried, \xe2\x80\x9cFaster! Faster!\xe2\x80\x9d My uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in\r\nthe energy of the moment, and--found that it was gray morning, and he\r\nwas sitting in the wheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s yard, on the box of an old Edinburgh\r\nmail, shivering with the cold and wet and stamping his feet to warm\r\nthem! He got down, and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young\r\nlady. Alas! There was neither door nor seat to the coach. It was a mere\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, my uncle knew very well that there was some mystery in the\r\nmatter, and that everything had passed exactly as he used to relate it.\r\nHe remained staunch to the great oath he had sworn to the beautiful\r\nyoung lady, refusing several eligible landladies on her account, and\r\ndying a bachelor at last. He always said what a curious thing it was\r\nthat he should have found out, by such a mere accident as his clambering\r\nover the palings, that the ghosts of mail-coaches and horses, guards,\r\ncoachmen, and passengers, were in the habit of making journeys regularly\r\nevery night. He used to add, that he believed he was the only living\r\nperson who had ever been taken as a passenger on one of these\r\nexcursions. And I think he was right, gentlemen--at least I never heard\r\nof any other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder what these ghosts of mail-coaches carry in their bags,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe landlord, who had listened to the whole story with profound\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The dead letters, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bagman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, ah! To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the landlord. \xe2\x80\x98I never thought of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L. HOW MR. PICKWICK SPED UPON HIS MISSION, AND HOW HE WAS\r\nREINFORCED IN THE OUTSET BY A MOST UNEXPECTED AUXILIARY\r\n\r\nThe horses were put to, punctually at a quarter before nine next\r\nmorning, and Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller having each taken his seat, the\r\none inside and the other out, the postillion was duly directed to repair\r\nin the first instance to Mr. Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s house, for the purpose of\r\ntaking up Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\nIt was with feelings of no small astonishment, when the carriage drew up\r\nbefore the door with the red lamp, and the very legible inscription of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sawyer, late Nockemorf,\xe2\x80\x99 that Mr. Pickwick saw, on popping his head out\r\nof the coach window, the boy in the gray livery very busily employed in\r\nputting up the shutters--the which, being an unusual and an\r\nunbusinesslike proceeding at that hour of the morning, at once suggested\r\nto his mind two inferences: the one, that some good friend and patient\r\nof Mr. Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s was dead; the other, that Mr. Bob Sawyer himself was\r\nbankrupt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy, expanding his mouth to the\r\nwhole breadth of his countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, all right!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bob Sawyer, suddenly appearing at the\r\ndoor, with a small leathern knapsack, limp and dirty, in one hand, and a\r\nrough coat and shawl thrown over the other arm. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going, old fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer, \xe2\x80\x98and a regular expedition we\xe2\x80\x99ll make of it.\r\nHere, Sam! Look out!\xe2\x80\x99 Thus briefly bespeaking Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s attention,\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer jerked the leathern knapsack into the dickey, where it\r\nwas immediately stowed away, under the seat, by Sam, who regarded the\r\nproceeding with great admiration. This done, Mr. Bob Sawyer, with the\r\nassistance of the boy, forcibly worked himself into the rough coat,\r\nwhich was a few sizes too small for him, and then advancing to the coach\r\nwindow, thrust in his head, and laughed boisterously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a start it is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bob, wiping the tears out of his\r\neyes, with one of the cuffs of the rough coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with some embarrassment, \xe2\x80\x98I had no\r\nidea of your accompanying us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the very thing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob, seizing Mr. Pickwick by\r\nthe lappel of his coat. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the joke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the joke, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the whole point of the thing, you know--\r\nthat, and leaving the business to take care of itself, as it seems to\r\nhave made up its mind not to take care of me.\xe2\x80\x99 With this explanation of\r\nthe phenomenon of the shutters, Mr. Bob Sawyer pointed to the shop, and\r\nrelapsed into an ecstasy of mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless me, you are surely not mad enough to think of leaving your\r\npatients without anybody to attend them!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Pickwick in a\r\nvery serious tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bob, in reply. \xe2\x80\x98I shall save by it, you know. None of\r\nthem ever pay. Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, lowering his voice to a confidential\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x98they will be all the better for it; for, being nearly out of\r\ndrugs, and not able to increase my account just now, I should have been\r\nobliged to give them calomel all round, and it would have been certain\r\nto have disagreed with some of them. So it\xe2\x80\x99s all for the best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a philosophy and a strength of reasoning about this reply,\r\nwhich Mr. Pickwick was not prepared for. He paused a few moments, and\r\nadded, less firmly than before--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this chaise, my young friend, will only hold two; and I am pledged\r\nto Mr. Allen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of me for a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged it all;\r\nSam and I will share the dickey between us. Look here. This little bill\r\nis to be wafered on the shop door: \xe2\x80\x9cSawyer, late Nockemorf. Inquire of\r\nMrs. Cripps over the way.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Cripps is my boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Cripps, \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it--fetched away early\r\nthis morning to a consultation of the very first surgeons in the\r\ncountry--couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without him--would have him at any price--\r\ntremendous operation.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nme more good than otherwise, I expect. If it gets into one of the local\r\npapers, it will be the making of me. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Ben; now then, jump in!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these hurried words, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed the postboy on one side,\r\njerked his friend into the vehicle, slammed the door, put up the steps,\r\nwafered the bill on the street door, locked it, put the key in his\r\npocket, jumped into the dickey, gave the word for starting, and did the\r\nwhole with such extraordinary precipitation, that before Mr. Pickwick\r\nhad well begun to consider whether Mr. Bob Sawyer ought to go or not,\r\nthey were rolling away, with Mr. Bob Sawyer thoroughly established as\r\npart and parcel of the equipage.\r\n\r\nSo long as their progress was confined to the streets of Bristol, the\r\nfacetious Bob kept his professional green spectacles on, and conducted\r\nhimself with becoming steadiness and gravity of demeanour; merely giving\r\nutterance to divers verbal witticisms for the exclusive behoof and\r\nentertainment of Mr. Samuel Weller. But when they emerged on the open\r\nroad, he threw off his green spectacles and his gravity together, and\r\nperformed a great variety of practical jokes, which were calculated to\r\nattract the attention of the passersby, and to render the carriage and\r\nthose it contained objects of more than ordinary curiosity; the least\r\nconspicuous among these feats being a most vociferous imitation of a\r\nkey-bugle, and the ostentatious display of a crimson silk pocket-\r\nhandkerchief attached to a walking-stick, which was occasionally waved\r\nin the air with various gestures indicative of supremacy and defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, stopping in the midst of a most sedate\r\nconversation with Ben Allen, bearing reference to the numerous good\r\nqualities of Mr. Winkle and his sister--\xe2\x80\x98I wonder what all the people we\r\npass, can see in us to make them stare so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a neat turn-out,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Ben Allen, with something of pride in\r\nhis tone. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re not used to see this sort of thing, every day, I dare\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98It may be so. Perhaps it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick might very probably have reasoned himself into the belief\r\nthat it really was, had he not, just then happening to look out of the\r\ncoach window, observed that the looks of the passengers betokened\r\nanything but respectful astonishment, and that various telegraphic\r\ncommunications appeared to be passing between them and some persons\r\noutside the vehicle, whereupon it occurred to him that these\r\ndemonstrations might be, in some remote degree, referable to the\r\nhumorous deportment of Mr. Robert Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98that our volatile friend is committing no\r\nabsurdities in that dickey behind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Ben Allen. \xe2\x80\x98Except when he\xe2\x80\x99s elevated, Bob\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nquietest creature breathing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere a prolonged imitation of a key-bugle broke upon the ear, succeeded\r\nby cheers and screams, all of which evidently proceeded from the throat\r\nand lungs of the quietest creature breathing, or in plainer designation,\r\nof Mr. Bob Sawyer himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick and Mr. Ben Allen looked expressively at each other, and\r\nthe former gentleman taking off his hat, and leaning out of the coach\r\nwindow until nearly the whole of his waistcoat was outside it, was at\r\nlength enabled to catch a glimpse of his facetious friend.\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer was seated, not in the dickey, but on the roof of the\r\nchaise, with his legs as far asunder as they would conveniently go,\r\nwearing Mr. Samuel Weller\xe2\x80\x99s hat on one side of his head, and bearing, in\r\none hand, a most enormous sandwich, while, in the other, he supported a\r\ngoodly-sized case-bottle, to both of which he applied himself with\r\nintense relish, varying the monotony of the occupation by an occasional\r\nhowl, or the interchange of some lively badinage with any passing\r\nstranger. The crimson flag was carefully tied in an erect position to\r\nthe rail of the dickey; and Mr. Samuel Weller, decorated with Bob\r\nSawyer\xe2\x80\x99s hat, was seated in the centre thereof, discussing a twin\r\nsandwich, with an animated countenance, the expression of which\r\nbetokened his entire and perfect approval of the whole arrangement.\r\n\r\nThis was enough to irritate a gentleman with Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s sense of\r\npropriety, but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation, for a\r\nstage-coach full, inside and out, was meeting them at the moment, and\r\nthe astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced. The\r\ncongratulations of an Irish family, too, who were keeping up with the\r\nchaise, and begging all the time, were of rather a boisterous\r\ndescription, especially those of its male head, who appeared to consider\r\nthe display as part and parcel of some political or other procession of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Sawyer!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick, in a state of great excitement, \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nSawyer, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 responded that gentleman, looking over the side of the chaise\r\nwith all the coolness in life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you mad, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob; \xe2\x80\x98only cheerful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cheerful, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Take down that scandalous red\r\nhandkerchief, I beg. I insist, Sir. Sam, take it down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Sam could interpose, Mr. Bob Sawyer gracefully struck his\r\ncolours, and having put them in his pocket, nodded in a courteous manner\r\nto Mr. Pickwick, wiped the mouth of the case-bottle, and applied it to\r\nhis own, thereby informing him, without any unnecessary waste of words,\r\nthat he devoted that draught to wishing him all manner of happiness and\r\nprosperity. Having done this, Bob replaced the cork with great care, and\r\nlooking benignantly down on Mr. Pickwick, took a large bite out of the\r\nsandwich, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, whose momentary anger was not quite proof\r\nagainst Bob\xe2\x80\x99s immovable self-possession, \xe2\x80\x98pray let us have no more of\r\nthis absurdity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob, once more exchanging hats with Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do it, only I got so enlivened with the ride that I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think of the look of the thing,\xe2\x80\x99 expostulated Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98have some\r\nregard to appearances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s not the sort of thing at all. All over,\r\ngovernor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this assurance, Mr. Pickwick once more drew his head into\r\nthe chaise and pulled up the glass; but he had scarcely resumed the\r\nconversation which Mr. Bob Sawyer had interrupted, when he was somewhat\r\nstartled by the apparition of a small dark body, of an oblong form, on\r\nthe outside of the window, which gave sundry taps against it, as if\r\nimpatient of admission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It looks like a case-bottle;\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Ben Allen, eyeing the object in\r\nquestion through his spectacles with some interest; \xe2\x80\x98I rather think it\r\nbelongs to Bob.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe impression was perfectly accurate; for Mr. Bob Sawyer, having\r\nattached the case-bottle to the end of the walking-stick, was battering\r\nthe window with it, in token of his wish, that his friends inside would\r\npartake of its contents, in all good-fellowship and harmony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking at the bottle. \xe2\x80\x98This\r\nproceeding is more absurd than the other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it would be best to take it in,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Ben Allen; \xe2\x80\x98it\r\nwould serve him right to take it in and keep it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98shall I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it the most proper course we could possibly adopt,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nBen.\r\n\r\nThis advice quite coinciding with his own opinion, Mr. Pickwick gently\r\nlet down the window and disengaged the bottle from the stick; upon which\r\nthe latter was drawn up, and Mr. Bob Sawyer was heard to laugh heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a merry dog it is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking round at his\r\ncompanion, with the bottle in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot possibly be angry with him,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite out of the question,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\nDuring this short interchange of sentiments, Mr. Pickwick had, in an\r\nabstracted mood, uncorked the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Ben Allen carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, with equal carelessness. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nsmells, I think, like milk-punch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I _think _so,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick, very properly guarding himself\r\nagainst the possibility of stating an untruth; \xe2\x80\x98mind, I could not\r\nundertake to say certainly, without tasting it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better do so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben; \xe2\x80\x98we may as well know what it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Well; if you are curious to\r\nknow, of course I have no objection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEver willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his friend,\r\nMr. Pickwick at once took a pretty long taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Ben Allen, interrupting him with some impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Curious,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, smacking his lips, \xe2\x80\x98I hardly know, now.\r\nOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, after a second taste. \xe2\x80\x98It _is_ punch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Ben Allen looked at Mr. Pickwick; Mr. Pickwick looked at Mr. Ben\r\nAllen; Mr. Ben Allen smiled; Mr. Pickwick did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would serve him right,\xe2\x80\x99 said the last-named gentleman, with some\r\nseverity--\xe2\x80\x98it would serve him right to drink it every drop.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The very thing that occurred to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ben Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Then here\xe2\x80\x99s his health!\xe2\x80\x99 With\r\nthese words, that excellent person took a most energetic pull at the\r\nbottle, and handed it to Ben Allen, who was not slow to imitate his\r\nexample. The smiles became mutual, and the milk-punch was gradually and\r\ncheerfully disposed of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as he drained the last drop, \xe2\x80\x98his pranks\r\nare really very amusing; very entertaining indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may say that,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Ben Allen. In proof of Bob Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing one of the funniest fellows alive, he proceeded to entertain Mr.\r\nPickwick with a long and circumstantial account how that gentleman once\r\ndrank himself into a fever and got his head shaved; the relation of\r\nwhich pleasant and agreeable history was only stopped by the stoppage of\r\nthe chaise at the Bell at Berkeley Heath, to change horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say! We\xe2\x80\x99re going to dine here, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, looking in at\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dine!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Why, we have only come nineteen miles, and\r\nhave eighty-seven and a half to go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just the reason why we should take something to enable us to bear up\r\nagainst the fatigue,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite impossible to dine at half-past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bob, \xe2\x80\x98lunch is the very thing. Hollo, you sir!\r\nLunch for three, directly; and keep the horses back for a quarter of an\r\nhour. Tell them to put everything they have cold, on the table, and some\r\nbottled ale, and let us taste your very best Madeira.\xe2\x80\x99 Issuing these\r\norders with monstrous importance and bustle, Mr. Bob Sawyer at once\r\nhurried into the house to superintend the arrangements; in less than\r\nfive minutes he returned and declared them to be excellent.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the lunch fully justified the eulogium which Bob had\r\npronounced, and very great justice was done to it, not only by that\r\ngentleman, but Mr. Ben Allen and Mr. Pickwick also. Under the auspices\r\nof the three, the bottled ale and the Madeira were promptly disposed of;\r\nand when (the horses being once more put to) they resumed their seats,\r\nwith the case-bottle full of the best substitute for milk-punch that\r\ncould be procured on so short a notice, the key-bugle sounded, and the\r\nred flag waved, without the slightest opposition on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\n\r\nAt the Hop Pole at Tewkesbury, they stopped to dine; upon which occasion\r\nthere was more bottled ale, with some more Madeira, and some port\r\nbesides; and here the case-bottle was replenished for the fourth time.\r\nUnder the influence of these combined stimulants, Mr. Pickwick and Mr.\r\nBen Allen fell fast asleep for thirty miles, while Bob and Mr. Weller\r\nsang duets in the dickey.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Mr. Pickwick roused himself sufficiently to look\r\nout of the window. The straggling cottages by the road-side, the dingy\r\nhue of every object visible, the murky atmosphere, the paths of cinders\r\nand brick-dust, the deep-red glow of furnace fires in the distance, the\r\nvolumes of dense smoke issuing heavily forth from high toppling\r\nchimneys, blackening and obscuring everything around; the glare of\r\ndistant lights, the ponderous wagons which toiled along the road, laden\r\nwith clashing rods of iron, or piled with heavy goods--all betokened\r\ntheir rapid approach to the great working town of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nAs they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart of\r\nthe turmoil, the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more\r\nforcibly on the senses. The streets were thronged with working people.\r\nThe hum of labour resounded from every house; lights gleamed from the\r\nlong casement windows in the attic storeys, and the whirl of wheels and\r\nnoise of machinery shook the trembling walls. The fires, whose lurid,\r\nsullen light had been visible for miles, blazed fiercely up, in the\r\ngreat works and factories of the town. The din of hammers, the rushing\r\nof steam, and the dead heavy clanking of engines, was the harsh music\r\nwhich arose from every quarter.\r\n\r\nThe postboy was driving briskly through the open streets, and past the\r\nhandsome and well-lighted shops that intervene between the outskirts of\r\nthe town and the Old Royal Hotel, before Mr. Pickwick had begun to\r\nconsider the very difficult and delicate nature of the commission which\r\nhad carried him thither.\r\n\r\nThe delicate nature of this commission, and the difficulty of executing\r\nit in a satisfactory manner, were by no means lessened by the voluntary\r\ncompanionship of Mr. Bob Sawyer. Truth to tell, Mr. Pickwick felt that\r\nhis presence on the occasion, however considerate and gratifying, was by\r\nno means an honour he would willingly have sought; in fact, he would\r\ncheerfully have given a reasonable sum of money to have had Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer removed to any place at not less than fifty miles\xe2\x80\x99 distance,\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had never held any personal communication with Mr. Winkle,\r\nsenior, although he had once or twice corresponded with him by letter,\r\nand returned satisfactory answers to his inquiries concerning the moral\r\ncharacter and behaviour of his son; he felt nervously sensible that to\r\nwait upon him, for the first time, attended by Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen,\r\nboth slightly fuddled, was not the most ingenious and likely means that\r\ncould have been hit upon to prepossess him in his favour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, endeavouring to reassure himself, \xe2\x80\x98I must\r\ndo the best I can. I must see him to-night, for I faithfully promised to\r\ndo so. If they persist in accompanying me, I must make the interview as\r\nbrief as possible, and be content that, for their own sakes, they will\r\nnot expose themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he comforted himself with these reflections, the chaise stopped at\r\nthe door of the Old Royal. Ben Allen having been partially awakened from\r\na stupendous sleep, and dragged out by the collar by Mr. Samuel Weller,\r\nMr. Pickwick was enabled to alight. They were shown to a comfortable\r\napartment, and Mr. Pickwick at once propounded a question to the waiter\r\nconcerning the whereabout of Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Close by, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the waiter, \xe2\x80\x98not above five hundred yards, Sir.\r\nMr. Winkle is a wharfinger, Sir, at the canal, sir. Private residence is\r\nnot--oh dear, no, sir, not five hundred yards, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the waiter\r\nblew a candle out, and made a feint of lighting it again, in order to\r\nafford Mr. Pickwick an opportunity of asking any further questions, if\r\nhe felt so disposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take anything now, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the waiter, lighting the candle in\r\ndesperation at Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s silence. \xe2\x80\x98Tea or coffee, Sir? Dinner,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, sir. Like to order supper, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not just now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Here, he walked slowly to the door, and then stopping\r\nshort, turned round and said, with great suavity--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I send the chambermaid, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If _you _please, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And bring some soda-water,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Soda-water, Sir! Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 With his mind apparently relieved from an\r\noverwhelming weight, by having at last got an order for something, the\r\nwaiter imperceptibly melted away. Waiters never walk or run. They have a\r\npeculiar and mysterious power of skimming out of rooms, which other\r\nmortals possess not.\r\n\r\nSome slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in Mr. Ben Allen\r\nby the soda-water, he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to wash his\r\nface and hands, and to submit to be brushed by Sam. Mr. Pickwick and Bob\r\nSawyer having also repaired the disorder which the journey had made in\r\ntheir apparel, the three started forth, arm in arm, to Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s; Bob\r\nSawyer impregnating the atmosphere with tobacco smoke as he walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of a mile off, in a quiet, substantial-looking street,\r\nstood an old red brick house with three steps before the door, and a\r\nbrass plate upon it, bearing, in fat Roman capitals, the words, \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nWinkle.\xe2\x80\x99 The steps were very white, and the bricks were very red, and\r\nthe house was very clean; and here stood Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Benjamin\r\nAllen, and Mr. Bob Sawyer, as the clock struck ten.\r\n\r\nA smart servant-girl answered the knock, and started on beholding the\r\nthree strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mr. Winkle at home, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is just going to supper, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give him that card if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Say I am\r\nsorry to trouble him at so late an hour; but I am anxious to see him to-\r\nnight, and have only just arrived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl looked timidly at Mr. Bob Sawyer, who was expressing his\r\nadmiration of her personal charms by a variety of wonderful grimaces;\r\nand casting an eye at the hats and greatcoats which hung in the passage,\r\ncalled another girl to mind the door while she went upstairs. The\r\nsentinel was speedily relieved; for the girl returned immediately, and\r\nbegging pardon of the gentlemen for leaving them in the street, ushered\r\nthem into a floor-clothed back parlour, half office and half dressing\r\nroom, in which the principal useful and ornamental articles of furniture\r\nwere a desk, a wash-hand stand and shaving-glass, a boot-rack and boot-\r\njack, a high stool, four chairs, a table, and an old eight-day clock.\r\nOver the mantelpiece were the sunken doors of an iron safe, while a\r\ncouple of hanging shelves for books, an almanac, and several files of\r\ndusty papers, decorated the walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very sorry to leave you standing at the door, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl,\r\nlighting a lamp, and addressing Mr. Pickwick with a winning smile, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nyou was quite strangers to me; and we have such a many trampers that\r\nonly come to see what they can lay their hands on, that really--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is not the least occasion for any apology, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the slightest, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, playfully stretching\r\nforth his arms, and skipping from side to side, as if to prevent the\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the room.\r\n\r\nThe young lady was not at all softened by these allurements, for she at\r\nonce expressed her opinion, that Mr. Bob Sawyer was an \xe2\x80\x98odous creetur;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand, on his becoming rather more pressing in his attentions, imprinted\r\nher fair fingers upon his face, and bounced out of the room with many\r\nexpressions of aversion and contempt.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s society, Mr. Bob Sawyer proceeded to divert\r\nhimself by peeping into the desk, looking into all the table drawers,\r\nfeigning to pick the lock of the iron safe, turning the almanac with its\r\nface to the wall, trying on the boots of Mr. Winkle, senior, over his\r\nown, and making several other humorous experiments upon the furniture,\r\nall of which afforded Mr. Pickwick unspeakable horror and agony, and\r\nyielded Mr. Bob Sawyer proportionate delight.\r\n\r\nAt length the door opened, and a little old gentleman in a snuff-\r\ncoloured suit, with a head and face the precise counterpart of those\r\nbelonging to Mr. Winkle, junior, excepting that he was rather bald,\r\ntrotted into the room with Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s card in one hand, and a silver\r\ncandlestick in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, sir, how do you do?\xe2\x80\x99 said Winkle the elder, putting down\r\nthe candlestick and proffering his hand. \xe2\x80\x98Hope I see you well, sir. Glad\r\nto see you. Be seated, Mr. Pickwick, I beg, Sir. This gentleman is--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend, Mr. Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98your son\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle the elder, looking rather grimly at Bob. \xe2\x80\x98I hope\r\nyou are well, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right as a trivet, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This other gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98is, as you will see when\r\nyou have read the letter with which I am intrusted, a very near\r\nrelative, or I should rather say a very particular friend of your son\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHis name is Allen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_That _gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle, pointing with the card towards\r\nBen Allen, who had fallen asleep in an attitude which left nothing of\r\nhim visible but his spine and his coat collar.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was on the point of replying to the question, and reciting\r\nMr. Benjamin Allen\xe2\x80\x99s name and honourable distinctions at full length,\r\nwhen the sprightly Mr. Bob Sawyer, with a view of rousing his friend to\r\na sense of his situation, inflicted a startling pinch upon the fleshly\r\npart of his arm, which caused him to jump up with a shriek. Suddenly\r\naware that he was in the presence of a stranger, Mr. Ben Allen advanced\r\nand, shaking Mr. Winkle most affectionately by both hands for about five\r\nminutes, murmured, in some half-intelligible fragments of sentences, the\r\ngreat delight he felt in seeing him, and a hospitable inquiry whether he\r\nfelt disposed to take anything after his walk, or would prefer waiting\r\n\xe2\x80\x98till dinner-time;\xe2\x80\x99 which done, he sat down and gazed about him with a\r\npetrified stare, as if he had not the remotest idea where he was, which\r\nindeed he had not.\r\n\r\nAll this was most embarrassing to Mr. Pickwick, the more especially as\r\nMr. Winkle, senior, evinced palpable astonishment at the eccentric--not\r\nto say extraordinary--behaviour of his two companions. To bring the\r\nmatter to an issue at once, he drew a letter from his pocket, and\r\npresenting it to Mr. Winkle, senior, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This letter, Sir, is from your son. You will see, by its contents, that\r\non your favourable and fatherly consideration of it, depend his future\r\nhappiness and welfare. Will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and\r\ncoolest perusal, and by discussing the subject afterwards with me, in\r\nthe tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed? You may\r\njudge of the importance of your decision to your son, and his intense\r\nanxiety upon the subject, by my waiting upon you, without any previous\r\nwarning, at so late an hour; and,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick, glancing slightly\r\nat his two companions--\xe2\x80\x98and under such unfavourable circumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this prelude, Mr. Pickwick placed four closely-written sides of\r\nextra superfine wire-wove penitence in the hands of the astounded Mr.\r\nWinkle, senior. Then reseating himself in his chair, he watched his\r\nlooks and manner: anxiously, it is true, but with the open front of a\r\ngentleman who feels he has taken no part which he need excuse or\r\npalliate.\r\n\r\nThe old wharfinger turned the letter over, looked at the front, back,\r\nand sides, made a microscopic examination of the fat little boy on the\r\nseal, raised his eyes to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s face, and then, seating himself\r\non the high stool, and drawing the lamp closer to him, broke the wax,\r\nunfolded the epistle, and lifting it to the light, prepared to read.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, Mr. Bob Sawyer, whose wit had lain dormant for some\r\nminutes, placed his hands on his knees, and made a face after the\r\nportraits of the late Mr. Grimaldi, as clown. It so happened that Mr.\r\nWinkle, senior, instead of being deeply engaged in reading the letter,\r\nas Mr. Bob Sawyer thought, chanced to be looking over the top of it at\r\nno less a person than Mr. Bob Sawyer himself; rightly conjecturing that\r\nthe face aforesaid was made in ridicule and derision of his own person,\r\nhe fixed his eyes on Bob with such expressive sternness, that the late\r\nMr. Grimaldi\xe2\x80\x99s lineaments gradually resolved themselves into a very fine\r\nexpression of humility and confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you speak, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Winkle, senior, after an awful\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob, With no remains of the clown about him, save and\r\nexcept the extreme redness of his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure you did not, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, senior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear, yes, sir, quite,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you did, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman, with indignant\r\nemphasis. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you _looked _at me, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no! sir, not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob, with extreme civility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad to hear it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, senior. Having\r\nfrowned upon the abashed Bob with great magnificence, the old gentleman\r\nagain brought the letter to the light, and began to read it seriously.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the\r\nfirst page to the top line of the second, and from the bottom of the\r\nsecond to the top of the third, and from the bottom of the third to the\r\ntop of the fourth; but not the slightest alteration of countenance\r\nafforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement\r\nof his son\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, which Mr. Pickwick knew was in the very first\r\nhalf-dozen lines.\r\n\r\nHe read the letter to the last word, folded it again with all the\r\ncarefulness and precision of a man of business, and, just when Mr.\r\nPickwick expected some great outbreak of feeling, dipped a pen in the\r\nink-stand, and said, as quietly as if he were speaking on the most\r\nordinary counting-house topic--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is Nathaniel\xe2\x80\x99s address, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The George and Vulture, at present,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George and Vulture. Where is that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George Yard, Lombard Street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the city?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman methodically indorsed the address on the back of the\r\nletter; and then, placing it in the desk, which he locked, said, as he\r\ngot off the stool and put the bunch of keys in his pocket--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose there is nothing else which need detain us, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing else, my dear Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 observed that warm-hearted person in\r\nindignant amazement. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing else! Have you no opinion to express on\r\nthis momentous event in our young friend\xe2\x80\x99s life? No assurance to convey\r\nto him, through me, of the continuance of your affection and protection?\r\nNothing to say which will cheer and sustain him, and the anxious girl\r\nwho looks to him for comfort and support? My dear Sir, consider.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will consider,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I have nothing to say\r\njust now. I am a man of business, Mr. Pickwick. I never commit myself\r\nhastily in any affair, and from what I see of this, I by no means like\r\nthe appearance of it. A thousand pounds is not much, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re very right, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Ben Allen, just awake enough to\r\nknow that he had spent his thousand pounds without the smallest\r\ndifficulty. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re an intelligent man. Bob, he\xe2\x80\x99s a very knowing fellow\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very happy to find that you do me the justice to make the\r\nadmission, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle, senior, looking contemptuously at Ben\r\nAllen, who was shaking his head profoundly. \xe2\x80\x98The fact is, Mr. Pickwick,\r\nthat when I gave my son a roving license for a year or so, to see\r\nsomething of men and manners (which he has done under your auspices), so\r\nthat he might not enter life a mere boarding-school milk-sop to be\r\ngulled by everybody, I never bargained for this. He knows that very\r\nwell, so if I withdraw my countenance from him on this account, he has\r\nno call to be surprised. He shall hear from me, Mr. Pickwick. Good-\r\nnight, sir.--Margaret, open the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll this time, Bob Sawyer had been nudging Mr. Ben Allen to say\r\nsomething on the right side; Ben accordingly now burst, without the\r\nslightest preliminary notice, into a brief but impassioned piece of\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen, staring at the old gentleman, out of a pair\r\nof very dim and languid eyes, and working his right arm vehemently up\r\nand down, \xe2\x80\x98you--you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the lady\xe2\x80\x99s brother, of course you are an excellent judge of the\r\nquestion,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr. Winkle, senior. \xe2\x80\x98There; that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Pray say\r\nno more, Mr. Pickwick. Good-night, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words the old gentleman took up the candle-stick and opening\r\nthe room door, politely motioned towards the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will regret this, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, setting his teeth close\r\ntogether to keep down his choler; for he felt how important the effect\r\nmight prove to his young friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am at present of a different opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 calmly replied Mr. Winkle,\r\nsenior. \xe2\x80\x98Once again, gentlemen, I wish you a good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick walked with angry strides into the street. Mr. Bob Sawyer,\r\ncompletely quelled by the decision of the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s manner, took\r\nthe same course. Mr. Ben Allen\xe2\x80\x99s hat rolled down the steps immediately\r\nafterwards, and Mr. Ben Allen\xe2\x80\x99s body followed it directly. The whole\r\nparty went silent and supperless to bed; and Mr. Pickwick thought, just\r\nbefore he fell asleep, that if he had known Mr. Winkle, senior, had been\r\nquite so much of a man of business, it was extremely probable he might\r\nnever have waited upon him, on such an errand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI. IN WHICH MR. PICKWICK ENCOUNTERS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE--TO\r\nWHICH FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THE READER IS MAINLY INDEBTED FOR MATTER OF\r\nTHRILLING INTEREST HEREIN SET DOWN, CONCERNING TWO GREAT PUBLIC MEN OF\r\nMIGHT AND POWER\r\n\r\nThe morning which broke upon Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s sight at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, was\r\nnot at all calculated to elevate his spirits, or to lessen the\r\ndepression which the unlooked-for result of his embassy inspired. The\r\nsky was dark and gloomy, the air was damp and raw, the streets were wet\r\nand sloppy. The smoke hung sluggishly above the chimney-tops as if it\r\nlacked the courage to rise, and the rain came slowly and doggedly down,\r\nas if it had not even the spirit to pour. A game-cock in the stableyard,\r\ndeprived of every spark of his accustomed animation, balanced himself\r\ndismally on one leg in a corner; a donkey, moping with drooping head\r\nunder the narrow roof of an outhouse, appeared from his meditative and\r\nmiserable countenance to be contemplating suicide. In the street,\r\numbrellas were the only things to be seen, and the clicking of pattens\r\nand splashing of rain-drops were the only sounds to be heard.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation; even Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer felt the influence of the weather, and the previous day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexcitement. In his own expressive language he was \xe2\x80\x98floored.\xe2\x80\x99 So was Mr.\r\nBen Allen. So was Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nIn protracted expectation of the weather clearing up, the last evening\r\npaper from London was read and re-read with an intensity of interest\r\nonly known in cases of extreme destitution; every inch of the carpet was\r\nwalked over with similar perseverance; the windows were looked out of,\r\noften enough to justify the imposition of an additional duty upon them;\r\nall kinds of topics of conversation were started, and failed; and at\r\nlength Mr. Pickwick, when noon had arrived, without a change for the\r\nbetter, rang the bell resolutely, and ordered out the chaise.\r\n\r\nAlthough the roads were miry, and the drizzling rain came down harder\r\nthan it had done yet, and although the mud and wet splashed in at the\r\nopen windows of the carriage to such an extent that the discomfort was\r\nalmost as great to the pair of insides as to the pair of outsides, still\r\nthere was something in the motion, and the sense of being up and doing,\r\nwhich was so infinitely superior to being pent in a dull room, looking\r\nat the dull rain dripping into a dull street, that they all agreed, on\r\nstarting, that the change was a great improvement, and wondered how they\r\ncould possibly have delayed making it as long as they had done.\r\n\r\nWhen they stopped to change at Coventry, the steam ascended from the\r\nhorses in such clouds as wholly to obscure the hostler, whose voice was\r\nhowever heard to declare from the mist, that he expected the first gold\r\nmedal from the Humane Society on their next distribution of rewards, for\r\ntaking the postboy\xe2\x80\x99s hat off; the water descending from the brim of\r\nwhich, the invisible gentleman declared, must have drowned him (the\r\npostboy), but for his great presence of mind in tearing it promptly from\r\nhis head, and drying the gasping man\xe2\x80\x99s countenance with a wisp of straw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is pleasant,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, turning up his coat collar, and\r\npulling the shawl over his mouth to concentrate the fumes of a glass of\r\nbrandy just swallowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam composedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind it,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly see no good my mindin\xe2\x80\x99 on it \xe2\x80\x98ud do, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nSam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s an unanswerable reason, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Wotever is, is right, as the young\r\nnobleman sweetly remarked wen they put him down in the pension list \xe2\x80\x98cos\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s uncle\xe2\x80\x99s vife\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather vunce lit the king\xe2\x80\x99s pipe vith a\r\nportable tinder-box.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot a bad notion that, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Bob Sawyer approvingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just wot the young nobleman said ev\xe2\x80\x99ry quarter-day arterwards for the\r\nrest of his life,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wos you ever called in,\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, glancing at the driver, after a\r\nshort silence, and lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper--\xe2\x80\x98wos you\r\never called in, when you wos \xe2\x80\x98prentice to a sawbones, to wisit a\r\npostboy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that I ever was,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You never see a postboy in that \xe2\x80\x98ere hospital as you _walked _(as they\r\nsays o\xe2\x80\x99 the ghosts), did you?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never know\xe2\x80\x99d a churchyard were there wos a postboy\xe2\x80\x99s tombstone, or see\r\na dead postboy, did you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, pursuing his catechism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bob, \xe2\x80\x98I never did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x98Nor never vill; and there\xe2\x80\x99s another\r\nthing that no man never see, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a dead donkey. No man never see\r\na dead donkey \xe2\x80\x98cept the gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n in the black silk smalls as know\xe2\x80\x99d the\r\nyoung \xe2\x80\x98ooman as kep\xe2\x80\x99 a goat; and that wos a French donkey, so wery\r\nlikely he warn\xe2\x80\x99t wun o\xe2\x80\x99 the reg\xe2\x80\x99lar breed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what has that got to do with the postboys?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This here,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Without goin\xe2\x80\x99 so far as to as-sert, as some\r\nwery sensible people do, that postboys and donkeys is both immortal, wot\r\nI say is this: that wenever they feels theirselves gettin\xe2\x80\x99 stiff and\r\npast their work, they just rides off together, wun postboy to a pair in\r\nthe usual way; wot becomes on \xe2\x80\x98em nobody knows, but it\xe2\x80\x99s wery probable\r\nas they starts avay to take their pleasure in some other vorld, for\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a man alive as ever see either a donkey or a postboy a-\r\ntakin\xe2\x80\x99 his pleasure in this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nExpatiating upon this learned and remarkable theory, and citing many\r\ncurious statistical and other facts in its support, Sam Weller beguiled\r\nthe time until they reached Dunchurch, where a dry postboy and fresh\r\nhorses were procured; the next stage was Daventry, and the next\r\nTowcester; and at the end of each stage it rained harder than it had\r\ndone at the beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Bob Sawyer, looking in at the coach window, as\r\nthey pulled up before the door of the Saracen\xe2\x80\x99s Head, Towcester, \xe2\x80\x98this\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, just awakening from a nap, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re wet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you are, are you?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bob. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am, a little that way,\r\nUncomfortably damp, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBob did look dampish, inasmuch as the rain was streaming from his neck,\r\nelbows, cuffs, skirts, and knees; and his whole apparel shone so with\r\nthe wet, that it might have been mistaken for a full suit of prepared\r\noilskin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I _am_ rather wet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, giving himself a shake and casting a\r\nlittle hydraulic shower around, like a Newfoundland dog just emerged\r\nfrom the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite impossible to go on to-night,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Ben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Out of the question, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Sam Weller, coming to assist in the\r\nconference; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a cruelty to animals, sir, to ask \xe2\x80\x98em to do it.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s beds here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, addressing his master, \xe2\x80\x98everything\r\nclean and comfortable. Wery good little dinner, sir, they can get ready\r\nin half an hour--pair of fowls, sir, and a weal cutlet; French beans,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98taturs, tart, and tidiness. You\xe2\x80\x99d better stop vere you are, sir, if I\r\nmight recommend. Take adwice, sir, as the doctor said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe host of the Saracen\xe2\x80\x99s Head opportunely appeared at this moment, to\r\nconfirm Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s statement relative to the accommodations of the\r\nestablishment, and to back his entreaties with a variety of dismal\r\nconjectures regarding the state of the roads, the doubt of fresh horses\r\nbeing to be had at the next stage, the dead certainty of its raining all\r\nnight, the equally mortal certainty of its clearing up in the morning,\r\nand other topics of inducement familiar to innkeepers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but I must send a letter to London by some\r\nconveyance, so that it may be delivered the very first thing in the\r\nmorning, or I must go forwards at all hazards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe landlord smiled his delight. Nothing could be easier than for the\r\ngentleman to inclose a letter in a sheet of brown paper, and send it on,\r\neither by the mail or the night coach from Birmingham. If the gentleman\r\nwere particularly anxious to have it left as soon as possible, he might\r\nwrite outside, \xe2\x80\x98To be delivered immediately,\xe2\x80\x99 which was sure to be\r\nattended to; or \xe2\x80\x98Pay the bearer half-a-crown extra for instant\r\ndelivery,\xe2\x80\x99 which was surer still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98then we will stop here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lights in the Sun, John; make up the fire; the gentlemen are wet!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried the landlord. \xe2\x80\x98This way, gentlemen; don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourselves about\r\nthe postboy now, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send him to you when you ring for him, sir.\r\nNow, John, the candles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe candles were brought, the fire was stirred up, and a fresh log of\r\nwood thrown on. In ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time, a waiter was laying the cloth for\r\ndinner, the curtains were drawn, the fire was blazing brightly, and\r\neverything looked (as everything always does, in all decent English\r\ninns) as if the travellers had been expected, and their comforts\r\nprepared, for days beforehand.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick sat down at a side table, and hastily indited a note to Mr.\r\nWinkle, merely informing him that he was detained by stress of weather,\r\nbut would certainly be in London next day; until when he deferred any\r\naccount of his proceedings. This note was hastily made into a parcel,\r\nand despatched to the bar per Mr. Samuel Weller.\r\n\r\nSam left it with the landlady, and was returning to pull his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboots off, after drying himself by the kitchen fire, when glancing\r\ncasually through a half-opened door, he was arrested by the sight of a\r\ngentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying\r\non the table before him, and was perusing the leading article of one\r\nwith a settled sneer which curled up his nose and all other features\r\ninto a majestic expression of haughty contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98I ought to know that \xe2\x80\x98ere head and them features;\r\nthe eyeglass, too, and the broad-brimmed tile! Eatansvill to vit, or I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na Roman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam was taken with a troublesome cough, at once, for the purpose of\r\nattracting the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s attention; the gentleman starting at the\r\nsound, raised his head and his eyeglass, and disclosed to view the\r\nprofound and thoughtful features of Mr. Pott, of the Eatanswill\r\n_Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beggin\xe2\x80\x99 your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, advancing with a bow, \xe2\x80\x98my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhere, Mr. Pott.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! hush!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Pott, drawing Sam into the room, and closing the\r\ndoor, with a countenance of mysterious dread and apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, looking vacantly about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a whisper of my name,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pott; \xe2\x80\x98this is a buff neighbourhood.\r\nIf the excited and irritable populace knew I was here, I should be torn\r\nto pieces.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! Vould you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be the victim of their fury,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pott. \xe2\x80\x98Now young man,\r\nwhat of your master?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a-stopping here to-night on his vay to town, with a couple of\r\nfriends,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mr. Winkle one of them?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Pott, with a slight frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sir. Mr. Vinkle stops at home now,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Married!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Pott, with frightful vehemence. He stopped, smiled\r\ndarkly, and added, in a low, vindictive tone, \xe2\x80\x98It serves him right!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving given vent to this cruel ebullition of deadly malice and cold-\r\nblooded triumph over a fallen enemy, Mr. Pott inquired whether Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s friends were \xe2\x80\x98blue?\xe2\x80\x99 Receiving a most satisfactory answer in\r\nthe affirmative from Sam, who knew as much about the matter as Pott\r\nhimself, he consented to accompany him to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s room, where a\r\nhearty welcome awaited him, and an agreement to club their dinners\r\ntogether was at once made and ratified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how are matters going on in Eatanswill?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick,\r\nwhen Pott had taken a seat near the fire, and the whole party had got\r\ntheir wet boots off, and dry slippers on. \xe2\x80\x98Is the _Independent_ still in\r\nbeing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The _Independent_, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pott, \xe2\x80\x98is still dragging on a wretched\r\nand lingering career. Abhorred and despised by even the few who are\r\ncognisant of its miserable and disgraceful existence, stifled by the\r\nvery filth it so profusely scatters, rendered deaf and blind by the\r\nexhalations of its own slime, the obscene journal, happily unconscious\r\nof its degraded state, is rapidly sinking beneath that treacherous mud\r\nwhich, while it seems to give it a firm standing with the low and\r\ndebased classes of society, is nevertheless rising above its detested\r\nhead, and will speedily engulf it for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving delivered this manifesto (which formed a portion of his last\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s leader) with vehement articulation, the editor paused to take\r\nbreath, and looked majestically at Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a young man, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott.\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So are you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, addressing Mr. Ben Allen.\r\n\r\nBen admitted the soft impeachment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And are both deeply imbued with those blue principles, which, so long\r\nas I live, I have pledged myself to the people of these kingdoms to\r\nsupport and to maintain?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know about that,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x98I am--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not buff, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Pott, drawing back his chair,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98your friend is not buff, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bob, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a kind of plaid at present; a compound of\r\nall sorts of colours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A waverer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott solemnly, \xe2\x80\x98a waverer. I should like to show you a\r\nseries of eight articles, Sir, that have appeared in the Eatanswill\r\n_Gazette_. I think I may venture to say that you would not be long in\r\nestablishing your opinions on a firm and solid blue basis, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI dare say I should turn very blue, long before I got to the end of\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Bob.\r\n\r\nMr. Pott looked dubiously at Bob Sawyer for some seconds, and, turning\r\nto Mr. Pickwick, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen the literary articles which have appeared at intervals in\r\nthe Eatanswill _Gazette_ in the course of the last three months, and\r\nwhich have excited such general--I may say such universal--attention and\r\nadmiration?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, slightly embarrassed by the question, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nfact is, I have been so much engaged in other ways, that I really have\r\nnot had an opportunity of perusing them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should do so, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, with a severe countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They appeared in the form of a copious review of a work on Chinese\r\nmetaphysics, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98from your pen, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From the pen of my critic, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Pott, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An abstruse subject, I should conceive,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Pott, looking intensely sage. \xe2\x80\x98He _crammed _for\r\nit, to use a technical but expressive term; he read up for the subject,\r\nat my desire, in the \xe2\x80\x9cEncyclopaedia Britannica.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98I was not aware that that valuable work\r\ncontained any information respecting Chinese metaphysics.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He read, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Pott, laying his hand on Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s knee,\r\nand looking round with a smile of intellectual superiority--\xe2\x80\x98he read for\r\nmetaphysics under the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and\r\ncombined his information, Sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s features assumed so much additional grandeur at the\r\nrecollection of the power and research displayed in the learned\r\neffusions in question, that some minutes elapsed before Mr. Pickwick\r\nfelt emboldened to renew the conversation; at length, as the editor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance gradually relaxed into its customary expression of moral\r\nsupremacy, he ventured to resume the discourse by asking--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it fair to inquire what great object has brought you so far from\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That object which actuates and animates me in all my gigantic labours,\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pott, with a calm smile: \xe2\x80\x98my country\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI supposed it was some public mission,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Pott, \xe2\x80\x98it is.\xe2\x80\x99 Here, bending towards Mr. Pickwick,\r\nhe whispered in a deep, hollow voice, \xe2\x80\x98A Buff ball, Sir, will take place\r\nin Birmingham to-morrow evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God bless me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir, and supper,\xe2\x80\x99 added Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nPott nodded portentously.\r\n\r\nNow, although Mr. Pickwick feigned to stand aghast at this disclosure,\r\nhe was so little versed in local politics that he was unable to form an\r\nadequate comprehension of the importance of the dire conspiracy it\r\nreferred to; observing which, Mr. Pott, drawing forth the last number of\r\nthe Eatanswill _Gazette_, and referring to the same, delivered himself\r\nof the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLE-AND-CORNER BUFFERY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A reptile contemporary has recently sweltered forth his black venom in\r\nthe vain and hopeless attempt of sullying the fair name of our\r\ndistinguished and excellent representative, the Honourable Mr. Slumkey--\r\nthat Slumkey whom we, long before he gained his present noble and\r\nexalted position, predicted would one day be, as he now is, at once his\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s brightest honour, and her proudest boast: alike her bold\r\ndefender and her honest pride--our reptile contemporary, we say, has\r\nmade himself merry, at the expense of a superbly embossed plated coal-\r\nscuttle, which has been presented to that glorious man by his enraptured\r\nconstituents, and towards the purchase of which, the nameless wretch\r\ninsinuates, the Honourable Mr. Slumkey himself contributed, through a\r\nconfidential friend of his butler\xe2\x80\x99s, more than three-fourths of the\r\nwhole sum subscribed. Why, does not the crawling creature see, that even\r\nif this be the fact, the Honourable Mr. Slumkey only appears in a still\r\nmore amiable and radiant light than before, if that be possible? Does\r\nnot even his obtuseness perceive that this amiable and touching desire\r\nto carry out the wishes of the constituent body, must for ever endear\r\nhim to the hearts and souls of such of his fellow townsmen as are not\r\nworse than swine; or, in other words, who are not as debased as our\r\ncontemporary himself? But such is the wretched trickery of hole-and-\r\ncorner Buffery! These are not its only artifices. Treason is abroad. We\r\nboldly state, now that we are goaded to the disclosure, and we throw\r\nourselves on the country and its constables for protection--we boldly\r\nstate that secret preparations are at this moment in progress for a Buff\r\nball; which is to be held in a Buff town, in the very heart and centre\r\nof a Buff population; which is to be conducted by a Buff master of the\r\nceremonies; which is to be attended by four ultra Buff members of\r\nParliament, and the admission to which, is to be by Buff tickets! Does\r\nour fiendish contemporary wince? Let him writhe, in impotent malice, as\r\nwe pen the words, _We will be there_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, folding up the paper quite exhausted, \xe2\x80\x98that is\r\nthe state of the case!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe landlord and waiter entering at the moment with dinner, caused Mr.\r\nPott to lay his finger on his lips, in token that he considered his life\r\nin Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and depended on his secrecy. Messrs. Bob Sawyer\r\nand Benjamin Allen, who had irreverently fallen asleep during the\r\nreading of the quotation from the Eatanswill _Gazette_, and the\r\ndiscussion which followed it, were roused by the mere whispering of the\r\ntalismanic word \xe2\x80\x98Dinner\xe2\x80\x99 in their ears; and to dinner they went with\r\ngood digestion waiting on appetite, and health on both, and a waiter on\r\nall three.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the dinner and the sitting which succeeded it, Mr. Pott\r\ndescending, for a few moments, to domestic topics, informed Mr. Pickwick\r\nthat the air of Eatanswill not agreeing with his lady, she was then\r\nengaged in making a tour of different fashionable watering-places with a\r\nview to the recovery of her wonted health and spirits; this was a\r\ndelicate veiling of the fact that Mrs. Pott, acting upon her often-\r\nrepeated threat of separation, had, in virtue of an arrangement\r\nnegotiated by her brother, the lieutenant, and concluded by Mr. Pott,\r\npermanently retired with the faithful bodyguard upon one moiety or half\r\npart of the annual income and profits arising from the editorship and\r\nsale of the Eatanswill _Gazette_.\r\n\r\nWhile the great Mr. Pott was dwelling upon this and other matters,\r\nenlivening the conversation from time to time with various extracts from\r\nhis own lucubrations, a stern stranger, calling from the window of a\r\nstage-coach, outward bound, which halted at the inn to deliver packages,\r\nrequested to know whether if he stopped short on his journey and\r\nremained there for the night, he could be furnished with the necessary\r\naccommodation of a bed and bedstead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can, can I?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the stranger, who seemed habitually suspicious\r\nin look and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No doubt of it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98Coachman, I get down here. Guard, my carpet-\r\nbag!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBidding the other passengers good-night, in a rather snappish manner,\r\nthe stranger alighted. He was a shortish gentleman, with very stiff\r\nblack hair cut in the porcupine or blacking-brush style, and standing\r\nstiff and straight all over his head; his aspect was pompous and\r\nthreatening; his manner was peremptory; his eyes were sharp and\r\nrestless; and his whole bearing bespoke a feeling of great confidence in\r\nhimself, and a consciousness of immeasurable superiority over all other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was shown into the room originally assigned to the\r\npatriotic Mr. Pott; and the waiter remarked, in dumb astonishment at the\r\nsingular coincidence, that he had no sooner lighted the candles than the\r\ngentleman, diving into his hat, drew forth a newspaper, and began to\r\nread it with the very same expression of indignant scorn, which, upon\r\nthe majestic features of Pott, had paralysed his energies an hour\r\nbefore. The man observed too, that, whereas Mr. Pott\xe2\x80\x99s scorn had been\r\nroused by a newspaper headed the Eatanswill _Independent_, this\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s withering contempt was awakened by a newspaper entitled the\r\nEatanswill _Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Send the landlord,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was sent, and came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you the landlord?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know me?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not had that pleasure, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Slurk,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe landlord slightly inclined his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Slurk, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the gentleman haughtily. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know me now,\r\nman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe landlord scratched his head, looked at the ceiling, and at the\r\nstranger, and smiled feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know me, man?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the stranger angrily.\r\n\r\nThe landlord made a strong effort, and at length replied, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir, I\r\ndo _not_ know you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, dashing his clenched fist upon the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x98And this is popularity!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe landlord took a step or two towards the door; the stranger fixing\r\nhis eyes upon him, resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger--\xe2\x80\x98this is gratitude for years of labour and\r\nstudy in behalf of the masses. I alight wet and weary; no enthusiastic\r\ncrowds press forward to greet their champion; the church bells are\r\nsilent; the very name elicits no responsive feeling in their torpid\r\nbosoms. It is enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said the agitated Mr. Slurk, pacing to and fro,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to curdle the ink in one\xe2\x80\x99s pen, and induce one to abandon their cause\r\nfor ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you say brandy-and-water, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the landlord, venturing a\r\nhint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rum,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Slurk, turning fiercely upon him. \xe2\x80\x98Have you got a fire\r\nanywhere?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We can light one directly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which will throw out no heat until it is bed-time,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mr.\r\nSlurk. \xe2\x80\x98Is there anybody in the kitchen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot a soul. There was a beautiful fire. Everybody had gone, and the\r\nhouse door was closed for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will drink my rum-and-water,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Slurk, \xe2\x80\x98by the kitchen fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo, gathering up his hat and newspaper, he stalked solemnly behind the\r\nlandlord to that humble apartment, and throwing himself on a settle by\r\nthe fireside, resumed his countenance of scorn, and began to read and\r\ndrink in silent dignity.\r\n\r\nNow, some demon of discord, flying over the Saracen\xe2\x80\x99s Head at that\r\nmoment, on casting down his eyes in mere idle curiosity, happened to\r\nbehold Slurk established comfortably by the kitchen fire, and Pott\r\nslightly elevated with wine in another room; upon which the malicious\r\ndemon, darting down into the last-mentioned apartment with inconceivable\r\nrapidity, passed at once into the head of Mr. Bob Sawyer, and prompted\r\nhim for his (the demon\xe2\x80\x99s) own evil purpose to speak as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve let the fire out. It\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly cold after the rain,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It really is,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, shivering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad notion to have a cigar by the kitchen fire, would\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer, still prompted by the demon aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be particularly comfortable, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pott, what do you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pott yielded a ready assent; and all four travellers, each with his\r\nglass in his hand, at once betook themselves to the kitchen, with Sam\r\nWeller heading the procession to show them the way.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was still reading; he looked up and started. Mr. Pott\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That reptile!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What reptile?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him for fear he should\r\ntread on some overgrown black beetle, or dropsical spider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That reptile,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Pott, catching Mr. Pickwick by the arm, and\r\npointing towards the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98That reptile Slurk, of the\r\n_Independent_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we had better retire,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Pott, pot-valiant in a double sense--\xe2\x80\x98never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWith these words, Mr. Pott took up his position on an opposite settle,\r\nand selecting one from a little bundle of newspapers, began to read\r\nagainst his enemy.\r\n\r\nMr. Pott, of course read the _Independent_, and Mr. Slurk, of course,\r\nread the _Gazette_; and each gentleman audibly expressed his contempt at\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x99s compositions by bitter laughs and sarcastic sniffs; whence\r\nthey proceeded to more open expressions of opinion, such as \xe2\x80\x98absurd,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98wretched,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98atrocity,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98humbug,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98knavery\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98dirt,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98filth,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98slime,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ditch-water,\xe2\x80\x99 and other critical remarks of the like nature.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Ben Allen had beheld these symptoms of\r\nrivalry and hatred, with a degree of delight which imparted great\r\nadditional relish to the cigars at which they were puffing most\r\nvigorously. The moment they began to flag, the mischievous Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer, addressing Slurk with great politeness, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me to look at your paper, Sir, when you have quite done\r\nwith it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will find very little to repay you for your trouble in this\r\ncontemptible _thing_, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Slurk, bestowing a Satanic frown on\r\nPott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall have this presently,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, looking up, pale with rage,\r\nand quivering in his speech, from the same cause. \xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha! you will be\r\namused with this _fellow\xe2\x80\x99s_ audacity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTerrible emphasis was laid upon \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98fellow\xe2\x80\x99; and the faces of\r\nboth editors began to glow with defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The ribaldry of this miserable man is despicably disgusting,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPott, pretending to address Bob Sawyer, and scowling upon Slurk.\r\n\r\nHere, Mr. Slurk laughed very heartily, and folding up the paper so as to\r\nget at a fresh column conveniently, said, that the blockhead really\r\namused him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an impudent blunderer this fellow is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, turning from\r\npink to crimson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ever read any of this man\xe2\x80\x99s foolery, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Slurk of\r\nBob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bob; \xe2\x80\x98is it very bad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, shocking! shocking!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Slurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really! Dear me, this is too atrocious!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Pott, at this\r\njuncture; still feigning to be absorbed in his reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you can wade through a few sentences of malice, meanness, falsehood,\r\nperjury, treachery, and cant,\xe2\x80\x99 said Slurk, handing the paper to Bob,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you will, perhaps, be somewhat repaid by a laugh at the style of this\r\nungrammatical twaddler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that you said, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pott, looking up, trembling\r\nall over with passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that to you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Slurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ungrammatical twaddler, was it, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, it was,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Slurk; \xe2\x80\x98and _blue bore_, Sir, if you like\r\nthat better; ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pott retorted not a word at this jocose insult, but deliberately\r\nfolded up his copy of the _Independent_, flattened it carefully down,\r\ncrushed it beneath his boot, spat upon it with great ceremony, and flung\r\nit into the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pott, retreating from the stove, \xe2\x80\x98and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way\r\nI would serve the viper who produces it, if I were not, fortunately for\r\nhim, restrained by the laws of my country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serve him so, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Slurk, starting up. \xe2\x80\x98Those laws shall never\r\nbe appealed to by him, sir, in such a case. Serve him so, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear! hear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing can be fairer,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Ben Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serve him so, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 reiterated Slurk, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nMr. Pott darted a look of contempt, which might have withered an anchor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serve him so, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 reiterated Slurk, in a louder voice than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Pott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you won\xe2\x80\x99t, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Slurk, in a taunting manner;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you hear this, gentlemen! He won\xe2\x80\x99t; not that he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid--, oh, no! he\r\n_won\xe2\x80\x99t_. Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I consider you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pott, moved by this sarcasm, \xe2\x80\x98I consider\r\nyou a viper. I look upon you, sir, as a man who has placed himself\r\nbeyond the pale of society, by his most audacious, disgraceful, and\r\nabominable public conduct. I view you, sir, personally and politically,\r\nin no other light than as a most unparalleled and unmitigated viper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe indignant Independent did not wait to hear the end of this personal\r\ndenunciation; for, catching up his carpet-bag, which was well stuffed\r\nwith movables, he swung it in the air as Pott turned away, and, letting\r\nit fall with a circular sweep on his head, just at that particular angle\r\nof the bag where a good thick hairbrush happened to be packed, caused a\r\nsharp crash to be heard throughout the kitchen, and brought him at once\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick, as Pott started up and seized the fire-\r\nshovel--\xe2\x80\x98gentlemen! Consider, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake--help--Sam--here--pray,\r\ngentlemen--interfere, somebody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUttering these incoherent exclamations, Mr. Pickwick rushed between the\r\ninfuriated combatants just in time to receive the carpet-bag on one side\r\nof his body, and the fire-shovel on the other. Whether the\r\nrepresentatives of the public feeling of Eatanswill were blinded by\r\nanimosity, or (being both acute reasoners) saw the advantage of having a\r\nthird party between them to bear all the blows, certain it is that they\r\npaid not the slightest attention to Mr. Pickwick, but defying each other\r\nwith great spirit, plied the carpet-bag and the fire-shovel most\r\nfearlessly. Mr. Pickwick would unquestionably have suffered severely for\r\nhis humane interference, if Mr. Weller, attracted by his master\xe2\x80\x99s cries,\r\nhad not rushed in at the moment, and, snatching up a meal-sack,\r\neffectually stopped the conflict by drawing it over the head and\r\nshoulders of the mighty Pott, and clasping him tight round the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take away that \xe2\x80\x98ere bag from the t\xe2\x80\x99other madman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam to Ben Allen\r\nand Bob Sawyer, who had done nothing but dodge round the group, each\r\nwith a tortoise-shell lancet in his hand, ready to bleed the first man\r\nstunned. \xe2\x80\x98Give it up, you wretched little creetur, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll smother you\r\nin it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAwed by these threats, and quite out of breath, the _Independent_\r\nsuffered himself to be disarmed; and Mr. Weller, removing the\r\nextinguisher from Pott, set him free with a caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You take yourselves off to bed quietly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98or I\xe2\x80\x99ll put you\r\nboth in it, and let you fight it out vith the mouth tied, as I vould a\r\ndozen sich, if they played these games. And you have the goodness to\r\ncome this here way, sir, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus addressing his master, Sam took him by the arm, and led him off,\r\nwhile the rival editors were severally removed to their beds by the\r\nlandlord, under the inspection of Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen;\r\nbreathing, as they went away, many sanguinary threats, and making vague\r\nappointments for mortal combat next day. When they came to think it\r\nover, however, it occurred to them that they could do it much better in\r\nprint, so they recommenced deadly hostilities without delay; and all\r\nEatanswill rung with their boldness--on paper.\r\n\r\nThey had taken themselves off in separate coaches, early next morning,\r\nbefore the other travellers were stirring; and the weather having now\r\ncleared up, the chaise companions once more turned their faces to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII. INVOLVING A SERIOUS CHANGE IN THE WELLER FAMILY, AND THE\r\nUNTIMELY DOWNFALL OF MR. STIGGINS\r\n\r\nConsidering it a matter of delicacy to abstain from introducing either\r\nBob Sawyer or Ben Allen to the young couple, until they were fully\r\nprepared to expect them, and wishing to spare Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s feelings as\r\nmuch as possible, Mr. Pickwick proposed that he and Sam should alight in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the George and Vulture, and that the two young men\r\nshould for the present take up their quarters elsewhere. To this they\r\nvery readily agreed, and the proposition was accordingly acted upon; Mr.\r\nBen Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer betaking themselves to a sequestered pot-\r\nshop on the remotest confines of the Borough, behind the bar door of\r\nwhich their names had in other days very often appeared at the head of\r\nlong and complex calculations worked in white chalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said the pretty housemaid, meeting Sam at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear _me_ I vish it vos, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, dropping behind, to let\r\nhis master get out of hearing. \xe2\x80\x98Wot a sweet-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 creetur you are,\r\nMary!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor\xe2\x80\x99, Mr. Weller, what nonsense you do talk!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nMr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t what, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, that,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the pretty housemaid. \xe2\x80\x98Lor, do get along with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThus admonishing him, the pretty housemaid pushed Sam against the wall,\r\ndeclaring that he had tumbled her cap, and put her hair quite out of\r\ncurl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And prevented what I was going to say, besides,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mary. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nletter been waiting here for you four days; you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone away, half\r\nan hour, when it came; and more than that, it\xe2\x80\x99s got \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate,\xe2\x80\x9d on the\r\noutside.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vere is it, my love?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I took care of it, for you, or I dare say it would have been lost long\r\nbefore this,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mary. \xe2\x80\x98There, take it; it\xe2\x80\x99s more than you\r\ndeserve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, after many pretty little coquettish doubts and fears,\r\nand wishes that she might not have lost it, Mary produced the letter\r\nfrom behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible, and handed it to\r\nSam, who thereupon kissed it with much gallantry and devotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My goodness me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, adjusting the tucker, and feigning\r\nunconsciousness, \xe2\x80\x98you seem to have grown very fond of it all at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Weller only replied by a wink, the intense meaning of which\r\nno description could convey the faintest idea of; and, sitting himself\r\ndown beside Mary on a window-seat, opened the letter and glanced at the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam, \xe2\x80\x98wot\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing the matter, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, peeping over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless them eyes o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind my eyes; you had much better read your letter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\npretty housemaid; and as she said so, she made the eyes twinkle with\r\nsuch slyness and beauty that they were perfectly irresistible.\r\n\r\nSam refreshed himself with a kiss, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MARKIS GRAN \xe2\x80\x98By DORKEN \xe2\x80\x98Wensdy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My DEAR SAMMLE,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am wery sorry to have the pleasure of being a Bear of ill news your\r\nMother in law cort cold consekens of imprudently settin too long on the\r\ndamp grass in the rain a hearin of a shepherd who warnt able to leave\r\noff till late at night owen to his having vound his-self up vith brandy\r\nand vater and not being able to stop his-self till he got a little sober\r\nwhich took a many hours to do the doctor says that if she\xe2\x80\x99d svallo\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nvarm brandy and vater artervards insted of afore she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\nno vus her veels wos immedetly greased and everythink done to set her\r\nagoin as could be inwented your father had hopes as she vould have\r\nvorked round as usual but just as she wos a turnen the corner my boy she\r\ntook the wrong road and vent down hill vith a welocity you never see and\r\nnotvithstandin that the drag wos put on drectly by the medikel man it\r\nwornt of no use at all for she paid the last pike at twenty minutes\r\nafore six o\xe2\x80\x99clock yesterday evenin havin done the jouney wery much under\r\nthe reglar time vich praps was partly owen to her haven taken in wery\r\nlittle luggage by the vay your father says that if you vill come and see\r\nme Sammy he vill take it as a wery great favor for I am wery lonely\r\nSamivel N.

It ain\xe2\x80\x99t my father\xe2\x80\x99s writin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98cept this\r\nhere signater in print letters; that\xe2\x80\x99s his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps he got somebody to write it for him, and signed it himself\r\nafterwards,\xe2\x80\x99 said the pretty housemaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a minit,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, running over the letter again, and pausing\r\nhere and there, to reflect, as he did so. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve hit it. The gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nas wrote it wos a-tellin\xe2\x80\x99 all about the misfortun\xe2\x80\x99 in a proper vay, and\r\nthen my father comes a-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 over him, and complicates the whole\r\nconcern by puttin\xe2\x80\x99 his oar in. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the wery sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndo. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, Mary, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied himself on this point, Sam read the letter all over,\r\nonce more, and, appearing to form a clear notion of its contents for the\r\nfirst time, ejaculated thoughtfully, as he folded it up--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so the poor creetur\xe2\x80\x99s dead! I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for it. She warn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad-\r\ndisposed \xe2\x80\x98ooman, if them shepherds had let her alone. I\xe2\x80\x99m wery sorry for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller uttered these words in so serious a manner, that the pretty\r\nhousemaid cast down her eyes and looked very grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, putting the letter in his pocket with a gentle\r\nsigh, \xe2\x80\x98it wos to be--and wos, as the old lady said arter she\xe2\x80\x99d married\r\nthe footman. Can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped now, can it, Mary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary shook her head, and sighed too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must apply to the hemperor for leave of absence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nMary sighed again--the letter was so very affecting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the pretty housemaid, turning her head away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, shake hands, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nThe pretty housemaid put out a hand which, although it was a\r\nhousemaid\xe2\x80\x99s, was a very small one, and rose to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be wery long avay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re always away,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, giving her head the slightest possible\r\ntoss in the air. \xe2\x80\x98You no sooner come, Mr. Weller, than you go again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller drew the household beauty closer to him, and entered upon a\r\nwhispering conversation, which had not proceeded far, when she turned\r\nher face round and condescended to look at him again. When they parted,\r\nit was somehow or other indispensably necessary for her to go to her\r\nroom, and arrange the cap and curls before she could think of presenting\r\nherself to her mistress; which preparatory ceremony she went off to\r\nperform, bestowing many nods and smiles on Sam over the banisters as she\r\ntripped upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be avay more than a day, or two, Sir, at the furthest,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSam, when he had communicated to Mr. Pickwick the intelligence of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As long as may be necessary, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98you have my\r\nfull permission to remain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will tell your father, Sam, that if I can be of any assistance to\r\nhim in his present situation, I shall be most willing and ready to lend\r\nhim any aid in my power,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention it, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd with some expressions of mutual good-will and interest, master and\r\nman separated.\r\n\r\nIt was just seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Samuel Weller, alighting from the box of\r\na stage-coach which passed through Dorking, stood within a few hundred\r\nyards of the Marquis of Granby. It was a cold, dull evening; the little\r\nstreet looked dreary and dismal; and the mahogany countenance of the\r\nnoble and gallant marquis seemed to wear a more sad and melancholy\r\nexpression than it was wont to do, as it swung to and fro, creaking\r\nmournfully in the wind. The blinds were pulled down, and the shutters\r\npartly closed; of the knot of loungers that usually collected about the\r\ndoor, not one was to be seen; the place was silent and desolate.\r\n\r\nSeeing nobody of whom he could ask any preliminary questions, Sam walked\r\nsoftly in, and glancing round, he quickly recognised his parent in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe widower was seated at a small round table in the little room behind\r\nthe bar, smoking a pipe, with his eyes intently fixed upon the fire. The\r\nfuneral had evidently taken place that day, for attached to his hat,\r\nwhich he still retained on his head, was a hatband measuring about a\r\nyard and a half in length, which hung over the top rail of the chair and\r\nstreamed negligently down. Mr. Weller was in a very abstracted and\r\ncontemplative mood. Notwithstanding that Sam called him by name several\r\ntimes, he still continued to smoke with the same fixed and quiet\r\ncountenance, and was only roused ultimately by his son\xe2\x80\x99s placing the\r\npalm of his hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-callin\xe2\x80\x99 to you half a dozen times,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, hanging his\r\nhat on a peg, \xe2\x80\x98but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, again looking thoughtfully at the fire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was in a referee, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot about?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam, drawing his chair up to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a referee, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the elder Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98regarding _her_,\r\nSamivel.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr. Weller jerked his head in the direction of Dorking\r\nchurchyard, in mute explanation that his words referred to the late Mrs.\r\nWeller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wos a-thinkin\xe2\x80\x99, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, eyeing his son, with great\r\nearnestness, over his pipe, as if to assure him that however\r\nextraordinary and incredible the declaration might appear, it was\r\nnevertheless calmly and deliberately uttered. \xe2\x80\x98I wos a-thinkin\xe2\x80\x99, Sammy,\r\nthat upon the whole I wos wery sorry she wos gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, and so you ought to be,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller nodded his acquiescence in the sentiment, and again fastening\r\nhis eyes on the fire, shrouded himself in a cloud, and mused deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those wos wery sensible observations as she made, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller, driving the smoke away with his hand, after a long silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot observations?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Them as she made, arter she was took ill,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot was they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somethin\xe2\x80\x99 to this here effect. \xe2\x80\x9cVeller,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afeered I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnot done by you quite wot I ought to have done; you\xe2\x80\x99re a wery kind-\r\nhearted man, and I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 made your home more comfortabler. I begin\r\nto see now,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cven it\xe2\x80\x99s too late, that if a married \xe2\x80\x98ooman\r\nvishes to be religious, she should begin vith dischargin\xe2\x80\x99 her dooties at\r\nhome, and makin\xe2\x80\x99 them as is about her cheerful and happy, and that vile\r\nshe goes to church, or chapel, or wot not, at all proper times, she\r\nshould be wery careful not to con-wert this sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing into a excuse\r\nfor idleness or self-indulgence. I have done this,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nvasted time and substance on them as has done it more than me; but I\r\nhope ven I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, Veller, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll think on me as I wos afore I\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x99d them people, and as I raly wos by natur.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSusan,\xe2\x80\x9d says I--I wos\r\ntook up wery short by this, Samivel; I von\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, my boy--\xe2\x80\x9cSusan,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a wery good vife to me, altogether; don\xe2\x80\x99t say nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat all about it; keep a good heart, my dear; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll live to see me\r\npunch that \xe2\x80\x98ere Stiggins\xe2\x80\x99s head yet.\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled at this, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe old gentleman, stifling a sigh with his pipe, \xe2\x80\x98but she died arter\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, venturing to offer a little homely consolation, after\r\nthe lapse of three or four minutes, consumed by the old gentleman in\r\nslowly shaking his head from side to side, and solemnly smoking, \xe2\x80\x98vell,\r\ngov\xe2\x80\x99nor, ve must all come to it, one day or another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So we must, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller the elder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a Providence in it all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 course there is,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father, with a nod of grave approval.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot \xe2\x80\x98ud become of the undertakers vithout it, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLost in the immense field of conjecture opened by this reflection, the\r\nelder Mr. Weller laid his pipe on the table, and stirred the fire with a\r\nmeditative visage.\r\n\r\nWhile the old gentleman was thus engaged, a very buxom-looking cook,\r\ndressed in mourning, who had been bustling about, in the bar, glided\r\ninto the room, and bestowing many smirks of recognition upon Sam,\r\nsilently stationed herself at the back of his father\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and\r\nannounced her presence by a slight cough, the which, being disregarded,\r\nwas followed by a louder one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller, dropping the poker as he looked\r\nround, and hastily drew his chair away. \xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have a cup of tea, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good soul,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the buxom female\r\ncoaxingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I von\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, in a somewhat boisterous manner. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee you--\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller hastily checked himself, and added in a low tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98furder fust.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, dear, dear! How adwersity does change people!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady,\r\nlooking upwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing \xe2\x80\x98twixt this and the doctor as shall change my\r\ncondition,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really never saw a man so cross,\xe2\x80\x99 said the buxom female.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s all for my own good; vich is the reflection vith vich\r\nthe penitent school-boy comforted his feelin\xe2\x80\x99s ven they flogged him,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrejoined the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe buxom female shook her head with a compassionate and sympathising\r\nair; and, appealing to Sam, inquired whether his father really ought not\r\nto make an effort to keep up, and not give way to that lowness of\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Mr. Samuel,\xe2\x80\x99 said the buxom female, \xe2\x80\x98as I was telling him\r\nyesterday, he will feel lonely, he can\xe2\x80\x99t expect but what he should, sir,\r\nbut he should keep up a good heart, because, dear me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we all\r\npity his loss, and are ready to do anything for him; and there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nsituation in life so bad, Mr. Samuel, that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be mended. Which is\r\nwhat a very worthy person said to me when my husband died.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the\r\nspeaker, putting her hand before her mouth, coughed again, and looked\r\naffectionately at the elder Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I don\xe2\x80\x99t rekvire any o\xe2\x80\x99 your conversation just now, mum, vill you\r\nhave the goodness to re-tire?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller, in a grave and\r\nsteady voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said the buxom female, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I only spoke to you\r\nout of kindness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery likely, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Samivel, show the lady out, and\r\nshut the door after her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis hint was not lost upon the buxom female; for she at once left the\r\nroom, and slammed the door behind her, upon which Mr. Weller, senior,\r\nfalling back in his chair in a violent perspiration, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sammy, if I wos to stop here alone vun week--only vun week, my boy--\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98ere \xe2\x80\x98ooman \xe2\x80\x98ud marry me by force and wiolence afore it was over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot! is she so wery fond on you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fond!\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep her avay from me. If I was\r\nlocked up in a fireproof chest vith a patent Brahmin, she\xe2\x80\x99d find means\r\nto get at me, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot a thing it is to be so sought arter!\xe2\x80\x99 observed Sam, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t take no pride out on it, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, poking the\r\nfire vehemently, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a horrid sitiwation. I\xe2\x80\x99m actiwally drove out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhouse and home by it. The breath was scarcely out o\xe2\x80\x99 your poor mother-\r\nin-law\xe2\x80\x99s body, ven vun old \xe2\x80\x98ooman sends me a pot o\xe2\x80\x99 jam, and another a\r\npot o\xe2\x80\x99 jelly, and another brews a blessed large jug o\xe2\x80\x99 camomile-tea,\r\nvich she brings in vith her own hands.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Weller paused with an aspect\r\nof intense disgust, and looking round, added in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x98They wos all\r\nwidders, Sammy, all on \xe2\x80\x98em, \xe2\x80\x98cept the camomile-tea vun, as wos a single\r\nyoung lady o\xe2\x80\x99 fifty-three.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam gave a comical look in reply, and the old gentleman having broken an\r\nobstinate lump of coal, with a countenance expressive of as much\r\nearnestness and malice as if it had been the head of one of the widows\r\nlast-mentioned, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In short, Sammy, I feel that I ain\xe2\x80\x99t safe anyveres but on the box.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you safer there than anyveres else?\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos a coachman\xe2\x80\x99s a privileged indiwidual,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, looking\r\nfixedly at his son. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos a coachman may do vithout suspicion wot other\r\nmen may not; \xe2\x80\x98cos a coachman may be on the wery amicablest terms with\r\neighty mile o\xe2\x80\x99 females, and yet nobody think that he ever means to marry\r\nany vun among \xe2\x80\x98em. And wot other man can say the same, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell, there\xe2\x80\x99s somethin\xe2\x80\x99 in that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If your gov\xe2\x80\x99nor had been a coachman,\xe2\x80\x99 reasoned Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98do you\r\ns\xe2\x80\x99pose as that \xe2\x80\x98ere jury \xe2\x80\x98ud ever ha\xe2\x80\x99 conwicted him, s\xe2\x80\x99posin\xe2\x80\x99 it\r\npossible as the matter could ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone to that extremity? They dustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 done it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy not?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, rather disparagingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy not!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99cos it \xe2\x80\x98ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone agin their\r\nconsciences. A reg\xe2\x80\x99lar coachman\xe2\x80\x99s a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 con-nectin\xe2\x80\x99 link betwixt\r\nsingleness and matrimony, and every practicable man knows it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot! You mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re gen\xe2\x80\x99ral favorites, and nobody takes adwantage on\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em, p\xe2\x80\x99raps?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\nHis father nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How it ever come to that \xe2\x80\x98ere pass,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the parent Weller, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say. Wy it is that long-stage coachmen possess such insiniwations,\r\nand is alvays looked up to--a-dored I may say--by ev\xe2\x80\x99ry young \xe2\x80\x98ooman in\r\nev\xe2\x80\x99ry town he vurks through, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I only know that so it is.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a regulation of natur--a dispensary, as your poor mother-in-law\r\nused to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A dispensation,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, correcting the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, Samivel, a dispensation if you like it better,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr.\r\nWeller; \xe2\x80\x98I call it a dispensary, and it\xe2\x80\x99s always writ up so, at the\r\nplaces vere they gives you physic for nothin\xe2\x80\x99 in your own bottles;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Weller refilled and relighted his pipe, and once\r\nmore summoning up a meditative expression of countenance, continued as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Therefore, my boy, as I do not see the adwisability o\xe2\x80\x99 stoppin here to\r\nbe married vether I vant to or not, and as at the same time I do not\r\nvish to separate myself from them interestin\xe2\x80\x99 members o\xe2\x80\x99 society\r\naltogether, I have come to the determination o\xe2\x80\x99 driving the Safety, and\r\nputtin\xe2\x80\x99 up vunce more at the Bell Savage, vich is my nat\xe2\x80\x99ral born\r\nelement, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And wot\xe2\x80\x99s to become o\xe2\x80\x99 the bis\xe2\x80\x99ness?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The bis\xe2\x80\x99ness, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98good-vill, stock,\r\nand fixters, vill be sold by private contract; and out o\xe2\x80\x99 the money, two\r\nhundred pound, agreeable to a rekvest o\xe2\x80\x99 your mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s to me, a\r\nlittle afore she died, vill be invested in your name in--What do you\r\ncall them things agin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot things?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Them things as is always a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 up and down, in the city.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Omnibuses?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Them things as is alvays a-\r\nfluctooatin\xe2\x80\x99, and gettin\xe2\x80\x99 theirselves inwolved somehow or another vith\r\nthe national debt, and the chequers bill; and all that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! the funds,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98the funs; two hundred pounds o\xe2\x80\x99 the money is\r\nto be inwested for you, Samivel, in the funs; four and a half per cent.\r\nreduced counsels, Sammy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery kind o\xe2\x80\x99 the old lady to think o\xe2\x80\x99 me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99m wery much\r\nobliged to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The rest will be inwested in my name,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the elder Mr. Weller;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and wen I\xe2\x80\x99m took off the road, it\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you, so take care you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t spend it all at vunst, my boy, and mind that no widder gets a\r\ninklin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 your fortun\xe2\x80\x99, or you\xe2\x80\x99re done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving delivered this warning, Mr. Weller resumed his pipe with a more\r\nserene countenance; the disclosure of these matters appearing to have\r\neased his mind considerably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s a-tappin\xe2\x80\x99 at the door,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let \xe2\x80\x98em tap,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father, with dignity.\r\n\r\nSam acted upon the direction. There was another tap, and another, and\r\nthen a long row of taps; upon which Sam inquired why the tapper was not\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Weller, with apprehensive looks, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t take no\r\nnotice on \xe2\x80\x98em, Sammy, it\xe2\x80\x99s vun o\xe2\x80\x99 the widders, p\xe2\x80\x99raps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo notice being taken of the taps, the unseen visitor, after a short\r\nlapse, ventured to open the door and peep in. It was no female head that\r\nwas thrust in at the partially-opened door, but the long black locks and\r\nred face of Mr. Stiggins. Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s pipe fell from his hands.\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman gradually opened the door by almost imperceptible\r\ndegrees, until the aperture was just wide enough to admit of the passage\r\nof his lank body, when he glided into the room and closed it after him,\r\nwith great care and gentleness. Turning towards Sam, and raising his\r\nhands and eyes in token of the unspeakable sorrow with which he regarded\r\nthe calamity that had befallen the family, he carried the high-backed\r\nchair to his old corner by the fire, and, seating himself on the very\r\nedge, drew forth a brown pocket-handkerchief, and applied the same to\r\nhis optics.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going forward, the elder Mr. Weller sat back in his\r\nchair, with his eyes wide open, his hands planted on his knees, and his\r\nwhole countenance expressive of absorbing and overwhelming astonishment.\r\nSam sat opposite him in perfect silence, waiting, with eager curiosity,\r\nfor the termination of the scene.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins kept the brown pocket-handkerchief before his eyes for some\r\nminutes, moaning decently meanwhile, and then, mastering his feelings by\r\na strong effort, put it in his pocket and buttoned it up. After this, he\r\nstirred the fire; after that, he rubbed his hands and looked at Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins, breaking the silence, in a\r\nvery low voice, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s a sorrowful affliction!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam nodded very slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the man of wrath, too!\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Stiggins; \xe2\x80\x98it makes a vessel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart bleed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller was overheard by his son to murmur something relative to\r\nmaking a vessel\xe2\x80\x99s nose bleed; but Mr. Stiggins heard him not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know, young man,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Mr. Stiggins, drawing his chair\r\ncloser to Sam, \xe2\x80\x98whether she has left Emanuel anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The chapel,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Stiggins; \xe2\x80\x98our chapel; our fold, Mr. Samuel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left the fold nothin\xe2\x80\x99, nor the shepherd nothin\xe2\x80\x99, nor the\r\nanimals nothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam decisively; \xe2\x80\x98nor the dogs neither.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins looked slily at Sam; glanced at the old gentleman, who was\r\nsitting with his eyes closed, as if asleep; and drawing his chair still\r\nnearer, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing for _me_, Mr. Samuel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think there\xe2\x80\x99s something,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stiggins, turning as pale as he could\r\nturn. \xe2\x80\x98Consider, Mr. Samuel; no little token?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so much as the vorth o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere old umberella o\xe2\x80\x99 yourn,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nSam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Stiggins hesitatingly, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 deep\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps she recommended me to the care of the man of wrath,\r\nMr. Samuel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think that\xe2\x80\x99s wery likely, from what he said,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam; \xe2\x80\x98he wos\r\na-speakin\xe2\x80\x99 about you, jist now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he, though?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Stiggins, brightening up. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! He\xe2\x80\x99s changed,\r\nI dare say. We might live very comfortably together now, Mr. Samuel, eh?\r\nI could take care of his property when you are away--good care, you\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHeaving a long-drawn sigh, Mr. Stiggins paused for a response. Sam\r\nnodded, and Mr. Weller the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound,\r\nwhich, being neither a groan, nor a grunt, nor a gasp, nor a growl,\r\nseemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiggins, encouraged by this sound, which he understood to betoken\r\nremorse or repentance, looked about him, rubbed his hands, wept, smiled,\r\nwept again, and then, walking softly across the room to a well-\r\nremembered shelf in one corner, took down a tumbler, and with great\r\ndeliberation put four lumps of sugar in it. Having got thus far, he\r\nlooked about him again, and sighed grievously; with that, he walked\r\nsoftly into the bar, and presently returning with the tumbler half full\r\nof pine-apple rum, advanced to the kettle which was singing gaily on the\r\nhob, mixed his grog, stirred it, sipped it, sat down, and taking a long\r\nand hearty pull at the rum-and-water, stopped for breath.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Weller, who still continued to make various strange and\r\nuncouth attempts to appear asleep, offered not a single word during\r\nthese proceedings; but when Stiggins stopped for breath, he darted upon\r\nhim, and snatching the tumbler from his hand, threw the remainder of the\r\nrum-and-water in his face, and the glass itself into the grate. Then,\r\nseizing the reverend gentleman firmly by the collar, he suddenly fell to\r\nkicking him most furiously, accompanying every application of his top-\r\nboot to Mr. Stiggins\xe2\x80\x99s person, with sundry violent and incoherent\r\nanathemas upon his limbs, eyes, and body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98put my hat on tight for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband more firmly on his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s head, and the old gentleman, resuming his kicking with greater\r\nagility than before, tumbled with Mr. Stiggins through the bar, and\r\nthrough the passage, out at the front door, and so into the street--the\r\nkicking continuing the whole way, and increasing in vehemence, rather\r\nthan diminishing, every time the top-boot was lifted.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the red-nosed man\r\nwrithing in Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s grasp, and his whole frame quivering with\r\nanguish as kick followed kick in rapid succession; it was a still more\r\nexciting spectacle to behold Mr. Weller, after a powerful struggle,\r\nimmersing Mr. Stiggins\xe2\x80\x99s head in a horse-trough full of water, and\r\nholding it there, until he was half suffocated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, throwing all his energy into one most\r\ncomplicated kick, as he at length permitted Mr. Stiggins to withdraw his\r\nhead from the trough, \xe2\x80\x98send any vun o\xe2\x80\x99 them lazy shepherds here, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll pound him to a jelly first, and drownd him artervards! Sammy, help\r\nme in, and fill me a small glass of brandy. I\xe2\x80\x99m out o\xe2\x80\x99 breath, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII. COMPRISING THE FINAL EXIT OF MR. JINGLE AND JOB TROTTER,\r\nWITH A GREAT MORNING OF BUSINESS IN GRAY\xe2\x80\x99S INN SQUARE--CONCLUDING WITH A\r\nDOUBLE KNOCK AT MR. PERKER\xe2\x80\x99S DOOR\r\n\r\nWhen Arabella, after some gentle preparation and many assurances that\r\nthere was not the least occasion for being low-spirited, was at length\r\nmade acquainted by Mr. Pickwick with the unsatisfactory result of his\r\nvisit to Birmingham, she burst into tears, and sobbing aloud, lamented\r\nin moving terms that she should have been the unhappy cause of any\r\nestrangement between a father and his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick kindly, \xe2\x80\x98it is no fault of yours. It\r\nwas impossible to foresee that the old gentleman would be so strongly\r\nprepossessed against his son\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, you know. I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr.\r\nPickwick, glancing at her pretty face, \xe2\x80\x98he can have very little idea of\r\nthe pleasure he denies himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, \xe2\x80\x98what shall we do, if he\r\ncontinues to be angry with us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, wait patiently, my dear, until he thinks better of it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nMr. Pickwick cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, dear Mr. Pickwick, what is to become of Nathaniel if his father\r\nwithdraws his assistance?\xe2\x80\x99 urged Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I will venture to\r\nprophesy that he will find some other friend who will not be backward in\r\nhelping him to start in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe significance of this reply was not so well disguised by Mr. Pickwick\r\nbut that Arabella understood it. So, throwing her arms round his neck,\r\nand kissing him affectionately, she sobbed louder than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick taking her hand, \xe2\x80\x98we will wait here a\r\nfew days longer, and see whether he writes or takes any other notice of\r\nyour husband\xe2\x80\x99s communication. If not, I have thought of half a dozen\r\nplans, any one of which would make you happy at once. There, my dear,\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Pickwick gently pressed Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and bade\r\nher dry her eyes, and not distress her husband. Upon which, Arabella,\r\nwho was one of the best little creatures alive, put her handkerchief in\r\nher reticule, and by the time Mr. Winkle joined them, exhibited in full\r\nlustre the same beaming smiles and sparkling eyes that had originally\r\ncaptivated him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a distressing predicament for these young people,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr.\r\nPickwick, as he dressed himself next morning. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk up to Perker\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand consult him about the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Pickwick was further prompted to betake himself to Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn\r\nSquare by an anxious desire to come to a pecuniary settlement with the\r\nkind-hearted little attorney without further delay, he made a hurried\r\nbreakfast, and executed his intention so speedily, that ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock had\r\nnot struck when he reached Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn.\r\n\r\nIt still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the\r\nstaircase on which Perker\xe2\x80\x99s chambers were. The clerks had not arrived\r\nyet, and he beguiled the time by looking out of the staircase window.\r\n\r\nThe healthy light of a fine October morning made even the dingy old\r\nhouses brighten up a little; some of the dusty windows actually looking\r\nalmost cheerful as the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays gleamed upon them. Clerk after clerk\r\nhastened into the square by one or other of the entrances, and looking\r\nup at the Hall clock, accelerated or decreased his rate of walking\r\naccording to the time at which his office hours nominally commenced; the\r\nhalf-past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock people suddenly becoming very brisk, and the ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock gentlemen falling into a pace of most aristocratic slowness. The\r\nclock struck ten, and clerks poured in faster than ever, each one in a\r\ngreater perspiration than his predecessor. The noise of unlocking and\r\nopening doors echoed and re-echoed on every side; heads appeared as if\r\nby magic in every window; the porters took up their stations for the\r\nday; the slipshod laundresses hurried off; the postman ran from house to\r\nhouse; and the whole legal hive was in a bustle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re early, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said a voice behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mr. Lowten,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman, looking round, and recognising\r\nhis old acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precious warm walking, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten, drawing a Bramah key\r\nfrom his pocket, with a small plug therein, to keep the dust out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You appear to feel it so,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick, smiling at the clerk,\r\nwho was literally red-hot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve come along, rather, I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lowten. \xe2\x80\x98It went the\r\nhalf hour as I came through the Polygon. I\xe2\x80\x99m here before him, though, so\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nComforting himself with this reflection, Mr. Lowten extracted the plug\r\nfrom the door-key; having opened the door, replugged and repocketed his\r\nBramah, and picked up the letters which the postman had dropped through\r\nthe box, he ushered Mr. Pickwick into the office. Here, in the twinkling\r\nof an eye, he divested himself of his coat, put on a threadbare garment,\r\nwhich he took out of a desk, hung up his hat, pulled forth a few sheets\r\nof cartridge and blotting-paper in alternate layers, and, sticking a pen\r\nbehind his ear, rubbed his hands with an air of great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, you see, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98now I\xe2\x80\x99m complete. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my\r\noffice coat on, and my pad out, and let him come as soon as he likes.\r\nYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a pinch of snuff about you, have you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I have not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ll run out presently,\r\nand get a bottle of soda. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I look rather queer about the eyes, Mr.\r\nPickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe individual appealed to, surveyed Mr. Lowten\xe2\x80\x99s eyes from a distance,\r\nand expressed his opinion that no unusual queerness was perceptible in\r\nthose features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten. \xe2\x80\x98We were keeping it up pretty tolerably\r\nat the Stump last night, and I\xe2\x80\x99m rather out of sorts this morning.\r\nPerker\xe2\x80\x99s been about that business of yours, by the bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What business?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Bardell\xe2\x80\x99s costs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Lowten. \xe2\x80\x98About getting that\r\ncustomer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill-\r\ndiscounter for, on your account--to get him out of the Fleet, you know--\r\nabout getting him to Demerara.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr. Jingle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick hastily. \xe2\x80\x98Yes. Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all arranged,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten, mending his pen. \xe2\x80\x98The agent at\r\nLiverpool said he had been obliged to you many times when you were in\r\nbusiness, and he would be glad to take him on your recommendation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I am delighted to hear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I say,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Lowten, scraping the back of the pen preparatory to\r\nmaking a fresh split, \xe2\x80\x98what a soft chap that other is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which other?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, that servant, or friend, or whatever he is; you know, Trotter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x98I always thought him the\r\nreverse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and so did I, from what little I saw of him,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lowten, \xe2\x80\x98it\r\nonly shows how one may be deceived. What do you think of his going to\r\nDemerara, too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! And giving up what was offered him here!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Treating Perker\xe2\x80\x99s offer of eighteen bob a week, and a rise if he\r\nbehaved himself, like dirt,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lowten. \xe2\x80\x98He said he must go along\r\nwith the other one, and so they persuaded Perker to write again, and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got him something on the same estate; not near so good, Perker\r\nsays, as a convict would get in New South Wales, if he appeared at his\r\ntrial in a new suit of clothes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Foolish fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, with glistening eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Foolish\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s worse than foolish; it\xe2\x80\x99s downright sneaking, you know,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied Lowten, nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face. \xe2\x80\x98He says that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s the only friend he ever had, and he\xe2\x80\x99s attached to him, and all\r\nthat. Friendship\xe2\x80\x99s a very good thing in its way--we are all very\r\nfriendly and comfortable at the Stump, for instance, over our grog,\r\nwhere every man pays for himself; but damn hurting yourself for anybody\r\nelse, you know! No man should have more than two attachments--the first,\r\nto number one, and the second to the ladies; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say--ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr. Lowten concluded with a loud laugh, half in jocularity, and half in\r\nderision, which was prematurely cut short by the sound of Perker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps on the stairs, at the first approach of which, he vaulted on\r\nhis stool with an agility most remarkable, and wrote intensely.\r\n\r\nThe greeting between Mr. Pickwick and his professional adviser was warm\r\nand cordial; the client was scarcely ensconced in the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s arm-\r\nchair, however, when a knock was heard at the door, and a voice inquired\r\nwhether Mr. Perker was within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hark!\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s one of our vagabond friends--Jingle\r\nhimself, my dear Sir. Will you see him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think you had better. Here, you Sir, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name, walk in,\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this unceremonious invitation, Jingle and Job walked\r\ninto the room, but, seeing Mr. Pickwick, stopped short in some\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good reason to,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Jingle, stepping forward. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick--\r\ndeepest obligations--life preserver--made a man of me--you shall never\r\nrepent it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am happy to hear you say so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98You look much\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks to you, sir--great change--Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Fleet--unwholesome place--\r\nvery,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle, shaking his head. He was decently and cleanly\r\ndressed, and so was Job, who stood bolt upright behind him, staring at\r\nMr. Pickwick with a visage of iron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When do they go to Liverpool?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick, half aside to\r\nPerker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This evening, Sir, at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, taking one step\r\nforward. \xe2\x80\x98By the heavy coach from the city, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are your places taken?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have fully made up your mind to go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have sir,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With regard to such an outfit as was indispensable for Jingle,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPerker, addressing Mr. Pickwick aloud. \xe2\x80\x98I have taken upon myself to make\r\nan arrangement for the deduction of a small sum from his quarterly\r\nsalary, which, being made only for one year, and regularly remitted,\r\nwill provide for that expense. I entirely disapprove of your doing\r\nanything for him, my dear sir, which is not dependent on his own\r\nexertions and good conduct.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Jingle, with great firmness. \xe2\x80\x98Clear head--man of\r\nthe world--quite right--perfectly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By compounding with his creditor, releasing his clothes from the\r\npawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s, relieving him in prison, and paying for his passage,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Perker, without noticing Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s observation, \xe2\x80\x98you have\r\nalready lost upwards of fifty pounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not lost,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jingle hastily, \xe2\x80\x98Pay it all--stick to business--cash\r\nup--every farthing. Yellow fever, perhaps--can\xe2\x80\x99t help that--if not--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHere Mr. Jingle paused, and striking the crown of his hat with great\r\nviolence, passed his hand over his eyes, and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He means to say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, advancing a few paces, \xe2\x80\x98that if he is not\r\ncarried off by the fever, he will pay the money back again. If he lives,\r\nhe will, Mr. Pickwick. I will see it done. I know he will, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nJob, with energy. \xe2\x80\x98I could undertake to swear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, who had been bestowing a score or two\r\nof frowns upon Perker, to stop his summary of benefits conferred, which\r\nthe little attorney obstinately disregarded, \xe2\x80\x98you must be careful not to\r\nplay any more desperate cricket matches, Mr. Jingle, or to renew your\r\nacquaintance with Sir Thomas Blazo, and I have little doubt of your\r\npreserving your health.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Jingle smiled at this sally, but looked rather foolish\r\nnotwithstanding; so Mr. Pickwick changed the subject by saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to know, do you, what has become of another friend of\r\nyours--a more humble one, whom I saw at Rochester?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dismal Jemmy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Jingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJingle shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clever rascal--queer fellow, hoaxing genius--Job\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Job\xe2\x80\x99s brother!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Well, now I look at him\r\nclosely, there _is_ a likeness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We were always considered like each other, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job, with a\r\ncunning look just lurking in the corners of his eyes, \xe2\x80\x98only I was really\r\nof a serious nature, and he never was. He emigrated to America, Sir, in\r\nconsequence of being too much sought after here, to be comfortable; and\r\nhas never been heard of since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That accounts for my not having received the \xe2\x80\x9cpage from the romance of\r\nreal life,\xe2\x80\x9d which he promised me one morning when he appeared to be\r\ncontemplating suicide on Rochester Bridge, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98I need not inquire whether his dismal behaviour was\r\nnatural or assumed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He could assume anything, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Job. \xe2\x80\x98You may consider yourself\r\nvery fortunate in having escaped him so easily. On intimate terms he\r\nwould have been even a more dangerous acquaintance than--\xe2\x80\x99 Job looked at\r\nJingle, hesitated, and finally added, \xe2\x80\x98than--than-myself even.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A hopeful family yours, Mr. Trotter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, sealing a letter\r\nwhich he had just finished writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Job. \xe2\x80\x98Very much so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98I hope you are going to disgrace\r\nit. Deliver this letter to the agent when you reach Liverpool, and let\r\nme advise you, gentlemen, not to be too knowing in the West Indies. If\r\nyou throw away this chance, you will both richly deserve to be hanged,\r\nas I sincerely trust you will be. And now you had better leave Mr.\r\nPickwick and me alone, for we have other matters to talk over, and time\r\nis precious.\xe2\x80\x99 As Perker said this, he looked towards the door, with an\r\nevident desire to render the leave-taking as brief as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was brief enough on Mr. Jingle\xe2\x80\x99s part. He thanked the little attorney\r\nin a few hurried words for the kindness and promptitude with which he\r\nhad rendered his assistance, and, turning to his benefactor, stood for a\r\nfew seconds as if irresolute what to say or how to act. Job Trotter\r\nrelieved his perplexity; for, with a humble and grateful bow to Mr.\r\nPickwick, he took his friend gently by the arm, and led him away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A worthy couple!\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, as the door closed behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope they may become so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98What do you think?\r\nIs there any chance of their permanent reformation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerker shrugged his shoulders doubtfully, but observing Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanxious and disappointed look, rejoined--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course there is a chance. I hope it may prove a good one. They are\r\nunquestionably penitent now; but then, you know, they have the\r\nrecollection of very recent suffering fresh upon them. What they may\r\nbecome, when that fades away, is a problem that neither you nor I can\r\nsolve. However, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 added Perker, laying his hand on Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, \xe2\x80\x98your object is equally honourable, whatever the\r\nresult is. Whether that species of benevolence which is so very cautious\r\nand long-sighted that it is seldom exercised at all, lest its owner\r\nshould be imposed upon, and so wounded in his self-love, be real charity\r\nor a worldly counterfeit, I leave to wiser heads than mine to determine.\r\nBut if those two fellows were to commit a burglary to-morrow, my opinion\r\nof this action would be equally high.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these remarks, which were delivered in a much more animated and\r\nearnest manner than is usual in legal gentlemen, Perker drew his chair\r\nto his desk, and listened to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s recital of old Mr. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobstinacy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give him a week,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, nodding his head prophetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think he will come round?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think he will,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Perker. \xe2\x80\x98If not, we must try the young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion; and that is what anybody but you would have done at\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Perker was taking a pinch of snuff with various grotesque\r\ncontractions of countenance, eulogistic of the persuasive powers\r\nappertaining unto young ladies, when the murmur of inquiry and answer\r\nwas heard in the outer office, and Lowten tapped at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the little man.\r\n\r\nThe clerk came in, and shut the door after him, with great mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re wanted, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who wants me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLowten looked at Mr. Pickwick, and coughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who wants me? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you speak, Mr. Lowten?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lowten, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s Dodson; and Fogg is with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless my life!\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man, looking at his watch, \xe2\x80\x98I appointed\r\nthem to be here at half-past eleven, to settle that matter of yours,\r\nPickwick. I gave them an undertaking on which they sent down your\r\ndischarge; it\xe2\x80\x99s very awkward, my dear Sir; what will you do? Would you\r\nlike to step into the next room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe next room being the identical room in which Messrs. Dodson & Fogg\r\nwere, Mr. Pickwick replied that he would remain where he was: the more\r\nespecially as Messrs. Dodson & Fogg ought to be ashamed to look him in\r\nthe face, instead of his being ashamed to see them. Which latter\r\ncircumstance he begged Mr. Perker to note, with a glowing countenance\r\nand many marks of indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, my dear Sir, very well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, \xe2\x80\x98I can only say\r\nthat if you expect either Dodson or Fogg to exhibit any symptom of shame\r\nor confusion at having to look you, or anybody else, in the face, you\r\nare the most sanguine man in your expectations that I ever met with.\r\nShow them in, Mr. Lowten.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Lowten disappeared with a grin, and immediately returned ushering in\r\nthe firm, in due form of precedence--Dodson first, and Fogg afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen Mr. Pickwick, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker to Dodson,\r\ninclining his pen in the direction where that gentleman was seated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you do, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fogg, \xe2\x80\x98how do you do, Mr. Pickwick? I hope you are\r\nwell, Sir. I thought I knew the face,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, drawing up a chair,\r\nand looking round him with a smile.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick bent his head very slightly, in answer to these\r\nsalutations, and, seeing Fogg pull a bundle of papers from his coat\r\npocket, rose and walked to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no occasion for Mr. Pickwick to move, Mr. Perker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg,\r\nuntying the red tape which encircled the little bundle, and smiling\r\nagain more sweetly than before. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick is pretty well acquainted\r\nwith these proceedings. There are no secrets between us, I think. He!\r\nhe! he!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not many, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson. \xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99 Then both the partners\r\nlaughed together--pleasantly and cheerfully, as men who are going to\r\nreceive money often do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall make Mr. Pickwick pay for peeping,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, with\r\nconsiderable native humour, as he unfolded his papers. \xe2\x80\x98The amount of\r\nthe taxed costs is one hundred and thirty-three, six, four, Mr. Perker.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a great comparing of papers, and turning over of leaves, by\r\nFogg and Perker, after this statement of profit and loss. Meanwhile,\r\nDodson said, in an affable manner, to Mr. Pickwick--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are looking quite so stout as when I had the pleasure\r\nof seeing you last, Mr. Pickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly not, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, who had been flashing forth\r\nlooks of fierce indignation, without producing the smallest effect on\r\neither of the sharp practitioners; \xe2\x80\x98I believe I am not, Sir. I have been\r\npersecuted and annoyed by scoundrels of late, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerker coughed violently, and asked Mr. Pickwick whether he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to look at the morning paper. To which inquiry Mr. Pickwick\r\nreturned a most decided negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, \xe2\x80\x98I dare say you have been annoyed in the Fleet;\r\nthere are some odd gentry there. Whereabouts were your apartments, Mr.\r\nPickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My one room,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that much-injured gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98was on the coffee-\r\nroom flight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson. \xe2\x80\x98I believe that is a very pleasant part of\r\nthe establishment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick drily.\r\n\r\nThere was a coolness about all this, which, to a gentleman of an\r\nexcitable temperament, had, under the circumstances, rather an\r\nexasperating tendency. Mr. Pickwick restrained his wrath by gigantic\r\nefforts; but when Perker wrote a cheque for the whole amount, and Fogg\r\ndeposited it in a small pocket-book, with a triumphant smile playing\r\nover his pimply features, which communicated itself likewise to the\r\nstern countenance of Dodson, he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling\r\nwith indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr. Dodson,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, putting up the pocket-book and drawing on\r\nhis gloves, \xe2\x80\x98I am at your service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, rising; \xe2\x80\x98I am quite ready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very happy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, softened by the cheque, \xe2\x80\x98to have had the\r\npleasure of making Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance. I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nquite so ill of us, Mr. Pickwick, as when we first had the pleasure of\r\nseeing you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, with the high tone of calumniated virtue.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick now knows us better, I trust; whatever your opinion of\r\ngentlemen of our profession may be, I beg to assure you, sir, that I\r\nbear no ill-will or vindictive feeling towards you for the sentiments\r\nyou thought proper to express in our office in Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Court,\r\nCornhill, on the occasion to which my partner has referred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, no; nor I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, in a most forgiving manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our conduct, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, \xe2\x80\x98will speak for itself, and justify\r\nitself, I hope, upon every occasion. We have been in the profession some\r\nyears, Mr. Pickwick, and have been honoured with the confidence of many\r\nexcellent clients. I wish you good-morning, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-morning, Mr. Pickwick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg. So saying, he put his umbrella\r\nunder his arm, drew off his right glove, and extended the hand of\r\nreconciliation to that most indignant gentleman; who, thereupon, thrust\r\nhis hands beneath his coat tails, and eyed the attorney with looks of\r\nscornful amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lowten!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Perker, at this moment. \xe2\x80\x98Open the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait one instant,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Perker, I _will _speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sir, pray let the matter rest where it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little\r\nattorney, who had been in a state of nervous apprehension during the\r\nwhole interview; \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, I beg--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not be put down, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick hastily. \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nDodson, you have addressed some remarks to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDodson turned round, bent his head meekly, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some remarks to me,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Pickwick, almost breathless; \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nyour partner has tendered me his hand, and you have both assumed a tone\r\nof forgiveness and high-mindedness, which is an extent of impudence that\r\nI was not prepared for, even in you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Dodson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 reiterated Fogg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know that I have been the victim of your plots and\r\nconspiracies?\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know that I am the man\r\nwhom you have been imprisoning and robbing? Do you know that you were\r\nthe attorneys for the plaintiff, in Bardell and Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, we do know it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Dodson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course we know it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Fogg, slapping his pocket--perhaps\r\nby accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see that you recollect it with satisfaction,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nattempting to call up a sneer for the first time in his life, and\r\nfailing most signally in so doing. \xe2\x80\x98Although I have long been anxious to\r\ntell you, in plain terms, what my opinion of you is, I should have let\r\neven this opportunity pass, in deference to my friend Perker\xe2\x80\x99s wishes,\r\nbut for the unwarrantable tone you have assumed, and your insolent\r\nfamiliarity. I say insolent familiarity, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick,\r\nturning upon Fogg with a fierceness of gesture which caused that person\r\nto retreat towards the door with great expedition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, who, though he was the biggest man of the\r\nparty, had prudently entrenched himself behind Fogg, and was speaking\r\nover his head with a very pale face. \xe2\x80\x98Let him assault you, Mr. Fogg;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t return it on any account.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t return it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg, falling back a little more as he\r\nspoke; to the evident relief of his partner, who by these means was\r\ngradually getting into the outer office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, resuming the thread of his discourse-\r\n-\xe2\x80\x99you are a well-matched pair of mean, rascally, pettifogging robbers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Perker, \xe2\x80\x98is that all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is all summed up in that,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98they are mean,\r\nrascally, pettifogging robbers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, in a most conciliatory tone. \xe2\x80\x98My dear sirs, he has\r\nsaid all he has to say. Now pray go. Lowten, is that door open?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Lowten, with a distant giggle, replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, there--good-morning--good-morning--now pray, my dear sirs--Mr.\r\nLowten, the door!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the little man, pushing Dodson & Fogg, nothing\r\nloath, out of the office; \xe2\x80\x98this way, my dear sirs--now pray don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprolong this--Dear me--Mr. Lowten--the door, sir--why don\xe2\x80\x99t you attend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If there\xe2\x80\x99s law in England, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dodson, looking towards Mr.\r\nPickwick, as he put on his hat, \xe2\x80\x98you shall smart for this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a couple of mean--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remember, sir, you pay dearly for this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fogg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Rascally, pettifogging robbers!\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Pickwick, taking not\r\nthe least notice of the threats that were addressed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Robbers!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Pickwick, running to the stair-head, as the two\r\nattorneys descended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Robbers!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Mr. Pickwick, breaking from Lowten and Perker, and\r\nthrusting his head out of the staircase window.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pickwick drew in his head again, his countenance was smiling\r\nand placid; and, walking quietly back into the office, he declared that\r\nhe had now removed a great weight from his mind, and that he felt\r\nperfectly comfortable and happy.\r\n\r\nPerker said nothing at all until he had emptied his snuff-box, and sent\r\nLowten out to fill it, when he was seized with a fit of laughing, which\r\nlasted five minutes; at the expiration of which time he said that he\r\nsupposed he ought to be very angry, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of the\r\nbusiness seriously yet--when he could, he would be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98let me have a settlement with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOf the same kind as the last?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Perker, with another laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Pickwick, drawing out his pocket-book, and\r\nshaking the little man heartily by the hand, \xe2\x80\x98I only mean a pecuniary\r\nsettlement. You have done me many acts of kindness that I can never\r\nrepay, and have no wish to repay, for I prefer continuing the\r\nobligation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this preface, the two friends dived into some very complicated\r\naccounts and vouchers, which, having been duly displayed and gone\r\nthrough by Perker, were at once discharged by Mr. Pickwick with many\r\nprofessions of esteem and friendship.\r\n\r\nThey had no sooner arrived at this point, than a most violent and\r\nstartling knocking was heard at the door; it was not an ordinary double-\r\nknock, but a constant and uninterrupted succession of the loudest single\r\nraps, as if the knocker were endowed with the perpetual motion, or the\r\nperson outside had forgotten to leave off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Perker, starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it is a knock at the door,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, as if there\r\ncould be the smallest doubt of the fact.\r\n\r\nThe knocker made a more energetic reply than words could have yielded,\r\nfor it continued to hammer with surprising force and noise, without a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s cessation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, ringing his bell, \xe2\x80\x98we shall alarm the inn. Mr.\r\nLowten, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear a knock?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer the door in one moment, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe knocker appeared to hear the response, and to assert that it was\r\nquite impossible he could wait so long. It made a stupendous uproar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s quite dreadful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, stopping his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Make haste, Mr. Lowten,\xe2\x80\x99 Perker called out; \xe2\x80\x98we shall have the panels\r\nbeaten in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Lowten, who was washing his hands in a dark closet, hurried to the\r\ndoor, and turning the handle, beheld the appearance which is described\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV. CONTAINING SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE DOUBLE KNOCK,\r\nAND OTHER MATTERS: AMONG WHICH CERTAIN INTERESTING DISCLOSURES RELATIVE\r\nTO MR. SNODGRASS AND A YOUNG LADY ARE BY NO MEANS IRRELEVANT TO THIS\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nThe object that presented itself to the eyes of the astonished clerk,\r\nwas a boy--a wonderfully fat boy--habited as a serving lad, standing\r\nupright on the mat, with his eyes closed as if in sleep. He had never\r\nseen such a fat boy, in or out of a travelling caravan; and this,\r\ncoupled with the calmness and repose of his appearance, so very\r\ndifferent from what was reasonably to have been expected of the\r\ninflicter of such knocks, smote him with wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary boy replied not a word; but he nodded once, and\r\nseemed, to the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, to snore feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where do you come from?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe boy made no sign. He breathed heavily, but in all other respects was\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nThe clerk repeated the question thrice, and receiving no answer,\r\nprepared to shut the door, when the boy suddenly opened his eyes, winked\r\nseveral times, sneezed once, and raised his hand as if to repeat the\r\nknocking. Finding the door open, he stared about him with astonishment,\r\nand at length fixed his eyes on Mr. Lowten\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What the devil do you knock in that way for?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the clerk\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which way?\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, in a slow and sleepy voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, like forty hackney-coachmen,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because master said, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to leave off knocking till they opened\r\nthe door, for fear I should go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk, \xe2\x80\x98what message have you brought?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s downstairs,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Master. He wants to know whether you\xe2\x80\x99re at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Lowten bethought himself, at this juncture, of looking out of the\r\nwindow. Seeing an open carriage with a hearty old gentleman in it,\r\nlooking up very anxiously, he ventured to beckon him; on which, the old\r\ngentleman jumped out directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s your master in the carriage, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lowten.\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded.\r\n\r\nAll further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old Wardle,\r\nwho, running upstairs and just recognising Lowten, passed at once into\r\nMr. Perker\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pickwick!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Your hand, my boy! Why have I never\r\nheard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be\r\ncooped up in jail? And why did you let him do it, Perker?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker, with a smile and a\r\npinch of snuff; \xe2\x80\x98you know how obstinate he is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I do; of course I do,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nheartily glad to see him, notwithstanding. I will not lose sight of him\r\nagain, in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, Wardle shook Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hand once more, and,\r\nhaving done the same by Perker, threw himself into an arm-chair, his\r\njolly red face shining again with smiles and health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Here are pretty goings on--a pinch of your snuff,\r\nPerker, my boy--never were such times, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mean!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Why, I think the girls are all running mad;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s no news, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say? Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not; but it\xe2\x80\x99s true, for all\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not come up to London, of all places in the world, to tell us\r\nthat, my dear Sir, have you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not altogether,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98though it was the main cause of\r\nmy coming. How\xe2\x80\x99s Arabella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98and will be delighted to see you, I\r\nam sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Black-eyed little jilt!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98I had a great idea of\r\nmarrying her myself, one of these odd days. But I am glad of it too,\r\nvery glad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did the intelligence reach you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it came to my girls, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Arabella wrote,\r\nthe day before yesterday, to say she had made a stolen match without her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s consent, and so you had gone down to get it when his\r\nrefusing it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent the match, and all the rest of it. I\r\nthought it a very good time to say something serious to my girls; so I\r\nsaid what a dreadful thing it was that children should marry without\r\ntheir parents\xe2\x80\x99 consent, and so forth; but, bless your hearts, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake the least impression upon them. They thought it such a much more\r\ndreadful thing that there should have been a wedding without\r\nbridesmaids, that I might as well have preached to Joe himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the old gentleman stopped to laugh; and having done so to his\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s content, presently resumed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this is not the best of it, it seems. This is only half the love-\r\nmaking and plotting that have been going forward. We have been walking\r\non mines for the last six months, and they\xe2\x80\x99re sprung at last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning pale; \xe2\x80\x98no other\r\nsecret marriage, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied old Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98not so bad as that; no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What then?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98am I interested in it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I answer that question, Perker?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you don\xe2\x80\x99t commit yourself by doing so, my dear Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then, you are,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Pickwick anxiously. \xe2\x80\x98In what way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re such a fiery sort of a young fellow\r\nthat I am almost afraid to tell you; but, however, if Perker will sit\r\nbetween us to prevent mischief, I\xe2\x80\x99ll venture.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving closed the room door, and fortified himself with another\r\napplication to Perker\xe2\x80\x99s snuff-box, the old gentleman proceeded with his\r\ngreat disclosure in these words--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact is, that my daughter Bella--Bella, who married young Trundle,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, we know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t alarm me at the very beginning. My daughter Bella--Emily having\r\ngone to bed with a headache after she had read Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s letter to me--\r\nsat herself down by my side the other evening, and began to talk over\r\nthis marriage affair. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, pa,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s all very well; I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nthe best.\xe2\x80\x9d I answered in this way because I was sitting before the fire\r\nat the time, drinking my grog rather thoughtfully, and I knew my\r\nthrowing in an undecided word now and then, would induce her to continue\r\ntalking. Both my girls are pictures of their dear mother, and as I grow\r\nold I like to sit with only them by me; for their voices and looks carry\r\nme back to the happiest period of my life, and make me, for the moment,\r\nas young as I used to be then, though not quite so light-hearted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite a marriage of affection, pa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bella, after a short silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut such marriages do not always turn out the\r\nhappiest.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I question that, mind!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Pickwick warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98question anything you like when it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour turn to speak, but don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Granted,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear you express your opinion\r\nagainst marriages of affection, pa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bella, colouring a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas wrong; I ought not to have said so, my dear, either,\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\npatting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor your mother\xe2\x80\x99s was one, and so was yours.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that I meant,\r\npa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bella. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, pa, I wanted to speak to you about\r\nEmily.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Wardle, stopping in his narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Pray go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never could spin out a story,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle abruptly. \xe2\x80\x98It must come\r\nout, sooner or later, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll save us all a great deal of time if it\r\ncomes at once. The long and the short of it is, then, that Bella at last\r\nmustered up courage to tell me that Emily was very unhappy; that she and\r\nyour young friend Snodgrass had been in constant correspondence and\r\ncommunication ever since last Christmas; that she had very dutifully\r\nmade up her mind to run away with him, in laudable imitation of her old\r\nfriend and school-fellow; but that having some compunctions of\r\nconscience on the subject, inasmuch as I had always been rather kindly\r\ndisposed to both of them, they had thought it better in the first\r\ninstance to pay me the compliment of asking whether I would have any\r\nobjection to their being married in the usual matter-of-fact manner.\r\nThere now, Mr. Pickwick, if you can make it convenient to reduce your\r\neyes to their usual size again, and to let me hear what you think we\r\nought to do, I shall feel rather obliged to you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe testy manner in which the hearty old gentleman uttered this last\r\nsentence was not wholly unwarranted; for Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s face had settled\r\ndown into an expression of blank amazement and perplexity, quite curious\r\nto behold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Snodgrass!--since last Christmas!\xe2\x80\x99 were the first broken words that\r\nissued from the lips of the confounded gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since last Christmas,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s plain enough, and very\r\nbad spectacles we must have worn, not to have discovered it before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, ruminating; \xe2\x80\x98I cannot really\r\nunderstand it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to understand it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the choleric old gentleman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you had been a younger man, you would have been in the secret long\r\nago; and besides,\xe2\x80\x99 added Wardle, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, \xe2\x80\x98the truth\r\nis, that, knowing nothing of this matter, I have rather pressed Emily\r\nfor four or five months past, to receive favourably (if she could; I\r\nwould never attempt to force a girl\xe2\x80\x99s inclinations) the addresses of a\r\nyoung gentleman down in our neighbourhood. I have no doubt that, girl-\r\nlike, to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nshe has represented this matter in very glowing colours, and that they\r\nhave both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly-persecuted\r\npair of unfortunates, and have no resource but clandestine matrimony, or\r\ncharcoal. Now the question is, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have _you _done?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_I!_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean what did you do when your married daughter told you this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I made a fool of myself of course,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Perker, who had accompanied this dialogue with\r\nsundry twitchings of his watch-chain, vindictive rubbings of his nose,\r\nand other symptoms of impatience. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s very natural; but how?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went into a great passion and frightened my mother into a fit,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nWardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was judicious,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Perker; \xe2\x80\x98and what else?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fretted and fumed all next day, and raised a great disturbance,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrejoined the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98At last I got tired of rendering myself\r\nunpleasant and making everybody miserable; so I hired a carriage at\r\nMuggleton, and, putting my own horses in it, came up to town, under\r\npretence of bringing Emily to see Arabella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Wardle is with you, then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure she is,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98She is at Osborne\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel in the\r\nAdelphi at this moment, unless your enterprising friend has run away\r\nwith her since I came out this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are reconciled then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Wardle; \xe2\x80\x98she has been crying and moping ever\r\nsince, except last night, between tea and supper, when she made a great\r\nparade of writing a letter that I pretended to take no notice of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want my advice in this matter, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, looking\r\nfrom the musing face of Mr. Pickwick to the eager countenance of Wardle,\r\nand taking several consecutive pinches of his favourite stimulant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, looking at Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Perker, rising and pushing his chair back, \xe2\x80\x98my advice\r\nis, that you both walk away together, or ride away, or get away by some\r\nmeans or other, for I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of you, and just talk this matter over\r\nbetween you. If you have not settled it by the next time I see you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you what to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, hardly knowing whether to smile or\r\nbe offended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Perker. \xe2\x80\x98I know you both a great\r\ndeal better than you know yourselves. You have settled it already, to\r\nall intents and purposes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus expressing himself, the little gentleman poked his snuff-box first\r\ninto the chest of Mr. Pickwick, and then into the waistcoat of Mr.\r\nWardle, upon which they all three laughed, especially the two last-named\r\ngentlemen, who at once shook hands again, without any obvious or\r\nparticular reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You dine with me to-day,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle to Perker, as he showed them out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t promise, my dear Sir, can\xe2\x80\x99t promise,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Perker. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll look\r\nin, in the evening, at all events.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall expect you at five,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Now, Joe!\xe2\x80\x99 And Joe having\r\nbeen at length awakened, the two friends departed in Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarriage, which in common humanity had a dickey behind for the fat boy,\r\nwho, if there had been a footboard instead, would have rolled off and\r\nkilled himself in his very first nap.\r\n\r\nDriving to the George and Vulture, they found that Arabella and her maid\r\nhad sent for a hackney-coach immediately on the receipt of a short note\r\nfrom Emily announcing her arrival in town, and had proceeded straight to\r\nthe Adelphi. As Wardle had business to transact in the city, they sent\r\nthe carriage and the fat boy to his hotel, with the information that he\r\nand Mr. Pickwick would return together to dinner at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nCharged with this message, the fat boy returned, slumbering as peaceably\r\nin his dickey, over the stones, as if it had been a down bed on watch\r\nsprings. By some extraordinary miracle he awoke of his own accord, when\r\nthe coach stopped, and giving himself a good shake to stir up his\r\nfaculties, went upstairs to execute his commission.\r\n\r\nNow, whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s faculties together,\r\ninstead of arranging them in proper order, or had roused such a quantity\r\nof new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and\r\nceremonies, or (which is also possible) had proved unsuccessful in\r\npreventing his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs, it is an\r\nundoubted fact that he walked into the sitting-room without previously\r\nknocking at the door; and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping\r\nhis young mistress\xe2\x80\x99s waist, sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa,\r\nwhile Arabella and her pretty handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking\r\nout of a window at the other end of the room. At the sight of this\r\nphenomenon, the fat boy uttered an interjection, the ladies a scream,\r\nand the gentleman an oath, almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wretched creature, what do you want here?\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, who it\r\nis needless to say was Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\nTo this the fat boy, considerably terrified, briefly responded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Missis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want me for,\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Emily, turning her head aside, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nstupid creature?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Master and Mr. Pickwick is a-going to dine here at five,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the\r\nfat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave the room!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, glaring upon the bewildered youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 added Emily hastily. \xe2\x80\x98Bella, dear, advise me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUpon this, Emily and Mr. Snodgrass, and Arabella and Mary, crowded into\r\na corner, and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes, during\r\nwhich the fat boy dozed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, at length, looking round with a most bewitching\r\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x98how do you do, Joe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a very good boy; I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget you, Joe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Snodgrass, advancing to the astonished youth, and\r\nseizing his hand, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you before. There\xe2\x80\x99s five shillings for\r\nyou, Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll owe you five, Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, \xe2\x80\x98for old acquaintance sake, you\r\nknow;\xe2\x80\x99 and another most captivating smile was bestowed upon the\r\ncorpulent intruder.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s perception being slow, he looked rather puzzled at first\r\nto account for this sudden prepossession in his favour, and stared about\r\nhim in a very alarming manner. At length his broad face began to show\r\nsymptoms of a grin of proportionately broad dimensions; and then,\r\nthrusting half-a-crown into each of his pockets, and a hand and wrist\r\nafter it, he burst into a horse laugh: being for the first and only time\r\nin his existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He understands us, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He had better have something to eat, immediately,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Emily.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy almost laughed again when he heard this suggestion. Mary,\r\nafter a little more whispering, tripped forth from the group and said--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going to dine with you to-day, sir, if you have no objection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This way,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy eagerly. \xe2\x80\x98There is such a jolly meat-pie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, the fat boy led the way downstairs; his pretty\r\ncompanion captivating all the waiters and angering all the chambermaids\r\nas she followed him to the eating-room.\r\n\r\nThere was the meat-pie of which the youth had spoken so feelingly, and\r\nthere were, moreover, a steak, and a dish of potatoes, and a pot of\r\nporter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my eye, how prime! I am _so_ hungry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving apostrophised his eye, in a species of rapture, five or six\r\ntimes, the youth took the head of the little table, and Mary seated\r\nherself at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you have some of this?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy, plunging into the pie up\r\nto the very ferules of the knife and fork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A little, if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mary.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy assisted Mary to a little, and himself to a great deal, and\r\nwas just going to begin eating when he suddenly laid down his knife and\r\nfork, leaned forward in his chair, and letting his hands, with the knife\r\nand fork in them, fall on his knees, said, very slowly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say! How nice you look!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was said in an admiring manner, and was, so far, gratifying; but\r\nstill there was enough of the cannibal in the young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to\r\nrender the compliment a double one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, affecting to blush, \xe2\x80\x98what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy, gradually recovering his former position, replied with a\r\nheavy sigh, and, remaining thoughtful for a few moments, drank a long\r\ndraught of the porter. Having achieved this feat, he sighed again, and\r\napplied himself assiduously to the pie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a nice young lady Miss Emily is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, after a long silence.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy had by this time finished the pie. He fixed his eyes on\r\nMary, and replied--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knows a nicerer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat boy, with unwonted vivacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s her name?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So\xe2\x80\x99s hers,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re her.\xe2\x80\x99 The boy grinned to add\r\npoint to the compliment, and put his eyes into something between a\r\nsquint and a cast, which there is reason to believe he intended for an\r\nogle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me in that way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary; \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t I, though?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat boy. \xe2\x80\x98I say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you going to come here regular?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mary, shaking her head, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going away again to-night.\r\nWhy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy, in a tone of strong feeling; \xe2\x80\x98how we should have\r\nenjoyed ourselves at meals, if you had been!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I might come here sometimes, perhaps, to see you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, plaiting\r\nthe table-cloth in assumed coyness, \xe2\x80\x98if you would do me a favour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy looked from the pie-dish to the steak, as if he thought a\r\nfavour must be in a manner connected with something to eat; and then\r\ntook out one of the half-crowns and glanced at it nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand me?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, looking slily in his fat face.\r\n\r\nAgain he looked at the half-crown, and said faintly, \xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The ladies want you not to say anything to the old gentleman about the\r\nyoung gentleman having been upstairs; and I want you too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that all?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy, evidently very much relieved, as he\r\npocketed the half-crown again. \xe2\x80\x98Of course I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Snodgrass is very fond of Miss Emily, and\r\nMiss Emily\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of him, and if you were to tell about it, the old\r\ngentleman would carry you all away miles into the country, where you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsee nobody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy stoutly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary. \xe2\x80\x98Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time I went upstairs, and got my\r\nlady ready for dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go yet,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mary. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, for the present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy, with elephantine playfulness, stretched out his arms to\r\nravish a kiss; but as it required no great agility to elude him, his\r\nfair enslaver had vanished before he closed them again; upon which the\r\napathetic youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental\r\ncountenance, and fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to say upstairs, and there were so many plans to\r\nconcert for elopement and matrimony in the event of old Wardle\r\ncontinuing to be cruel, that it wanted only half an hour of dinner when\r\nMr. Snodgrass took his final adieu. The ladies ran to Emily\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom to\r\ndress, and the lover, taking up his hat, walked out of the room. He had\r\nscarcely got outside the door, when he heard Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s voice talking\r\nloudly, and looking over the banisters beheld him, followed by some\r\nother gentlemen, coming straight upstairs. Knowing nothing of the house,\r\nMr. Snodgrass in his confusion stepped hastily back into the room he had\r\njust quitted, and passing thence into an inner apartment (Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedchamber), closed the door softly, just as the persons he had caught a\r\nglimpse of entered the sitting-room. These were Mr. Wardle, Mr.\r\nPickwick, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, and Mr. Benjamin Allen, whom he had no\r\ndifficulty in recognising by their voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very lucky I had the presence of mind to avoid them,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr.\r\nSnodgrass with a smile, and walking on tiptoe to another door near the\r\nbedside; \xe2\x80\x98this opens into the same passage, and I can walk quietly and\r\ncomfortably away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably away,\r\nwhich was that the door was locked and the key gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us have some of your best wine to-day, waiter,\xe2\x80\x99 said old Wardle,\r\nrubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall have some of the very best, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let the ladies know we have come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDevoutly and ardently did Mr. Snodgrass wish that the ladies could know\r\nhe had come in. He ventured once to whisper, \xe2\x80\x98Waiter!\xe2\x80\x99 through the\r\nkeyhole, but the probability of the wrong waiter coming to his relief,\r\nflashed upon his mind, together with a sense of the strong resemblance\r\nbetween his own situation and that in which another gentleman had been\r\nrecently found in a neighbouring hotel (an account of whose misfortunes\r\nhad appeared under the head of \xe2\x80\x98Police\xe2\x80\x99 in that morning\xe2\x80\x99s paper), he sat\r\nhimself on a portmanteau, and trembled violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We won\xe2\x80\x99t wait a minute for Perker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, looking at his watch;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98he is always exact. He will be here, in time, if he means to come; and\r\nif he does not, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use waiting. Ha! Arabella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My sister!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Benjamin Allen, folding her in a most\r\nromantic embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Ben, dear, how you do smell of tobacco,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, rather\r\novercome by this mark of affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Benjamin Allen. \xe2\x80\x98Do I, Bella? Well, perhaps I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps he did, having just left a pleasant little smoking-party of\r\ntwelve medical students, in a small back parlour with a large fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I am delighted to see you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ben Allen. \xe2\x80\x98Bless you, Bella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, bending forward to kiss her brother; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nhold of me again, Ben, dear, because you tumble me so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this point of the reconciliation, Mr. Ben Allen allowed his feelings\r\nand the cigars and porter to overcome him, and looked round upon the\r\nbeholders with damp spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is nothing to be said to me?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wardle, with open arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A great deal,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Arabella, as she received the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhearty caress and congratulation. \xe2\x80\x98You are a hard-hearted, unfeeling,\r\ncruel monster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a little rebel,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wardle, in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x98and I am\r\nafraid I shall be obliged to forbid you the house. People like you, who\r\nget married in spite of everybody, ought not to be let loose on society.\r\nBut come!\xe2\x80\x99 added the old gentleman aloud, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s the dinner; you shall\r\nsit by me. Joe; why, damn the boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s awake!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo the great distress of his master, the fat boy was indeed in a state\r\nof remarkable vigilance, his eyes being wide open, and looking as if\r\nthey intended to remain so. There was an alacrity in his manner, too,\r\nwhich was equally unaccountable; every time his eyes met those of Emily\r\nor Arabella, he smirked and grinned; once, Wardle could have sworn, he\r\nsaw him wink.\r\n\r\nThis alteration in the fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour originated in his increased\r\nsense of his own importance, and the dignity he acquired from having\r\nbeen taken into the confidence of the young ladies; and the smirks, and\r\ngrins, and winks were so many condescending assurances that they might\r\ndepend upon his fidelity. As these tokens were rather calculated to\r\nawaken suspicion than allay it, and were somewhat embarrassing besides,\r\nthey were occasionally answered by a frown or shake of the head from\r\nArabella, which the fat boy, considering as hints to be on his guard,\r\nexpressed his perfect understanding of, by smirking, grinning, and\r\nwinking, with redoubled assiduity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Wardle, after an unsuccessful search in all his pockets,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98is my snuff-box on the sofa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I recollect; I left it on my dressing-table this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nWardle. \xe2\x80\x98Run into the next room and fetch it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy went into the next room; and, having been absent about a\r\nminute, returned with the snuff-box, and the palest face that ever a fat\r\nboy wore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the boy?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothen\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Joe nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you been seeing any spirits?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or taking any?\xe2\x80\x99 added Ben Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Wardle across the table. \xe2\x80\x98He is\r\nintoxicated, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBen Allen replied that he thought he was; and, as that gentleman had\r\nseen a vast deal of the disease in question, Wardle was confirmed in an\r\nimpression which had been hovering about his mind for half an hour, and\r\nat once arrived at the conclusion that the fat boy was drunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nshall soon find out whether he is or not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words with Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, that gentleman having implored him to make a private appeal\r\nto some friend to release him, and then pushed him out with the snuff-\r\nbox, lest his prolonged absence should lead to a discovery. He ruminated\r\na little with a most disturbed expression of face, and left the room in\r\nsearch of Mary.\r\n\r\nBut Mary had gone home after dressing her mistress, and the fat boy came\r\nback again more disturbed than before.\r\n\r\nWardle and Mr. Ben Allen exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you go away for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fat boy looked hopelessly in the face of everybody at table, and\r\nstammered out that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, eh? Take this cheese to Mr.\r\nPickwick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Pickwick being in the very best health and spirits, had been\r\nmaking himself perfectly delightful all dinner-time, and was at this\r\nmoment engaged in an energetic conversation with Emily and Mr. Winkle;\r\nbowing his head, courteously, in the emphasis of his discourse, gently\r\nwaving his left hand to lend force to his observations, and all glowing\r\nwith placid smiles. He took a piece of cheese from the plate, and was on\r\nthe point of turning round to renew the conversation, when the fat boy,\r\nstooping so as to bring his head on a level with that of Mr. Pickwick,\r\npointed with his thumb over his shoulder, and made the most horrible and\r\nhideous face that was ever seen out of a Christmas pantomime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, starting, \xe2\x80\x98what a very--Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 He stopped,\r\nfor the fat boy had drawn himself up, and was, or pretended to be, fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is such an extremely singular lad!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, looking\r\nuneasily at the boy. \xe2\x80\x98It seems an odd thing to say, but upon my word I\r\nam afraid that, at times, he is a little deranged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Mr. Pickwick, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t say so,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Emily and Arabella, both at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not certain, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, amidst profound\r\nsilence and looks of general dismay; \xe2\x80\x98but his manner to me this moment\r\nreally was very alarming. Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, suddenly jumping\r\nup with a short scream. \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, ladies, but at that moment\r\nhe ran some sharp instrument into my leg. Really, he is not safe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s drunk,\xe2\x80\x99 roared old Wardle passionately. \xe2\x80\x98Ring the bell! Call the\r\nwaiters! He\xe2\x80\x99s drunk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fat boy, falling on his knees as his master seized\r\nhim by the collar. \xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t drunk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you\xe2\x80\x99re mad; that\xe2\x80\x99s worse. Call the waiters,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t mad; I\xe2\x80\x99m sensible,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the fat boy, beginning to cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, what the devil did you run sharp instruments into Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegs for?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Wardle angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy. \xe2\x80\x98I wanted to speak to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you want to say?\xe2\x80\x99 asked half a dozen voices at once.\r\n\r\nThe fat boy gasped, looked at the bedroom door, gasped again, and wiped\r\ntwo tears away with the knuckle of each of his forefingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you want to say?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Wardle, shaking him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98allow me. What did you wish to communicate\r\nto me, my poor boy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to whisper to you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fat boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want to bite his ear off, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t come near\r\nhim; he\xe2\x80\x99s vicious; ring the bell, and let him be taken downstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJust as Mr. Winkle caught the bell-rope in his hand, it was arrested by\r\na general expression of astonishment; the captive lover, his face\r\nburning with confusion, suddenly walked in from the bedroom, and made a\r\ncomprehensive bow to the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wardle, releasing the fat boy\xe2\x80\x99s collar, and staggering\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been concealed in the next room, sir, since you returned,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexplained Mr. Snodgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Emily, my girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x98I detest meanness and\r\ndeceit; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deserve this at your hands, Emily, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear papa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily, \xe2\x80\x98Arabella knows--everybody here knows--Joe\r\nknows--that I was no party to this concealment. Augustus, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, explain it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Snodgrass, who had only waited for a hearing, at once recounted how\r\nhe had been placed in his then distressing predicament; how the fear of\r\ngiving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid Mr.\r\nWardle on his entrance; how he merely meant to depart by another door,\r\nbut, finding it locked, had been compelled to stay against his will. It\r\nwas a painful situation to be placed in; but he now regretted it the\r\nless, inasmuch as it afforded him an opportunity of acknowledging,\r\nbefore their mutual friends, that he loved Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s daughter deeply\r\nand sincerely; that he was proud to avow that the feeling was mutual;\r\nand that if thousands of miles were placed between them, or oceans\r\nrolled their waters, he could never for an instant forget those happy\r\ndays, when first--et cetera, et cetera.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself to this effect, Mr. Snodgrass bowed again,\r\nlooked into the crown of his hat, and stepped towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Wardle. \xe2\x80\x98Why, in the name of all that\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Inflammable,\xe2\x80\x99 mildly suggested Mr. Pickwick, who thought something\r\nworse was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--that\xe2\x80\x99s inflammable,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wardle, adopting the substitute;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say all this to me in the first instance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or confide in me?\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, taking up the defence, \xe2\x80\x98what is the use of\r\nasking all that now, especially when you know you had set your covetous\r\nold heart on a richer son-in-law, and are so wild and fierce besides,\r\nthat everybody is afraid of you, except me? Shake hands with him, and\r\norder him some dinner, for goodness gracious\xe2\x80\x99 sake, for he looks half\r\nstarved; and pray have your wine up at once, for you\xe2\x80\x99ll not be tolerable\r\nuntil you have taken two bottles at least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s ear, kissed her without the\r\nsmallest scruple, kissed his daughter also with great affection, and\r\nshook Mr. Snodgrass warmly by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is right on one point at all events,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman\r\ncheerfully. \xe2\x80\x98Ring for the wine!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wine came, and Perker came upstairs at the same moment. Mr.\r\nSnodgrass had dinner at a side table, and, when he had despatched it,\r\ndrew his chair next Emily, without the smallest opposition on the old\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\n\r\nThe evening was excellent. Little Mr. Perker came out wonderfully, told\r\nvarious comic stories, and sang a serious song which was almost as funny\r\nas the anecdotes. Arabella was very charming, Mr. Wardle very jovial,\r\nMr. Pickwick very harmonious, Mr. Ben Allen very uproarious, the lovers\r\nvery silent, Mr. Winkle very talkative, and all of them very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV. MR. SOLOMON PELL, ASSISTED BY A SELECT COMMITTEE OF\r\nCOACHMEN, ARRANGES THE AFFAIRS OF THE ELDER MR. WELLER\r\n\r\nSamivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, accosting his son on the morning after the\r\nfuneral, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve found it, Sammy. I thought it wos there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thought wot wos there?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s vill, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98In wirtue o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvich, them arrangements is to be made as I told you on, last night,\r\nrespectin\xe2\x80\x99 the funs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she tell you were it wos?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit on it, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98We wos a adjestin\xe2\x80\x99 our\r\nlittle differences, and I wos a-cheerin\xe2\x80\x99 her spirits and bearin\xe2\x80\x99 her up,\r\nso that I forgot to ask anythin\xe2\x80\x99 about it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I should ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndone it, indeed, if I had remembered it,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98for it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nrum sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing, Sammy, to go a-hankerin\xe2\x80\x99 arter anybody\xe2\x80\x99s property,\r\nven you\xe2\x80\x99re assistin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98em in illness.

She used to\r\nkeep bank-notes there, \xe2\x80\x98fore she vos married, Samivel. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her\r\ntake the lid off, to pay a bill, many and many a time. Poor creetur, she\r\nmight ha\xe2\x80\x99 filled all the tea-pots in the house vith vills, and not have\r\ninconwenienced herself neither, for she took wery little of anythin\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nthat vay lately, \xe2\x80\x98cept on the temperance nights, ven they just laid a\r\nfoundation o\xe2\x80\x99 tea to put the spirits atop on!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does it say?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jist vot I told you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined his parent. \xe2\x80\x98Two hundred pound\r\nvurth o\xe2\x80\x99 reduced counsels to my son-in-law, Samivel, and all the rest o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy property, of ev\xe2\x80\x99ry kind and description votsoever, to my husband, Mr.\r\nTony Veller, who I appint as my sole eggzekiter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98And I s\xe2\x80\x99pose as it\xe2\x80\x99s all right and\r\nsatisfactory to you and me as is the only parties interested, ve may as\r\nvell put this bit o\xe2\x80\x99 paper into the fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot are you a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 on, you lunatic?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, snatching the paper\r\naway, as his parent, in all innocence, stirred the fire preparatory to\r\nsuiting the action to the word. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a nice eggzekiter, you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vy not?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly round, with the poker in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vy not?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos it must be proved, and probated, and\r\nswore to, and all manner o\xe2\x80\x99 formalities.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, laying down the poker.\r\n\r\nSam buttoned the will carefully in a side pocket; intimating by a look,\r\nmeanwhile, that he did mean it, and very seriously too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you wot it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, after a short\r\nmeditation, \xe2\x80\x98this is a case for that \xe2\x80\x98ere confidential pal o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nChancellorship\xe2\x80\x99s.

Ve\xe2\x80\x99ll have this here brought afore the\r\nSolvent Court, directly, Samivel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never did see such a addle-headed old creetur!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam\r\nirritably; \xe2\x80\x98Old Baileys, and Solvent Courts, and alleybis, and ev\xe2\x80\x99ry\r\nspecies o\xe2\x80\x99 gammon alvays a-runnin\xe2\x80\x99 through his brain.

But mind this here, my boy, nobody\r\nbut Pell--nobody but Pell as a legal adwiser.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody else,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Now, are you a-comin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vait a minit, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, who, having tied his shawl\r\nwith the aid of a small glass that hung in the window, was now, by dint\r\nof the most wonderful exertions, struggling into his upper garments.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vait a minit\xe2\x80\x99 Sammy; ven you grow as old as your father, you von\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\ninto your veskit quite as easy as you do now, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into it easier than that, I\xe2\x80\x99m blessed if I\xe2\x80\x99d vear vun\r\nat all,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think so now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with the gravity of age, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find that as you get vider, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get viser. Vidth and visdom,\r\nSammy, alvays grows together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Weller delivered this infallible maxim--the result of many years\xe2\x80\x99\r\npersonal experience and observation--he contrived, by a dexterous twist\r\nof his body, to get the bottom button of his coat to perform its office.\r\nHaving paused a few seconds to recover breath, he brushed his hat with\r\nhis elbow, and declared himself ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As four heads is better than two, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, as they\r\ndrove along the London Road in the chaise-cart, \xe2\x80\x98and as all this here\r\nproperty is a wery great temptation to a legal gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n, ve\xe2\x80\x99ll take a\r\ncouple o\xe2\x80\x99 friends o\xe2\x80\x99 mine vith us, as\xe2\x80\x99ll be wery soon down upon him if\r\nhe comes anythin\xe2\x80\x99 irreg\xe2\x80\x99lar; two o\xe2\x80\x99 them as saw you to the Fleet that\r\nday. They\xe2\x80\x99re the wery best judges,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Weller, in a half-whisper-\r\n-\xe2\x80\x99the wery best judges of a horse, you ever know\xe2\x80\x99d.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And of a lawyer too?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man as can form a ackerate judgment of a animal, can form a\r\nackerate judgment of anythin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his father, so dogmatically,\r\nthat Sam did not attempt to controvert the position.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this notable resolution, the services of the mottled-\r\nfaced gentleman and of two other very fat coachmen--selected by Mr.\r\nWeller, probably, with a view to their width and consequent wisdom--were\r\nput into requisition; and this assistance having been secured, the party\r\nproceeded to the public-house in Portugal Street, whence a messenger was\r\ndespatched to the Insolvent Court over the way, requiring Mr. Solomon\r\nPell\xe2\x80\x99s immediate attendance.\r\n\r\nThe messenger fortunately found Mr. Solomon Pell in court, regaling\r\nhimself, business being rather slack, with a cold collation of an\r\nAbernethy biscuit and a saveloy. The message was no sooner whispered in\r\nhis ear than he thrust them in his pocket among various professional\r\ndocuments, and hurried over the way with such alacrity that he reached\r\nthe parlour before the messenger had even emancipated himself from the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell, touching his hat, \xe2\x80\x98my service to you all. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say it to flatter you, gentlemen, but there are not five other men\r\nin the world, that I\xe2\x80\x99d have come out of that court for, to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So busy, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Busy!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pell; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m completely sewn up, as my friend the late\r\nLord Chancellor many a time used to say to me, gentlemen, when he came\r\nout from hearing appeals in the House of Lords. Poor fellow; he was very\r\nsusceptible to fatigue; he used to feel those appeals uncommonly. I\r\nactually thought more than once that he\xe2\x80\x99d have sunk under \xe2\x80\x98em; I did,\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Pell shook his head and paused; on which, the elder Mr. Weller,\r\nnudging his neighbour, as begging him to mark the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s high\r\nconnections, asked whether the duties in question produced any permanent\r\nill effects on the constitution of his noble friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he ever quite recovered them,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pell; \xe2\x80\x98in fact I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure he never did. \xe2\x80\x9cPell,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say to me many a time, \xe2\x80\x9chow the\r\nblazes you can stand the head-work you do, is a mystery to me.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I used to answer, \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know how I do it, upon my life.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cPell,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he\xe2\x80\x99d add, sighing, and looking at me with a little envy--friendly envy,\r\nyou know, gentlemen, mere friendly envy; I never minded it--\xe2\x80\x9cPell,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a wonder; a wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d Ah! you\xe2\x80\x99d have liked him very much if you\r\nhad known him, gentlemen. Bring me three-penn\xe2\x80\x99orth of rum, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAddressing this latter remark to the waitress, in a tone of subdued\r\ngrief, Mr. Pell sighed, looked at his shoes and the ceiling; and, the\r\nrum having by that time arrived, drank it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, drawing a chair to the table, \xe2\x80\x98a professional man\r\nhas no right to think of his private friendships when his legal\r\nassistance is wanted. By the bye, gentlemen, since I saw you here\r\nbefore, we have had to weep over a very melancholy occurrence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pell drew out a pocket-handkerchief, when he came to the word weep,\r\nbut he made no further use of it than to wipe away a slight tinge of rum\r\nwhich hung upon his upper lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw it in the ADVERTISER, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Pell. \xe2\x80\x98Bless my\r\nsoul, not more than fifty-two! Dear me--only think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese indications of a musing spirit were addressed to the mottled-faced\r\nman, whose eyes Mr. Pell had accidentally caught; on which, the mottled-\r\nfaced man, whose apprehension of matters in general was of a foggy\r\nnature, moved uneasily in his seat, and opined that, indeed, so far as\r\nthat went, there was no saying how things was brought about; which\r\nobservation, involving one of those subtle propositions which it is\r\ndifficult to encounter in argument, was controverted by nobody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Pell, in a sympathising manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, she wos,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the elder Mr. Weller, not much relishing\r\nthis mode of discussing the subject, and yet thinking that the attorney,\r\nfrom his long intimacy with the late Lord Chancellor, must know best on\r\nall matters of polite breeding. \xe2\x80\x98She wos a wery fine \xe2\x80\x98ooman, sir, ven I\r\nfirst know\xe2\x80\x99d her. She wos a widder, sir, at that time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s curious,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, looking round with a sorrowful smile;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Pell was a widow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s very extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mottled-faced man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it is a curious coincidence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 gruffly remarked the elder Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98More widders is\r\nmarried than single wimin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, Mr. Weller. Mrs.\r\nPell was a very elegant and accomplished woman; her manners were the\r\ntheme of universal admiration in our neighbourhood. I was proud to see\r\nthat woman dance; there was something so firm and dignified, and yet\r\nnatural, in her motion. Her cutting, gentlemen, was simplicity itself.\r\nAh! well, well! Excuse my asking the question, Mr. Samuel,\xe2\x80\x99 continued\r\nthe attorney in a lower voice, \xe2\x80\x98was your mother-in-law tall?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not wery,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Pell was a tall figure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, \xe2\x80\x98a splendid woman, with a\r\nnoble shape, and a nose, gentlemen, formed to command and be majestic.\r\nShe was very much attached to me--very much--highly connected, too. Her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s brother, gentlemen, failed for eight hundred pounds, as a law\r\nstationer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, who had grown rather restless during this\r\ndiscussion, \xe2\x80\x98vith regard to bis\xe2\x80\x99ness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe word was music to Pell\xe2\x80\x99s ears. He had been revolving in his mind\r\nwhether any business was to be transacted, or whether he had been merely\r\ninvited to partake of a glass of brandy-and-water, or a bowl of punch,\r\nor any similar professional compliment, and now the doubt was set at\r\nrest without his appearing at all eager for its solution. His eyes\r\nglistened as he laid his hat on the table, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the business upon which--um? Either of these gentlemen wish to\r\ngo through the court? We require an arrest; a friendly arrest will do,\r\nyou know; we are all friends here, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me the dockyment, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, taking the will from\r\nhis son, who appeared to enjoy the interview amazingly. \xe2\x80\x98Wot we rekvire,\r\nsir, is a probe o\xe2\x80\x99 this here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Probate, my dear Sir, probate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller sharply, \xe2\x80\x98probe and probe it, is wery\r\nmuch the same; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand wot I mean, sir, I des-say I can\r\nfind them as does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No offence, I hope, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell meekly. \xe2\x80\x98You are the\r\nexecutor, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, casting his eyes over the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These other gentlemen, I presume, are legatees, are they?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired\r\nPell, with a congratulatory smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sammy is a leg-at-ease,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98these other gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n is\r\nfriends o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, just come to see fair; a kind of umpires.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, \xe2\x80\x98very good. I have no objections, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I shall\r\nwant a matter of five pound of you before I begin, ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt being decided by the committee that the five pound might be advanced,\r\nMr. Weller produced that sum; after which, a long consultation about\r\nnothing particular took place, in the course whereof Mr. Pell\r\ndemonstrated to the perfect satisfaction of the gentlemen who saw fair,\r\nthat unless the management of the business had been intrusted to him, it\r\nmust all have gone wrong, for reasons not clearly made out, but no doubt\r\nsufficient. This important point being despatched, Mr. Pell refreshed\r\nhimself with three chops, and liquids both malt and spirituous, at the\r\nexpense of the estate; and then they all went away to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was another visit to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons, and a great\r\nto-do with an attesting hostler, who, being inebriated, declined\r\nswearing anything but profane oaths, to the great scandal of a proctor\r\nand surrogate. Next week, there were more visits to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons,\r\nand there was a visit to the Legacy Duty Office besides, and there were\r\ntreaties entered into, for the disposal of the lease and business, and\r\nratifications of the same, and inventories to be made out, and lunches\r\nto be taken, and dinners to be eaten, and so many profitable things to\r\nbe done, and such a mass of papers accumulated that Mr. Solomon Pell,\r\nand the boy, and the blue bag to boot, all got so stout that scarcely\r\nanybody would have known them for the same man, boy, and bag, that had\r\nloitered about Portugal Street, a few days before.\r\n\r\nAt length all these weighty matters being arranged, a day was fixed for\r\nselling out and transferring the stock, and of waiting with that view\r\nupon Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, stock-broker, of somewhere near the bank,\r\nwho had been recommended by Mr. Solomon Pell for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind of festive occasion, and the parties were attired\r\naccordingly. Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s tops were newly cleaned, and his dress was\r\narranged with peculiar care; the mottled-faced gentleman wore at his\r\nbutton-hole a full-sized dahlia with several leaves; and the coats of\r\nhis two friends were adorned with nosegays of laurel and other\r\nevergreens. All three were habited in strict holiday costume; that is to\r\nsay, they were wrapped up to the chins, and wore as many clothes as\r\npossible, which is, and has been, a stage-coachman\xe2\x80\x99s idea of full dress\r\never since stage-coaches were invented.\r\n\r\nMr. Pell was waiting at the usual place of meeting at the appointed\r\ntime; even he wore a pair of gloves and a clean shirt, much frayed at\r\nthe collar and wristbands by frequent washings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A quarter to two,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, looking at the parlour clock. \xe2\x80\x98If we are\r\nwith Mr. Flasher at a quarter past, we shall just hit the best time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What should you say to a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 beer, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested the\r\nmottled-faced man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a little bit o\xe2\x80\x99 cold beef,\xe2\x80\x99 said the second coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or a oyster,\xe2\x80\x99 added the third, who was a hoarse gentleman, supported by\r\nvery round legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell; \xe2\x80\x98to congratulate Mr. Weller, on his coming into\r\npossession of his property, eh? Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m quite agreeable, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Sammy, pull the\r\nbell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSammy complied; and the porter, cold beef, and oysters being promptly\r\nproduced, the lunch was done ample justice to. Where everybody took so\r\nactive a part, it is almost invidious to make a distinction; but if one\r\nindividual evinced greater powers than another, it was the coachman with\r\nthe hoarse voice, who took an imperial pint of vinegar with his oysters,\r\nwithout betraying the least emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller, stirring a glass of brandy-\r\nand-water, of which one was placed before every gentleman when the\r\noyster shells were removed--\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pell, Sir, it wos my intention to have\r\nproposed the funs on this occasion, but Samivel has vispered to me--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Samuel Weller, who had silently eaten his oysters with tranquil\r\nsmiles, cried, \xe2\x80\x98Hear!\xe2\x80\x99 in a very loud voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Has vispered to me,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed his father, \xe2\x80\x98that it vould be better to\r\ndewote the liquor to vishin\xe2\x80\x99 you success and prosperity, and thankin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou for the manner in which you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought this here business through.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s your health, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold hard there,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the mottled-faced gentleman, with sudden\r\nenergy; \xe2\x80\x98your eyes on me, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x99n!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nSaying this, the mottled-faced gentleman rose, as did the other\r\ngentlemen. The mottled-faced gentleman reviewed the company, and slowly\r\nlifted his hand, upon which every man (including him of the mottled\r\ncountenance) drew a long breath, and lifted his tumbler to his lips. In\r\none instant, the mottled-faced gentleman depressed his hand again, and\r\nevery glass was set down empty. It is impossible to describe the\r\nthrilling effect produced by this striking ceremony. At once dignified,\r\nsolemn, and impressive, it combined every element of grandeur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pell, \xe2\x80\x98all I can say is, that such marks of\r\nconfidence must be very gratifying to a professional man. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto say anything that might appear egotistical, gentlemen, but I\xe2\x80\x99m very\r\nglad, for your own sakes, that you came to me; that\xe2\x80\x99s all. If you had\r\ngone to any low member of the profession, it\xe2\x80\x99s my firm conviction, and I\r\nassure you of it as a fact, that you would have found yourselves in\r\nQueer Street before this. I could have wished my noble friend had been\r\nalive to have seen my management of this case. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it out of\r\npride, but I think--However, gentlemen, I won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you with that.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m generally to be found here, gentlemen, but if I\xe2\x80\x99m not here, or over\r\nthe way, that\xe2\x80\x99s my address. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find my terms very cheap and\r\nreasonable, and no man attends more to his clients than I do, and I hope\r\nI know a little of my profession besides. If you have any opportunity of\r\nrecommending me to any of your friends, gentlemen, I shall be very much\r\nobliged to you, and so will they too, when they come to know me. Your\r\nhealths, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this expression of his feelings, Mr. Solomon Pell laid three small\r\nwritten cards before Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s friends, and, looking at the clock\r\nagain, feared it was time to be walking. Upon this hint Mr. Weller\r\nsettled the bill, and, issuing forth, the executor, legatee, attorney,\r\nand umpires, directed their steps towards the city.\r\n\r\nThe office of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, of the Stock Exchange, was in a\r\nfirst floor up a court behind the Bank of England; the house of Wilkins\r\nFlasher, Esquire, was at Brixton, Surrey; the horse and stanhope of\r\nWilkins Flasher, Esquire, were at an adjacent livery stable; the groom\r\nof Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was on his way to the West End to deliver\r\nsome game; the clerk of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, had gone to his\r\ndinner; and so Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, himself, cried, \xe2\x80\x98Come in,\xe2\x80\x99 when\r\nMr. Pell and his companions knocked at the counting-house door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-morning, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, bowing obsequiously. \xe2\x80\x98We want to make a\r\nlittle transfer, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, just come in, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Flasher. \xe2\x80\x98Sit down a minute; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nattend to you directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pell, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry. Take a chair, Mr.\r\nWeller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller took a chair, and Sam took a box, and the umpires took what\r\nthey could get, and looked at the almanac and one or two papers which\r\nwere wafered against the wall, with as much open-eyed reverence as if\r\nthey had been the finest efforts of the old masters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you half a dozen of claret on it; come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins\r\nFlasher, Esquire, resuming the conversation to which Mr. Pell\xe2\x80\x99s entrance\r\nhad caused a momentary interruption.\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to a very smart young gentleman who wore his hat on\r\nhis right whisker, and was lounging over the desk, killing flies with a\r\nruler. Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was balancing himself on two legs of an\r\noffice stool, spearing a wafer-box with a penknife, which he dropped\r\nevery now and then with great dexterity into the very centre of a small\r\nred wafer that was stuck outside. Both gentlemen had very open\r\nwaistcoats and very rolling collars, and very small boots, and very big\r\nrings, and very little watches, and very large guard-chains, and\r\nsymmetrical inexpressibles, and scented pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never bet half a dozen!\xe2\x80\x99 said the other gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a\r\ndozen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done, Simmery, done!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98P. P., mind,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. Wilkins Flasher, Esquire,\r\nentered it in a little book, with a gold pencil-case, and the other\r\ngentleman entered it also, in another little book with another gold\r\npencil-case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see there\xe2\x80\x99s a notice up this morning about Boffer,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr.\r\nSimmery. \xe2\x80\x98Poor devil, he\xe2\x80\x99s expelled the house!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you ten guineas to five, he cuts his throat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins\r\nFlasher, Esquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Simmery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop! I bar,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps he\r\nmay hang himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Simmery, pulling out the gold pencil-case\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve no objection to take you that way. Say, makes away with\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kills himself, in fact,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Simmery, putting it down. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFlasher--ten guineas\r\nto five, Boffer kills himself.\xe2\x80\x9d Within what time shall we say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A fortnight?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Con-found it, no,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Simmery, stopping for an instant to\r\nsmash a fly with the ruler. \xe2\x80\x98Say a week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Split the difference,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. \xe2\x80\x98Make it ten\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; ten days,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Simmery.\r\n\r\nSo it was entered down on the little books that Boffer was to kill\r\nhimself within ten days, or Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was to hand over\r\nto Frank Simmery, Esquire, the sum of ten guineas; and that if Boffer\r\ndid kill himself within that time, Frank Simmery, Esquire, would pay to\r\nWilkins Flasher, Esquire, five guineas, instead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry he has failed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. \xe2\x80\x98Capital\r\ndinners he gave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine port he had too,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Mr. Simmery. \xe2\x80\x98We are going to send our\r\nbutler to the sale to-morrow, to pick up some of that sixty-four.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The devil you are!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. \xe2\x80\x98My man\xe2\x80\x99s going too.\r\nFive guineas my man outbids your man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother entry was made in the little books, with the gold pencil-cases;\r\nand Mr. Simmery, having by this time killed all the flies and taken all\r\nthe bets, strolled away to the Stock Exchange to see what was going\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nWilkins Flasher, Esquire, now condescended to receive Mr. Solomon Pell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstructions, and having filled up some printed forms, requested the\r\nparty to follow him to the bank, which they did: Mr. Weller and his\r\nthree friends staring at all they beheld in unbounded astonishment, and\r\nSam encountering everything with a coolness which nothing could disturb.\r\n\r\nCrossing a courtyard which was all noise and bustle, and passing a\r\ncouple of porters who seemed dressed to match the red fire engine which\r\nwas wheeled away into a corner, they passed into an office where their\r\nbusiness was to be transacted, and where Pell and Mr. Flasher left them\r\nstanding for a few moments, while they went upstairs into the Will\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot place is this here?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered the mottled-faced gentleman to the\r\nelder Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the executor in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot are them gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men a-settin\xe2\x80\x99 behind the counters?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the hoarse\r\ncoachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Reduced counsels, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t they the\r\nreduced counsels, Samivel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose the reduced counsels is alive, do you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired\r\nSam, with some disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How should I know?\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98I thought they looked wery\r\nlike it. Wot are they, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clerks,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot are they all a-eatin\xe2\x80\x99 ham sangwidges for?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Cos it\xe2\x80\x99s in their dooty, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a part o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nsystem; they\xe2\x80\x99re alvays a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 it here, all day long!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller and his friends had scarcely had a moment to reflect upon\r\nthis singular regulation as connected with the monetary system of the\r\ncountry, when they were rejoined by Pell and Wilkins Flasher, Esquire,\r\nwho led them to a part of the counter above which was a round blackboard\r\nwith a large \xe2\x80\x98W.\xe2\x80\x99 on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s that for, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Weller, directing Pell\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nto the target in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first letter of the name of the deceased,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Pell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, turning round to the umpires, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomethin\xe2\x80\x99 wrong here. We\xe2\x80\x99s our letter--this won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe referees at once gave it as their decided opinion that the business\r\ncould not be legally proceeded with, under the letter W., and in all\r\nprobability it would have stood over for one day at least, had it not\r\nbeen for the prompt, though, at first sight, undutiful behaviour of Sam,\r\nwho, seizing his father by the skirt of the coat, dragged him to the\r\ncounter, and pinned him there, until he had affixed his signature to a\r\ncouple of instruments; which, from Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s habit of printing, was a\r\nwork of so much labour and time, that the officiating clerk peeled and\r\nate three Ribstone pippins while it was performing.\r\n\r\nAs the elder Mr. Weller insisted on selling out his portion forthwith,\r\nthey proceeded from the bank to the gate of the Stock Exchange, to which\r\nWilkins Flasher, Esquire, after a short absence, returned with a cheque\r\non Smith, Payne, & Smith, for five hundred and thirty pounds; that being\r\nthe money to which Mr. Weller, at the market price of the day, was\r\nentitled, in consideration of the balance of the second Mrs. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfunded savings. Sam\xe2\x80\x99s two hundred pounds stood transferred to his name,\r\nand Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, having been paid his commission, dropped\r\nthe money carelessly into his coat pocket, and lounged back to his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller was at first obstinately determined on cashing the cheque in\r\nnothing but sovereigns; but it being represented by the umpires that by\r\nso doing he must incur the expense of a small sack to carry them home\r\nin, he consented to receive the amount in five-pound notes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My son,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, as they came out of the banking-house--\xe2\x80\x98my\r\nson and me has a wery partickler engagement this arternoon, and I should\r\nlike to have this here bis\xe2\x80\x99ness settled out of hand, so let\xe2\x80\x99s jest go\r\nstraight avay someveres, vere ve can hordit the accounts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA quiet room was soon found, and the accounts were produced and audited.\r\nMr. Pell\xe2\x80\x99s bill was taxed by Sam, and some charges were disallowed by\r\nthe umpires; but, notwithstanding Mr. Pell\xe2\x80\x99s declaration, accompanied\r\nwith many solemn asseverations that they were really too hard upon him,\r\nit was by very many degrees the best professional job he had ever had,\r\nand one on which he boarded, lodged, and washed, for six months\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe umpires having partaken of a dram, shook hands and departed, as they\r\nhad to drive out of town that night. Mr. Solomon Pell, finding that\r\nnothing more was going forward, either in the eating or drinking way,\r\ntook a friendly leave, and Sam and his father were left alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, thrusting his pocket-book in his side pocket.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vith the bills for the lease, and that, there\xe2\x80\x99s eleven hundred and\r\neighty pound here. Now, Samivel, my boy, turn the horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads to the\r\nGeorge and Wulter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI. AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE TAKES PLACE BETWEEN MR. PICKWICK\r\nAND SAMUEL WELLER, AT WHICH HIS PARENT ASSISTS--AN OLD GENTLEMAN IN A\r\nSNUFF-COLOURED SUIT ARRIVES UNEXPECTEDLY\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was sitting alone, musing over many things, and thinking\r\namong other considerations how he could best provide for the young\r\ncouple whose present unsettled condition was matter of constant regret\r\nand anxiety to him, when Mary stepped lightly into the room, and,\r\nadvancing to the table, said, rather hastily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, if you please, Sir, Samuel is downstairs, and he says may his\r\nfather see you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, tripping towards the door again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam has not been here long, has he?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mary eagerly. \xe2\x80\x98He has only just come home. He is\r\nnot going to ask you for any more leave, Sir, he says.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary might have been conscious that she had communicated this last\r\nintelligence with more warmth than seemed actually necessary, or she\r\nmight have observed the good-humoured smile with which Mr. Pickwick\r\nregarded her, when she had finished speaking. She certainly held down\r\nher head, and examined the corner of a very smart little apron, with\r\nmore closeness than there appeared any absolute occasion for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell them they can come up at once, by all means,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nMary, apparently much relieved, hurried away with her message.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick took two or three turns up and down the room; and, rubbing\r\nhis chin with his left hand as he did so, appeared lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, at length in a kind but somewhat\r\nmelancholy tone, \xe2\x80\x98it is the best way in which I could reward him for his\r\nattachment and fidelity; let it be so, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name. It is the fate\r\nof a lonely old man, that those about him should form new and different\r\nattachments and leave him. I have no right to expect that it should be\r\notherwise with me. No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr. Pickwick more cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x98it\r\nwould be selfish and ungrateful. I ought to be happy to have an\r\nopportunity of providing for him so well. I am. Of course I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick had been so absorbed in these reflections, that a knock at\r\nthe door was three or four times repeated before he heard it. Hastily\r\nseating himself, and calling up his accustomed pleasant looks, he gave\r\nthe required permission, and Sam Weller entered, followed by his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad to see you back again, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98How do you do,\r\nMr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery hearty, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the widower; \xe2\x80\x98hope I see you well,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wanted to have a little bit o\xe2\x80\x99 conwersation with you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller, \xe2\x80\x98if you could spare me five minits or so, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Sam, give your father a chair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Samivel, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a cheer here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, bringing\r\none forward as he spoke; \xe2\x80\x98uncommon fine day it\xe2\x80\x99s been, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 added the\r\nold gentleman, laying his hat on the floor as he sat himself down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remarkably so, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98Very seasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seasonablest veather I ever see, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller. Here, the\r\nold gentleman was seized with a violent fit of coughing, which, being\r\nterminated, he nodded his head and winked and made several supplicatory\r\nand threatening gestures to his son, all of which Sam Weller steadily\r\nabstained from seeing.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick, perceiving that there was some embarrassment on the old\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s part, affected to be engaged in cutting the leaves of a book\r\nthat lay beside him, and waited patiently until Mr. Weller should arrive\r\nat the object of his visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never see sich a aggrawatin\xe2\x80\x99 boy as you are, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nWeller, looking indignantly at his son; \xe2\x80\x98never in all my born days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is he doing, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He von\xe2\x80\x99t begin, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller; \xe2\x80\x98he knows I ain\xe2\x80\x99t ekal to\r\nex-pressin\xe2\x80\x99 myself ven there\xe2\x80\x99s anythin\xe2\x80\x99 partickler to be done, and yet\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll stand and see me a-settin\xe2\x80\x99 here taking up your walable time, and\r\nmakin\xe2\x80\x99 a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar spectacle o\xe2\x80\x99 myself, rayther than help me out vith a\r\nsyllable. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t filial conduct, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, wiping his\r\nforehead; \xe2\x80\x98wery far from it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You said you\xe2\x80\x99d speak,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam; \xe2\x80\x98how should I know you wos done up\r\nat the wery beginnin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You might ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen I warn\xe2\x80\x99t able to start,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined his father; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\non the wrong side of the road, and backin\xe2\x80\x99 into the palin\xe2\x80\x99s, and all\r\nmanner of unpleasantness, and yet you von\xe2\x80\x99t put out a hand to help me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed on you, Samivel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact is, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with a slight bow, \xe2\x80\x98the gov\xe2\x80\x99nor\xe2\x80\x99s been a-\r\ndrawin\xe2\x80\x99 his money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, Samivel, wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, nodding his head with\r\na satisfied air, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to speak harsh to you, Sammy. Wery good.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the vay to begin. Come to the pint at once. Wery good indeed,\r\nSamivel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller nodded his head an extraordinary number of times, in the\r\nexcess of his gratification, and waited in a listening attitude for Sam\r\nto resume his statement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may sit down, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, apprehending that the\r\ninterview was likely to prove rather longer than he had expected.\r\n\r\nSam bowed again and sat down; his father looking round, he continued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gov\xe2\x80\x99nor, sir, has drawn out five hundred and thirty pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Reduced counsels,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller, senior, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It don\xe2\x80\x99t much matter vether it\xe2\x80\x99s reduced counsels, or wot not,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSam; \xe2\x80\x98five hundred and thirty pounds is the sum, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To vich sum, he has added for the house and bisness--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lease, good-vill, stock, and fixters,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As much as makes it,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Sam, \xe2\x80\x98altogether, eleven hundred and\r\neighty pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98I am delighted to hear it. I congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. Weller, on having done so well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vait a minit, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, raising his hand in a deprecatory\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x98Get on, Samivel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This here money,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, with a little hesitation, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s anxious to\r\nput someveres, vere he knows it\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wery anxious too,\r\nfor if he keeps it, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go a-lendin\xe2\x80\x99 it to somebody, or inwestin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nproperty in horses, or droppin\xe2\x80\x99 his pocket-book down an airy, or makin\xe2\x80\x99\r\na Egyptian mummy of his-self in some vay or another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr. Weller, in as complacent a manner as\r\nif Sam had been passing the highest eulogiums on his prudence and\r\nforesight. \xe2\x80\x98Wery good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For vich reasons,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Sam, plucking nervously at the brim of his\r\nhat--\xe2\x80\x98for vich reasons, he\xe2\x80\x99s drawn it out to-day, and come here vith me\r\nto say, leastvays to offer, or in other vords--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To say this here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder Mr. Weller impatiently, \xe2\x80\x98that it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t o\xe2\x80\x99 no use to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to vork a coach reg\xe2\x80\x99lar, and ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot noveres to keep it in, unless I vos to pay the guard for takin\xe2\x80\x99 care\r\non it, or to put it in vun o\xe2\x80\x99 the coach pockets, vich \xe2\x80\x98ud be a\r\ntemptation to the insides. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll take care on it for me, sir, I\r\nshall be wery much obliged to you. P\xe2\x80\x99raps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, walking up\r\nto Mr. Pickwick and whispering in his ear--\xe2\x80\x98p\xe2\x80\x99raps it\xe2\x80\x99ll go a little vay\r\ntowards the expenses o\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98ere conwiction. All I say is, just you\r\nkeep it till I ask you for it again.\xe2\x80\x99 With these words, Mr. Weller\r\nplaced the pocket-book in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s hands, caught up his hat, and\r\nran out of the room with a celerity scarcely to be expected from so\r\ncorpulent a subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop him, Sam!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98Overtake him; bring\r\nhim back instantly! Mr. Weller--here--come back!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSam saw that his master\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions were not to be disobeyed; and,\r\ncatching his father by the arm as he was descending the stairs, dragged\r\nhim back by main force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, taking the old man by the hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98your honest confidence overpowers me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see no occasion for nothin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the kind, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr.\r\nWeller obstinately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, my good friend, I have more money than I can ever need;\r\nfar more than a man at my age can ever live to spend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No man knows how much he can spend, till he tries,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr.\r\nWeller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98but as I have no intention of\r\ntrying any such experiments, I am not likely to come to want. I must beg\r\nyou to take this back, Mr. Weller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWery well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with a discontented look. \xe2\x80\x98Mark my vords,\r\nSammy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do somethin\xe2\x80\x99 desperate vith this here property; somethin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndesperate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller reflected for a short time, and then, buttoning up his coat\r\nwith great determination, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a pike.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wot!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A pike!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller, through his set teeth; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a pike.\r\nSay good-bye to your father, Samivel. I dewote the remainder of my days\r\nto a pike.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis threat was such an awful one, and Mr. Weller, besides appearing\r\nfully resolved to carry it into execution, seemed so deeply mortified by\r\nMr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s refusal, that that gentleman, after a short reflection,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, Mr. Weller, I will keep your money. I can do more good with\r\nit, perhaps, than you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just the wery thing, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, brightening up; \xe2\x80\x98o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncourse you can, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say no more about it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, locking the pocket-book in\r\nhis desk; \xe2\x80\x98I am heartily obliged to you, my good friend. Now sit down\r\nagain. I want to ask your advice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe internal laughter occasioned by the triumphant success of his visit,\r\nwhich had convulsed not only Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s face, but his arms, legs, and\r\nbody also, during the locking up of the pocket-book, suddenly gave place\r\nto the most dignified gravity as he heard these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait outside a few minutes, Sam, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nSam immediately withdrew.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller looked uncommonly wise and very much amazed, when Mr.\r\nPickwick opened the discourse by saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not an advocate for matrimony, I think, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller shook his head. He was wholly unable to speak; vague thoughts\r\nof some wicked widow having been successful in her designs on Mr.\r\nPickwick, choked his utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you happen to see a young girl downstairs when you came in just now\r\nwith your son?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I see a young gal,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you think of her, now? Candidly, Mr. Weller, what did you\r\nthink of her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought she wos wery plump, and vell made,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with a\r\ncritical air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So she is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98so she is. What did you think of her\r\nmanners, from what you saw of her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery pleasant,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mr. Weller. \xe2\x80\x98Wery pleasant and comformable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe precise meaning which Mr. Weller attached to this last-mentioned\r\nadjective, did not appear; but, as it was evident from the tone in which\r\nhe used it that it was a favourable expression, Mr. Pickwick was as well\r\nsatisfied as if he had been thoroughly enlightened on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I take a great interest in her, Mr. Weller,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller coughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean an interest in her doing well,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr. Pickwick; \xe2\x80\x98a desire\r\nthat she may be comfortable and prosperous. You understand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery clearly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Weller, who understood nothing yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That young person,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98is attached to your son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To Samivel Veller!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the parent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s nat\xe2\x80\x99ral,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, after some consideration, \xe2\x80\x98nat\xe2\x80\x99ral, but\r\nrayther alarmin\xe2\x80\x99. Sammy must be careful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery careful that he don\xe2\x80\x99t say nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to her,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Mr. Weller.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery careful that he ain\xe2\x80\x99t led avay, in a innocent moment, to say\r\nanythin\xe2\x80\x99 as may lead to a conwiction for breach. You\xe2\x80\x99re never safe vith\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em, Mr. Pickwick, ven they vunce has designs on you; there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvere to have \xe2\x80\x98em; and vile you\xe2\x80\x99re a-considering of it, they have you. I\r\nwos married fust, that vay myself, Sir, and Sammy wos the consekens o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe manoover.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You give me no great encouragement to conclude what I have to say,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nobserved Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98but I had better do so at once. This young\r\nperson is not only attached to your son, Mr. Weller, but your son is\r\nattached to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, \xe2\x80\x98this here\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing to come to\r\na father\xe2\x80\x99s ears, this is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have observed them on several occasions,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, making\r\nno comment on Mr. Weller\xe2\x80\x99s last remark; \xe2\x80\x98and entertain no doubt at all\r\nabout it. Supposing I were desirous of establishing them comfortably as\r\nman and wife in some little business or situation, where they might hope\r\nto obtain a decent living, what should you think of it, Mr. Weller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt first, Mr. Weller received with wry faces a proposition involving the\r\nmarriage of anybody in whom he took an interest; but, as Mr. Pickwick\r\nargued the point with him, and laid great stress on the fact that Mary\r\nwas not a widow, he gradually became more tractable. Mr. Pickwick had\r\ngreat influence over him, and he had been much struck with Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance; having, in fact, bestowed several very unfatherly winks upon\r\nher, already. At length he said that it was not for him to oppose Mr.\r\nPickwick\xe2\x80\x99s inclination, and that he would be very happy to yield to his\r\nadvice; upon which, Mr. Pickwick joyfully took him at his word, and\r\ncalled Sam back into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, clearing his throat, \xe2\x80\x98your father and I have\r\nbeen having some conversation about you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About you, Samivel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, in a patronising and impressive\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not so blind, Sam, as not to have seen, a long time since, that\r\nyou entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards Mrs.\r\nWinkle\xe2\x80\x99s maid,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You hear this, Samivel?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, in the same judicial form of\r\nspeech as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam, addressing his master, \xe2\x80\x98I hope there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm\r\nin a young man takin\xe2\x80\x99 notice of a young \xe2\x80\x98ooman as is undeniably good-\r\nlooking and well-conducted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not by no means,\xe2\x80\x99 acquiesced Mr. Weller, affably but magisterially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So far from thinking there is anything wrong in conduct so natural,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nresumed Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98it is my wish to assist and promote your wishes\r\nin this respect. With this view, I have had a little conversation with\r\nyour father; and finding that he is of my opinion--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The lady not bein\xe2\x80\x99 a widder,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Weller in explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The lady not being a widow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98I wish to\r\nfree you from the restraint which your present position imposes upon\r\nyou, and to mark my sense of your fidelity and many excellent qualities,\r\nby enabling you to marry this girl at once, and to earn an independent\r\nlivelihood for yourself and family. I shall be proud, Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nPickwick, whose voice had faltered a little hitherto, but now resumed\r\nits customary tone, \xe2\x80\x98proud and happy to make your future prospects in\r\nlife my grateful and peculiar care.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a profound silence for a short time, and then Sam said, in a\r\nlow, husky sort of voice, but firmly withal--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you for your goodness, Sir, as is only like\r\nyourself; but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t be done!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Mr. Pickwick in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Samivel!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Sam in a louder key. \xe2\x80\x98Wot\xe2\x80\x99s to become\r\nof you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98the recent changes among my\r\nfriends will alter my mode of life in future, entirely; besides, I am\r\ngrowing older, and want repose and quiet. My rambles, Sam, are over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do I know that \xe2\x80\x98ere, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 argued Sam. \xe2\x80\x98You think so now! S\xe2\x80\x99pose\r\nyou wos to change your mind, vich is not unlikely, for you\xe2\x80\x99ve the spirit\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 five-and-twenty in you still, what \xe2\x80\x98ud become on you vithout me? It\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be done, Sir, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good, Samivel, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal in that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Weller\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I speak after long deliberation, Sam, and with the certainty that I\r\nshall keep my word,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x98New scenes\r\nhave closed upon me; my rambles are at an end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wery good,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Sam. \xe2\x80\x98Then, that\xe2\x80\x99s the wery best reason wy you\r\nshould alvays have somebody by you as understands you, to keep you up\r\nand make you comfortable. If you vant a more polished sort o\xe2\x80\x99 feller,\r\nvell and good, have him; but vages or no vages, notice or no notice,\r\nboard or no board, lodgin\xe2\x80\x99 or no lodgin\xe2\x80\x99, Sam Veller, as you took from\r\nthe old inn in the Borough, sticks by you, come what may; and let\r\nev\xe2\x80\x99rythin\xe2\x80\x99 and ev\xe2\x80\x99rybody do their wery fiercest, nothin\xe2\x80\x99 shall ever\r\nperwent it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the close of this declaration, which Sam made with great emotion, the\r\nelder Mr. Weller rose from his chair, and, forgetting all considerations\r\nof time, place, or propriety, waved his hat above his head, and gave\r\nthree vehement cheers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller had sat down again,\r\nrather abashed at his own enthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x98you are bound to consider the\r\nyoung woman also.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do consider the young \xe2\x80\x98ooman, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sam. \xe2\x80\x98I have considered the\r\nyoung \xe2\x80\x98ooman. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoke to her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her how I\xe2\x80\x99m sitivated; she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nready to vait till I\xe2\x80\x99m ready, and I believe she vill. If she don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not the young \xe2\x80\x98ooman I take her for, and I give her up vith\r\nreadiness. You\xe2\x80\x99ve know\xe2\x80\x99d me afore, Sir. My mind\xe2\x80\x99s made up, and nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncan ever alter it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWho could combat this resolution? Not Mr. Pickwick. He derived, at that\r\nmoment, more pride and luxury of feeling from the disinterested\r\nattachment of his humble friends, than ten thousand protestations from\r\nthe greatest men living could have awakened in his heart.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was passing in Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s room, a little old\r\ngentleman in a suit of snuff-coloured clothes, followed by a porter\r\ncarrying a small portmanteau, presented himself below; and, after\r\nsecuring a bed for the night, inquired of the waiter whether one Mrs.\r\nWinkle was staying there, to which question the waiter of course\r\nresponded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she alone?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe she is, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the waiter; \xe2\x80\x98I can call her own maid,\r\nSir, if you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want her,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman quickly. \xe2\x80\x98Show me to her\r\nroom without announcing me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you deaf?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the little old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then listen, if you please. Can you hear me now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s well. Show me to Mrs. Winkle\xe2\x80\x99s room, without announcing me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the little old gentleman uttered this command, he slipped five\r\nshillings into the waiter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and looked steadily at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the waiter, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir, whether--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98You had\r\nbetter do it at once. It will save time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something so very cool and collected in the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner, that the waiter put the five shillings in his pocket, and led\r\nhim upstairs without another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the room, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98You may go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe waiter complied, wondering much who the gentleman could be, and what\r\nhe wanted; the little old gentleman, waiting till he was out of sight,\r\ntapped at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Um, a pretty voice, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the little old gentleman;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 As he said this, he opened the door and walked in.\r\nArabella, who was sitting at work, rose on beholding a stranger--a\r\nlittle confused--but by no means ungracefully so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t rise, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the unknown, walking in, and closing the\r\ndoor after him. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Winkle, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nArabella inclined her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Nathaniel Winkle, who married the son of the old man at\r\nBirmingham?\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, eyeing Arabella with visible curiosity.\r\n\r\nAgain Arabella inclined her head, and looked uneasily round, as if\r\nuncertain whether to call for assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I surprise you, I see, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather, I confess,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Arabella, wondering more and more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a chair, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.\r\n\r\nHe took one; and drawing a spectacle-case from his pocket, leisurely\r\npulled out a pair of spectacles, which he adjusted on his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking so intently at Arabella\r\nthat she began to feel alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman, nursing his left leg; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you\r\nshould. You know my name, though, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I?\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella, trembling, though she scarcely knew why. \xe2\x80\x98May I\r\nask what it is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Presently, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, presently,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, not having yet removed\r\nhis eyes from her countenance. \xe2\x80\x98You have been recently married, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Arabella, in a scarcely audible tone, laying aside her\r\nwork, and becoming greatly agitated as a thought, that had occurred to\r\nher before, struck more forcibly upon her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Without having represented to your husband the propriety of first\r\nconsulting his father, on whom he is dependent, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nArabella applied her handkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Without an endeavour, even, to ascertain, by some indirect appeal, what\r\nwere the old man\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments on a point in which he would naturally\r\nfeel much interested?\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot deny it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And without having sufficient property of your own to afford your\r\nhusband any permanent assistance in exchange for the worldly advantages\r\nwhich you knew he would have gained if he had married agreeably to his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s wishes?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98This is what boys and girls\r\ncall disinterested affection, till they have boys and girls of their\r\nown, and then they see it in a rougher and very different light!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s tears flowed fast, as she pleaded in extenuation that she was\r\nyoung and inexperienced; that her attachment had alone induced her to\r\ntake the step to which she had resorted; and that she had been deprived\r\nof the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was wrong,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman in a milder tone, \xe2\x80\x98very wrong. It\r\nwas romantic, unbusinesslike, foolish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was my fault; all my fault, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied poor Arabella, weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98it was not your fault that he fell\r\nin love with you, I suppose? Yes it was, though,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old\r\ngentleman, looking rather slily at Arabella. \xe2\x80\x98It was your fault. He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis little compliment, or the little gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s odd way of paying it,\r\nor his altered manner--so much kinder than it was, at first--or all\r\nthree together, forced a smile from Arabella in the midst of her tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s your husband?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old gentleman, abruptly; stopping a\r\nsmile which was just coming over his own face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I expect him every instant, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x98I persuaded him to\r\ntake a walk this morning. He is very low and wretched at not having\r\nheard from his father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Low, is he?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentlemen. \xe2\x80\x98Serve him right!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He feels it on my account, I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arabella; \xe2\x80\x98and indeed,\r\nSir, I feel it deeply on his. I have been the sole means of bringing him\r\nto his present condition.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it on his account, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nserves him right. I am glad of it--actually glad of it, as far as he is\r\nconcerned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s lips, when footsteps\r\nwere heard ascending the stairs, which he and Arabella seemed both to\r\nrecognise at the same moment. The little gentleman turned pale; and,\r\nmaking a strong effort to appear composed, stood up, as Mr. Winkle\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Winkle, recoiling in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the little old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir, what have you\r\ngot to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are ashamed of yourself, I hope, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nStill Mr. Winkle said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you ashamed of yourself, Sir, or are you not?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr. Winkle, drawing Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s arm through his. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nnot ashamed of myself, or of my wife either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the old gentleman ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry to have done anything which has lessened your affection\r\nfor me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Winkle; \xe2\x80\x98but I will say, at the same time, that I\r\nhave no reason to be ashamed of having this lady for my wife, nor you of\r\nhaving her for a daughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me your hand, Nat,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, in an altered voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kiss me, my love. You are a very charming little daughter-in-law after\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time Mr. Winkle went in search of Mr. Pickwick, and\r\nreturning with that gentleman, presented him to his father, whereupon\r\nthey shook hands for five minutes incessantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pickwick, I thank you most heartily for all your kindness to my\r\nson,\xe2\x80\x99 said old Mr. Winkle, in a bluff, straightforward way. \xe2\x80\x98I am a\r\nhasty fellow, and when I saw you last, I was vexed and taken by\r\nsurprise. I have judged for myself now, and am more than satisfied.\r\nShall I make any more apologies, Mr. Pickwick?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not one,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98You have done the only thing wanting\r\nto complete my happiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHereupon there was another shaking of hands for five minutes longer,\r\naccompanied by a great number of complimentary speeches, which, besides\r\nbeing complimentary, had the additional and very novel recommendation of\r\nbeing sincere.\r\n\r\nSam had dutifully seen his father to the Belle Sauvage, when, on\r\nreturning, he encountered the fat boy in the court, who had been charged\r\nwith the delivery of a note from Emily Wardle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joe, who was unusually loquacious, \xe2\x80\x98what a pretty girl\r\nMary is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she? I am _so_ fond of her, I am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Weller made no verbal remark in reply; but eyeing the fat boy for a\r\nmoment, quite transfixed at his presumption, led him by the collar to\r\nthe corner, and dismissed him with a harmless but ceremonious kick.\r\nAfter which, he walked home, whistling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII. IN WHICH THE PICKWICK CLUB IS FINALLY DISSOLVED, AND\r\nEVERYTHING CONCLUDED TO THE SATISFACTION OF EVERYBODY\r\n\r\nFor a whole week after the happy arrival of Mr. Winkle from Birmingham,\r\nMr. Pickwick and Sam Weller were from home all day long, only returning\r\njust in time for dinner, and then wearing an air of mystery and\r\nimportance quite foreign to their natures. It was evident that very\r\ngrave and eventful proceedings were on foot; but various surmises were\r\nafloat, respecting their precise character. Some (among whom was Mr.\r\nTupman) were disposed to think that Mr. Pickwick contemplated a\r\nmatrimonial alliance; but this idea the ladies most strenuously\r\nrepudiated. Others rather inclined to the belief that he had projected\r\nsome distant tour, and was at present occupied in effecting the\r\npreliminary arrangements; but this again was stoutly denied by Sam\r\nhimself, who had unequivocally stated, when cross-examined by Mary, that\r\nno new journeys were to be undertaken. At length, when the brains of the\r\nwhole party had been racked for six long days, by unavailing\r\nspeculation, it was unanimously resolved that Mr. Pickwick should be\r\ncalled upon to explain his conduct, and to state distinctly why he had\r\nthus absented himself from the society of his admiring friends.\r\n\r\nWith this view, Mr. Wardle invited the full circle to dinner at the\r\nAdelphi; and the decanters having been thrice sent round, opened the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are all anxious to know,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98what we have done\r\nto offend you, and to induce you to desert us and devote yourself to\r\nthese solitary walks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick. \xe2\x80\x98It is singular enough that I had intended\r\nto volunteer a full explanation this very day; so, if you will give me\r\nanother glass of wine, I will satisfy your curiosity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness, and Mr.\r\nPickwick, looking round on the faces of his friends with a cheerful\r\nsmile, proceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All the changes that have taken place among us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nmean the marriage that _has _taken place, and the marriage that WILL\r\ntake place, with the changes they involve, rendered it necessary for me\r\nto think, soberly and at once, upon my future plans. I determined on\r\nretiring to some quiet, pretty neighbourhood in the vicinity of London;\r\nI saw a house which exactly suited my fancy; I have taken it and\r\nfurnished it. It is fully prepared for my reception, and I intend\r\nentering upon it at once, trusting that I may yet live to spend many\r\nquiet years in peaceful retirement, cheered through life by the society\r\nof my friends, and followed in death by their affectionate remembrance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Pickwick paused, and a low murmur ran round the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The house I have taken,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98is at Dulwich. It has a\r\nlarge garden, and is situated in one of the most pleasant spots near\r\nLondon. It has been fitted up with every attention to substantial\r\ncomfort; perhaps to a little elegance besides; but of that you shall\r\njudge for yourselves. Sam accompanies me there. I have engaged, on\r\nPerker\xe2\x80\x99s representation, a housekeeper--a very old one--and such other\r\nservants as she thinks I shall require. I propose to consecrate this\r\nlittle retreat, by having a ceremony in which I take a great interest,\r\nperformed there. I wish, if my friend Wardle entertains no objection,\r\nthat his daughter should be married from my new house, on the day I take\r\npossession of it. The happiness of young people,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick, a\r\nlittle moved, \xe2\x80\x98has ever been the chief pleasure of my life. It will warm\r\nmy heart to witness the happiness of those friends who are dearest to\r\nme, beneath my own roof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paused again: Emily and Arabella sobbed audibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have communicated, both personally and by letter, with the club,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nresumed Mr. Pickwick, \xe2\x80\x98acquainting them with my intention. During our\r\nlong absence, it has suffered much from internal dissentions; and the\r\nwithdrawal of my name, coupled with this and other circumstances, has\r\noccasioned its dissolution. The Pickwick Club exists no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall never regret,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Pickwick in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98I shall never\r\nregret having devoted the greater part of two years to mixing with\r\ndifferent varieties and shades of human character, frivolous as my\r\npursuit of novelty may have appeared to many. Nearly the whole of my\r\nprevious life having been devoted to business and the pursuit of wealth,\r\nnumerous scenes of which I had no previous conception have dawned upon\r\nme--I hope to the enlargement of my mind, and the improvement of my\r\nunderstanding. If I have done but little good, I trust I have done less\r\nharm, and that none of my adventures will be other than a source of\r\namusing and pleasant recollection to me in the decline of life. God\r\nbless you all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Pickwick filled and drained a bumper with a\r\ntrembling hand; and his eyes moistened as his friends rose with one\r\naccord, and pledged him from their hearts.\r\n\r\nThere were few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of\r\nMr. Snodgrass. As he had neither father nor mother, and had been in his\r\nminority a ward of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s, that gentleman was perfectly well\r\nacquainted with his possessions and prospects. His account of both was\r\nquite satisfactory to Wardle--as almost any other account would have\r\nbeen, for the good old gentleman was overflowing with hilarity and\r\nkindness--and a handsome portion having been bestowed upon Emily, the\r\nmarriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time--the\r\nsuddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers and a tailor\r\nto the extreme verge of insanity.\r\n\r\nGetting post-horses to the carriage, old Wardle started off, next day,\r\nto bring his mother back to town. Communicating his intelligence to the\r\nold lady with characteristic impetuosity, she instantly fainted away;\r\nbut being promptly revived, ordered the brocaded silk gown to be packed\r\nup forthwith, and proceeded to relate some circumstances of a similar\r\nnature attending the marriage of the eldest daughter of Lady\r\nTollimglower, deceased, which occupied three hours in the recital, and\r\nwere not half finished at last.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trundle had to be informed of all the mighty preparations that were\r\nmaking in London; and, being in a delicate state of health, was informed\r\nthereof through Mr. Trundle, lest the news should be too much for her;\r\nbut it was not too much for her, inasmuch as she at once wrote off to\r\nMuggleton, to order a new cap and a black satin gown, and moreover\r\navowed her determination of being present at the ceremony. Hereupon, Mr.\r\nTrundle called in the doctor, and the doctor said Mrs. Trundle ought to\r\nknow best how she felt herself, to which Mrs. Trundle replied that she\r\nfelt herself quite equal to it, and that she had made up her mind to go;\r\nupon which the doctor, who was a wise and discreet doctor, and knew what\r\nwas good for himself, as well as for other people, said that perhaps if\r\nMrs. Trundle stopped at home, she might hurt herself more by fretting,\r\nthan by going, so perhaps she had better go. And she did go; the doctor\r\nwith great attention sending in half a dozen of medicine, to be drunk\r\nupon the road.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these points of distraction, Wardle was intrusted with\r\ntwo small letters to two small young ladies who were to act as\r\nbridesmaids; upon the receipt of which, the two young ladies were driven\r\nto despair by having no \xe2\x80\x98things\xe2\x80\x99 ready for so important an occasion, and\r\nno time to make them in--a circumstance which appeared to afford the two\r\nworthy papas of the two small young ladies rather a feeling of\r\nsatisfaction than otherwise. However, old frocks were trimmed, and new\r\nbonnets made, and the young ladies looked as well as could possibly have\r\nbeen expected of them. And as they cried at the subsequent ceremony in\r\nthe proper places, and trembled at the right times, they acquitted\r\nthemselves to the admiration of all beholders.\r\n\r\nHow the two poor relations ever reached London--whether they walked, or\r\ngot behind coaches, or procured lifts in wagons, or carried each other\r\nby turns--is uncertain; but there they were, before Wardle; and the very\r\nfirst people that knocked at the door of Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s house, on the\r\nbridal morning, were the two poor relations, all smiles and shirt\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\nThey were welcomed heartily though, for riches or poverty had no\r\ninfluence on Mr. Pickwick; the new servants were all alacrity and\r\nreadiness; Sam was in a most unrivalled state of high spirits and\r\nexcitement; Mary was glowing with beauty and smart ribands.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom, who had been staying at the house for two or three days\r\nprevious, sallied forth gallantly to Dulwich Church to meet the bride,\r\nattended by Mr. Pickwick, Ben Allen, Bob Sawyer, and Mr. Tupman; with\r\nSam Weller outside, having at his button-hole a white favour, the gift\r\nof his lady-love, and clad in a new and gorgeous suit of livery invented\r\nfor the occasion. They were met by the Wardles, and the Winkles, and the\r\nbride and bridesmaids, and the Trundles; and the ceremony having been\r\nperformed, the coaches rattled back to Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s to breakfast,\r\nwhere little Mr. Perker already awaited them.\r\n\r\nHere, all the light clouds of the more solemn part of the proceedings\r\npassed away; every face shone forth joyously; and nothing was to be\r\nheard but congratulations and commendations. Everything was so\r\nbeautiful! The lawn in front, the garden behind, the miniature\r\nconservatory, the dining-room, the drawing-room, the bedrooms, the\r\nsmoking-room, and, above all, the study, with its pictures and easy-\r\nchairs, and odd cabinets, and queer tables, and books out of number,\r\nwith a large cheerful window opening upon a pleasant lawn and commanding\r\na pretty landscape, dotted here and there with little houses almost\r\nhidden by the trees; and then the curtains, and the carpets, and the\r\nchairs, and the sofas! Everything was so beautiful, so compact, so neat,\r\nand in such exquisite taste, said everybody, that there really was no\r\ndeciding what to admire most.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of all this, stood Mr. Pickwick, his countenance\r\nlighted up with smiles, which the heart of no man, woman, or child,\r\ncould resist: himself the happiest of the group: shaking hands, over and\r\nover again, with the same people, and when his own hands were not so\r\nemployed, rubbing them with pleasure: turning round in a different\r\ndirection at every fresh expression of gratification or curiosity, and\r\ninspiring everybody with his looks of gladness and delight.\r\n\r\nBreakfast is announced. Mr. Pickwick leads the old lady (who has been\r\nvery eloquent on the subject of Lady Tollimglower) to the top of a long\r\ntable; Wardle takes the bottom; the friends arrange themselves on either\r\nside; Sam takes his station behind his master\xe2\x80\x99s chair; the laughter and\r\ntalking cease; Mr. Pickwick, having said grace, pauses for an instant\r\nand looks round him. As he does so, the tears roll down his cheeks, in\r\nthe fullness of his joy.\r\n\r\nLet us leave our old friend in one of those moments of unmixed\r\nhappiness, of which, if we seek them, there are ever some, to cheer our\r\ntransitory existence here. There are dark shadows on the earth, but its\r\nlights are stronger in the contrast. Some men, like bats or owls, have\r\nbetter eyes for the darkness than for the light. We, who have no such\r\noptical powers, are better pleased to take our last parting look at the\r\nvisionary companions of many solitary hours, when the brief sunshine of\r\nthe world is blazing full upon them.\r\n\r\nIt is the fate of most men who mingle with the world, and attain even\r\nthe prime of life, to make many real friends, and lose them in the\r\ncourse of nature. It is the fate of all authors or chroniclers to create\r\nimaginary friends, and lose them in the course of art. Nor is this the\r\nfull extent of their misfortunes; for they are required to furnish an\r\naccount of them besides.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this custom--unquestionably a bad one--we subjoin a\r\nfew biographical words, in relation to the party at Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Winkle, being fully received into favour by the old\r\ngentleman, were shortly afterwards installed in a newly-built house, not\r\nhalf a mile from Mr. Pickwick\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr. Winkle, being engaged in the city\r\nas agent or town correspondent of his father, exchanged his old costume\r\nfor the ordinary dress of Englishmen, and presented all the external\r\nappearance of a civilised Christian ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Snodgrass settled at Dingley Dell, where they purchased and\r\ncultivated a small farm, more for occupation than profit. Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nbeing occasionally abstracted and melancholy, is to this day reputed a\r\ngreat poet among his friends and acquaintance, although we do not find\r\nthat he has ever written anything to encourage the belief. There are\r\nmany celebrated characters, literary, philosophical, and otherwise, who\r\nhold a high reputation on a similar tenure.\r\n\r\nMr. Tupman, when his friends married, and Mr. Pickwick settled, took\r\nlodgings at Richmond, where he has ever since resided. He walks\r\nconstantly on the terrace during the summer months, with a youthful and\r\njaunty air, which has rendered him the admiration of the numerous\r\nelderly ladies of single condition, who reside in the vicinity. He has\r\nnever proposed again.\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer, having previously passed through the _Gazette_, passed\r\nover to Bengal, accompanied by Mr. Benjamin Allen; both gentlemen having\r\nreceived surgical appointments from the East India Company. They each\r\nhad the yellow fever fourteen times, and then resolved to try a little\r\nabstinence; since which period, they have been doing well. Mrs. Bardell\r\nlet lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen, with great profit,\r\nbut never brought any more actions for breach of promise of marriage.\r\nHer attorneys, Messrs. Dodson & Fogg, continue in business, from which\r\nthey realise a large income, and in which they are universally\r\nconsidered among the sharpest of the sharp.\r\n\r\nSam Weller kept his word, and remained unmarried, for two years. The old\r\nhousekeeper dying at the end of that time, Mr. Pickwick promoted Mary to\r\nthe situation, on condition of her marrying Mr. Weller at once, which\r\nshe did without a murmur. From the circumstance of two sturdy little\r\nboys having been repeatedly seen at the gate of the back garden, there\r\nis reason to suppose that Sam has some family.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Weller drove a coach for twelve months, but being\r\nafflicted with the gout, was compelled to retire. The contents of the\r\npocket-book had been so well invested for him, however, by Mr. Pickwick,\r\nthat he had a handsome independence to retire on, upon which he still\r\nlives at an excellent public-house near Shooter\xe2\x80\x99s Hill, where he is\r\nquite reverenced as an oracle, boasting very much of his intimacy with\r\nMr. Pickwick, and retaining a most unconquerable aversion to widows.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house, employing his\r\nleisure hours in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented\r\nto the secretary of the once famous club, or in hearing Sam Weller read\r\naloud, with such remarks as suggested themselves to his mind, which\r\nnever failed to afford Mr. Pickwick great amusement. He was much\r\ntroubled at first, by the numerous applications made to him by Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Trundle, to act as godfather to their\r\noffspring; but he has become used to it now, and officiates as a matter\r\nof course. He never had occasion to regret his bounty to Mr. Jingle; for\r\nboth that person and Job Trotter became, in time, worthy members of\r\nsociety, although they have always steadily objected to return to the\r\nscenes of their old haunts and temptations. Mr. Pickwick is somewhat\r\ninfirm now; but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit, and may\r\nstill be frequently seen, contemplating the pictures in the Dulwich\r\nGallery, or enjoying a walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine\r\nday. He is known by all the poor people about, who never fail to take\r\ntheir hats off, as he passes, with great respect. The children idolise\r\nhim, and so indeed does the whole neighbourhood. Every year he repairs\r\nto a large family merry-making at Mr. Wardle\xe2\x80\x99s; on this, as on all other\r\noccasions, he is invariably attended by the faithful Sam, between whom\r\nand his master there exists a steady and reciprocal attachment which\r\nnothing but death will terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Pickwick Papers, by Charles\r\nDickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PICKWICK PAPERS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 580-0.txt or 580-0.zip ***** This and all\r\nassociated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/5/8/580/\r\n\r\nProduced by Jo Churcher, and David Widger\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\r\nrenamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\r\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\r\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\r\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\r\nfreely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\r\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\r\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\r\nFoundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the\r\nnumber of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\r\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of\r\nequipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to\r\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\r\nthe IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where\r\nwe have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\r\nthe United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\r\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\r\nplease visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\r\na copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\r\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\r\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\r\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
