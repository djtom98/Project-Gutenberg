They pervade all\r\nclasses--Affecting instance of Colonel Snobley.)\r\n\r\nWe have all read a statement, (the authenticity of which I take leave to\r\ndoubt entirely, for upon what calculations I should like to know is it\r\nfounded?)--we have all, I say, been favoured by perusing a remark,\r\nthat when the times and necessities of the world call for a Man, that\r\nindividual is found. Thus at the French Revolution (which the reader\r\nwill be pleased to have introduced so early), when it was requisite to\r\nadminister a corrective dose to the nation, Robespierre was found;\r\na most foul and nauseous dose indeed, and swallowed eagerly by the\r\npatient, greatly to the latter\'s ultimate advantage: thus, when it\r\nbecame necessary to kick John Bull out of America, Mr. Washington\r\nstepped forward, and performed that job to satisfaction: thus, when\r\nthe Earl of Aldborough was unwell, Professor Holloway appeared with his\r\npills, and cured his lordship, as per advertisement, &c. &c.. Numberless\r\ninstances might be adduced to show that when a nation is in great want,\r\nthe relief is at hand; just as in the Pantomime (that microcosm) where\r\nwhen CLOWN wants anything--a warming-pan, a pump-handle, a goose, or a\r\nlady\'s tippet--a fellow comes sauntering out from behind the side-scenes\r\nwith the very article in question.\r\n\r\nAgain, when men commence an undertaking, they always are prepared\r\nto show that the absolute necessities of the world demanded its\r\ncompletion.--Say it is a railroad: the directors begin by stating that\r\n\'A more intimate communication between Bathershins and Derrynane Beg\r\nis necessary for the advancement of civilization, and demanded by the\r\nmultitudinous acclamations of the great Irish people.\' Or suppose it is\r\na newspaper: the prospectus states that \'At a time when the Church is\r\nin danger, threatened from without by savage fanaticism and miscreant\r\nunbelief, and undermined from within by dangerous Jesuitism, and\r\nsuicidal Schism, a Want has been universally felt--a suffering people\r\nhas looked abroad--for an Ecclesiastical Champion and Guardian. A body\r\nof Prelates and Gentlemen have therefore stepped forward in this our\r\nhour of danger, and determined on establishing the BEADLE newspaper,\'\r\n&c. &c. One or other of these points at least is incontrovertible: the\r\npublic wants a thing, therefore it is supplied with it; or the public is\r\nsupplied with a thing, therefore it wants it.\r\n\r\nI have long gone about with a conviction on my mind that I had a work to\r\ndo--a Work, if you like, with a great W; a Purpose to fulfil; a chasm to\r\nleap into, like Curtius, horse and foot; a Great Social Evil to Discover\r\nand to Remedy. That Conviction Has Pursued me for Years. It has Dogged\r\nme in the Busy Street; Seated Itself By Me in The Lonely Study; Jogged\r\nMy Elbow as it Lifted the Wine-cup at The Festive Board; Pursued me\r\nthrough the Maze of Rotten Row; Followed me in Far Lands. On Brighton\'s\r\nShingly Beach, or Margate\'s Sand, the Voice Outpiped the Roaring of the\r\nSea; it Nestles in my Nightcap, and It Whispers, \'Wake, Slumberer, thy\r\nWork Is Not Yet Done.\' Last Year, By Moonlight, in the Colosseum,\r\nthe Little Sedulous Voice Came To Me and Said, \'Smith, or Jones\' (The\r\nWriter\'s Name is Neither Here nor There), \'Smith or Jones, my fine\r\nfellow, this is all very well, but you ought to be at home writing your\r\ngreat work on SNOBS.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has this sort of vocation it is all nonsense attempting to\r\nelude it. He must speak out to the nations; he must unbusm himself, as\r\nJeames would say, or choke and die. \'Mark to yourself,\' I have often\r\nmentally exclaimed to your humble servant, \'the gradual way in which you\r\nhave been prepared for, and are now led by an irresistible necessity\r\nto enter upon your great labour. First, the World was made: then, as a\r\nmatter of course, Snobs; they existed for years and years, and were no\r\nmore known than America. But presently,--INGENS PATEBAT TELLUS,--the\r\npeople became darkly aware that there was such a race. Not above\r\nfive-and-twenty years since, a name, an expressive monosyllable, arose\r\nto designate that race. That name has spread over England like railroads\r\nsubsequently; Snobs are known and recognized throughout an Empire on\r\nwhich I am given to understand the Sun never sets. PUNCH appears at the\r\nripe season, to chronicle their history: and the individual comes forth\r\nto write that history in PUNCH.\'\r\n\r\nI have (and for this gift I congratulate myself with Deep and Abiding\r\nThankfulness) an eye for a Snob. If the Truthful is the Beautiful, it is\r\nBeautiful to study even the Snobbish; to track Snobs through history,\r\nas certain little dogs in Hampshire hunt out truffles; to sink shafts in\r\nsociety and come upon rich veins of Snobore. Snobbishness is like Death\r\nin a quotation from Horace, which I hope you never have heard, \'beating\r\nwith equal foot at poor men\'s doors, and kicking at the gates of\r\nEmperors.\' It is a great mistake to judge of Snobs lightly, and think\r\nthey exist among the lower classes merely. An immense percentage of\r\nSnobs, I believe, is to be found in every rank of this mortal life. You\r\nmust not judge hastily or vulgarly of Snobs: to do so shows that you are\r\nyourself a Snob. I myself have been taken for one.\r\n\r\nWhen I was taking the waters at Bagnigge Wells, and living at the\r\n\'Imperial Hotel\' there, there used to sit opposite me at breakfast, for\r\na short time, a Snob so insufferable that I felt I should never get\r\nany benefit of the waters so long as he remained. His name was\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Snobley, of a certain dragoon regiment. He wore\r\njapanned boots and moustaches: he lisped, drawled, and left the \'r\'s\'\r\nout of his words: he was always flourishing about, and smoothing his\r\nlacquered whiskers with a huge flaming bandanna, that filled the room\r\nwith an odour of musk so stifling that I determined to do battle with\r\nthat Snob, and that either he or I should quit the Inn. I first began\r\nharmless conversations with him; frightening him exceedingly, for he did\r\nnot know what to do when so attacked, and had never the slightest notion\r\nthat anybody would take such a liberty with him as to speak first:\r\nthen I handed him the paper: then, as he would take no notice of these\r\nadvances, I used to look him in the face steadily and--and use my fork\r\nin the light of a toothpick. After two mornings of this practice, he\r\ncould bear it no longer, and fairly quitted the place.\r\n\r\nShould the Colonel see this, will he remember the Gent who asked him if\r\nhe thought Publicoaler was a fine writer, and drove him from the Hotel\r\nwith a four-pronged fork?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I--THE SNOB PLAYFULLY DEALT WITH\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are relative and positive Snobs. I mean by positive, such persons\r\nas are Snobs everywhere, in all companies, from morning till night,\r\nfrom youth to the grave, being by Nature endowed with Snobbishness--and\r\nothers who are Snobs only in certain circumstances and relations of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFor instance: I once knew a man who committed before me an act as\r\natrocious as that which I have indicated in the last chapter as\r\nperformed by me for the purpose of disgusting Colonel Snobley; viz, the\r\nusing the fork in the guise of a toothpick. I once, I say, knew a man\r\nwho, dining in my company at the \'Europa Coffee-house,\' (opposite the\r\nGrand Opera, and, as everybody knows, the only decent place for dining\r\nat Naples,) ate peas with the assistance of his knife. He was a person\r\nwith whose society I was greatly pleased at first--indeed, we had met in\r\nthe crater of Mount Vesuvius, and were subsequently robbed and held to\r\nransom by brigands in Calabria, which is nothing to the purpose--a man\r\nof great powers, excellent heart, and varied information; but I had\r\nnever before seen him with a dish of pease, and his conduct in regard to\r\nthem caused me the deepest pain.\r\n\r\nAfter having seen him thus publicly comport himself, but one course was\r\nopen to me--to cut his acquaintance. I commissioned a mutual friend\r\n(the Honourable Poly Anthus) to break the matter to this gentleman as\r\ndelicately as possible, and to say that painful circumstances--in nowise\r\naffecting Mr. Marrowfat\'s honour, or my esteem for him--had occurred,\r\nwhich obliged me to forego my intimacy with him; and accordingly we met\r\nand gave each other the cut direct that night at the Duchess of Monte\r\nFiasco\'s ball.\r\n\r\nEverybody at Naples remarked the separation of the Damon and\r\nPythias--indeed, Marrowfat had saved my life more than once--but, as an\r\nEnglish gentleman, what was I to do?\r\n\r\nMy dear friend was, in this instance, the Snob RELATIVE. It is not\r\nsnobbish of persons of rank of any other nation to employ their knife in\r\nthe manner alluded to. I have seen Monte Fiasco clean his trencher with\r\nhis knife, and every Principe in company doing likewise. I have seen,\r\nat the hospitable board of H.I.H. the Grand Duchess Stephanie of\r\nBaden--(who, if these humble lines should come under her Imperial eyes,\r\nis besought to remember graciously the most devoted of her servants)--I\r\nhave seen, I say, the Hereditary Princess of Potztausend-Donnerwetter\r\n(that serenely-beautiful woman) use her knife in lieu of a fork or\r\nspoon; I have seen her almost swallow it, by Jove! like Ramo Samee, the\r\nIndian juggler. And did I blench? Did my estimation for the Princess\r\ndiminish? No, lovely Amalia! One of the truest passions that ever was\r\ninspired by woman was raised in this bosom by that lady. Beautiful\r\none! long, long may the knife carry food to those lips! the reddest and\r\nloveliest in the world!\r\n\r\nThe cause of my quarrel with Marrowfat I never breathed to mortal soul\r\nfor four years. We met in the halls of the aristocracy--our friends and\r\nrelatives. We jostled each other in the dance or at the board; but the\r\nestrangement continued, and seemed irrevocable, until the fourth of\r\nJune, last year.\r\n\r\nWe met at Sir George Golloper\'s. We were placed, he on the right, your\r\nhumble servant on the left of the admirable Lady G.. Peas formed part of\r\nthe banquet--ducks and green peas. I trembled as I saw Marrowfat helped,\r\nand turned away sickening, lest I should behold the weapon darting down\r\nhis horrid jaws.\r\n\r\nWhat was my astonishment, what my delight, when I saw him use his fork\r\nlike any other Christian! He did not administer the cold steel once. Old\r\ntimes rushed back upon me--the remembrance of old services--his rescuing\r\nme from the brigands--his gallant conduct in the affair with the\r\nCountess Dei Spinachi--his lending me the 1,700L. I almost burst into\r\ntears with joy--my voice trembled with emotion. \'George, my boy!\' I\r\nexclaimed, \'George Marrowfat, my dear fellow! a glass of wine!\'\r\n\r\nBlushing--deeply moved--almost as tremulous as I was myself, George\r\nanswered, \'FRANK, SHALL IT BE HOCK OR MADEIRA? I could have hugged\r\nhim to my heart but for the presence of the company. Little did Lady\r\nGolloper know what was the cause of the emotion which sent the duckling\r\nI was carving into her ladyship\'s pink satin lap. The most good-natured\r\nof women pardoned the error, and the butler removed the bird.\r\n\r\nWe have been the closest friends over since, nor, of course, has George\r\nrepeated his odious habit. He acquired it at a country school, where\r\nthey cultivated peas and only used two-pronged forks, and it was only\r\nby living on the Continent where the usage of the four-prong is general,\r\nthat he lost the horrible custom.\r\n\r\nIn this point--and in this only--I confess myself a member of the\r\nSilver-Fork School; and if this tale but induce one of my readers to\r\npause, to examine in his own mind solemnly, and ask, \'Do I or do I not\r\neat peas with a knife?\'--to see the ruin which may fall upon himself by\r\ncontinuing the practice, or his family by beholding the example, these\r\nlines will not have been written in vain. And now, whatever other\r\nauthors may be, I flatter myself, it will be allowed that I, at least,\r\nam a moral man.\r\n\r\nBy the way, as some readers are dull of comprehension, I may as well\r\nsay what the moral of this history is. The moral is this--Society having\r\nordained certain customs, men are bound to obey the law of society, and\r\nconform to its harmless orders.\r\n\r\nIf I should go to the British and Foreign Institute (and heaven forbid I\r\nshould go under any pretext or in any costume whatever)--if I should go\r\nto one of the tea-parties in a dressing-gown and slippers, and not in\r\nthe usual attire of a gentleman, viz, pumps, a gold waistcoat, a crush\r\nhat, a sham frill, and a white choker--I should be insulting society,\r\nand EATING PEASE WITH MY KNIFE. Let the porters of the Institute hustle\r\nout the individual who shall so offend. Such an offender is, as regards\r\nsociety, a most emphatical and refractory Snob. It has its code and\r\npolice as well as governments, and he must conform who would profit by\r\nthe decrees set forth for their common comfort.\r\n\r\nI am naturally averse to egotism, and hate selflaudation consumedly; but\r\nI can\'t help relating here a circumstance illustrative of the point in\r\nquestion, in which I must think I acted with considerable prudence.\r\n\r\nBeing at Constantinople a few years since--(on a delicate mission),--the\r\nRussians were playing a double game, between ourselves, and it became\r\nnecessary on our part to employ an EXTRA NEGOTIATOR--Leckerbiss Pasha of\r\nRoumelia, then Chief Galeongee of the Porte, gave a diplomatic banquet\r\nat his summer palace at Bujukdere. I was on the left of the Galeongee,\r\nand the Russian agent, Count de Diddloff, on his dexter side. Diddloff\r\nis a dandy who would die of a rose in aromatic pain: he had tried to\r\nhave me assassinated three times in the course of the negotiation; but\r\nof course we were friends in public, and saluted each other in the most\r\ncordial and charming manner.\r\n\r\nThe Galeongee is--or was, alas! for a bow-string has done for him--a\r\nstaunch supporter of the old school of Turkish politics. We dined with\r\nour fingers, and had flaps of bread for plates; the only innovation\r\nhe admitted was the use of European liquors, in which he indulged with\r\ngreat gusto. He was an enormous eater. Amongst the dishes a very large\r\none was placed before him of a lamb dressed in its wool, stuffed with\r\nprunes, garlic, assafoetida, capsicums, and other condiments, the most\r\nabominable mixture that ever mortal smelt or tasted. The Galeongee ate\r\nof this hugely; and pursuing the Eastern fashion, insisted on helping\r\nhis friends right and left, and when he came to a particularly spicy\r\nmorsel, would push it with his own hands into his guests\' very mouths.\r\n\r\nI never shall forget the look of poor Diddloff, when his Excellency,\r\nrolling up a large quantity of this into a ball and exclaiming, \'Buk\r\nBuk\' (it is very good), administered the horrible bolus to Diddloff. The\r\nRussian\'s eyes rolled dreadfully as he received it: he swallowed it with\r\na grimace that I thought must precede a convulsion, and seizing a bottle\r\nnext him, which he thought was Sauterne, but which turned out to be\r\nFrench brandy, he drank off nearly a pint before he know his error. It\r\nfinished him; he was carried away from the dining-room almost dead, and\r\nlaid out to cool in a summer-house on the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to my turn, I took down the condiment with a smile, said\r\n\'Bismillah,\' licked my lips with easy gratification, and when the next\r\ndish was served, made up a ball myself so dexterously, and popped it\r\ndown the old Galeongee\'s mouth with so much grace, that his heart was\r\nwon. Russia was put out of court at once and THE TREATY of Kabobanople\r\nWAS SIGNED. As for Diddloff, all was over with HIM: he was recalled to\r\nSt. Petersburg, and Sir Roderick Murchison saw him, under the No. 3967,\r\nworking in the Ural mines.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this tale, I need not say, is, that there are many\r\ndisagreeable things in society which you are bound to take down, and to\r\ndo so with a smiling face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--THE SNOB ROYAL\r\n\r\nLong since at the commencement of the reign of her present Gracious\r\nMajesty, it chanced \'on a fair summer evening,\' as Mr. James would say,\r\nthat three or four young cavaliers were drinking a cup of wine after\r\ndinner at the hostelry called the \'King\'s Arms,\' kept by Mistress\r\nAnderson, in the royal village of Kensington. \'Twas a balmy evening,\r\nand the wayfarers looked out on a cheerful scene. The tall elms of\r\nthe ancient gardens were in full leaf, and countless chariots of\r\nthe nobility of England whirled by to the neighbouring palace, where\r\nprincely Sussex (whose income latterly only allowed him to give\r\ntea-parties) entertained his royal niece at a state banquet. When the\r\ncaroches of the nobles had set down their owners at the banquethall,\r\ntheir varlets and servitors came to quaff a flagon of nut-brown ale in\r\nthe \'King\'s Arms\' gardens hard by. We watched these fellows from our\r\nlattice. By Saint Boniface \'twas a rare sight!\r\n\r\nThe tulips in Mynheer Van Dunck\'s gardens were not more gorgeous than\r\nthe liveries of these pie-coated retainers. All the flowers of the field\r\nbloomed in their ruffled bosoms, all the hues of the rainbow gleamed\r\nin their plush breeches, and the long-caned ones walked up and down the\r\ngarden with that charming solemnity, that delightful quivering swagger\r\nof the calves, which has always had a frantic fascination for us. The\r\nwalk was not wide enough for them as the shoulder-knots strutted up and\r\ndown it in canary, and crimson, and light blue.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of their pride, a little bell was rung, a side\r\ndoor opened, and (after setting down their Royal Mistress) her Majesty\'s\r\nown crimson footmen, with epaulets and black plushes, came in.\r\n\r\nIt was pitiable to see the other poor Johns slink off at this arrival!\r\nNot one of the honest private Plushes could stand up before the Royal\r\nFlunkeys. They left the walk: they sneaked into dark holes and drank\r\ntheir beer in silence. The Royal Plush kept possession of the garden\r\nuntil the Royal Plush dinner was announced, when it retired, and we\r\nheard from the pavilion where they dined, conservative cheers, and\r\nspeeches, and Kentish fires. The other Flunkeys we never saw more.\r\n\r\nMy dear Flunkeys, so absurdly conceited at one moment and so abject\r\nat the next, are but the types of their masters in this world. HE WHO\r\nMEANLY ADMIRES MEAN THINGS IS A SNOB--perhaps that is a safe definition\r\nof the character.\r\n\r\nAnd this is why I have, with the utmost respect, ventured to place The\r\nSnob Royal at the head of my list, causing all others to give way before\r\nhim, as the Flunkeys before the royal representative in Kensington\r\nGardens. To say of such and such a Gracious Sovereign that he is a Snob,\r\nis but to say that his Majesty is a man. Kings, too, are men and Snobs.\r\nIn a country where Snobs are in the majority, a prime one, surely,\r\ncannot be unfit to govern. With us they have succeeded to admiration.\r\n\r\nFor instance, James I. was a Snob, and a Scotch Snob, than which the\r\nworld contains no more offensive creature. He appears to have had not\r\none of the good qualities of a man--neither courage, nor generosity,\r\nnor honesty, nor brains; but read what the great Divines and Doctors of\r\nEngland said about him! Charles II., his grandson, was a rogue, but not\r\na Snob; whilst Louis XIV., his old squaretoes of a contemporary,--the\r\ngreat worshipper of Bigwiggery--has always struck me as a most undoubted\r\nand Royal Snob.\r\n\r\nI will not, however, take instances from our own country of Royal Snobs,\r\nbut refer to a neighbouring kingdom, that of Brentford--and its monarch,\r\nthe late great and lamented Gorgius IV. With the same humility with\r\nwhich the footmen at the \'King\'s Arms\' gave way before the Plush Royal,\r\nthe aristocracy of the Brentford nation bent down and truckled before\r\nGorgius, and proclaimed him the first gentleman in Europe. And it\'s a\r\nwonder to think what is the gentlefolks\' opinion of a gentleman, when\r\nthey gave Gorgius such a title.\r\n\r\nWhat is it to be a gentleman? Is it to be honest, to be gentle, to be\r\ngenerous, to be brave, to be wise, and, possessing all these qualities,\r\nto exercise them in the most graceful outward manner? Ought a gentleman\r\nto be a loyal son, a true husband, and honest father? Ought his life to\r\nbe decent--his bills to be paid--his tastes to be high and elegant--his\r\naims in life lofty and noble? In a word, ought not the Biography of a\r\nFirst Gentleman in Europe to be of such a nature that it might be read\r\nin Young Ladies\' Schools with advantage, and studied with profit in the\r\nSeminaries of Young Gentlemen? I put this question to all instructors\r\nof youth--to Mrs. Ellis and the Women of England; to all schoolmasters,\r\nfrom Doctor Hawtrey down to Mr. Squeers. I conjure up before me an awful\r\ntribunal of youth and innocence, attended by its venerable instructors\r\n(like the ten thousand red-cheeked charity-children in Saint Paul\'s),\r\nsitting in judgment, and Gorgius pleading his cause in the midst. Out of\r\nCourt, out of Court, fat old Florizel! Beadles, turn out that bloated,\r\npimple-faced man!--If Gorgius MUST have a statue in the new Palace which\r\nthe Brentford nation is building, it ought to be set up in the Flunkeys\'\r\nHall. He should be represented cutting out a coat, in which art he is\r\nsaid to have excelled. He also invented Maraschino punch, a shoe-buckle\r\n(this was in the vigour of his youth, and the prime force of his\r\ninvention), and a Chinese pavilion, the most hideous building in the\r\nworld. He could drive a four-in-hand very nearly as well as the Brighton\r\ncoachman, could fence elegantly, and it is said, played the fiddle well.\r\nAnd he smiled with such irresistible fascination, that persons who were\r\nintroduced into his august presence became his victims, body and soul,\r\nas a rabbit becomes the prey of a great big boa-constrictor.\r\n\r\nI would wager that if Mr. Widdicomb were, by a revolution, placed on\r\nthe throne of Brentford, people would be equally fascinated by his\r\nirresistibly majestic smile and tremble as they knelt down to kiss his\r\nhand. If he went to Dublin they would erect an obelisk on the spot where\r\nhe first landed, as the Paddylanders did when Gorgius visited them.\r\nWe have all of us read with delight that story of the King\'s voyage to\r\nHaggisland, where his presence inspired such a fury of loyalty and where\r\nthe most famous man of the country--the Baron of Bradwardine--coming\r\non board the royal yacht, and finding a glass out of which Gorgius had\r\ndrunk, put it into his coatpocket as an inestimable relic, and went\r\nashore in his boat again. But the Baron sat down upon the glass and\r\nbroke it, and cut his coat-tails very much; and the inestimable relic\r\nwas lost to the world for ever. O noble Bradwardine! what old-world\r\nsuperstition could set you on your knees before such an idol as that?\r\n\r\nIf you want to moralise upon the mutability of human affairs, go and\r\nsee the figure of Gorgius in his real, identical robes, at the\r\nwaxwork.--Admittance one shilling. Children and flunkeys sixpence. Go,\r\nand pay sixpence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III--THE INFLUENCE OF THE ARISTOCRACY ON SNOBS\r\n\r\nLast Sunday week, being at church in this city, and the service just\r\nended, I heard two Snobs conversing about the Parson. One was asking\r\nthe other who the clergyman was? \'He is Mr. So-and-so,\' the second Snob\r\nanswered, \'domestic chaplain to the Earl of What-d\'ye-call\'im.\' \'Oh, is\r\nhe\' said the first Snob, with a tone of indescribable satisfaction.--The\r\nParson\'s orthodoxy and identity were at once settled in this Snob\'s\r\nmind. He knew no more about the Earl than about the Chaplain, but he\r\ntook the latter\'s character upon the authority of the former; and went\r\nhome quite contented with his Reverence, like a little truckling Snob.\r\n\r\nThis incident gave me more matter for reflection even than the sermon:\r\nand wonderment at the extent and prevalence of Lordolatory in this\r\ncountry. What could it matter to Snob whether his Reverence were\r\nchaplain to his Lordship or not? What Peerageworship there is all\r\nthrough this free country! How we are all implicated in it, and more or\r\nless down on our knees.--And with regard to the great subject on hand, I\r\nthink that the influence of the Peerage upon Snobbishness has been\r\nmore remarkable than that of any other institution. The increase,\r\nencouragement, and maintenance of Snobs are among the \'priceless\r\nservices,\' as Lord John Russell says, which we owe to the nobility.\r\n\r\nIt can\'t be otherwise. A man becomes enormously rich, or he jobs\r\nsuccessfully in the aid of a Minister, or he wins a great battle, or\r\nexecutes a treaty, or is a clever lawyer who makes a multitude of fees\r\nand ascends the bench; and the country rewards him for ever with a gold\r\ncoronet (with more or less balls or leaves) and a title, and a rank\r\nas legislator. \'Your merits are so great,\' says the nation, \'that your\r\nchildren shall be allowed to reign over us, in a manner. It does not in\r\nthe least matter that your eldest son be a fool: we think your services\r\nso remarkable, that he shall have the reversion of your honours when\r\ndeath vacates your noble shoes. If you are poor, we will give you such\r\na sum of money as shall enable you and the eldest-born of your race for\r\never to live in fat and splendour. It is our wish that there should be\r\na race set apart in this happy country, who shall hold the first rank,\r\nhave the first prizes and chances in all government jobs and patronages.\r\nWe cannot make all your dear children Peers--that would make Peerage\r\ncommon and crowd the House of Lords uncomfortably--but the young ones\r\nshall have everything a Government can give: they shall get the pick\r\nof all the places: they shall be Captains and Lieutenant-Colonels at\r\nnineteen, when hoary-headed old lieutenants are spending thirty years\r\nat drill: they shall command ships at one-and-twenty, and veterans who\r\nfought before they were born. And as we are eminently a free people, and\r\nin order to encourage all men to do their duty, we say to any man of\r\nany rank--get enormously rich, make immense fees as a lawyer, or great\r\nspeeches, or distinguish yourself and win battles--and you, even you,\r\nshall come into the privileged class, and your children shall reign\r\nnaturally over ours.\'\r\n\r\nHow can we help Snobbishness, with such a prodigious national\r\ninstitution erected for its worship? How can we help cringing to\r\nLords? Flesh and blood can\'t do otherwise. What man can withstand this\r\nprodigious temptation? Inspired by what is called a noble emulation,\r\nsome people grasp at honours and win them; others, too weak or mean,\r\nblindly admire and grovel before those who have gained them; others, not\r\nbeing able to acquire them, furiously hate, abuse, and envy. There are\r\nonly a few bland and not-in-the-least-conceited philosophers, who\r\ncan behold the state of society, viz., Toadyism, organised:--base\r\nMan-and-Mammon worship, instituted by command of law:--Snobbishness, in\r\na word, perpetuated,--and mark the phenomenon calmly. And of these calm\r\nmoralists, is there one, I wonder, whose heart would not throb with\r\npleasure if he could be seen walking arm-in-arm with a couple of dukes\r\ndown Pall Mall? No it is impossible in our condition of society, not to\r\nbe sometimes a Snob.\r\n\r\nOn one hand it encourages the commoner to be snobbishly mean, and the\r\nnoble to be snobbishly arrogant. When a noble marchioness writes in\r\nher travels about the hard necessity under which steam-boat travellers\r\nlabour of being brought into contact \'with all sorts and conditions of\r\npeople:\' implying that a fellowship with God\'s creatures is disagreeable\r\nto to her Ladyship, who is their superior:--when, I say, the Marchioness\r\nof ---- writes in this fashion, we must consider that out of her natural\r\nheart it would have been impossible for any woman to have had such a\r\nsentiment; but that the habit of truckling and cringing, which all\r\nwho surround her have adopted towards this beautiful and magnificent\r\nlady,--this proprietor of so many black and other diamonds,--has really\r\ninduced her to believe that she is the superior of the world in general:\r\nand that people are not to associate with her except awfully at a\r\ndistance. I recollect being once at the city of Grand Cairo, through\r\nwhich a European Royal Prince was passing India-wards. One night at the\r\ninn there was a great disturbance: a man had drowned himself in the well\r\nhard by: all the inhabitants of the hotel came bustling into the Court,\r\nand amongst others your humble servant, who asked of a certain young man\r\nthe reason of the disturbance. How was I to know that this young gent\r\nwas a prince? He had not his crown and sceptre on: he was dressed in a\r\nwhite jacket and felt hat: but he looked surprised at anybody speaking\r\nto him: answered an unintelligible monosyllable, and--BECKONED HIS\r\nAID-DE-CAMP TO COME AND SPEAK TO ME. It is our fault, not that of the\r\ngreat, that they should fancy themselves so far above us. If you WILL\r\nfling yourself under the wheels, Juggernaut will go over you, depend\r\nupon it; and if you and I, my dear friend, had Kotow performed before\r\nus every day,--found people whenever we appeared grovelling in slavish\r\nadoration, we should drop into the airs of superiority quite naturally,\r\nand accept the greatness with which the world insisted upon endowing us.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance, out of Lord L----\'s travels, of that calm,\r\ngood-natured, undoubting way in which a great man accepts the homage of\r\nhis inferiors. After making some profound and ingenious remarks about\r\nthe town of Brussells, his lordship says:--\'Staying some day at the\r\nHotel de Belle Vue, a greatly overrated establishment, and not nearly as\r\ncomfortable as the Hotel de France--I made acquaintance with Dr. L----,\r\nthe physician of the Mission. He was desirous of doing the honours of\r\nthe place to me, and he ordered for us a DINER EN GOURMAND at the chief\r\nrestaurateur\'s, maintaining it surpassed the Rocher at Paris. Six or\r\neight partook of the entertainment, and we all agreed it was infinitely\r\ninferior to the Paris display, and much more extravagant. So much for\r\nthe copy.\r\n\r\nAnd so much for the gentleman who gave the dinner. Dr. L----, desirous\r\nto do his lordship \'the honour of the place,\' feasts him with the\r\nbest victuals money can procure--and my lord finds the entertainment\r\nextravagant and inferior. Extravagant! it was not extravagant to\r\nHIM;--Inferior! Mr. L---- did his best to satisfy those noble jaws,\r\nand my lord receives the entertainment, and dismisses the giver with\r\na rebuke. It is like a three-tailed Pasha grumbling about an\r\nunsatisfactory backsheesh.\r\n\r\nBut how should it be otherwise in a country where Lordolatry is part\r\nof our creed, and where our children are brought up to respect the\r\n\'Peerage\' as the Englishman\'s second Bible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV--THE COURT CIRCULAR, AND ITS INFLUENCE ON SNOBS\r\n\r\nExample is the best of precepts; so let us begin with a true and\r\nauthentic story, showing how young aristocratic snobs are reared, and\r\nhow early their Snobbishness may be made to bloom. A beautiful and\r\nfashionable lady--(pardon, gracious madam, that your story should\r\nbe made public; but it is so moral that it ought to be known to the\r\nuniversal world)--told me that in her early youth she had a little\r\nacquaintance, who is now indeed a beautiful and fashionable lady too.\r\nIn mentioning Miss Snobky, daughter of Sir Snobby Snobky, whose\r\npresentation at Court caused such a sensation, need I say more?\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Snobky was so very young as to be in the nursery regions, and\r\nto walk off early mornings in St. James\'s Park, protected by a French\r\ngoverness and followed by a huge hirsute flunkey in the canary coloured\r\nlivery of the Snobkys, she used occasionally in these promenades to meet\r\nwith young Lord Claude Lollipop, the Marquis of Sillabub\'s younger\r\nson. In the very height of the season, from some unexplained cause, the\r\nSnobkys suddenly determined upon leaving town. Miss Snobky spoke to her\r\nfemale friend and confidante. \'What will poor Claude Lollipop say when\r\nhe hears of my absence?\' asked the tender-hearted child.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, perhaps he won\'t hear of it,\' answers the confidante.\r\n\r\n\'MY DEAR, HE WILL READ IT IN THE PAPERS,\' replied the dear little\r\nfashionable rogue of seven years old. She knew already her importance,\r\nand how all the world of England, how all the would-be-genteel people,\r\nhow all the silver-fork worshippers, how all the tattle-mongers, how all\r\nthe grocers\' ladies, the tailors\' ladies, the attorneys\' and merchants\'\r\nladies, and the people living at Clapham and Brunswick Square,--who have\r\nno more chance of consorting with a Snobky than my beloved reader has\r\nof dining with the Emperor of China--yet watched the movements of the\r\nSnobkys with interest and were glad to know when they came to London and\r\nleft it.\r\n\r\nHere is the account of Miss Snobky\'s dress, and that of her mother, Lady\r\nSnobky, from the papers:--\r\n\r\n\'MISS SNOBKY.\r\n\r\nHabit de Cour, composed of a yellow nankeen illusion dress over a\r\nslip of rich pea-green corduroy, trimmed en tablier, with bouquets\r\nof Brussels sprouts: the body and sleeves handsomely trimmed with\r\ncalimanco, and festooned with a pink train and white radishes.\r\nHead-dress, carrots and lappets.\r\n\r\n\'LADY SNOBKY.\r\n\r\n\'Costume de Cour, composed of a train of the most superb Pekin\r\nbandannas, elegantly trimmed with spangles, tinfoil, and red-tape.\r\nBodice and underdress of sky-blue velveteen, trimmed with bouffants and\r\nnoeuds of bell-pulls. Stomacher a muffin. Head-dress a bird\'s nest,\r\nwith a bird of paradise, over a rich brass knocker en ferroniere. This\r\nsplendid costume, by Madame Crinoline, of Regent Street, was the object\r\nof universal admiration.\'\r\n\r\nThis is what you read. Oh, Mrs. Ellis! Oh, mothers, daughters, aunts,\r\ngrandmothers of England, this is the sort of writing which is put in the\r\nnewspapers for you! How can you help being the mothers, daughters, &c.\r\nof Snobs, so long as this balderdash is set before you?\r\n\r\nYou stuff the little rosy foot of a Chinese young lady of fashion into a\r\nslipper that is about the size of a salt-cruet, and keep the poor little\r\ntoes there imprisoned and twisted up so long that the dwarfishness\r\nbecomes irremediable. Later, the foot would not expand to the natural\r\nsize were you to give her a washing-tub for a shoe and for all her life\r\nshe has little feet, and is a cripple. Oh, my dear Miss Wiggins, thank\r\nyour stars that those beautiful feet of yours--though I declare when you\r\nwalk they are so small as to be almost invisible--thank your stars that\r\nsociety never so practised upon them; but look around and see how\r\nmany friends of ours in the highest circles have had their BRAINS so\r\nprematurely and hopelessly pinched and distorted.\r\n\r\nHow can you expect that those poor creatures are to move naturally when\r\nthe world and their parents have mutilated them so cruelly? As long as\r\na COURT CIRCULAR exists, how the deuce are people whose names are\r\nchronicled in it ever to believe themselves the equals of the cringing\r\nrace which daily reads that abominable trash? I believe that ours is the\r\nonly country in the world now where the COURT CIRCULAR remains in full\r\nflourish--where you read, \'This day his Royal Highness Prince Pattypan\r\nwas taken an airing in his go-cart.\' \'The Princess Pimminy was taken a\r\ndrive, attended by her ladies of honour, and accompanied by her doll,\'\r\n&c. We laugh at the solemnity with which Saint Simon announces that SA\r\nMAJESTE SE MEDICAMENTE AUJOURD\'HUI. Under our very noses the same folly\r\nis daily going on. That wonderful and mysterious man, the author of the\r\nCOURT CIRCULAR, drops in with his budget at the newspaper offices every\r\nnight. I once asked the editor of a paper to allow me to lie in wait and\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nI am told that in a kingdom where there is a German King-Consort\r\n(Portugal it must be, for the Queen of that country married a German\r\nPrince, who is greatly admired and respected by the natives), whenever\r\nthe Consort takes the diversion of shooting among the rabbit-warrens of\r\nCintra, or the pheasant-preserve of Mafra, he has a keeper to load his\r\nguns, as a matter of course, and then they are handed to the nobleman,\r\nhis equerry, and the nobleman hands them to the Prince who blazes\r\naway--gives back the discharged gun to the nobleman, who gives it to the\r\nkeeper, and so on. But the Prince WON\'T TAKE THE GUN FROM THE HANDS OF\r\nTHE LOADER.\r\n\r\nAs long as this unnatural and monstrous etiquette continues, Snobs there\r\nmust be. The three persons engaged in this transaction are, for the time\r\nbeing, Snobs.\r\n\r\n1. The keeper--the least Snob of all, because he is discharging his\r\ndaily duty; but he appears here as a Snob, that is to say, in a position\r\nof debasement before another human being (the Prince), with whom he\r\nis allowed to communicate through another party. A free Portuguese\r\ngamekeeper, who professes himself to be unworthy to communicate directly\r\nwith any person, confesses himself to be a Snob.\r\n\r\n2. The nobleman in waiting is a Snob. If it degrades the Prince to\r\nreceive the gun from the gamekeeper, it is degrading to the nobleman in\r\nwaiting to execute that service. He acts as a Snob towards the keeper,\r\nwhom he keeps from communication with the Prince--a Snob to the Prince,\r\nto whom he pays a degrading homage.\r\n\r\n3. The King-Consort of Portugal is a Snob for insulting fellow-men in\r\nthis way. There\'s no harm in his accepting the services of the keeper\r\ndirectly; but indirectly he insults the service performed, and the\r\nservants who perform it; and therefore, I say, respectfully, is a most\r\nundoubted, though royal Snob.\r\n\r\nAnd then you read in the DIARIO DO GOBERNO--\'Yesterday his Majesty the\r\nKing took the diversion of shooting the woods off Cintra, attended by\r\nColonel the honourable Whiskerando Sombrero. His Majesty returned to the\r\nNecessidades to lunch, at,\' &c. &c..\r\n\r\nOh! that COURT CIRCULAR! once more, I exclaim.\r\n\r\nDown with the COURT CIRCULAR--that engine and propagator of\r\nSnobbishness! I promise to subscribe for a year to any daily paper that\r\nshall come out without a COURT CIRCULAR--were it the MORNING HERALD\r\nitself. When I read that trash, I rise in my wrath; I feel myself\r\ndisloyal, a regicide, a member of the Calf\'s Head Club. The only COURT\r\nCIRCULAR story which ever pleased me, was that of the King of Spain,\r\nwho in great part was roasted, because there was not time for the Prime\r\nMinister to command the Lord Chamberlain to desire the Grand Gold Stick\r\nto order the first page in waiting to bid the chief of the flunkeys to\r\nrequest the House-maid of Honour to bring up a pail of water to put his\r\nMajesty out.\r\n\r\nI am like the Pasha of three tails, to whom the Sultan sends HIS COURT\r\nCIRCULAR, the bowstring.\r\n\r\nIt CHOKES me. May its usage be abolished for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V--WHAT SNOBS ADMIRE\r\n\r\nNow let us consider how difficult it is even for great men to escape\r\nfrom being Snobs. It is very well for the reader, whose fine feelings\r\nare disgusted by the assertion that Kings, Princes, Lords, are Snobs, to\r\nsay \'You are confessedly a Snob yourself. In professing to depict Snobs,\r\nit is only your own ugly mug which you are copying with a Narcissus-like\r\nconceit and fatuity.\' But I shall pardon this explosion of ill-temper\r\non the part of my constant reader, reflecting upon the misfortune of his\r\nbirth and country. It is impossible for ANY Briton, perhaps, not to be a\r\nSnob in some degree. If people can be convinced of this fact, an immense\r\npoint is gained, surely. If I have pointed out the disease, let us hope\r\nthat other scientific characters may discover the remedy.\r\n\r\nIf you, who are a person of the middle ranks of life, are a Snob,--you\r\nwhom nobody flatters particularly; you who have no toadies; you whom no\r\ncringing flunkeys or shopmen bow out of doors; you whom the policeman\r\ntells to move on; you who are jostled in the crowd of this world, and\r\namongst the Snobs our brethren: consider how much harder it is for a man\r\nto escape who has not your advantages, and is all his life long subject\r\nto adulation; the butt of meanness; consider how difficult it is for the\r\nSnobs\' idol not to be a Snob.\r\n\r\nAs I was discoursing with my friend Eugenio in this impressive way, Lord\r\nBuckram passed us, the son of the Marquis of Bagwig, and knocked at\r\nthe door of the family mansion in Red Lion Square. His noble father and\r\nmother occupied, as everybody knows, distinguished posts in the\r\nCourts of late Sovereigns. The Marquis was Lord of the Pantry, and her\r\nLadyship, Lady of the Powder Closet to Queen Charlotte. Buck (as I\r\ncall him, for we are very familiar) gave me a nod as he passed, and\r\nI proceeded to show Eugenio how it was impossible that this nobleman\r\nshould not be one of ourselves, having been practised upon by Snobs all\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nHis parents resolved to give him a public education, and sent him to\r\nschool at the earliest possible period. The Reverend Otto Rose, D.D.,\r\nPrincipal of the Preparatory Academy for young noblemen and gentlemen,\r\nRichmond Lodge, took this little Lord in hand, and fell down and\r\nworshipped him. He always introduced him to fathers and mothers who\r\ncame to visit their children at the school. He referred with pride and\r\npleasure to the most noble the Marquis of Bagwig, as one of the kind\r\nfriends and patrons of his Seminary. He made Lord Buckram a bait for\r\nsuch a multiplicity of pupils, that a new wing was built to Richmond\r\nLodge, and thirty-five new little white dimity beds were added to\r\nthe establishment. Mm. Rose used to take out the little Lord in the\r\none-horse chaise with her when she paid visits, until the Rector\'s\r\nlady and the Surgeon\'s wife almost died with envy. His own son and Lord\r\nBuckram having been discovered robbing an orchard together, the Doctor\r\nflogged his own flesh and blood most unmercifully for leading the young\r\nLord astray. He parted from him with tears. There was always a letter\r\ndirected to the Most Noble the Marquis ef Bagwig, on the Doctor\'s study\r\ntable, when any visitors were received by him.\r\n\r\nAt Eton, a great deal of Snobbishness was thrashed out of Lord Buckram,\r\nand he was birched with perfect impartiality. Even there, however, a\r\nselect band of sucking tuft-hunters followed him. Young Croesus lent\r\nhim three-and-twenty bran-new sovereigns out of his father\'s bank. Young\r\nSnaily did his exercises for him, and tried \'to know him at home;\' but\r\nYoung Bull licked him in a fight of fifty-five minutes, and he was caned\r\nseveral times with great advantage for not sufficiently polishing his\r\nmaster Smith\'s shoes. Boys are not ALL toadies in the morning of life.\r\n\r\nBut when he went to the University, crowds of toadies sprawled over\r\nhim. The tutors toadied him. The fellows in hall paid him great clumsy\r\ncompliments. The Dean never remarked his absence from Chapel, or heard\r\nany noise issuing from his rooms. A number of respectable young fellows,\r\n(it is among the respectable, the Baker Street class, that Snobbishness\r\nflourishes, more than among any set of people in England)--a number of\r\nthese clung to him like leeches. There was no end now to Croesus\'s loans\r\nof money; and Buckram couldn\'t ride out with the hounds, but Snaily (a\r\ntimid creature by nature) was in the field, and would take any leap at\r\nwhich his friend chose to ride. Young Rose came up to the same College,\r\nhaving been kept back for that express purpose by his father. He spent a\r\nquarter\'s allowance in giving Buckram a single dinner; but he knew\r\nthere was always pardon for him for extravagance in such a cause; and a\r\nten-pound note always came to him from home when he mentioned Buckram\'s\r\nname in a letter. What wild visions entered the brains of Mrs. Podge\r\nand Miss Podge, the wife and daughter of the Principal of Lord Buckram\'s\r\nCollege, I don\'t know, but that reverend old gentleman was too profound\r\na flunkey by nature ever for one minute to think that a child of his\r\ncould marry a nobleman. He therefore hastened on his daughter\'s union\r\nwith Professor Crab.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Buckram, after taking his honorary degree, (for Alma Mater is\r\na Snob, too, and truckles to a Lord like the rest,)--when Lord Buckram\r\nwent abroad to finish his education, you all know what dangers he ran,\r\nand what numbers of caps were set at him. Lady Leach and her daughters\r\nfollowed him from Paris to Rome, and from Rome to Baden-Baden;\r\nMiss Leggitt burst into tears before his face when he announced his\r\ndetermination to quit Naples, and fainted on the neck of her mamma:\r\nCaptain Macdragon, of Macdragonstown, County Tipperary, called upon\r\nhim to \'explene his intintions with respect to his sisther, Miss Amalia\r\nMacdragon, of Macdragonstown,\' and proposed to shoot him unless he\r\nmarried that spotless and beautiful young creature, who was afterwards\r\nled to the altar by Mr. Muff, at Cheltenham. If perseverance and forty\r\nthousand pounds down could have tempted him, Miss Lydia Croesus would\r\ncertainly have been Lady Buckram. Count Towrowski was glad to take her\r\nwith half the meney, as all the genteel world knows.\r\n\r\nAnd now, perhaps, the reader is anxious to know what sort of a man\r\nthis is who wounded so many ladies\' hearts, and who has been such a\r\nprodigious favourite with men. If we were to describe him it would be\r\npersonal. Besides, it really does not matter in the least what sort of a\r\nman he is, or what his personal qualities are.\r\n\r\nSuppose he is a young nobleman of a literary turn, and that he published\r\npoems ever so foolish and feeble, the Snobs would purchase thousands\r\nof his volumes: the publishers (who refused my Passion-Flowers, and\r\nmy grand Epic at any price) would give him his own. Suppose he is a\r\nnobleman of a jovial turn, and has a fancy for wrenching off knockers,\r\nfrequenting ginshops, and half murdering policemen: the public will\r\nsympathize good-naturedly with his amusements, and say he is a hearty,\r\nhonest fellow. Suppose he is fond of play and the turf; and has a fancy\r\nto be a blackleg, and occasionally condescends to pluck a pigeon at\r\ncards; the public will pardon him, and many honest people will court\r\nhim, as they would court a housebreaker if he happened to be a Lord.\r\nSuppose he is an idiot; yet, by the glorious constitution, he is good\r\nenough to govern US. Suppose he is an honest, highminded gentleman; so\r\nmuch the better for himself. But he may be an ass, and yet respected; or\r\na ruffian, and yet be exceedingly popular; or a rogue, and yet excuses\r\nwill be found for him. Snobs will still worship him. Male Snobs will do\r\nhim honour, and females look kindly upon him, however hideous he may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI--ON SOME RESPECTABLE SNOBS\r\n\r\nHaving received a great deal of obloquy for dragging monarchs, princes,\r\nand the respected nobility into the Snob category, I trust to please\r\neverybody in the present chapter, by stating my firm opinion that it\r\nis among the RESPECTABLE classes of this vast and happy empire that the\r\ngreatest profusion of Snobs is to be found. I pace down my beloved Baker\r\nStreet, (I am engaged on a life of Baker, founder of this celebrated\r\nstreet,) I walk in Harley Street (where every other house has a\r\nhatchment), Wimpole Street, that is as cheerful as the Catacombs--a\r\ndingy Mausoleum of the genteel:--I rove round Regent\'s Park, where the\r\nplaster is patching off the house walls; where Methodist preachers are\r\nholding forth to three little children in the green inclosures, and\r\npuffy valetudinarians are cantering in the solitary mud:--I thread the\r\ndoubtful ZIG-ZAGS of May Fair, where Mrs. Kitty Lorimer\'s Brougham may\r\nbe seen drawn up next door to old Lady Lollipop\'s belozenged family\r\ncoach;--I roam through Belgravia, that pale and polite district, where\r\nall the inhabitants look prim and correct, and the mansions are painted\r\na faint whity-brown: I lose myself in the new squares and terraces of\r\nthe brilliant bran-new Bayswater-and-Tyburn-Junction line; and in one\r\nand all of these districts the same truth comes across me. I stop before\r\nany house at hazard, and say, \'O house, you are inhabited--O knocker,\r\nyou are knocked at--O undressed flunkey, sunning your lazy calves as\r\nyou lean against the iron railings, you are paid--by Snobs.\' It is\r\na tremendous thought that; and it is almost sufficient to drive a\r\nbenevolent mind to madness to think that perhaps there is not one in\r\nten of those houses where the \'Peerage\' does not lie on the drawing-room\r\ntable. Considering the harm that foolish lying book does, I would have\r\nall the copies of it burned, as the barber burned all Quixote\'s books of\r\nhumbugging chivalry.\r\n\r\nLook at this grand house in the middle of the square. The Earl of\r\nLoughcorrib lives there: he has fifty thousand a year. A DEJEUNER\r\nDANSANT given at his house last week cost, who knows how much? The\r\nmere flowers for the room and bouquets for the ladies cost four hundred\r\npounds. That man in drab trousers, coming crying down the stops, is a\r\ndun: Lord Loughcorrib has ruined him, and won\'t see him: that is his\r\nlordship peeping through the blind of his study at him now. Go thy ways,\r\nLoughcorrib, thou art a Snob, a heartless pretender, a hypocrite of\r\nhospitality; a rogue who passes forged notes upon society;--but I am\r\ngrowing too eloquent.\r\n\r\nYou see that nice house, No. 23, where a butcher\'s boy is ringing the\r\narea-bell. He has three muttonchops in his tray. They are for the dinner\r\nof a very different and very respectable family; for Lady Susan Scraper,\r\nand her daughters, Miss Scraper and Miss Emily Scraper. The domestics,\r\nluckily for them, are on board wages--two huge footmen in light blue and\r\ncanary, a fat steady coachman who is a Methodist, and a butler who\r\nwould never have stayed in the family but that he was orderly to General\r\nScraper when the General distinguished himself at Walcheren. His widow\r\nsent his portrait to the United Service Club, and it is hung up in\r\none of the back dressing-closets there. He is represented at a parlour\r\nwindow with red curtains; in the distance is a whirlwind, in which\r\ncannon are firing off; and he is pointing to a chart, on which are\r\nwritten the words \'Walcheren, Tobago.\'\r\n\r\nLady Susan is, as everybody knows by referring to the \'British Bible,\' a\r\ndaughter of the great and good Earl Bagwig before mentioned. She thinks\r\neverything belonging to her the greatest and best in the world. The\r\nfirst of men naturally are the Buckrams, her own race: then follow in\r\nrank the Scrapers. The General was the greatest general: his eldest son,\r\nScraper Buckram Scraper, is at present the greatest and best; his second\r\nson the next greatest and best; and herself the paragon of women.\r\n\r\nIndeed, she is a most respectable and honourable lady. She goes to\r\nchurch of course: she would fancy the Church in danger if she did not.\r\nShe subscribes to Church and parish charities; and is a directress\r\nof meritorious charitable institutions--of Queen Charlotte\'s Lying-in\r\nHospital, the Washerwomen\'s Asylum, the British Drummers\' Daughters\'\r\nHome, &c.. She is a model of a matron.\r\n\r\nThe tradesman never lived who could say that he was not paid on\r\nthe quarter-day. The beggars of her neighbourhood avoid her like a\r\npestilence; for while she walks out, protected by John, that domestic\r\nhas always two or three mendicity tickets ready for deserving objects.\r\nTen guineas a year will pay all her charities. There is no respectable\r\nlady in all London who gets her name more often printed for such a sum\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nThose three mutton-chops which you see entering at the kitchen-door will\r\nbe served on the family-plate at seven o\'clock this evening, the huge\r\nfootman being present, and the butler in black, and the crest and\r\ncoat-of-arms of the Scrapers blazing everywhere. I pity Miss Emily\r\nScraper--she is still young--young and hungry. Is it a fact that she\r\nspends her pocket-money in buns? Malicious tongues say so; but she has\r\nvery little to spare for buns, the poor little hungry soul! For the\r\nfact is, that when the footmen, and the ladies\' maids, and the fat\r\ncoach-horses, which are jobbed, and the six dinner-parties in the\r\nseason, and the two great solemn evening-parties, and the rent of the\r\nbig house, and the journey to an English or foreign watering-place for\r\nthe autumn, are paid, my lady\'s income has dwindled away to a very small\r\nsum, and she is as poor as you or I.\r\n\r\nYou would not think it when you saw her big carriage rattling up to the\r\ndrawing-room, and caught a glimpse of her plumes, lappets, and diamonds,\r\nwaving over her ladyship\'s sandy hair and majestical hooked nose;--you\r\nwould not think it when you hear \'Lady Susan Scraper\'s carriage\' bawled\r\nout at midnight so as to disturb all Belgravia:--you would not think it\r\nwhen she comes rustling into church, the obsequious John behind with the\r\nbag of Prayer-books. Is it possible, you would say, that so grand and\r\nawful a personage as that can be hard-up for money? Alas! So it is.\r\n\r\nShe never heard such a word as Snob, I will engage, in this wicked and\r\nvulgar world. And, O stars and garters! how she would start if she heard\r\nthat she--she, as solemn as Minerva--she, as chaste as Diana (without\r\nthat heathen goddess\'s unladylike propensity for field-sports)--that she\r\ntoo was a Snob!\r\n\r\nA Snob she is, as long as she sets that prodigious value upon herself,\r\nupon her name, upon her outward appearance, and indulges in that\r\nintolerable pomposity; as long as she goes parading abroad, like\r\nSolomon in all his glory; as long as she goes to bed--as I believe she\r\ndoes--with a turban and a bird of paradise in it, and a court train\r\nto her night-gown; as long as she is so insufferably virtuous and\r\ncondescending; as long as she does not cut at least one of those footmen\r\ndown into mutton-chops for the benefit of the young ladies.\r\n\r\nI had my notions of her from my old schoolfellow,--her son Sydney\r\nScraper--a Chancery barrister without any practice--the most placid,\r\npolite, and genteel of Snobs, who never exceeded his allowance of two\r\nhundred a year, and who may be seen any evening at the \'Oxford and\r\nCambridge Club,\' simpering over the QUARTERLY REVIEW, in the blameless\r\nenjoyment of his half-pint of port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII--ON SOME RESPECTABLE SNOBS\r\n\r\nLook at the next house to Lady Susan Scraper\'s. The first mansion with\r\nthe awning over the door: that canopy will be let down this evening for\r\nthe comfort of the friends of Sir Alured and Lady S. de Mogyns, whose\r\nparties are so much admired by the public, and the givers themselves.\r\n\r\nPeach-coloured liveries laced with silver, and pea-green plush\r\ninexpressibles, render the De Mogyns\' flunkeys the pride of the ring\r\nwhen they appear in Hyde Park where Lady de Mogyns, as she sits upon\r\nher satin cushions, with her dwarf spaniel in her arms, bows to the very\r\nselectest of the genteel. Times are altered now with Mary Anne, or, as\r\nshe calls herself, Marian de Mogyns.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of Captain Flack of the Rathdrum Fencibles, who\r\ncrossed with his regiment over from Ireland to Caermarthenshire ever\r\nso many years ago, and defended Wales from the Corsican invader. The\r\nRathdrums were quartered at Pontydwdlm, where Marian wooed and won her\r\nDe Mogyns, a young banker in the place. His attentions to Miss Flack at\r\na race ball were such that her father said De Mogyns must either die on\r\nthe field of honour, or become his son-in-law. He preferred marriage.\r\nHis name was Muggins then, and his father--a flourishing banker,\r\narmy-contractor, smuggler, and general jobber--almost disinherited him\r\non account of this connection.\r\n\r\nThere is a story that Muggins the Elder was made a baronet for having\r\nlent money to a R-y-l p-rs-n-ge. I do not believe it. The R-y-l Family\r\nalways paid their debts, from the Prince of Wales downwards.\r\n\r\nHowbeit, to his life\'s end he remained simple Sir Thomas Muggins,\r\nrepresenting Pontydwdlm in Parliament for many years after the war. The\r\nold banker died in course of time, and to use the affectionate phrase\r\ncommon on such occasions, \'cut up\' prodigiously well. His son, Alfred\r\nSmith Mogyns, succeeded to the main portion of his wealth, and to his\r\ntitles and the bloody hand of his scutcheon. It was not for many years\r\nafter that he appeared as Sir Alured Mogyns Smyth de Mogyns, with a\r\ngenealogy found out for him by the Editor of \'Fluke\'s Peerage,\' and\r\nwhich appears as follows in that work:--\'De Mogyns.--Sir Alured Mogyns\r\nSmyth, Second Baronet. This gentleman is a representative of one of the\r\nmost ancient families of Wales, who trace their descent until it is lost\r\nin the mists of antiquity. A genealogical tree beginning with Shem is in\r\nthe possession of the family, and is stated by a legend of many thousand\r\nyears\' date to have been drawn on papyrus by a grandson of the patriarch\r\nhimself. Be this as it may, there can be no doubt of the immense\r\nantiquity of the race of Mogyns.\r\n\r\n\'In the time of Boadicea, Hogyn Mogyn, of the hundred Beeves, was a\r\nsuitor and a rival of Caractacus for the hand of that Princess. He was\r\na person gigantic in stature, and was slain by Suetonius in the battle\r\nwhich terminated the liberties of Britain. From him descended directly\r\nthe Princes of Pontydwdlm, Mogyn of the Golden Harp (see the Mabinogion\r\nof Lady Charlotte Guest,) Bogyn-Merodac-ap-Mogyn, (the black fiend son\r\nof Mogyn,) and a long list of bards and warriors, celebrated both in\r\nWales and Armorica. The independent Princes of Mogyn long held out\r\nagainst the ruthless Kings of England, until finally Gam Mogyns made his\r\nsubmission to Prince Henry, son of Henry IV., and under the name of Sir\r\nDavid Gam de Mogyns, was distinguished at the battle of Agincourt.\r\n\r\nFrom him the present Baronet is descended. (And here the descent follows\r\nin order until it comes to) Thomas Muggins, first Baronet of Pontydwdlm\r\nCastle, for 23 years Member of Parliament for that borough, who had\r\nissue, Alured Mogyns Smyth, the present Baronet, who married Marian,\r\ndaughter of the late general P. Flack, of Ballyflack, in the Kingdom of\r\nIreland of the Counts Flack of the H. R. Empire. Sir Alured has issue,\r\nAlured Caradoc, born 1819, Marian, 1811, Blanche Adeliza, Emily Doria,\r\nAdelaide Obleans, Katinka Rostopchin, Patrick Flack, died 1809.\r\n\r\n\'Arms--a mullion garbled, gules on a saltire reversed of the second.\r\nCrest--a tom-tit rampant regardant. Motto--UNG ROY UNG MOGYNS.\'\r\n\r\nIt was long before Lady de Mogyns shone as a star in the fashionable\r\nworld. At first, poor Muggins was the in the hands of the Flacks, the\r\nClancys, the Tooles, the Shanahans, his wife\'s Irish relations; and\r\nwhilst he was yet but heir-apparent, his house overflowed with claret\r\nand the national nectar, for the benefit of Hibernian relatives. Tom\r\nTufto absolutely left the street in which they lived in London, because\r\nhe said \'it was infected with such a confounded smell of whisky from the\r\nhouse of those IWISH people.\'\r\n\r\nIt was abroad that they learned to be genteel. They pushed into all\r\nforeign courts, and elbowed their way into the halls of Ambassadors.\r\nThey pounced upon the stray nobility, and seized young lords travelling\r\nwith their bear-leaders. They gave parties at Naples, Rome, and Paris.\r\nThey got a Royal Prince to attend their SOIREES at the latter place, and\r\nit was here that they first appeared under the name of De Mogyns, which\r\nthey bear with such splendour to this day.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of stories are told of the desperate efforts made by the\r\nindomitable Lady de Mogyns to gain the place she now occupies, and those\r\nof my beloved readers who live in middle life, and are unacquainted\r\nwith the frantic struggles, the wicked feuds, the intrigues, cabals,\r\nand disappointments which, as I am given to understand, reign in the\r\nfashionable world, may bless their stars that they at least are not\r\nFASHIONABLE Snobs. The intrigues set afoot by the De Mogyns to get\r\nthe Duchess of Buckskin to her parties, would strike a Talleyrand\r\nwith admiration. She had a brain fever after being disappointed of an\r\ninvitation to Lady Aldermanbury\'s THE DANSANT, and would have committed\r\nsuicide but for a ball at Windsor. I have the following story from my\r\nnoble friend Lady Clapperclaw herself,--Lady Kathleen O\'Shaughnessy that\r\nwas, and daughter of the Earl of Turfanthunder:--\r\n\r\n\'When that odious disguised Irishwoman, Lady Muggins, was struggling to\r\ntake her place in the world, and was bringing out her hidjous daughter\r\nBlanche,\' said old Lady Clapperclaw--(Marian has a hump-back and doesn\'t\r\nshow, but she\'s the only lady in the family)--\'when that wretched Polly\r\nMuggins was bringing out Blanche, with her radish of a nose, and her\r\ncarrots of ringlets, and her turnip for a face, she was most anxious--as\r\nher father had been a cowboy on my father\'s land--to be patronized\r\nby us, and asked me point-blank, in the midst of a silence at Count\r\nVolauvent\'s, the French Ambassador\'s dinner, why I had not sent her a\r\ncard for my ball?\r\n\r\n\'"Because my rooms are already too full, and your ladyship would be\r\ncrowded inconveniently," says I; indeed she takes up as much room as an\r\nelephant: besides I wouldn\'t have her, and that was flat.\r\n\r\n\'I thought my answer was a settler to her: but the next day she comes\r\nweeping to my arms--"Dear Lady Clapperclaw," says she, "it\'s not for ME;\r\nI ask it for my blessed Blanche! a young creature in her first season,\r\nand not at your ball! My tender child will pine and die of vexation. I\r\ndon\'t want to come. I will stay at home to nurse Sir Alured in the gout.\r\nMrs. Bolster is going, I know; she will be Blanche\'s chaperon."\r\n\r\n\'"You wouldn\'t subscribe for the Rathdrum blanket and potato fund; you,\r\nwho come out of the parish," says I, "and whose grandfather, honest man,\r\nkept cows there."\r\n\r\n\'"Will twenty guineas be enough, dearest Lady Clapperclaw?"\r\n\r\n\'"Twenty guineas is sufficient," says I, and she paid them; so I said,\r\n"Blanche may come, but not you, mind:" and she left me with a world of\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\'Would you believe it?--when my ball came, the horrid woman made her\r\nappearance with her daughter!\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you not to come?" said I, in a mighty passion. "What\r\nwould the world have said?" cries my Lady Muggins: "my carriage is gone\r\nfor Sir Alured to the Club; let me stay only ten minutes, dearest Lady\r\nClapperclaw."\r\n\r\n\'"Well as you are here, madam, you may stay and get your supper," I\r\nanswered, and so left her, and never spoke a word more to her all night.\r\n\r\n\'And now,\' screamed out old Lady Clapperclaw, clapping her hands, and\r\nspeaking with more brogue than ever, \'what do you think, after all\r\nmy kindness to her, the wicked, vulgar, odious, impudent upstart of s\r\ncowboy\'s granddaughter, has done?--she cut me yesterday in Hy\' Park, and\r\nhasn\'t sent me a ticket for her ball to-night, though they say Prince\r\nGeorge is to be there.\'\r\n\r\nYes, such is the fact. In the race of fashion the resolute and active\r\nDe Mogyns has passed the poor old Clapperclaw. Her progress in gentility\r\nmay be traced by the sets of friends whom she has courted, and made,\r\nand cut, and left behind her. She has struggled so gallantly for polite\r\nreputation that she has won it: pitilessly kicking down the ladder as\r\nshe advanced degree by degree.\r\n\r\nIrish relations were first sacrificed; she made her father dine in the\r\nsteward\'s room, to his perfect contentment: and would send Sir Alured\r\nthither like-wise but that he is a peg on which she hopes to hang her\r\nfuture honours; and is, after all, paymaster of her daughter\'s fortunes.\r\nHe is meek and content. He has been so long a gentleman that he is used\r\nto it, and acts the part of governor very well. In the day-time he goes\r\nfrom the \'Union\' to \'Arthur\'s,\' and from \'Arthur\'s\' to the \'Union.\' He\r\nis a dead hand at piquet, and loses a very comfortable maintenance to\r\nsome young fellows, at whist, at the \'Travellers\'.\'\r\n\r\nHis son has taken his father\'s seat in Parliament, and has of course\r\njoined Young England. He is the only man in the country who believes in\r\nthe De Mogynses, and sighs for the days when a De Mogyns led the van of\r\nbattle. He has written a little volume of spoony puny poems. He wears a\r\nlock of the hair of Laud, the Confessor and Martyr, and fainted when\r\nhe kissed the Pope\'s toe at Rome. He sleeps in white kid-gloves, and\r\ncommits dangerous excesses upon green tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII--GREAT CITY SNOBS\r\n\r\nThere is no disguising the fact that this series of papers is making\r\na prodigious sensation among all classes in this Empire. Notes of\r\nadmiration (!), of interrogation (?), of remonstrance, approval, or\r\nabuse, come pouring into MR. PUNCH\'S box. We have been called to task\r\nfor betraying the secrets of three different families of De Mogyns; no\r\nless than four Lady Scrapers have been discovered; and young gentlemen\r\nare quite shy of ordering half-a-pint of port and simpering over the\r\nQUARTERLY REVIEW at the Club, lest they should be mistaken for Sydney\r\nScraper, Esq. \'What CAN be your antipathy to Baker Street?\' asks some\r\nfair remonstrant, evidently writing from that quarter.\r\n\r\n\'Why only attack the aristocratic Snobs?\' says one \'estimable\r\ncorrespondent: \'are not the snobbish Snobs to have their turn?\'--\'Pitch\r\ninto the University Snobs!\' writes an indignant gentleman (who\r\nspelt ELEGANT with two I\'s)--\'Show up the Clerical Snob,\' suggests\r\nanother.--\'Being at "Meurice\'s Hotel," Paris, some time since,\' some wag\r\nhints, \'I saw Lord B. leaning out of the window with his boots in his\r\nhand, and bawling out "GARCON, CIREZ-MOI CES BOTTES." Oughtn\'t he to be\r\nbrought in among the Snobs?\'\r\n\r\nNo; far from it. If his lordship\'s boots are dirty, it is because he is\r\nLord B., and walks. There is nothing snobbish in having only one pair of\r\nboots, or a favourite pair; and certainly nothing snobbish in desiring\r\nto have them cleaned. Lord B., in so doing, performed a perfectly\r\nnatural and gentlemanlike action; for which I am so pleased with him\r\nthat I have had him designed in a favourable and elegant attitude, and\r\nput at the head of this Chapter in the place of honour. No, we are not\r\npersonal in these candid remarks. As Phidias took the pick of a score of\r\nbeauties before he completed a Venus, so have we to examine, perhaps, a\r\nthousand Snobs, before one is expressed upon paper.\r\n\r\nGreat City Snobs are the next in the hierarchy, and ought to be\r\nconsidered. But here is a difficulty. The great City Snob is commonly\r\nmost difficult of access. Unless you are a capitalist, you cannot visit\r\nhim in the recesses of his bank parlour in Lombard Street. Unless you\r\nare a sprig of nobility there is little hope of seeing him at home. In\r\na great City Snob firm there is generally one partner whose name is down\r\nfor charities, and who frequents Exeter Hall; you may catch a glimpse\r\nof another (a scientific City Snob) at my Lord N----\'s SOIREES, or the\r\nlectures of the London Institution; of a third (a City Snob of taste)\r\nat picture-auctions, at private views of exhibitions, or at the Opera or\r\nthe Philharmonic. But intimacy is impossible, in most cases, with this\r\ngrave, pompous, and awful being.\r\n\r\nA mere gentleman may hope to sit at almost anybody\'s table--to take\r\nhis place at my lord duke\'s in the country--to dance a quadrille at\r\nBuckingham Palace itself--(beloved Lady Wilhelmina Wagglewiggle! do you\r\nrecollect the sensation we made at the ball of our late adored Sovereign\r\nQueen Caroline, at Brandenburg House, Hammersmith?) but the City Snob\'s\r\ndoors are, for the most part, closed to him; and hence all that one\r\nknows of this great class is mostly from hearsay.\r\n\r\nIn other countries of Europe, the Banking Snob is more expansive and\r\ncommunicative than with us, and receives all the world into his\r\ncircle. For instance, everybody knows the princely hospitalities of the\r\nScharlaschild family at Paris, Naples, Frankfort, &c.. They entertain\r\nall the world, even the poor, at their FETES. Prince Polonia, at Rome,\r\nand his brother, the Duke of Strachino, are also remarkable for their\r\nhospitalities. I like the spirit of the first-named nobleman. Titles not\r\ncosting much in the Roman territory, he has had the head clerk of the\r\nbanking-house made a Marquis, and his Lordship will screw a BAJOCCO\r\nout of you in exchange as dexterously as any commoner could do. It is a\r\ncomfort to be able to gratify such grandees with a farthing or two;\r\nit makes the poorest man feel that he can do good. \'The Polonias have\r\nintermarried with the greatest and most ancient families of Rome, and\r\nyou see their heraldic cognizance (a mushroom or on an azure field)\r\nquartered in a hundred places in the city with the arms of the Colonnas\r\nand Dorias.\r\n\r\nCity Snobs have the same mania for aristocratic marriages. I like to\r\nsee such. I am of a savage and envious nature,--I like to see these two\r\nhumbugs which, dividing, as they do, the social empire of this kingdom\r\nbetween them, hate each other naturally, making truce and uniting,\r\nfor the sordid interests of either. I like to see an old aristocrat,\r\nswelling with pride of race, the descendant of illustrious Norman\r\nrobbers, whose blood has been pure for centuries, and who looks down\r\nupon common Englishmen as a free American does on a nigger,--I like to\r\nsee old Stiffneck obliged to bow down his head and swallow his infernal\r\npride, and drink the cup of humiliation poured out by Pump and Aldgate\'s\r\nbutler. \'Pump and Aldgate, says he, \'your grandfather was a bricklayer,\r\nand his hod is still kept in the bank. Your pedigree begins in a\r\nworkhouse; mine can be dated from all the royal palaces of Europe. I\r\ncame over with the Conqueror; I am own cousin to Charles Martel, Orlando\r\nFurioso, Philip Augustus, Peter the Cruel, and Frederick Barbarossa.\r\nI quarter the Royal Arms of Brentford in my coat. I despise you, but I\r\nwant money; and I will sell you my beloved daughter, Blanche Stiffneck,\r\nfor a hundred thousand pounds, to pay off my mortgages. Let your son\r\nmarry her, and she shall become Lady Blanche Pump and Aldgate.\'\r\n\r\nOld Pump and Aldgate clutches at the bargain. And a comfortable thing\r\nit is to think that birth can be bought for money. So you learn to value\r\nit. Why should we, who don\'t possess it, set a higher store on it than\r\nthose who do? Perhaps the best use of that book, the \'Peerage,\' is to\r\nlook down the list, and see how many have bought and sold birth,--how\r\npoor sprigs of nobility somehow sell themselves to rich City Snobs\'\r\ndaughters, how rich City Snobs purchase noble ladies--and so to admire\r\nthe double baseness of the bargain.\r\n\r\nOld Pump and Aldgate buys the article and pays the money. The sale\r\nof the girl\'s person is blessed by a Bishop at St. George\'s, Hanover\r\nSquare, and next year you read, \'At Roehampton, on Saturday, the Lady\r\nBlanche Pump, of a son and heir.\r\n\r\nAfter this interesting event, some old acquaintance, who saw young Pump\r\nin the parlour at the bank in the City, said to him, familiarly, \'How\'s\r\nyour wife, Pump, my boy?\'\r\n\r\nMr. Pump looked exceedingly puzzled and disgusted, and, after a pause,\r\nsaid, \'LADY BLANCHE PUMP\' is pretty well, I thank you.\'\r\n\r\n\'OH, I THOUGHT SHE WAS YOUR WIFE!\' said the familiar brute, Snooks,\r\nwishing him good-bye; and ten minutes after, the story was all over the\r\nStock Exchange, where it is told, when young Pump appears, to this very\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the weary life this poor Pump, this martyr to Mammon, is\r\ncompelled to undergo. Fancy the domestic enjoyments of a man who has a\r\nwife who scorns him; who cannot see his own friends in his own house;\r\nwho having deserted the middle rank of life, is not yet admitted to\r\nthe higher; but who is resigned to rebuffs and delay and humiliation,\r\ncontented to think that his son will be more fortunate.\r\n\r\nIt used to be the custom of some very old-fashioned clubs in this city,\r\nwhen a gentleman asked for change a guinea, always to bring it to him\r\nin WASHED SILVER: that which had passed immediately out of the hands of\r\nvulgar being considered \'as too coarse to soil a gentleman\'s fingers.\'\r\nSo, when the City Snob\'s money has been washed during a generation\r\nor so; has been washed into estates, and woods, and castles, and\r\ntown-mansions, it is allowed to pass current as real aristocratic coin.\r\nOld Pump sweeps a shop, runs of messages, becomes a confidential clerk\r\nand partner. Pump the Second becomes chief of the house, spins more and\r\nmore money, marries his son to an Earl\'s daughter. Pump Tertius goes on\r\nwith the bank; but his chief business in life is to become the father of\r\nPump Quartus, who comes out a full-blown aristocrat, and takes his seat\r\nas Baron Pumpington, and his race rules hereditarily over this nation of\r\nSnobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX--ON SOME MILITARY SNOBS\r\n\r\nAs no society in the world is more agreeable than that of well-bred\r\nand well-informed military gentlemen, so, likewise, none is more\r\ninsufferable than that of Military Snobs. They are to be found of all\r\ngrades, from the General Officer, whose padded old breast twinkles over\r\nwith a score of stars, clasps, and decorations, to the budding\r\ncornet, who is shaving for a beard, and has just been appointed to the\r\nSaxe-Coburg Lancers.\r\n\r\nI have always admired that dispensation of rank in our country, which\r\nsets up this last-named little creature (who was flogged only last week\r\nbecause he could not spell) to command great whiskered warriors, who\r\nhave faced all dangers of climate and battle; which, because he has\r\nmoney, to lodge at the agent\'s, will place him over the heads of men\r\nwho have a thousand times more experience and desert: and which, in the\r\ncourse of time, will bring him all the honours of his profession, when\r\nthe veteran soldier he commanded has got no other reward for his bravery\r\nthan a berth in Chelsea Hospital, and the veteran officer he superseded\r\nhas slunk into shabby retirement, and ends his disappointed life on a\r\nthreadbare half-pay.\r\n\r\nWhen I read in the GAZETTE such announcements as \'Lieutenant and Captain\r\nGrig, from the Bombardier Guards, to be Captain, vice Grizzle, who\r\nretires,\' I know what becomes of the Peninsular Grizzle; I follow him in\r\nspirit to the humble country town, where he takes up his quarters,\r\nand occupies himself with the most desperate attempts to live like a\r\ngentleman, on the stipend of half a tailor\'s foreman; and I picture to\r\nmyself little Grig rising from rank to rank, skipping from one regiment\r\nto another, with an increased grade in each, avoiding disagreeable\r\nforeign service, and ranking as a colonel at thirty;--all because he has\r\nmoney, and Lord Grigsby is his father, who had the same luck before him.\r\nGrig must blush at first to give his orders to old men in every way his\r\nbetters. And as it is very difficult for a spoiled child to escape being\r\nselfish and arrogant, so it is a very hard task indeed for this spoiled\r\nchild of fortune not to be a Snob.\r\n\r\nIt must have often been a matter of wonder to the candid reader, that\r\nthe army, the most enormous job of all our political institutions,\r\nshould yet work so well in the field; and we must cheerfully give\r\nGrig, and his like, the credit for courage which they display whenever\r\noccasion calls for it. The Duke\'s dandy regiments fought as well as any\r\n(they said better than any, but that is absurd). The great Duke himself\r\nwas a dandy once, and jobbed on, as Marlborough did before him. But\r\nthis only proves that dandies are brave as well as other Britons--as\r\nall Britons. Let us concede that the high-born Grig rode into\r\nthe entrenchments at Sobraon as gallantly as Corporal Wallop, the\r\nex-ploughboy.\r\n\r\nThe times of war are more favourable to him than the periods of peace.\r\nThink of Grig\'s life in the Bombardier Guards, or the Jack-boot Guards;\r\nhis marches from Windsor to London, from London to Windsor, from\r\nKnightsbridge to Regent\'s Park; the idiotic services he has to perform,\r\nwhich consist in inspecting the pipeclay of his company, or the horses\r\nin the stable, or bellowing out \'Shoulder humps! Carry humps!\' all which\r\nduties the very smallest intellect that ever belonged to mortal man\r\nwould suffice to comprehend. The professional duties of a footman are\r\nquite as difficult and various. The red-jackets who hold gentlemen\'s\r\nhorses in St. James\'s Street could do the work just as well as those\r\nvacuous, good-natured, gentlemanlike, rickety little lieutenants, who\r\nmay be seen sauntering about Pall Mall, in high-heeled little boots, or\r\nrallying round the standard of their regiment in the Palace Court, at\r\neleven o\'clock, when the band plays. Did the beloved reader ever see\r\none of the young fellows staggering under the flag, or, above all, going\r\nthrough the operation of saluting it? It is worth a walk to the Palace\r\nto witness that magnificent piece of tomfoolery.\r\n\r\nI have had the honour of meeting once or twice an old gentleman, whom I\r\nlook upon to be a specimen of army-training, and who has served in\r\ncrack regiments, or commanded them, all his life. I allude to\r\nLieutenant-General the Honourable Sir George Granby Tufto, K.C.B.,\r\nK.T.S., K.H., K.S.W., &c. &c.. His manners are irreproachable generally;\r\nin society he is a perfect gentleman, and a most thorough Snob.\r\n\r\nA man can\'t help being a fool, be he ever so old, and Sir George is a\r\ngreater ass at sixty-eight than he was when he first entered the army at\r\nfifteen. He distinguished himself everywhere: his name is mentioned\r\nwith praise in a score of Gazettes: he is the man, in fact, whose padded\r\nbreast, twinkling over with innumerable decorations, has already been\r\nintroduced to the reader. It is difficult to say what virtues this\r\nprosperous gentleman possesses. He never read a book in his life, and,\r\nwith his purple, old gouty fingers, still writes a schoolboy hand. He\r\nhas reached old age and grey hairs without being the least venerable. He\r\ndresses like an outrageously young man to the present moment, and laces\r\nand pads his old carcass as if he were still handsome George Tufto of\r\n1800. He is selfish, brutal, passionate, and a glutton. It is curious\r\nto mark him at table, and see him heaving in his waistband, his little\r\nbloodshot eyes gloating over his meal. He swears considerably in his\r\ntalk, and tells filthy garrison stories after dinner. On account of his\r\nrank and his services, people pay the bestarred and betitled old brute\r\na sort of reverence; and he looks down upon you and me, and exhibits\r\nhis contempt for us, with a stupid and artless candour which is quite\r\namusing to watch. Perhaps, had he been bred to another profession, he\r\nwould not have been the disreputable old creature he now is. But what\r\nother? He was fit for none; too incorrigibly idle and dull for any trade\r\nbut this, in which he has distinguished himself publicly as a good and\r\ngallant officer, and privately for riding races, drinking port, fighting\r\nduels, and seducing women. He believes himself to be one of the most\r\nhonourable and deserving beings in the world. About Waterloo Place,\r\nof afternoons, you may see him tottering in his varnished boots, and\r\nleering under the bonnets of the women who pass by. When he dies of\r\napoplexy, THE TIMES will have a quarter of a column about his services\r\nand battles--four lines of print will be wanted to describe his titles\r\nand orders alone--and the earth will cover one of the wickedest and\r\ndullest old wretches that ever strutted over it.\r\n\r\nLest it should be imagined that I am of so obstinate a misanthropic\r\nnature as to be satisfied with nothing, I beg (for the comfort of the\r\nforces) to state my belief that the army is not composed of such persons\r\nas the above. He has only been selected for the study of civilians and\r\nthe military, as a specimen of a prosperous and bloated Army Snob. No:\r\nwhen epaulets are not sold; when corporal punishments are abolished, and\r\nCorporal Smith has a chance to have his gallantry rewarded as well\r\nas that of Lieutenant Grig; when there is no such rank as ensign and\r\nlieutenant (the existence of which rank is an absurd anomaly, and an\r\ninsult upon all the rest of the army), and should there be no war, I\r\nshould not be disinclined to be a major-general myself.\r\n\r\nI have a little sheaf of Army Snobs in my portfolio, but shall pause in\r\nmy attack upon the forces till next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--MILITARY SNOBS\r\n\r\nWalking in the Park yesterday with my young friend Tagg, and discoursing\r\nwith him upon the next number of the Snob, at the very nick of time\r\nwho should pass us but two very good specimens of Military Snobs,--the\r\nSporting Military Snob, Capt. Rag, and the \'lurking\' or raffish Military\r\nSnob, Ensign Famish. Indeed you are fully sure to meet them lounging\r\non horseback, about five o\'clock, under the trees by the Serpentine,\r\nexamining critically the inmates of the flashy broughams which parade up\r\nand down \'the Lady\'s Mile.\'\r\n\r\nTagg and Rag are very well acquainted, and so the former, with that\r\ncandour inseparable from intimate friendship, told me his dear friend\'s\r\nhistory. Captain Rag is a small dapper north-country man. He went when\r\nquite a boy into a crack light cavalry regiment, and by the time he got\r\nhis troop, had cheated all his brother officers so completely, selling\r\nthem lame horses for sound ones, and winning their money by all manner\r\nof strange and ingenious contrivances, that his Colonel advised him to\r\nretire; which he did without much reluctance, accommodating a youngster,\r\nwho had just entered the regiment, with a glandered charger at an\r\nuncommonly stiff figure.\r\n\r\nHe has since devoted his time to billiards, steeple-chasing, and the\r\nturf. His head-quarters are \'Rummer\'s,\' in Conduit Street, where\r\nhe keeps his kit; but he is ever on the move in the exercise of his\r\nvocation as a gentleman-jockey and gentleman-leg.\r\n\r\nAccording to BELL\'S LIFE, he is an invariable attendant at all races,\r\nand an actor in most of them. He rode the winner at Leamington; he was\r\nleft for dead in a ditch a fortnight ago at Harrow; and yet there he\r\nwas, last week, at the Croix de Berny, pale and determined as ever,\r\nastonishing the BADAUDS of Paris by the elegance of his seat and the\r\nneatness of his rig, as he took a preliminary gallop on that vicious\r\nbrute \'The Disowned,\' before starting for \'the French Grand National.\'\r\n\r\nHe is a regular attendant at the Corner, where he compiles a limited but\r\ncomfortable libretto. During season he rides often in the Park, mounted\r\non a clever well-bred pony. He is to be seen escorting celebrated\r\nhorsewoman, Fanny Highflyer, or in confidential converse with Lord\r\nThimblerig, the eminent handicapper.\r\n\r\nHe carefully avoids decent society, and would rather dine off a steak at\r\nthe \'One Tun\' with Sam Snaffle the jockey, Captain O\'Rourke, and two or\r\nthree other notorious turf robbers, than with the choicest company in\r\nLondon. He likes to announce at \'Rummer\'s\' that he is going to run down\r\nand spend his Saturday and Sunday in a friendly way with Hocus, the leg,\r\nat his little box near Epsom; where, if report speak true, many \'rummish\r\nplants\' are concocted.\r\n\r\nHe does not play billiards often, and never in public: but when he does\r\nplay, he always contrives to get hold of a good flat, and never leaves\r\nhim till he has done him uncommonly brown. He has lately been playing a\r\ngood deal with Famish.\r\n\r\nWhen he makes his appearance in the drawing-room, which occasionally\r\nhappens at a hunt-meeting or a race-ball, he enjoys himself extremely.\r\n\r\nHis young friend is Ensign Famish, who is not a little pleased to be\r\nseen with such a smart fellow as Rag, who bows to the best turf company\r\nin the Park. Rag lets Famish accompany him to Tattersall\'s, and\r\nsells him bargains in horse-flesh, and uses Famish\'s cab. That young\r\ngentleman\'s regiment is in India, and he is at home on sick leave. He\r\nrecruits his health by being intoxicated every night, and fortifies his\r\nlungs, which are weak, by smoking cigars all day. The policemen about\r\nthe Haymarket know the little creature, and the early cabmen salute him.\r\nThe closed doors of fish and lobster shops open after service, and vomit\r\nout little Famish, who is either tipsy and quarrelsome--when he wants\r\nto fight the cabmen; or drunk and helpless--when some kind friend (in\r\nyellow satin) takes care of him. All the neighbourhood, the cabmen, the\r\npolice, the early potato-men, and the friends in yellow satin, know the\r\nyoung fellow, and he is called Little Bobby by some of the very worst\r\nreprobates in Europe.\r\n\r\nHis mother, Lady Fanny Famish, believes devoutly that Robert is in\r\nLondon solely for the benefit of consulting the physician; is going to\r\nhave him exchanged into a dragoon regiment, which doesn\'t go to that\r\nodious India; and has an idea that his chest is delicate, and that\r\nhe takes gruel every evening, when he puts his feet in hot water. Her\r\nLadyship resides at Cheltenham, and is of a serious turn.\r\n\r\nBobby frequents the \'Union Jack Club\' of course; where he breakfasts on\r\npale ale and devilled kidneys at three o\'clock; where beardless young\r\nheroes of his own sort congregate, and make merry, and give each other\r\ndinners; where you may see half-a-dozen of young rakes of the fourth\r\nor fifth order lounging and smoking on the steps; where you behold\r\nSlapper\'s long-tailed leggy mare in the custody of a red-jacket until\r\nthe Captain is primed for the Park with a glass of curacoa; and where\r\nyou see Hobby, of the Highland Buffs, driving up with Dobby, of the\r\nMadras Fusiliers, in the great banging, swinging cab, which the latter\r\nhires from Rumble of Bond Street.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Military Snobs are of such number and variety, that a hundred\r\nweeks of PUNCH would not suffice to give an audience to them. There is,\r\nbesides the disreputable old Military Snob, who has seen service, the\r\nrespectable old Military Snob, who has seen none, and gives himself the\r\nmost prodigious Martinet airs. There is the Medical-Military Snob, who\r\nis generally more outrageously military in his conversation than the\r\ngreatest SABREUR in the army. There is the Heavy-Dragoon Snob, whom\r\nyoung ladies, admire with his great stupid pink face and yellow\r\nmoustaches--a vacuous, solemn, foolish, but brave and honourable Snob.\r\nThere is the Amateur-Military Snob who writes Captain on his card\r\nbecause he is a Lieutenant in the Bungay Militia. There is the\r\nLady-killing Military Snob; and more, who need not be named.\r\n\r\nBut let no man, we repeat, charge MR. PUNCH with disrespect for the Army\r\nin general--that gallant and judicious Army, every man of which, from\r\nF.M. the Duke of Wellington, &c., downwards--(with the exception of\r\nH.R.H. Field-Marshal Prince Albert, who, however, can hardly count as a\r\nmilitary man,)--reads PUNCH in every quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nLet those civilians who sneer at the acquirements of the army read Sir\r\nHarry Smith\'s account of the Battle of Aliwal. A noble deed was never\r\ntold in nobler language. And you who doubt if chivalry exists, or the\r\nage of heroism has passed by, think of Sir Henry Hardinge, with his son,\r\n\'dear little Arthur,\' riding in front of the lines at Ferozeshah. I hope\r\nno English painter will endeavour to illustrate that scene; for who is\r\nthere to do justice to it? The history of the world contains no more\r\nbrilliant and heroic picture. No, no; the men who perform these\r\ndeeds with such brilliant valour, and describe them with such modest\r\nmanliness--SUCH are not Snobs. Their country admires them, their\r\nSovereign rewards them, and PUNCH, the universal railer, takes off his\r\nhat and, says, Heaven save them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI--ON CLERICAL SNOBS\r\n\r\nAfter Snobs-Military, Snobs-Clerical suggest themselves quite naturally,\r\nand it is clear that, with every respect for the cloth, yet having a\r\nregard for truth, humanity, and the British public, such a vast and\r\ninfluential class must not be omitted from our notices of the great Snob\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOf these Clerics there are some whose claim to snobbishness is\r\nundoubted, and yet it cannot be discussed here; for the same reason that\r\nPUNCH would not set up his show in a Cathedral, out of respect for\r\nthe solemn service celebrated within. There are some places where he\r\nacknowledges himself not privileged to make a noise, and puts away his\r\nshow, and silences his drum, and takes off his hat, and holds his peace.\r\n\r\nAnd I know this, that if there are some Clerics who do wrong, there are\r\nstraightway a thousand newspapers to haul up those unfortunates, and\r\ncry, \'Fie upon them, fie upon them!\' while, though the press is always\r\nready to yell and bellow excommunication against these stray delinquent\r\nparsons, it somehow takes very little count of the many good ones--of\r\nthe tens of thousands of honest men, who lead Christian lives, who give\r\nto the poor generously, who deny themselves rigidly, and live and die\r\nin their duty, without ever a newspaper paragraph in their favour. My\r\nbeloved friend and reader, I wish you and I could do the same: and let\r\nme whisper my belief, ENTRE NOUS that of those eminent philosophers who\r\ncry out against parsons the loudest, there are not many who have got\r\ntheir knowledge of the church by going thither often.\r\n\r\nBut you who have ever listened to village bells, or walked to church as\r\nchildren on sunny Sabbath mornings; you who have ever seen the parson\'s\r\nwife tending the poor man\'s bedside; or the town clergyman threading the\r\ndirty stairs of noxious alleys upon his business;--do not raise a shout\r\nwhen one falls away, or yell with the mob that howls after him.\r\n\r\nEvery man can do that. When old Father Noah was overtaken in his cups,\r\nthere was only one of his sons that dared to make merry at his disaster,\r\nand he was not the most virtuous of the family. Let us too turn away\r\nsilently, nor huzza like a parcel of school-boys, because some big young\r\nrebel suddenly starts up and whops the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nI confess, though, if I had by me the names of those seven or eight\r\nIrish bishops, the probates of whose wills were mentioned in last year\'s\r\njournals, and who died leaving behind them some two hundred thousand\r\na-piece--I would like to put THEM up as patrons of my Clerical Snobs,\r\nand operate upon them as successfully as I see from the newspapers Mr.\r\nEisenberg, Chiropodist, has lately done upon \'His Grace the Reverend\r\nLord Bishop of Tapioca.\'\r\n\r\nI confess that when those Right Reverend Prelates come up to the gates\r\nof Paradise with their probates of wills in their hands, I think that\r\ntheir chance is.... But the gates of Paradise is a far way to follow\r\ntheir Lordships; so let us trip down again lest awkward questions be\r\nasked there about our own favourite vices too.\r\n\r\nAnd don\'t let us give way to the vulgar prejudice, that clergymen are an\r\nover-paid and luxurious body of men. When that eminent ascetic, the\r\nlate Sydney Smith--(by the way, by what law of nature is it that so many\r\nSmiths in this world are called Sydney Smith?)--lauded the system of\r\ngreat prizes in the Church,--without which he said gentlemen would\r\nnot be induced to follow the clerical profession, he admitted most\r\npathetically that the clergy in general were by no means to be envied\r\nfor their worldly prosperity. From reading the works of some modern\r\nwriters of repute, you would fancy that a parson\'s life was passed\r\nin gorging himself with plum-pudding and port-wine; and that his\r\nReverence\'s fat chaps were always greasy with the crackling of tithe\r\npigs. Caricaturists delight to represent him so: round, short-necked,\r\npimple-faced, apoplectic, bursting out of waistcoat, like a\r\nblack-pudding, a shovel-hatted fuzz-wigged Silenus. Whereas, if you take\r\nthe real man, the poor fellow\'s flesh-pots are very scantily furnished\r\nwith meat. He labours commonly for a wage that a tailor\'s foreman\r\nwould despise: he has, too, such claims upon his dismal income as most\r\nphilosophers would rather grumble to meet; many tithes are levied upon\r\nHIS pocket, let it be remembered, by those who grudge him his means\r\nof livelihood. He has to dine with the Squire: and his wife must dress\r\nneatly; and he must \'look like a gentleman,\' as they call it, and bring\r\nup six great hungry sons as such. Add to this, if he does his duty,\r\nhe has such temptations to spend his money as no mortal man could\r\nwithstand. Yes; you who can\'t resist purchasing a chest of cigars,\r\nbecause they are so good; or an ormolu clock at Howell and James\'s,\r\nbecause it is such a bargain; or a box at the Opera, because Lablache\r\nand Grisi are divine in the PURITANI; fancy how difficult it is for a\r\nparson to resist spending a half-crown when John Breakstone\'s family\r\nare without a loaf; or \'standing\' a bottle of port for poor old Polly\r\nRabbits, who has her thirteenth child; or treating himself to a suit\r\nof corduroys for little Bob Scarecrow, whose breeches are sadly out at\r\nelbows. Think of these temptations, brother moralists and philosophers,\r\nand don\'t be too hard on the parson.\r\n\r\nBut what is this? Instead of \'showing up\' the parsons, are we indulging\r\nin maudlin praises of that monstrous black-coated race? O saintly\r\nFrancis, lying at rest under the turf; O Jimmy, and Johnny, and Willy,\r\nfriends of my youth! O noble and dear old Elias! how should he who\r\nknows you not respect you and your calling? May this pen never write a\r\npennyworth again, if it ever casts ridicule upon either!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII--ON CLERICAL SNOBS AND SNOBBISHNESS\r\n\r\n\'Dear Mr. Snob,\' an amiable young correspondent writes, who signs\r\nhimself Snobling, \'ought the clergyman who, at the request of a noble\r\nDuke, lately interrupted a marriage ceremony between two persons\r\nperfectly authorised to marry, to be ranked or not among the Clerical\r\nSnobs?\'\r\n\r\nThis, my dear young friend, is not a fair question. One of the\r\nillustrated weekly papers has already seized hold of the clergyman,\r\nand blackened him most unmercifully, by representing him in his cassock\r\nperforming the marriage service. Let that be sufficient punishment; and,\r\nif you please, do not press the query.\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that if Miss Smith had come with a licence to marry\r\nJones, the parson in question, not seeing old Smith present, would have\r\nsent off the beadle in a cab to let the old gentleman know what was\r\ngoing on; and would have delayed the service until the arrival of Smith\r\nsenior. He very likely thinks it his duty to ask all marriageable young\r\nladies, who come without their papa, why their parent is absent; and, no\r\ndoubt, ALWAYS sends off the beadle for that missing governor.\r\n\r\nOr, it is very possible that the Duke of Coeurdelion was Mr.\r\nWhat-d\'ye-call\'im\'s most intimate friend, and has often said to him,\r\n\'What-d\'ye-call\'im, my boy, my daughter must never marry the Capting.\r\nIf ever they try at your church, I beseech you, considering the terms of\r\nintimacy on which we are, to send off Rattan in a hack cab to fetch me.\'\r\n\r\nIn either of which cases, you see, dear Snobling, that though the parson\r\nwould not have been authorised, yet he might have been excused for\r\ninterfering. He has no more right to stop my marriage than to stop my\r\ndinner, to both of which, as a free-born Briton, I am entitled by law,\r\nif I can pay for them. But, consider pastoral solicitude, a deep sense\r\nof the duties of his office, and pardon this inconvenient, but genuine\r\nzeal.\r\n\r\nBut if the clergyman did in the Duke\'s case what he would NOT do in\r\nSmith\'s; if he has no more acquaintance with the Coeurdelion family than\r\nI have with the Royal and Serene House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha,--THEN, I\r\nconfess, my dear Snobling, your question might elicit a disagreeable\r\nreply, and one which I respectfully decline to give. I wonder what Sir\r\nGeorge Tufto would say, if a sentry left his post because a noble lord\r\n(not the least connected with the service) begged the sentinel not to do\r\nhis duty!\r\n\r\nAlas! that the beadle who canes little boys and drives them out, cannot\r\ndrive worldliness out too; what is worldliness but snobbishness? When,\r\nfor instance, I read in the newspapers that the Right Reverend the Lord\r\nCharles James administered the rite of confirmation to a PARTY OF THE\r\nJUVENILE NOBILITY at the Chapel Royal,--as if the Chapel Royal were a\r\nsort of ecclesiastical Almack\'s, and young people were to get ready for\r\nthe next world in little exclusive genteel knots of the aristocracy, who\r\nwere not to be disturbed in their journey thither by the company of\r\nthe vulgar:--when I read such a paragraph as that (and one or two such\r\ngenerally appear during the present fashionable season), it seems to me\r\nto be the most odious, mean and disgusting part of that odious, mean,\r\nand disgusting publication, the COURT CIRCULAR; and that snobbishness is\r\ntherein carried to quite an awful pitch. What, gentlemen, can\'t we even\r\nin the Church acknowledge a republic? There, at least, the Heralds\'\r\nCollege itself might allow that we all of us have the same pedigree,\r\nand are direct descendants of Eve and Adam, whose inheritance is divided\r\namongst us.\r\n\r\nI hereby call upon all Dukes, Earls, Baronets, and other potentates, not\r\nto lend themselves to this shameful scandal and error, and beseech all\r\nBishops who read this publication to take the matter into consideration,\r\nand to protest against the continuance of the practice, and to declare,\r\n\'We WON\'T confirm or christen Lord Tomnoddy, or Sir Carnaby Jenks, to\r\nthe exclusion of any other young Christian;\' the which declaration if\r\ntheir Lordships are induced to make, a great LAPIS OFFENSIONIS will be\r\nremoved, and the Snob Papers will not have been written in vain.\r\n\r\nA story is current of a celebrated NOUVEAU-RICHE, who having had\r\noccasion to oblige that excellent prelate the Bishop of Bullocksmithy,\r\nasked his Lordship, in return, to confirm his children privately in his\r\nLordship\'s own chapel; which ceremony the grateful prelate accordingly\r\nperformed. Can satire go farther than this? Is there even in this most\r\namusing of prints, any more NAIVE absurdity? It is as if a man wouldn\'t\r\ngo to heaven unless he went in a special train, or as if he thought (as\r\nsome people think about vaccination) Confirmation more effectual when\r\nadministered at first hand. When that eminent person, the Begum Sumroo,\r\ndied, it is said she left ten thousand pounds to the Pope, and ten\r\nthousand to the Archbishop of Canterbury,--so that there should be no\r\nmistake,--so as to make sure of having the ecclesiastical authorities on\r\nher side. This is only a little more openly and undisguisedly snobbish\r\nthan the cases before alluded to. A well-bred Snob is just as secretly\r\nproud of his riches and honours as a PARVENU Snob who makes the most\r\nludicrous exhibition of them; and a high-born Marchioness or Duchess\r\njust as vain of herself and her diamonds, as Queen Quashyboo, who sews a\r\npair of epaulets on to her skirt, and turns out in state in a cocked hat\r\nand feathers.\r\n\r\nIt is not out of disrespect to my \'Peerage,\' which I love and honour,\r\n(indeed, have I not said before, that I should be ready to jump out of\r\nmy skin if two Dukes would walk down Pall Mall with me?)--it is not out\r\nof disrespect for the individuals, that I wish these titles had never\r\nbeen invented; but, consider, if there were no tree, there would be no\r\nshadow; and how much more honest society would be, and how much more\r\nserviceable the clergy would be (which is our present consideration), if\r\nthese temptations of rank and continual baits of worldliness were not in\r\nexistence, and perpetually thrown out to lead them astray.\r\n\r\nI have seen many examples of their falling away. When, for instance, Tom\r\nSniffle first went into the country as Curate for Mr. Fuddleston (Sir\r\nHuddleston Fuddleston\'s brother), who resided on some other living,\r\nthere could not be a more kind, hardworking, and excellent creature\r\nthan Tom. He had his aunt to live with him. His conduct to his poor was\r\nadmirable. He wrote annually reams of the best-intentioned and vapid\r\nsermons. When Lord Brandyball\'s family came down into the country, and\r\ninvited him to dine at Brandyball Park, Sniffle was so agitated that he\r\nalmost forgot how to say grace, and upset a bowl of currant-jelly sauce\r\nin Lady Fanny Toffy\'s lap.\r\n\r\nWhat was the consequence of his intimacy with that noble family? He\r\nquarrelled with his aunt for dining out every night. The wretch forgot\r\nhis poor altogether, and killed his old nag by always riding over to\r\nBrandyball; where he revelled in the maddest passion for Lady Fanny.\r\nHe ordered the neatest new clothes and ecclesiastical waistcoats from\r\nLondon; he appeared with corazza-shirts, lackered boots, and perfumery;\r\nhe bought a blood-horse from Bob Toffy: was seen at archery meetings,\r\npublic breakfasts,--actually at cover; and, I blush to say, that I saw\r\nhim in a stall at the Opera; and afterwards riding by Lady Fanny\'s side\r\nin Rotten Row. He DOUBLE-BARRELLED his name, (as many poor Snobs do,)\r\nand instead of T. Sniffle, as formerly, came out, in a porcelain card,\r\nas Rev. T. D\'Arcy Sniffle, Burlington Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe end of all this may be imagined: when the Earl of Brandyball was\r\nmade acquainted with the curate\'s love for Lady Fanny, he had that fit\r\nof the gout which so nearly carried him off (to the inexpressible grief\r\nof his son, Lord Alicompayne), and uttered that remarkable speech to\r\nSniffle, which disposed of the claims of the latter:--\' If I didn\'t\r\nrespect the Church, Sir,\' his Lordship said, \'by Jove, I\'d kick you\r\ndownstairs:\' his Lordship then fell back into the fit aforesaid; and\r\nLady Fanny, as we all know, married General Podager.\r\n\r\nAs for poor Tom, he was over head and ears in debt as well as in\r\nlove: his creditors came down upon him. Mr. Hemp, of Portugal Street,\r\nproclaimed his name lately as a reverend outlaw; and he has been seen\r\nat various foreign watering-places; sometimes doing duty; sometimes\r\n\'coaching\' a stray gentleman\'s son at Carlsruhe or Kissingen;\r\nsometimes--must we say it?--lurking about the roulette-tables with a\r\ntuft to his chin.\r\n\r\nIf temptation had not come upon this unhappy fellow in the shape of\r\na Lord Brandyball, he might still have been following his profession,\r\nhumbly and worthily. He might have married his cousin with four thousand\r\npounds, the wine-merchant\'s daughter (the old gentleman quarrelled with\r\nhis nephew for not soliciting wine-orders from Lord B. for him): he\r\nmight have had seven children, and taken private pupils, and eked out\r\nhis income, and lived and died a country parson.\r\n\r\nCould he have done better? You who want to know how great, and good, and\r\nnoble such a character may be, read Stanley\'s \'Life of Doctor Arnold.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII--ON CLERICAL SNOBS\r\n\r\nAmong the varieties of the Snob Clerical, the University Snob and the\r\nScholastic Snob ought never to be forgotten; they form a very strong\r\nbattalion in the black-coated army.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of our ancestors (which I admire more and more every day)\r\nseemed to have determined that education of youth was so paltry and\r\nunimportant a matter, that almost any man, armed with a birch and\r\nregulation cassock and degree, might undertake the charge: and many an\r\nhonest country gentleman may be found to the present day, who takes very\r\ngood care to have a character with his butler when he engages him\r\nand will not purchase a horse without the warranty and the closest\r\ninspection; but sends off his son, young John Thomas, to school without\r\nasking any questions about the Schoolmaster, and places the lad at\r\nSwitchester College, under Doctor Block, because he (the good old\r\nEnglish gentleman) had been at Switchester, under Doctor Buzwig, forty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nWe have a love for all little boys at school; for many scores of\r\nthousands of them read and love PUNCH:--may he never write a word that\r\nshall not be honest and fit for them to read! He will not have his young\r\nfriends to be Snobs in the future, or to be bullied by Snobs, or\r\ngiven over to such to be educated. Our connexion with the youth at the\r\nUniversities is very close and affectionate. The candid undergraduate\r\nis our friend. The pompous old College Don trembles in his common room,\r\nlest we should attack him and show him up as a Snob.\r\n\r\nWhen railroads were threatening to invade the land which they have\r\nsince conquered, it may be recollected what a shrieking and outcry the\r\nauthorities of Oxford and Eton made, lest the iron abominations should\r\ncome near those seats of pure learning, and tempt the British youth\r\nastray. The supplications were in vain; the railroad is in upon them,\r\nand the old-world institutions are doomed. I felt charmed to read in the\r\npapers the other day a most veracious puffing advertisement headed, \'To\r\nCollege and back for Five Shillings.\' \'The College Gardens (it said)\r\nwill be thrown open on this occasion; the College youths will perform\r\na regatta; the Chapel of King\'s College will have its celebrated\r\nmusic;\'--and all for five shillings! The Goths have got into Rome;\r\nNapoleon Stephenson draws his republican lines round the sacred old\r\ncities and the ecclesiastical big-wigs who garrison them must prepare to\r\nlay down key and crosier before the iron conqueror.\r\n\r\nIf you consider, dear reader, what profound snobbishness the University\r\nSystem produced, you will allow that it is time to attack some of those\r\nfeudal middle-age superstitions. If you go down for five shillings to\r\nlook at the \'College Youths,\' you may see one sneaking down the court\r\nwithout a tassel to his cap; another with a gold or silver fringe to his\r\nvelvet trencher; a third lad with a master\'s gown and hat, walking at\r\nease over the sacred College grass-plats, which common men must not\r\ntread on.\r\n\r\nHe may do it because he is a nobleman. Because a lad is a lord, the\r\nUniversity gives him a degree at the end of two years which another is\r\nseven in acquiring. Because he is a lord, he has no call to go through\r\nan examination. Any man who has not been to College and back for\r\nfive shillings, would not believe in such distinctions in a place of\r\neducation, so absurd and monstrous do they seem to be.\r\n\r\nThe lads with gold and silver lace are sons of rich gentlemen and\r\ncalled Fellow Commoners; they are privileged to feed better than the\r\npensioners, and to have wine with their victuals, which the latter can\r\nonly get in their rooms.\r\n\r\nThe unlucky boys who have no tassels to their caps, are called\r\nsizars--SERVITORS at Oxford--(a very pretty and gentlemanlike title).\r\nA distinction is made in their clothes because they are poor; for which\r\nreason they wear a badge of poverty, and are not allowed to take their\r\nmeals with their fellow-students.\r\n\r\nWhen this wicked and shameful distinction was set up, it was of a piece\r\nwith all the rest--a part of the brutal, unchristian, blundering feudal\r\nsystem. Distinctions of rank were then so strongly insisted upon, that\r\nit would have been thought blasphemy to doubt them, as blasphemous as it\r\nis in parts of the United States now for a nigger to set up as the equal\r\nof a white man. A ruffian like Henry VIII. talked as gravely about the\r\ndivine powers vested in him, as if he had been an inspired prophet.\r\nA wretch like James I. not only believed that there was in himself a\r\nparticular sanctity, but other people believed him. Government regulated\r\nthe length of a merchant\'s shoes as well as meddled with his trade,\r\nprices, exports, machinery. It thought itself justified in roasting a\r\nman for his religion, or pulling a Jew\'s teeth out if he did not pay a\r\ncontribution, or ordered him to dress in a yellow gabardine, and locked\r\nhim in a particular quarter.\r\n\r\nNow a merchant may wear what boots he pleases, and has pretty nearly\r\nacquired the privilege of buying and selling without the Government\r\nlaying its paws upon the bargain. The stake for heretics is gone; the\r\npillory is taken down; Bishops are even found lifting up their voices\r\nagainst the remains of persecution, and ready to do away with the last\r\nCatholic Disabilities. Sir Robert Peel, though he wished it ever so\r\nmuch, has no power over Mr. Benjamin Disraeli\'s grinders, or any means\r\nof violently handling that gentleman\'s jaw. Jews are not called upon\r\nto wear badges: on the contrary, they may live in Piccadilly, or the\r\nMinories, according to fancy; they may dress like Christians, and do\r\nsometimes in a most elegant and fashionable manner.\r\n\r\nWhy is the poor College servitor to wear that name and that badge still?\r\nBecause Universities are the last places into which Reform penetrates.\r\nBut now that she can go to College and back for five shillings, let her\r\ntravel down thither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV--ON UNIVERSITY SNOBS\r\n\r\nAll the men of Saint Boniface will recognize Hugby and Crump in these\r\ntwo pictures. They were tutors in our time, and Crump is since advanced\r\nto be President of the College. He was formerly, and is now, a rich\r\nspecimen of a University Snob.\r\n\r\nAt five-and-twenty, Crump invented three new metres, and published\r\nan edition of an exceedingly improper Greek Comedy, with no less than\r\ntwenty emendations upon the German text of Schnupfenius and Schnapsius.\r\nThese Services to religion instantly pointed him out for advancement in\r\nthe Church, and he is now President of Saint Boniface, and very narrowly\r\nescaped the bench.\r\n\r\nCrump thinks Saint Boniface the centre of the world, and his position as\r\nPresident the highest in England. He expects the fellows and tutors to\r\npay him the same sort of service that Cardinals pay to the Pope. I am\r\nsure Crawler would have no objection to carry his trencher, or Page to\r\nhold up the skirts of his gown as he stalks into chapel. He roars out\r\nthe responses there as if it were an honour to heaven that the President\r\nof Saint Boniface should take a part in the service, and in his own\r\nlodge and college acknowledges the Sovereign only as his superior.\r\n\r\nWhen the allied monarchs came down, and were made Doctors of the\r\nUniversity, a breakfast was given at Saint Boniface; on which occasion\r\nCrump allowed the Emperor Alexander to walk before him, but took the PAS\r\nhimself of the King of Prussia and Prince Blucher. He was going to put\r\nthe Hetman Platoff to breakfast at a side-table with the under college\r\ntutors; but he was induced to relent, and merely entertained that\r\ndistinguished Cossack with a discourse on his own language, in which he\r\nshowed that the Hetman knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAs for us undergraduates, we scarcely knew more about Crump than about\r\nthe Grand Llama. A few favoured youths are asked occasionally to tea at\r\nthe lodge; but they do not speak unless first addressed by the Doctor;\r\nand if they venture to sit down, Crump\'s follower, Mr. Toady, whispers,\r\n\'Gentlemen, will you have the kindness to get up?--The President is\r\npassing;\' or \'Gentlemen, the President prefers that undergraduates\r\nshould not sit down;\' or words to a similar effect.\r\n\r\nTo do Crump justice, he does not cringe now to great people. He rather\r\npatronizes them than otherwise; and, in London, speaks quite affably to\r\na Duke who has been brought up at his college, or holds out a finger\r\nto a Marquis. He does not disguise his own origin, but brags of it with\r\nconsiderable self-gratulation:--\'I was a Charity-boy,\' says he; \'see\r\nwhat I am now; the greatest Greek scholar of the greatest College of the\r\ngreatest University of the greatest Empire in the world.\' The argument\r\nbeing, that this is a capital world, for beggars, because he, being a\r\nbeggar, has managed to get on horseback.\r\n\r\nHugby owes his eminence to patient merit and agreeable perseverance. He\r\nis a meek, mild, inoffensive creature, with just enough of scholarship\r\nto fit him to hold a lecture, or set an examination paper. He rose by\r\nkindness to the aristocracy. It was wonderful to see the way in which\r\nthat poor creature grovelled before a nobleman or a lord\'s nephew, or\r\neven some noisy and disreputable commoner, the friend of a lord. He used\r\nto give the young noblemen the most painful and elaborate breakfasts,\r\nand adopt a jaunty genteel air, and talk with them (although he was\r\ndecidedly serious) about the opera, or the last run with the hounds. It\r\nwas good to watch him in the midst of a circle of young tufts, with\r\nhis mean, smiling, eager, uneasy familiarity. He used to write home\r\nconfidential letters to their parents, and made it his duty to call upon\r\nthem when in town, to condole or rejoice with them when a death, birth,\r\nor marriage took place in their family; and to feast them whenever they\r\ncame to the University. I recollect a letter lying on a desk in his\r\nlecture-room for a whole term, beginning, \'My Lord Duke.\' It was to show\r\nus that he corresponded with such dignities.\r\n\r\nWhen the late lamented Lord Glenlivat, who broke his neck at a\r\nhurdle-race, at the premature age of twenty-four, was at the University,\r\nthe amiable young fellow, passing to his rooms in the early morning,\r\nand seeing Hugby\'s boots at his door, on the same staircase, playfully\r\nwadded the insides of the boots with cobbler\'s wax, which caused\r\nexcruciating pains to the Rev. Mr. Hugby, when he came to take them off\r\nthe same evening, before dining with the Master of St. Crispin\'s.\r\n\r\nEverybody gave the credit of this admirable piece of fun to Lord\r\nGlenlivat\'s friend, Bob Tizzy, who was famous for such feats, and who\r\nhad already made away with the college pump-handle; filed St. Boniface\'s\r\nnose smooth with his face; carried off four images of nigger-boys from\r\nthe tobacconists; painted the senior proctor\'s horse pea-green, &c. &c.;\r\nand Bob (who was of the party certainly, and would not peach,) was just\r\non the point of incurring expulsion, and so losing the family living\r\nwhich was in store for him, when Glenlivat nobly stepped forward, owned\r\nhimself to be the author of the delightful JEU-D\'ESPRIT, apologized to\r\nthe tutor, and accepted the rustication.\r\n\r\nHugby cried when Glenlivat apologized; if the young nobleman had kicked\r\nhim round the court, I believe the tutor would have been happy, so that\r\nan apology and a reconciliation might subsequently ensue. \'My lord,\'\r\nsaid he, \'in your conduct on this and all other occasions, you have\r\nacted as becomes a gentleman; you have been an honour to the University,\r\nas you will be to the peerage, I am sure, when the amiable vivacity of\r\nyouth is calmed down, and you are called upon to take your proper share\r\nin the government of the nation.\' And when his lordship took leave of\r\nthe University, Hugby presented him with a copy of his \'Sermons to a\r\nNobleman\'s Family\' (Hugby was once private tutor to the Sons of the\r\nEarl of Muffborough), which Glenlivat presented in return to Mr. William\r\nRamm, known to the fancy as the Tutbury Pet, and the sermons now figure\r\non the boudoir-table of Mrs. Ramm, behind the bar of her house of\r\nentertainment, \'The Game Cock and Spurs,\' near Woodstock, Oxon.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the long vacation, Hugby comes to town, and puts up\r\nin handsome lodgings near St. James\'s Square; rides in the Park in the\r\nafternoon; and is delighted to read his name in the morning papers among\r\nthe list of persons present at Muffborough House, and the Marquis of\r\nFarintosh\'s evening-parties. He is a member of Sydney Scraper\'s Club,\r\nwhere, however, he drinks his pint of claret.\r\n\r\nSometimes you may see him on Sundays, at the hour when tavern doors\r\nopen, whence issue little girls with great jugs of porter; when\r\ncharity-boys walk the streets, bearing brown dishes of smoking shoulders\r\nof mutton and baked \'taturs; when Sheeny and Moses are seen smoking\r\ntheir pipes before their lazy shutters in Seven Dials; when a crowd of\r\nsmiling persons in clean outlandish dresses, in monstrous bonnets and\r\nflaring printed gowns, or in crumpled glossy coats and silks that bear\r\nthe creases of the drawers where they have lain all the week, file down\r\nHigh Street,--sometimes, I say, you may see Hugby coming out of the\r\nChurch of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, with a stout gentlewoman leaning\r\non his arm, whose old face bears an expression of supreme pride and\r\nhappiness as she glances round at all the neighbours, and who faces the\r\ncurate himself and marches into Holborn, where she pulls the bell of a\r\nhouse over which is inscribed, \'Hugby, Haberdasher.\' It is the mother of\r\nthe Rev. F. Hugby, as proud of her son in his white choker as Cornelia\r\nof her jewels at Rome. That is old Hugby bringing up the rear with the\r\nPrayer-books, and Betsy Hugby the old maid, his daughter,--old Hugby,\r\nHaberdasher and Church-warden.\r\n\r\nIn the front room upstairs, where the dinner is laid out, there is\r\na picture of Muffborough Castle; of the Earl of Muffborough, K.X.,\r\nLord-Lieutenant for Diddlesex; an engraving, from an almanac, of Saint\r\nBoniface College, Oxon; and a sticking-plaster portrait of Hugby when\r\nyoung, in a cap and gown. A copy of his \'Sermons to a Nobleman\'s Family\'\r\nis on the bookshelf, by the \'Whole Duty of Man,\' the Reports of the\r\nMissionary Societies, and the \'Oxford University Calendar.\' Old Hugby\r\nknows part of this by heart; every living belonging to Saint Boniface,\r\nand the name of every tutor, fellow, nobleman, and undergraduate.\r\n\r\nHe used to go to meeting and preach himself, until his son took orders;\r\nbut of late the old gentleman has been accused of Puseyism, and is quite\r\npitiless against the Dissenters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV--ON UNIVERSITY SNOBS\r\n\r\nI should like to fill several volumes with accounts of various\r\nUniversity Snobs; so fond are my reminiscences of them, and so numerous\r\nare they. I should like to speak, above all, of the wives and daughters\r\nof some of the Professor-Snobs; their amusements, habits, jealousies;\r\ntheir innocent artifices to entrap young men; their picnics, concerts,\r\nand evening-parties. I wonder what has become of Emily Blades, daughter\r\nof Blades, the Professor of the Mandingo language? I remember her\r\nshoulders to this day, as she sat in the midst of a crowd of about\r\nseventy young gentlemen, from Corpus and Catherine Hall, entertaining\r\nthem with ogles and French songs on the guitar. Are you married, fair\r\nEmily of the shoulders? What beautiful ringlets those were that used to\r\ndribble over them!--what a waist!--what a killing sea-green shot-silk\r\ngown!--what a cameo, the size of a muffin! There were thirty-six young\r\nmen of the University in love at one time with Emily Blades: and no\r\nwords are sufficient to describe the pity, the sorrow, the deep,\r\ndeep commiseration--the rage, fury, and uncharitableness, in other\r\nwords--with which the Miss Trumps (daughter of Trumps, the Professor\r\nof Phlebotomy) regarded her, because she DIDN\'T squint, and because she\r\nWASN\'T marked with the small-pox.\r\n\r\nAs for the young University Snobs, I am getting too old, now, to speak\r\nof such very familiarly. My recollections of them lie in the far, far\r\npast--almost as far back as Pelham\'s time.\r\n\r\nWe THEN used to consider Snobs raw-looking lads, who never missed\r\nchapel; who wore highlows and no straps; who walked two hours on the\r\nTrumpington road every day of their lives; who carried off the college\r\nscholarships, and who overrated themselves in hall. We were premature in\r\npronouncing our verdict of youthful Snobbishness The man without straps\r\nfulfilled his destiny and duty. He eased his old governor, the curate\r\nin Westmoreland, or helped his sisters to set up the Ladies\' School. He\r\nwrote a \'Dictionary,\' or a \'Treatise on Conic Sections,\' as his nature\r\nand genius prompted. He got a fellowship: and then took to himself a\r\nwife, and a living. He presides over a parish now, and thinks it rather\r\na dashing thing to belong to the \'Oxford and Cambridge Club;\' and his\r\nparishioners love him, and snore under his sermons. No, no, HE is not a\r\nSnob. It is not straps that make the gentleman, or highlows that unmake\r\nhim, be they ever so thick. My son, it is you who are the Snob if you\r\nlightly despise a man for doing his duty, and refuse to shake an honest\r\nman\'s hand because it wears a Berlin glove.\r\n\r\nWe then used to consider it not the least vulgar for a parcel of lads\r\nwho had been whipped three months previous, and were not allowed more\r\nthan three glasses of port at home, to sit down to pineapples and ices\r\nat each other\'s rooms, and fuddle themselves with champagne and claret.\r\n\r\nOne looks back to what was called a \'wine-party\' with a sort of wonder.\r\nThirty lads round a table covered with bad sweetmeats, drinking bad\r\nwines, telling bad stories, singing bad songs over and over again. Milk\r\npunch--smoking--ghastly headache--frightful spectacle of dessert-table\r\nnext morning, and smell of tobacco--your guardian, the clergyman,\r\ndropping in, in the midst of this--expecting to find you deep in\r\nAlgebra, and discovering the Gyp administering soda-water.\r\n\r\nThere were young men who despised the lads who indulged in the coarse\r\nhospitalities of wine-parties, who prided themselves in giving RECHERCHE\r\nlittle French dinners. Both wine-party-givers and dinner-givers were\r\nSnobs.\r\n\r\nThere were what used to be called \'dressy\' Snobs:--Jimmy, who might\r\nbe seen at five o\'clock elaborately rigged out, with a camellia in his\r\nbutton-hole, glazed boots, and fresh kid-gloves twice a day;--Jessamy,\r\nwho was conspicuous for his \'jewellery,\'--a young donkey, glittering\r\nall over with chains, rings, and shirt-studs;--Jacky, who rode every day\r\nsolemnly on the Blenheim Road, in pumps and white silk stockings, with\r\nhis hair curled,--all three of whom flattered themselves they gave laws\r\nto the University about dress--all three most odious varieties of Snobs.\r\n\r\nSporting Snobs of course there were, and are always--those happy beings\r\nin whom Nature has implanted a love of slang: who loitered about the\r\nhorsekeeper\'s stables, and drove the London coaches--a stage in and\r\nout--and might be seen swaggering through the courts in pink of early\r\nmornings, and indulged in dice and blind-hookey at nights, and\r\nnever missed a race or a boxing-match; and rode flat-races, and kept\r\nbull-terriers. Worse Snobs even than these were poor miserable wretches\r\nwho did not like hunting at all, and could not afford it, and were in\r\nmortal fear at a two-foot ditch; but who hunted because Glenlivat and\r\nCinqbars hunted. The Billiard Snob and the Boating Snob were varieties\r\nof these, and are to be found elsewhere than in universities.\r\n\r\nThen there were Philosophical Snobs, who used to ape statesmen at the\r\nspouting-clubs, and who believed as a fact that Government always had\r\nan eye on the University for the selection of orators for the House of\r\nCommons. There were audacious young free-thinkers, who adored nobody or\r\nnothing, except perhaps Robespierre and the Koran, and panted for the\r\nday when the pale name of priest should shrink and dwindle away before\r\nthe indignation of an enlightened world.\r\n\r\nBut the worst of all University Snobs are those unfortunates who go\r\nto rack and ruin from their desire to ape their betters. Smith becomes\r\nacquainted with great people at college, and is ashamed of his father\r\nthe tradesman. Jones has fine acquaintances, and lives after their\r\nfashion like a gay free-hearted fellow as he is, and ruins his father,\r\nand robs his sister\'s portion, and cripples his younger brother\'s outset\r\nin life, for the pleasure of entertaining my lord, and riding by the\r\nside of Sir John. And though it may be very good fun for Robinson to\r\nfuddle himself at home as he does at College, and to be brought home by\r\nthe policeman he has just been trying to knock down--think what fun it\r\nis for the poor old soul his mother!--the half-pay captain\'s widow, who\r\nhas been pinching herself all her life long, in order that that jolly\r\nyoung fellow might have a University education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI--ON LITERARY SNOBS\r\n\r\nWhat will he say about Literary Snobs? has been a question, I make no\r\ndoubt, often asked by the public. How can he let off his own profession?\r\nWill that truculent and unsparing monster who attacks the nobility, the\r\nclergy, the army, and the ladies, indiscriminately, hesitate when the\r\nturn comes to EGORGER his own flesh and blood?\r\n\r\nMy dear and excellent querist, whom does the schoolmaster flog so\r\nresolutely as his own son? Didn\'t Brutus chop his offspring\'s head off?\r\nYou have a very bad opinion indeed of the present state of literature\r\nand of literary men, if you fancy that any one of us would hesitate to\r\nstick a knife into his neighbour penman, if the latter\'s death could do\r\nthe State any service.\r\n\r\nBut the fact is, that in the literary profession THERE ARE NO SNOBS.\r\nLook round at the whole body of British men of letters; and I defy you\r\nto point out among them a single instance of vulgarity, or envy, or\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nMen and women, as far as I have known them, they are all modest in\r\ntheir demeanour, elegant in their manners, spotless in their lives, and\r\nhonourable in their conduct to the world and to each other. You MAY,\r\noccasionally, it is true, hear one literary man abusing his brother; but\r\nwhy? Not in the least out of malice; not at all from envy; merely from a\r\nsense of truth and public duty. Suppose, for instance, I, good-naturedly\r\npoint out a blemish in my friend MR. PUNCH\'S person, and say, MR. P. has\r\na hump-back, and his nose and chin are more crooked than those features\r\nin the Apollo or Antinous, which we are accustomed to consider as our\r\nstandards of beauty; does this argue malice on my part towards MR.\r\nPUNCH? Not in the least. It is the critic\'s duty to point out defects as\r\nwell as merits, and he invariably does his duty with utmost gentleness\r\nand candour.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent foreigner\'s testimony about our manners is always worth\r\nhaving, and I think, in this respect the work of an eminent American,\r\nMr. N. P. Willis is eminently valuable and impartial. In his \'History\r\nof Ernest Clay,\' a crack magazine-writer, the reader will get an exact\r\naccount of the life of a popular man of letters in England. He is always\r\nthe lion of society.\r\n\r\nHe takes the PAS of dukes and earls; all the nobility crowd to see him:\r\nI forget how many baronesses and duchesses fall in love with him. But\r\non this subject let us hold our tongues. Modesty forbids that we should\r\nreveal the names of the heart-broken countesses and dear marchionesses\r\nwho are pining for every one of the contributors in PUNCH.\r\n\r\nIf anybody wants to know how intimately authors are connected with\r\nthe fashionable world, they have but to read the genteel novels.\r\nWhat refinement and delicacy pervades the works of Mrs. Barnaby! What\r\ndelightful good company do you meet with in Mrs. Armytage! She seldom\r\nintroduces you to anybody under a marquis! I don\'t know anything more\r\ndelicious than the pictures of genteel life in \'Ten Thousand a Year,\'\r\nexcept perhaps the \'Young Duke,\' and \'Coningsby.\' There\'s a modest\r\ngrace about THEM, and an air of easy high fashion, which only belongs to\r\nblood, my dear Sir--to true blood.\r\n\r\nAnd what linguists many of our writers are! Lady Bulwer, Lady\r\nLondonderry, Sir Edward himself--they write the French language with a\r\nluxurious elegance and ease which sets them far above their continental\r\nrivals, of whom not one (except Paul de Kock) knows a word of English.\r\n\r\nAnd what Briton can read without enjoyment the works of James, so\r\nadmirable for terseness; and the playful humour and dazzling offhand\r\nlightness of Ainsworth? Among other humourists, one might glance at a\r\nJerrold, the chivalrous advocate of Toryism and Church and State; an a\r\nBeckett, with a lightsome pen, but a savage earnestness of purpose;\r\na Jeames, whose pure style, and wit unmingled with buffoonery, was\r\nrelished by a congenial public.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of critics, perhaps there never was a review that has done so\r\nmuch for literature as the admirable QUARTERLY. It has its prejudices,\r\nto be sure, as which of us has not? It goes out of its way to abuse\r\na great man, or lays mercilessly on to such pretenders as Keats and\r\nTennyson; but, on the other hand, it is the friend of all young authors,\r\nand has marked and nurtured all the rising talent of the country. It is\r\nloved by everybody. There, again, is BLACKWOOD\'S MAGAZINE--conspicuous\r\nfor modest elegance and amiable satire; that review never passes the\r\nbounds of politeness in a joke. It is the arbiter of manners; and, while\r\ngently exposing the foibles of Londoners (for whom the BEAUX ESPRITS of\r\nEdinburgh entertain a justifiable contempt), it is never coarse in its\r\nfun. The fiery enthusiasm of the ATHENAEUM is well known: and the bitter\r\nwit of the too difficult LITERARY GAZETTE. The EXAMINER is perhaps too\r\ntimid, and the SPECTATOR too boisterous in its praise--but who can carp\r\nat these minor faults? No, no; the critics of England and the authors of\r\nEngland are unrivalled as a body; and hence it becomes impossible for us\r\nto find fault with them.\r\n\r\nAbove all, I never knew a man of letters ASHAMED OF HIS PROFESSION.\r\nThose who know us, know what an affectionate and brotherly spirit there\r\nis among us all. Sometimes one of us rises in the world: we never attack\r\nhim or sneer at him under those circumstances, but rejoice to a man at\r\nhis success. If Jones dines with a lord, Smith never says Jones is a\r\ncourtier and cringer. Nor, on the other hand, does Jones, who is in the\r\nhabit of frequenting the society of great people, give himself any airs\r\non account of the company he keeps; but will leave a duke\'s arm in Pall\r\nMall to come over and speak to poor Brown, the young penny-a-liner.\r\n\r\nThat sense of equality and fraternity amongst authors has always struck\r\nme as one of the most amiable characteristics of the class. It is\r\nbecause we know and respect each other, that the world respects us so\r\nmuch; that we hold such a good position in society, and demean ourselves\r\nso irreproachably when there.\r\n\r\nLiterary persons are held in such esteem by the nation that about two of\r\nthem have been absolutely invited to court during the present reign; and\r\nit is probable that towards the end of the season, one or two will be\r\nasked to dinner by Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nThey are such favourites with the public, that they are continually\r\nobliged to have their pictures taken and published; and one or two could\r\nbe pointed out, of whom the nation insists upon having a fresh portrait\r\nevery year. Nothing can be more gratifying than this proof of the\r\naffectionate regard which the people has for its instructors.\r\n\r\nLiterature is held in such honour in England, that there is a sum of\r\nnear twelve hundred pounds per annum set apart to pension deserving\r\npersons following that profession. And a great compliment this is,\r\ntoo, to the professors, and a proof of their generally prosperous and\r\nflourishing condition. They are generally so rich and thrifty, that\r\nscarcely any money is wanted to help them.\r\n\r\nIf every word of this is true, how, I should like to know am I to write\r\nabout Literary Snobs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII--A LITTLE ABOUT IRISH SNOBS\r\n\r\nYou do not, to be sure, imagine that there are no other Snobs in Ireland\r\nthan those of the amiable party who wish to make pikes of iron railroads\r\n(it\'s a fine Irish economy), and to cut the throats of the Saxon\r\ninvaders. These are of the venomous sort; and had they been invented in\r\nhis time, St. Patrick would have banished them out of the kingdom along\r\nwith the other dangerous reptiles.\r\n\r\nI think it is the Four Masters, or else it\'s Olaus Magnus, or else\r\nit\'s certainly O\'Neill Daunt, in the \'Catechism of Irish History,\' who\r\nrelates that when Richard the Second came to Ireland, and the Irish\r\nchiefs did homage to him, going down on their knees--the poor simple\r\ncreatures!--and worshipping and wondering before the English king and\r\nthe dandies of his court, my lords the English noblemen mocked and\r\njeered at their uncouth Irish admirers, mimicked their talk and\r\ngestures, pulled their poor old beards, and laughed at the strange\r\nfashion of their garments.\r\n\r\nThe English Snob rampant always does this to the present day. There is\r\nno Snob in existence, perhaps, that has such an indomitable belief in\r\nhimself: that sneers you down all the rest of the world besides, and has\r\nsuch an insufferable, admirable, stupid contempt for all people but his\r\nown--nay, for all sets but his own. \'Gwacious Gad\' what stories about\r\n\'the Iwish\' these young dandies accompanying King Richard must have had\r\nto tell, when they returned to Pall Mall, and smoked their cigars upon\r\nthe steps of \'White\'s.\'\r\n\r\nThe Irish snobbishness developes itself not in pride so much as in\r\nservility and mean admirations, and trumpery imitations of their\r\nneighbours. And I wonder De Tocqueville and De Beaumont, and THE TIMES\'\r\nCommissioner, did not explain the Snobbishness of Ireland as contrasted\r\nwith our own. Ours is that of Richard\'s Norman Knights,--haughty, brutal\r\nstupid, and perfectly self-confident;--theirs, of the poor, wondering,\r\nkneeling, simple chieftains. They are on their knees still before\r\nEnglish fashion--these simple, wild people; and indeed it is hard not to\r\ngrin at some of their NAIVE exhibitions.\r\n\r\nSome years since, when a certain great orator was Lord Mayor of Dublin,\r\nhe used to wear a red gown and a cocked hat, the splendour of which\r\ndelighted him as much as a new curtain-ring in her nose or a string of\r\nglass-beads round her neck charms Queen Quasheeneboo. He used to pay\r\nvisits to people in this dress; to appear at meetings hundreds of miles\r\noff, in the red velvet gown. And to hear the people crying \'Yes, me\r\nLard!\' and \'No, me Lard!\' and to read the prodigious accounts of his\r\nLordship in the papers: it seemed as if the people and he liked to be\r\ntaken in by this twopenny splendour. Twopenny magnificence,\r\nindeed, exists all over Ireland, and may be considered as the great\r\ncharacteristic of the Snobbishness of that country.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Mulholligan, the grocer\'s lady, retires to Kingstown, she has\r\nMulholliganville\' painted over the gate of her villa; and receives you\r\nat a door that won\'t shut or gazes at you out of a window that is glazed\r\nwith an old petticoat.\r\n\r\nBe it ever so shabby and dismal, nobody ever owns to keeping a shop. A\r\nfellow whose stock in trade is a penny roll or a tumbler of lollipops,\r\ncalls his cabin the \'American Flour Stores,\' or the \'Depository for\r\nColonial Produce,\' or some such name.\r\n\r\nAs for Inns, there are none in the country; Hotels abound as well\r\nfurnished as Mulholliganville; but again there are no such people as\r\nlandlords and land-ladies; the landlord is out with the hounds, and my\r\nlady in the parlour talking with the Captain or playing the piano.\r\n\r\nIf a gentleman has a hundred a year to leave to his family they all\r\nbecome gentlemen, all keep a nag, ride to hounds, and swagger about\r\nin the \'Phaynix,\' and grow tufts to their chins like so many real\r\naristocrats.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine has taken to be a painter, and lives out of Ireland,\r\nwhere he is considered to have disgraced the family by choosing such\r\na profession. His father is a wine-merchant; and his elder brother an\r\napothecary.\r\n\r\nThe number of men one meets in London and on the Continent who have a\r\npretty little property of five-and-twenty hundred a year in Ireland\r\nis prodigious: those who WILL have nine thousand a year in land when\r\nsomebody dies are still more numerous. I myself have met as many\r\ndescendants from Irish kings as would form a brigade.\r\n\r\nAnd who has not met the Irishman who apes the Englishman, and who\r\nforgets his country and tries to forget his accent, or to smother the\r\ntaste of it, as it were? \'Come, dine with me, my boy,\' says O\'Dowd, of\r\nO\'Dowdstown: \'you\'ll FIND US ALL ENGLISH THERE;\' which he tells you with\r\na brogue as broad as from here to Kingstown Pier. And did you never hear\r\nMrs. Captain Macmanus talk about \'I-ah-land,\' and her account of her\r\n\'fawther\'s esteet?\' Very few men have rubbed through the world without\r\nhearing and witnessing some of these Hibernian phenomena--these twopenny\r\nsplendours.\r\n\r\nAnd what say you to the summit of society--the Castle--with a sham\r\nking, and sham lords-in-waiting, and sham loyalty, and a sham Haroun\r\nAlraschid, to go about in a sham disguise, making believe to be affable\r\nand splendid? That Castle is the pink and pride of Snobbishness. A COURT\r\nCIRCULAR is bad enough, with two columns of print about a little baby\r\nthat\'s christened--but think of people liking a sham COURT CIRCULAR!\r\n\r\nI think the shams of Ireland are more outrageous than those of any\r\ncountry. A fellow shows you a hill and says, \'That\'s the highest\r\nmountain in all Ireland;\' a gentleman tells you he is descended from\r\nBrian Boroo and has his five-and-thirty hundred a year; or Mrs. Macmanus\r\ndescribes her fawther\'s esteet; or ould Dan rises and says the Irish\r\nwomen are the loveliest, the Irish men the bravest, the Irish land the\r\nmost fertile in the world: and nobody believes anybody--the latter does\r\nnot believe his story nor the hearer:--but they make-believe to believe,\r\nand solemnly do honour to humbug.\r\n\r\nO Ireland! O my country! (for I make little doubt I am descended from\r\nBrian Boroo too) when will you acknowledge that two and two make four,\r\nand call a pikestaff a pikestaff?--that is the very best use you can\r\nmake of the latter. Irish snobs will dwindle away then and we shall\r\nnever hear tell of Hereditary bondsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII--PARTY-GIVING SNOBS\r\n\r\nOur selection of Snobs has lately been too exclusively of a political\r\ncharacter. \'Give us private Snobs,\' cry the dear ladies. (I have before\r\nme the letter of one fair correspondent of the fishing village of\r\nBrighthelmstone in Sussex, and could her commands ever be disobeyed?)\r\n\'Tell us more, dear Mr. Snob, about your experience of Snobs in\r\nsociety.\' Heaven bless the dear souls!--they are accustomed to the word\r\nnow--the odious, vulgar, horrid, unpronounceable word slips out of their\r\nlips with the prettiest glibness possible. I should not wonder if it\r\nwere used at Court amongst the Maids of Honour. In the very best society\r\nI know it is. And why not? Snobbishness is vulgar--the mere words\r\nare not: that which we call a Snob, by any other name would still be\r\nSnobbish.\r\n\r\nWell, then. As the season is drawing to a close: as many hundreds\r\nof kind souls, snobbish or otherwise, have quitted London; as many\r\nhospitable carpets are taken up; and window-blinds are pitilessly\r\npapered with the MORNING HERALD; and mansions once inhabited by cheerful\r\nowners are now consigned to the care of the housekeeper\'s dreary LOCUM\r\nTENENS--some mouldy old woman, who, in reply to the hopeless clanging\r\nof the bell, peers at you for a moment from the area, and then slowly\r\nunbolting the great hall-door, informs you my lady has left town, or\r\nthat \'the family\'s in the country,\' or \'gone up the Rind,\'--or what not;\r\nas the season and parties are over; why not consider Party-giving Snobs\r\nfor a while, and review the conduct of some of those individuals who\r\nhave quitted the town for six months?\r\n\r\nSome of those worthy Snobs are making-believe to go yachting, and,\r\ndressed in telescopes and pea-jackets, are passing their time between\r\nCherbourg and Cowes; some living higgledy-piggledy in dismal little\r\nhuts in Scotland, provisioned with canisters of portable soup,\r\nand fricandeaux hermetically sealed in tin, are passing their days\r\nslaughtering grouse upon the moors; some are dozing and bathing away the\r\neffects of the season at Kissingen, or watching the ingenious game of\r\nTRENTE ET QUARANTE at Homburg and Ems. We can afford to be very bitter\r\nupon them now they are all gone. Now there are no more parties, let us\r\nhave at the Party-giving Snobs. The dinner-giving, the ball-giving, the\r\nDEJEUNER-giving, the CONVERSAZIONE-GIVING Snobs--Lord! Lord! what\r\nhavoc might have been made amongst them had we attacked them during the\r\nplethora of the season! I should have been obliged to have a guard to\r\ndefend me from fiddlers and pastrycooks, indignant at the abuse of\r\ntheir patrons. Already I\'m told that, from some flippant and unguarded\r\nexpressions considered derogatory to Baker Street and Harley Street,\r\nrents have fallen in these respectable quarters; and orders have been\r\nissued that at least Mr. Snob shall be asked to parties there no more.\r\nWell, then--now they are ALL away, let us frisk at our ease, and have at\r\neverything like the bull in the china-shop. They mayn\'t hear of what is\r\ngoing on in their absence, and, if they do they can\'t bear malice for\r\nsix months. We will begin to make it up with them about next February,\r\nand let next year take care of itself. We shall have no dinners from\r\nthe dinner-giving Snobs: no more from the ball-givers: no more\r\nCONVERSAZIONES (thank Mussy! as Jeames says,) from the Conversaziones\r\nSnob: and what is to prevent us from telling the truth?\r\n\r\nThe snobbishness of Conversazione Snobs is very soon disposed of: as\r\nsoon as that cup of washy bohea is handed to you in the tea-room; or the\r\nmuddy remnant of ice that you grasp in the suffocating scuffle of the\r\nassembly upstairs.\r\n\r\nGood heavens! What do people mean by going there? What is done there,\r\nthat everybody throngs into those three little rooms? Was the Black Hole\r\nconsidered to be an agreeable REUNION, that Britons in the dog-days here\r\nseek to imitate it? After being rammed to a jelly in a door-way (where\r\nyou feel your feet going through Lady Barbara Macbeth\'s lace flounces,\r\nand get a look from that haggard and painted old harpy, compared to\r\nwhich the gaze of Ugolino is quite cheerful); after withdrawing your\r\nelbow out of poor gasping Bob Guttleton\'s white waistcoat, from which\r\ncushion it was impossible to remove it, though you knew you were\r\nsqueezing poor Bob into an apoplexy--you find yourself at last in\r\nthe reception-room, and try to catch the eye of Mrs. Botibol, the\r\nCONVERSAZIONE-giver. When you catch her eye, you are expected to grin,\r\nand she smiles too, for the four hundredth time that night; and, if\r\nshe\'s very glad to see you, waggles her little hand before her face as\r\nif to blow you a kiss, as the phrase is.\r\n\r\nWhy the deuce should Mrs. Botibol blow me a kiss? I wouldn\'t kiss her\r\nfor the world. Why do I grin when I see her, as if I was delighted? Am\r\nI? I don\'t care a straw for Mrs. Botibol. I know what she thinks about\r\nme. I know what she said about my last volume of poems (I had it from\r\na dear mutual friend). Why, I say in a word, are we going on ogling\r\nand telegraphing each other in this insane way?--Because we are both\r\nperforming the ceremonies demanded by the Great Snob Society; whose\r\ndictates we all of us obey.\r\n\r\nWell; the recognition is over--my jaws have returned to their usual\r\nEnglish expression of subdued agony and intense gloom, and the Botibol\r\nis grinning and kissing her fingers to somebody else, who is squeezing\r\nthrough the aperture by which we have just entered. It is Lady Ann\r\nClutterbuck, who has her Friday evenings, as Botibol (Botty, we call\r\nher,) has Wednesdays. That is Miss Clementina Clutterbuck the cadaverous\r\nyoung woman in green, with florid auburn hair, who has published her\r\nvolume of poems (\'The Death-Shriek;\' \'Damiens;\' \'The Faggot of Joan\r\nof Arc;\' and \'Translations from the German\' of course). The\r\nconversazione-women salute each other calling each other \'My dear Lady\r\nAnn\' and \'My dear good Eliza,\' and hating each other, as women hate who\r\ngive parties on Wednesdays and Fridays. With inexpressible pain dear\r\ngood Eliza sees Ann go up and coax and wheedle Abou Gosh, who has just\r\narrived from Syria, and beg him to patronize her Fridays.\r\n\r\nAll this while, amidst the crowd and the scuffle, and a perpetual buzz\r\nand chatter, and the flare of the wax-candles, and an intolerable smell\r\nof musk--what the poor Snobs who write fashionable romances call \'the\r\ngleam of gems, the odour of perfumes, the blaze of countless lamps\'--a\r\nscrubby-looking, yellow-faced foreigner, with cleaned gloves, is\r\nwarbling inaudibly in a corner, to the accompaniment of another. \'The\r\nGreat Cacafogo,\' Mrs. Botibol whispers, as she passes you by. \'A great\r\ncreature, Thumpenstrumpff, is at the instrument--the Hetman Platoff\'s\r\npianist, you know.\'\r\n\r\nTo hear this Cacafogo and Thumpenstrumpff, a hundred people are gathered\r\ntogether--a bevy of dowagers, stout or scraggy; a faint sprinkling of\r\nmisses; six moody-looking lords, perfectly meek and solemn; wonderful\r\nforeign Counts, with bushy whiskers and yellow faces, and a great deal\r\nof dubious jewellery; young dandies with slim waists and open necks, and\r\nself-satisfied simpers, and flowers in their buttons; the old, stiff,\r\nstout, bald-headed CONVERSAZIONE ROUES, whom You meet everywhere--who\r\nnever miss a night of this delicious enjoyment; the three last-caught\r\nlions of the season--Higgs, the traveller, Biggs, the novelist, and\r\nToffey, who has come out so on the sugar question; Captain Flash, who is\r\ninvited on account of his pretty wife and Lord Ogleby, who goes wherever\r\nshe goes.\r\n\r\nQUE SCAIS-JE? Who are the owners of all those showy scarfs and white\r\nneckcloths?--Ask little Tom Prig, who is there in all his glory, knows\r\neverybody, has a story about every one; and, as he trips home to his\r\nlodgings in Jermyn Street, with his gibus-hat and his little glazed\r\npumps, thinks he is the fashionablest young fellow in town, and that he\r\nreally has passed a night of exquisite enjoyment.\r\n\r\nYou go up (with our usual easy elegance of manner) and talk to Miss\r\nSmith in a corner. \'Oh, Mr. Snob, I\'m afraid you\'re sadly satirical.\'\r\n\r\nThat\'s all she says. If you say it\'s fine weather, she bursts out\r\nlaughing; or hint that it\'s very hot, she vows you are the drollest\r\nwretch! Meanwhile Mrs. Botibol is simpering on fresh arrivals; the\r\nindividual at the door is roaring out their names; poor Cacafogo is\r\nquavering away in the music-room, under the impression that he will be\r\nLANCE in the world by singing inaudibly here. And what a blessing it is\r\nto squeeze out of the door, and into the street, where a half-hundred of\r\ncarriages are in waiting; and where the link-boy, with that unnecessary\r\nlantern of his, pounces upon all who issue out, and will insist upon\r\ngetting your noble honour\'s lordship\'s cab.\r\n\r\nAnd to think that there are people who, after having been to Botibol on\r\nWednesday, will go to Clutterbuck on Friday!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX--DINING-OUT SNOBS\r\n\r\nIn England Dinner-giving Snobs occupy a very important place in society,\r\nand the task of describing them is tremendous. There was a time in my\r\nlife when the consciousness of having eaten a man\'s salt rendered me\r\ndumb regarding his demerits, and I thought it a wicked act and a breach\r\nof hospitality to speak ill of him.\r\n\r\nBut why should a saddle-of-mutton blind you, or a turbot and\r\nlobster-sauce shut your mouth for ever? With advancing age, men see\r\ntheir duties more clearly. I am not to be hoodwinked any longer by a\r\nslice of venison, be it ever so fat; and as for being dumb on account of\r\nturbot and lobster-sauce----of course I am; good manners ordain that I\r\nshould be so, until I have swallowed the compound--but not afterwards;\r\ndirectly the victuals are discussed, and John takes away the plate,\r\nmy tongue begins to wag. Does not yours, if you have a pleasant\r\nneighbour?--a lovely creature, say, of some five-and-thirty, whose\r\ndaughters have not yet quite come out--they are the best talkers. As for\r\nyour young misses, they are only put about the table to look at--like\r\nthe flowers in the centre-piece. Their blushing youth and natural\r\nmodesty preclude them from easy, confidential, conversational ABANDON\r\nwhich forms the delight of the intercourse with their dear mothers. It\r\nis to these, if he would prosper in his profession, that the Dining-out\r\nSnob should address himself. Suppose you sit next to one of these, how\r\npleasant it is, in the intervals of the banquet, actually to abuse the\r\nvictuals and the giver of the entertainment! It\'s twice as PIQUANT to\r\nmake fun of a man under his very nose.\r\n\r\n\'What IS a Dinner-giving Snob?\' some innocent youth, who is not REPANDU\r\nin the world, may ask--or some simple reader who has not the benefits of\r\nLondon experience.\r\n\r\nMy dear sir, I will show you--not all, for that is impossible--but\r\nseveral kinds of Dinner-giving Snobs. For instance, suppose you, in the\r\nmiddle rank of life, accustomed to Mutton, roast on Tuesday, cold\r\non Wednesday, hashed on Thursday, &c., with small means and a small\r\nestablishment, choose to waste the former and set the latter topsy-turvy\r\nby giving entertainments unnaturally costly--you come into the\r\nDinner-giving Snob class at once. Suppose you get in cheap-made\r\ndishes from the pastrycook\'s, and hire a couple of greengrocers, or\r\ncarpet-beaters, to figure as footmen, dismissing honest Molly, who waits\r\non common days, and bedizening your table (ordinarily ornamented with\r\nwillow-pattern crockery) with twopenny-halfpenny Birmingham plate.\r\nSuppose you pretend to be richer and grander than you ought to be--you\r\nare a Dinner-giving Snob. And oh, I tremble to think how many and many a\r\none will read this!\r\n\r\nA man who entertains in this way--and, alas, how few do not!--is like\r\na fellow who would borrow his neighbour\'s coat to make a show in, or a\r\nlady who flaunts in the diamonds from next door--a humbug, in a word,\r\nand amongst the Snobs he must be set down.\r\n\r\nA man who goes out of his natural sphere of society to ask Lords,\r\nGenerals, Aldermen, and other persons of fashion, but is niggardly of\r\nhis hospitality towards his own equals, is a Dinner-giving Snob. My\r\ndear friend, Jack Tufthunt, for example, knows ONE Lord whom he met at\r\na watering-place: old Lord Mumble, who is as toothless as a\r\nthree-months-old baby, and as mum as an undertaker, and as dull\r\nas--well, we will not particularise. Tufthunt never has a dinner now but\r\nyou see this solemn old toothless patrician at the right-hand of Mrs.\r\nTufthunt--Tufthunt is a Dinner-giving Snob.\r\n\r\nOld Livermore, old Soy, old Chutney, the East Indian Director, old\r\nCutler, the Surgeon, &c.,--that society of old fogies, in fine, who give\r\neach other dinners round and round, and dine for the mere purpose of\r\nguttling--these, again, are Dinner-giving Snobs.\r\n\r\nAgain, my friend Lady MacScrew, who has three grenadier flunkeys in lace\r\nround the table, and serves up a scrag-of-mutton on silver, and dribbles\r\nyou out bad sherry and port by thimblefuls, is a Dinner-giving Snob of\r\nthe other sort; and I confess, for my part, I would rather dine with old\r\nLivermore or old Soy than with her Ladyship.\r\n\r\nStinginess is snobbish. Ostentation is snobbish. Too great profusion\r\nis snobbish. Tuft-hunting is snobbish. But I own there are people more\r\nsnobbish than all those whose defects are above mentioned: viz., those\r\nindividuals who can, and don\'t give dinners at all. The man without\r\nhospitality shall never sit SUB IISDEM TRABIBUS with ME. Let the sordid\r\nwretch go mumble his bone alone!\r\n\r\nWhat, again, is true hospitality? Alas, my dear friends and brother\r\nSnobs! how little do we meet of it after all! Are the motives PURE which\r\ninduce your friends to ask you to dinner? This has often come across me.\r\nDoes your entertainer want something from you? For instance, I am not of\r\na suspicious turn; but it IS a fact that when Hookey is bringing out a\r\nnew work, he asks the critics all round to dinner; that when Walker has\r\ngot his picture ready for the Exhibition, he somehow grows exceedingly\r\nhospitable, and has his friends of the press to a quiet cutlet and a\r\nglass of Sillery. Old Hunks, the miser, who died lately (leaving his\r\nmoney to his housekeeper) lived many years on the fat of the land, by\r\nsimply taking down, at all his friends\', the names and Christian names\r\nOF ALL THE CHILDREN. But though you may have your own opinion about\r\nthe hospitality of your acquaintances; and though men who ask you from\r\nsordid motives are most decidedly Dinner-giving Snobs, it is best not\r\nto inquire into their motives too keenly. Be not too curious about the\r\nmouth of a gift-horse. After all, a man does not intend to insult you by\r\nasking you to dinner.\r\n\r\nThough, for that matter, I know some characters about town who actually\r\nconsider themselves injured and insulted if the dinner or the company\r\nis not to their liking. There is Guttleton, who dines at home off a\r\nshilling\'s-worth of beef from the cookshop, but if he is asked to dine\r\nat a house where there are not pease at the end of May, or cucumbers in\r\nMarch along with the turbot, thinks himself insulted by being invited.\r\n\'Good Ged!\' says he, \'what the deuce do the Forkers mean by asking ME\r\nto a family dinner? I can get mutton at home;\' or \'What infernal\r\nimpertinence it is of the Spooners to get ENTREES from the pastrycook\'s,\r\nand fancy that I am to be deceived with their stories about their French\r\ncook!\' Then, again, there is Jack Puddington--I saw that honest fellow\r\nt\'other day quite in a rage, because, as chance would have it, Sir\r\nJohn Carver asked him to meet the very same party he had met at Colonel\r\nCramley\'s the day before, and he had not got up a new set of stories\r\nto entertain them. Poor Dinner-giving Snobs! you don\'t know what small\r\nthanks you get for all your pains and money! How we Dining-out Snobs\r\nsneer at your cookery, and pooh-pooh your old hock, and are incredulous\r\nabout your four-and-six-penny champagne, and know that the side-dishes\r\nof to-day are RECHAUFFES from the dinner of yesterday, and mark how\r\ncertain dishes are whisked off the table untasted, so that they may\r\nfigure at the banquet tomorrow. Whenever, for my part, I see the head\r\nman particularly anxious to ESCAMOTER a fricandeau or a blanc-mange, I\r\nalways call out, and insist upon massacring it with a spoon. All this\r\nsort of conduct makes one popular with the Dinner-giving Snob. One\r\nfriend of mine, I know, has made a prodigious sensation in good society,\r\nby announcing apropos of certain dishes when offered to him, that he\r\nnever eats aspic except at Lord Tittup\'s, and that Lady Jimmy\'s CHEF is\r\nthe only man in London who knows how to dress--FILET EN SERPENTEAU--or\r\nSUPREME DE VOLAILLE AUX TRUFFES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX--DINNER-GIVING SNOBS FURTHER CONSIDERED\r\n\r\nIf my friends would but follow the present prevailing fashion, I think\r\nthey ought to give me a testimonial for the paper on Dinner-giving\r\nSnobs, which I am now writing. What do you say now to a handsome\r\ncomfortable dinner-service of plate (NOT including plates, for I hold\r\nsilver plates to be sheer wantonness, and would almost as soon think of\r\nsilver teacups), a couple of neat teapots, a coffeepot, trays, &c., with\r\na little inscription to my wife, Mrs. Snob; and a half-score of silver\r\ntankards for the little Snoblings, to glitter on the homely table where\r\nthey partake of their quotidian mutton?\r\n\r\nIf I had my way, and my plans could be carried out, dinner-giving would\r\nincrease as much on the one hand as dinner-giving Snobbishness would\r\ndiminish:--to my mind the most amiable part of the work lately published\r\nby my esteemed friend (if upon a very brief acquaintance he will allow\r\nme to call him so), Alexis Soyer, the regenerator--what he (in his noble\r\nstyle) would call the most succulent, savoury, and elegant passages--are\r\nthose which relate, not to the grand banquets and ceremonial dinners,\r\nbut to his \'dinners at home.\'\r\n\r\nThe \'dinner at home\' ought to be the centre of the whole system\r\nof dinner-giving. Your usual style of meal--that is, plenteous,\r\ncomfortable, and in its perfection--should be that to which you welcome\r\nyour friends, as it is that of which you partake yourself.\r\n\r\nFor, towards what woman in the world do I entertain a higher regard than\r\ntowards the beloved partner of my existence, Mrs. Snob? Who should have\r\na greater place in my affections than her six brothers (three or four\r\nof whom we are pretty sure will favour us with their company at seven\r\no\'clock), or her angelic mother, my own valued mother-in-law?--for whom,\r\nfinally, would I wish to cater more generously than for your very humble\r\nservant, the present writer? Now, nobody supposes that the Birmingham\r\nplate is had out, the disguised carpet-beaters introduced to the\r\nexclusion of the neat parlour-maid, the miserable ENTREES from the\r\npastrycook\'s ordered in, and the children packed off (as it is supposed)\r\nto the nursery, but really only to the staircase, down which they slide\r\nduring the dinner-time, waylaying the dishes as they come out, and\r\nfingering the round bumps on the jellies, and the forced-meat balls\r\nin the soup,--nobody, I say, supposes that a dinner at home is\r\ncharacterized by the horrible ceremony, the foolish makeshifts, the mean\r\npomp and ostentation which distinguish our banquets on grand field-days.\r\n\r\nSuch a notion is monstrous. I would as soon think of having my dearest\r\nBessy sitting opposite me in a turban and bird of paradise, and showing\r\nher jolly mottled arms out of blond sleeves in her famous red satin\r\ngown: ay, or of having Mr. Toole every day, in a white waistcoat, at my\r\nback, shouting, \'Silence FAW the chair!\'\r\n\r\nNow, if this be the case; if the Brummagem-plate pomp and the\r\nprocessions of disguised footmen are odious and foolish in everyday\r\nlife, why not always? Why should Jones and I, who are in the middle\r\nrank, alter the modes of our being to assume an ECLAT which does not\r\nbelong to us--to entertain our friends, who (if we are worth anything\r\nand honest fellows at bottom,) are men of the middle rank too, who are\r\nnot in the least deceived by our temporary splendour, and who play off\r\nexactly the same absurd trick upon us when they ask us to dine?\r\n\r\nIf it be pleasant to dine with your friends, as all persons with good\r\nstomachs and kindly hearts will, I presume, allow it to be, it is better\r\nto dine twice than to dine once. It is impossible for men of small means\r\nto be continually spending five-and-twenty or thirty shillings on each\r\nfriend who sits down to their table. People dine for less. I myself have\r\nseen, at my favourite Club (the Senior United Service), His Grace the\r\nDuke of Wellington quite contented with the joint, one-and-three, and\r\nhalf-pint of sherry, nine; and if his Grace, why not you and I?\r\n\r\nThis rule I have made, and found the benefit of. Whenever I ask a couple\r\nof Dukes and a Marquis or so to dine with me, I set them down to a piece\r\nof beef, or a leg-of-mutton and trimmings. The grandees thank you for\r\nthis simplicity, and appreciate the same. My dear Jones, ask any of\r\nthose whom you have the honour of knowing, if such be not the case.\r\n\r\nI am far from wishing that their Graces should treat me in a similar\r\nfashion. Splendour is a part of their station, as decent comfort (let us\r\ntrust), of yours and mine. Fate has comfortably appointed gold plate for\r\nsome, and has bidden others contentedly to wear the willow-pattern. And\r\nbeing perfectly contented (indeed humbly thankful--for look around, O\r\nJones, and see the myriads who are not so fortunate,) to wear honest\r\nlinen, while magnificos of the world are adorned with cambric and\r\npoint-lace, surely we ought to hold as miserable, envious fools, those\r\nwretched Beaux Tibbs\'s of society, who sport a lace dickey, and nothing\r\nbesides,--the poor silly jays, who trail a peacock\'s feather behind\r\nthem, and think to simulate the gorgeous bird whose nature it is to\r\nstrut on palace-terraces, and to flaunt his magnificent fan-tail in the\r\nsunshine!\r\n\r\nThe jays with peacocks\' feathers are the Snobs of this world: and never,\r\nsince the days of Aesop, were they more numerous in any land than they\r\nare at present in this free country.\r\n\r\nHow does this most ancient apologue apply to the subject in hand?--the\r\nDinner-giving Snob. The imitation of the great is universal in this\r\ncity, from the palaces of Kensingtonia and Belgravia, even to the\r\nremotest corner of Brunswick Square.\r\n\r\nPeacocks\' feathers are stuck in the tails of most families. Scarce\r\none of us domestic birds but imitates the lanky, pavonine strut, and\r\nshrill, genteel scream. O you misguided dinner-giving Snobs, think how\r\nmuch pleasure you lose, and how much mischief you do with your\r\nabsurd grandeurs and hypocrisies! You stuff each other with unnatural\r\nforced-meats, and entertain each other to the ruin of friendship\r\n(let alone health) and the destruction of hospitality and\r\ngood-fellowship--you, who but for the peacock\'s tail might chatter away\r\nso much at your ease, and be so jovial and happy!\r\n\r\nWhen a man goes into a great set company of dinner-giving and\r\ndinner-receiving Snobs, if he has a philosophical turn of mind, he will\r\nconsider what a huge humbug the whole affair is: the dishes, and the\r\ndrink, and the servants, and the plate, and the host and hostess, and\r\nthe conversation, and the company,--the philosopher included.\r\n\r\nThe host is smiling, and hob-nobbing, and talking up and down the\r\ntable; but a prey to secret terrors and anxieties, lest the wines he\r\nhas brought up from the cellar should prove insufficient; lest a corked\r\nbottle should destroy his calculations; or our friend the carpet-beater,\r\nby making some BEVUE, should disclose his real quality of greengrocer,\r\nand show that he is not the family butler.\r\n\r\nThe hostess is smiling resolutely through all the courses, smiling\r\nthrough her agony; though her heart is in the kitchen, and she is\r\nspeculating with terror lest there be any disaster there. If the SOUFFLE\r\nshould collapse, or if Wiggins does not send the ices in time--she feels\r\nas if she would commit suicide--that smiling, jolly woman!\r\n\r\nThe children upstairs are yelling, as their maid is crimping their\r\nmiserable ringlets with hot tongs, tearing Miss Emmy\'s hair out by the\r\nroots, or scrubbing Miss Polly\'s dumpy nose with mottled soap till the\r\nlittle wretch screams herself into fits. The young males of the\r\nfamily are employed, as we have stated, in piratical exploits upon the\r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nThe servants are not servants, but the before-mentioned retail\r\ntradesmen.\r\n\r\nThe plate is not plate, but a mere shiny Birmingham lacquer; and so is\r\nthe hospitality, and everything else.\r\n\r\nThe talk is Birmingham talk. The wag of the party, with bitterness in\r\nhis heart, having just quitted his laundress, who is dunning him for her\r\nbill, is firing off good stories; and the opposition wag is furious\r\nthat he cannot get an innings. Jawkins, the great conversationalist, is\r\nscornful and indignant with the pair of them, because he is kept out of\r\ncourt. Young Muscadel, that cheap dandy, is talking Fashion and Almack\'s\r\nout of the MORNING POST, and disgusting his neighbour, Mrs. Fox, who\r\nreflects that she has never been there. The widow is vexed out of\r\npatience, because her daughter Maria has got a place beside young\r\nCambric, the penniless curate, and not by Colonel Goldmore, the rich\r\nwidower from India. The Doctor\'s wife is sulky, because she has not been\r\nled out before the barrister\'s lady; old Doctor Cork is grumbling at the\r\nwine, and Guttleton sneering at the cookery.\r\n\r\nAnd to think that all these people might be so happy, and easy, and\r\nfriendly, were they brought together in a natural unpretentious way,\r\nand but for an unhappy passion for peacocks\' feathers in England. Gentle\r\nshades of Marat and Robespierre! when I see how all the honesty of\r\nsociety is corrupted among us by the miserable fashion-worship, I feel\r\nas angry as Mrs. Fox just mentioned, and ready to order a general BATTUE\r\nof peacocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI--SOME CONTINENTAL SNOBS\r\n\r\nNow that September has come, and all our Parliamentary duties are over,\r\nperhaps no class of Snobs are in such high feather as the Continental\r\nSnobs. I watch these daily as they commence their migrations from the\r\nbeach at Folkestone. I see shoals of them depart (not perhaps without\r\nan innate longing too to quit the Island along with those happy Snobs).\r\nFarewell, dear friends, I say: you little know that the individual\r\nwho regards you from the beach is your friend and historiographer and\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nI went to-day to see our excellent friend Snooks, on board the \'Queen of\r\nthe French;\' many scores of Snobs were there, on the deck of that fine\r\nship, marching forth in their pride and bravery. They will be at Ostend\r\nin four hours; they will inundate the Continent next week; they will\r\ncarry into far lands the famous image of the British Snob. I shall\r\nnot see them--but am with them in spirit: and indeed there is hardly a\r\ncountry in the known and civilized world in which these eyes have not\r\nbeheld them.\r\n\r\nI have seen Snobs, in pink coats and hunting-boots, scouring over the\r\nCampagna of Rome; and have heard their oaths and their well-known slang\r\nin the galleries of the Vatican, and under the shadowy arches of\r\nthe Colosseum. I have met a Snob on a dromedary in the desert, and\r\npicnicking under the Pyramid of Cheops. I like to think how many gallant\r\nBritish Snobs there are, at this minute of writing, pushing their\r\nheads out of every window in the courtyard of \'Meurice\'s\' in the Rue\r\nde Rivoli; or roaring out, \'Garsong, du pang,\' \'Garsong, du Yang;\' or\r\nswaggering down the Toledo at Naples; or even how many will be on the\r\nlook-out for Snooks on Ostend Pier,--for Snooks, and the rest of the\r\nSnobs on board the \'Queen of the French.\'\r\n\r\nLook at the Marquis of Carabas and his two carriages. My Lady\r\nMarchioness comes on board, looks round with that happy air of mingled\r\nterror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship, and rushes to\r\nher carriage, for it is impossible that she should mingle with the\r\nother Snobs on deck. There she sits, and will be ill in private. The\r\nstrawberry leaves on her chariot-panels are engraved on her ladyship\'s\r\nheart. If she were going to heaven instead of to Ostend, I rather think\r\nshe would expect to have DES PLACES RESERVEES for her, and would send to\r\norder the best rooms. A courier, with his money-bag of office round his\r\nshoulders--a huge scowling footman, whose dark pepper-and-salt livery\r\nglistens with the heraldic insignia of the Carabases--a brazen-looking,\r\ntawdry French FEMME-DE-CHAMBRE (none but a female pen can do justice\r\nto that wonderful tawdry toilette of the lady\'s-maid EN VOYAGE)--and\r\na miserable DAME DE COMPAGNIE, are ministering to the wants of her\r\nladyship and her King Charles\'s spaniel. They are rushing to and fro\r\nwith eau-de-Cologne, pocket-handkerchiefs, which are all fringe and\r\ncipher, and popping mysterious cushions behind and before, and in every\r\navailable corner of the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe little Marquis, her husband is walking about the deck in a\r\nbewildered manner, with a lean daughter on each arm: the carroty-tufted\r\nhope of the family is already smoking on the foredeck in a travelling\r\ncostume checked all over, and in little lacquer-tip pod jean boots, and\r\na shirt embroidered with pink boa-constrictors. \'What is it that gives\r\ntravelling Snobs such a marvellous propensity to rush into a costume?\r\nWhy should a man not travel in a coat, &c.? but think proper to dress\r\nhimself like a harlequin in mourning? See, even young Aldermanbury,\r\nthe tallow-merchant, who has just stepped on board, has got a\r\ntravelling-dress gaping all over with pockets; and little Tom Tapeworm,\r\nthe lawyer\'s clerk out of the City, who has but three weeks\' leave,\r\nturns out in gaiters and a bran-new shooting-jacket, and must let the\r\nmoustaches grow on his little sniffy upper lip, forsooth!\r\n\r\nPompey Hicks is giving elaborate directions to his servant, and asking\r\nloudly, \'Davis, where\'s the dwessing-case?\' and \'Davis, you\'d best\r\ntake the pistol-case into the cabin.\' Little Pompey travels with a\r\ndressing-case, and without a beard: whom he is going to shoot with his\r\npistols, who on earth can tell? and what he is to do with his servant\r\nbut wait upon him, I am at a loss to conjecture.\r\n\r\nLook at honest Nathan Houndsditch and his lady, and their little son.\r\nWhat a noble air of blazing contentment illuminates the features of\r\nthose Snobs of Eastern race! What a toilette Houndsditch\'s is! What\r\nrings and chains, what gold-headed canes and diamonds, what a tuft the\r\nrogue has got to his chin (the rogue! he will never spare himself any\r\ncheap enjoyment!) Little Houndsditch has a little cane with a gilt head\r\nand little mosaic ornaments--altogether an extra air. As for the lady,\r\nshe is all the colours of the rainbow! she has a pink parasol, with a\r\nwhite lining, and a yellow bonnet, and an emerald green shawl, and\r\na shot-silk pelisse; and drab boots and rhubarb-coloured gloves;\r\nand parti-coloured glass buttons, expanding from the size of a\r\nfourpenny-piece to a crown, glitter and twiddle all down the front\r\nof her gorgeous costume. I have said before, I like to look at \'the\r\nPeoples\' on their gala days, they are so picturesquely and outrageously\r\nsplendid and happy.\r\n\r\nYonder comes Captain Bull; spick and span, tight and trim; who travels\r\nfor four or six months every year of his life; who does not commit\r\nhimself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour, but I think is\r\nas great a Snob as any man on board. Bull passes the season in London,\r\nsponging for dinners, and sleeping in a garret near his Club. Abroad,\r\nhe has been everywhere; he knows the best wine at every inn in every\r\ncapital in Europe; lives with the best English company there; has seen\r\nevery palace and picture-gallery from Madrid to Stockholm; speaks\r\nan abominable little jargon of half-a-dozen languages--and knows\r\nnothing--nothing. Bull hunts tufts on the Continent, and is a sort of\r\namateur courier. He will scrape acquaintance with old Carabas before\r\nthey make Ostend; and will remind his lordship that he met him at Vienna\r\ntwenty years ago, or gave him a glass of Schnapps up the Righi. We have\r\nsaid Bull knows nothing: he knows the birth, arms, and pedigree of all\r\nthe peerage, has poked his little eyes into every one of the carriages\r\non board--their panels noted and their crests surveyed; he knows all the\r\nContinental stories of English scandal--how Count Towrowski ran off\r\nwith Miss Baggs at Naples--how VERY thick Lady Smigsmag was with young\r\nCornichon of the French Legation at Florence--the exact amount which\r\nJack Deuceace won of Bob Greengoose at Baden--what it is that made the\r\nStaggs settle on the Continent: the sum for which the O\'Goggarty\r\nestates are mortgaged, &c. If he can\'t catch a lord he will hook on to a\r\nbaronet, or else the old wretch will catch hold of some beardless young\r\nstripling of fashion, and show him \'life\' in various and amiable and\r\ninaccessible quarters. Faugh! the old brute! If he has every one of the\r\nvices of the most boisterous youth, at least he is comforted by having\r\nno conscience. He is utterly stupid, but of a jovial turn, He believes\r\nhimself to be quite a respectable member of society: but perhaps the\r\nonly good action he ever did in his life is the involuntary one of\r\ngiving an example to be avoided, and showing what an odious thing in\r\nthe social picture is that figure of the debauched old man who passes\r\nthrough life rather a decorous Silenus, and dies some day in his garret,\r\nalone, unrepenting, and unnoted, save by his astonished heirs, who find\r\nthat the dissolute old miser has left money behind him. See! he is up to\r\nold Carabas already! I told you he would.\r\n\r\nYonder you see the old Lady Mary MacScrew, and those middle-aged young\r\nwomen her daughters; they are going to cheapen and haggle in Belgium and\r\nup the Rhine until they meet with a boarding-house where they can live\r\nupon less board-wages than her ladyship pays her footmen. But she will\r\nexact and receive considerable respect from the British Snobs located in\r\nthe watering place which she selects for her summer residence, being the\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Haggistoun. That broad-shouldered buck, with the\r\ngreat whiskers and the cleaned white kid-gloves, is Mr. Phelim Clancy of\r\nPoldoodystown: he calls himself Mr. De Clancy; he endeavours to disguise\r\nhis native brogue with the richest superposition of English; and if you\r\nplay at billiards or ECARTE with him, the chances are that you will win\r\nthe first game, and he the seven or eight games ensuing.\r\n\r\nThat overgrown lady with the four daughters, and the young dandy from\r\nthe University, her son, is Mrs. Kewsy, the eminent barrister\'s lady,\r\nwho would rather die than not be in the fashion. She has the \'Peerage\'\r\nin her carpet-bag, you may be sure; but she is altogether cut out by\r\nMrs. Quod, the attorney\'s wife, whose carriage, with the apparatus of\r\nrumbles, dickeys, and imperials, scarcely yields in splendour to the\r\nMarquis of Carabas\'s own travelling-chariot, and whose courier has even\r\nbigger whiskers and a larger morocco money-bag than the Marquis\'s own\r\ntravelling gentleman. Remark her well: she is talking to Mr. Spout, the\r\nnew Member for Jawborough, who is going out to inspect the operations\r\nof the Zollverein, and will put some very severe questions to Lord\r\nPalmerston next session upon England and her relations with the\r\nPrussian-blue trade, the Naples-soap trade, the German-tinder trade, &c.\r\nSpout will patronize King Leopold at Brussels; will write letters from\r\nabroad to the JAWBOROUGH INDEPENDENT; and in his quality of MEMBER DU\r\nPARLIAMONG BRITANNIQUE, will expect to be invited to a family dinner\r\nwith every sovereign whose dominions he honours with a visit during his\r\ntour.\r\n\r\nThe next person is--but hark! the bell for shore is ringing, and,\r\nshaking Snook\'s hand cordially, we rush on to the pier, waving him a\r\nfarewell as the noble black ship cuts keenly through the sunny azure\r\nwaters, bearing away that cargo of Snobs outward bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII--CONTINENTAL SNOBBERY CONTINUED\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to laugh at the French for their braggadocio\r\npropensities, and intolerable vanity about La France, la gloire,\r\nl\'Empereur, and the like; and yet I think in my heart that the British\r\nSnob, for conceit and self-sufficiency and braggartism in his way, is\r\nwithout a parallel. There is always something uneasy in a Frenchman\'s\r\nconceit. He brags with so much fury, shrieking, and gesticulation; yells\r\nout so loudly that the Francais is at the head of civilization, the\r\ncentre of thought, &c.; that one can\'t but see the poor fellow has a\r\nlurking doubt in his own mind that he is not the wonder he professes to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nAbout the British Snob, on the contrary, there is commonly no noise, no\r\nbluster, but the calmness of profound conviction. We are better than all\r\nthe world; we don\'t question the opinion at all; it\'s an axiom. And when\r\na Frenchman bellows out, \'LA FRANCE, MONSIEUR, LA FRANCE EST A LA TETE\r\nDU MONDE CIVILISE!\' we laugh good-naturedly at the frantic poor devil.\r\nWE are the first chop of the world: we know the fact so well in our\r\nsecret hearts that a claim set up elsewhere is simply ludicrous. My dear\r\nbrother reader, say, as a man of honour, if you are not of this opinion?\r\nDo you think a Frenchman your equal? You don\'t--you gallant British\r\nSnob--you know you don\'t: no more, perhaps, does the Snob your humble\r\nservant, brother.\r\n\r\nAnd I am inclined to think it is this conviction, and the consequent\r\nbearing of the Englishman towards the foreigner whom he condescends to\r\nvisit, this confidence of superiority which holds up the head of the\r\nowner of every English hat-box from Sicily to St. Petersburg, that makes\r\nus so magnificently hated throughout Europe as we are; this--more than\r\nall our little victories, and of which many Frenchmen and Spaniards have\r\nnever heard--this amazing and indomitable insular pride, which animates\r\nmy lord in his travelling-carriage as well as John in the rumble.\r\n\r\nIf you read the old Chronicles of the French wars, you find precisely\r\nthe same character of the Englishman, and Henry V.\'s people behaved with\r\njust the cool domineering manner of our gallant veterans of France\r\nand the Peninsula. Did you never hear Colonel Cutler and Major Slasher\r\ntalking over the war after dinner? or Captain Boarder describing his\r\naction with the \'Indomptable?\' \'Hang the fellows,\' says Boarder, \'their\r\npractice was very good. I was beat off three times before I took her.\'\r\n\'Cuss those carabineers of Milhaud\'s,\' says Slasher, \'what work they\r\nmade of our light cavalry!\' implying a sort of surprise that the\r\nFrenchman should stand up against Britons at all: a good-natured wonder\r\nthat the blind, mad, vain-glorious, brave poor devils should actually\r\nhave the courage to resist an Englishman. Legions of such Englishmen\r\nare patronizing Europe at this moment, being kind to the Pope, or\r\ngood-natured to the King of Holland, or condescending to inspect the\r\nPrussian reviews. When Nicholas came here, who reviews a quarter of a\r\nmillion of pairs of moustaches to his breakfast every morning, we took\r\nhim off to Windsor and showed him two whole regiments of six or eight\r\nhundred Britons a-piece, with an air as much as to say,--\'There, my boy,\r\nlook at THAT. Those are ENGLISHMEN, those are, and your master whenever\r\nyou please,\' as the nursery song says. The British Snob is long, long\r\npast scepticism, and can afford to laugh quite good-humouredly at those\r\nconceited Yankees, or besotted little Frenchmen, who set up as models of\r\nmankind. THEY forsooth!\r\n\r\nI have been led into these remarks by listening to an old fellow at the\r\nHotel du Nord, at Boulogne, and who is evidently of the Slasher sort. He\r\ncame down and seated himself at the breakfast-table, with a surly\r\nscowl on his salmon-coloured bloodshot face, strangling in a tight,\r\ncross-barred cravat; his linen and his appointments so perfectly stiff\r\nand spotless that everybody at once recognized him as a dear countryman.\r\nOnly our port-wine and other admirable institutions could have produced\r\na figure so insolent, so stupid, so gentleman-like. After a while our\r\nattention was called to him by his roaring out, in a voice of plethoric\r\nfury, \'O!\'\r\n\r\nEverybody turned round at the \'O,\' conceiving the Colonel to be, as his\r\ncountenance denoted him, in intense pain; but the waiters knew better,\r\nand instead of being alarmed, brought the Colonel the kettle. \'O,\' it\r\nappears, is the French for hot-water. The Colonel (though he despises it\r\nheartily) thinks he speaks the language remarkably well. Whilst he was\r\ninhausting his smoking tea, which went rolling and gurgling down his\r\nthroat, and hissing over the \'hot coppers\' of that respectable veteran,\r\na friend joined him, with a wizened face and very black wig, evidently a\r\nColonel too.\r\n\r\nThe two warriors, waggling their old heads at each other, presently\r\njoined breakfast, and fell into conversation, and we had the advantage\r\nof hearing about the old war, and some pleasant conjectures as to the\r\nnext, which they considered imminent. They psha\'d the French fleet; they\r\npooh-pooh\'d the French commercial marine; they showed how, in a war,\r\nthere would be a cordon (\'a cordong, by---\') of steamers along our\r\ncoast, and \'by ---,\' ready at a minute to land anywhere on the other\r\nshore, to give the French as good a thrashing as they got in the last\r\nwar, \'by ---\'. In fact, a rumbling cannonade of oaths was fired by the\r\ntwo veterans during the whole of their conversation.\r\n\r\nThere was a Frenchman in the room, but as he had not been above ten\r\nyears in London, of course he did not speak the language, and lost the\r\nbenefit of the conversation. \'But, O my country!\' said I to myself, it\'s\r\nno wonder that you are so beloved! If I were a Frenchman, how I would\r\nhate you!\'\r\n\r\nThat brutal, ignorant, peevish bully of an Englishman is showing himself\r\nin every city of Europe. One of the dullest creatures under heaven, he\r\ngoes travelling Europe under foot, shouldering his way into galleries\r\nand cathedrals, and bustling into palaces with his buck-ram uniform.\r\nAt church or theatre, gala or picture-gallery, HIS face never varies.\r\nA thousand delightful sights pass before his bloodshot eyes, and don\'t\r\naffect him. Countless brilliant scenes of life and manners are shown\r\nhim, but never move him. He goes to church, and calls the practices\r\nthere degrading and superstitious: as if HIS altar was the only one that\r\nwas acceptable. He goes to picture-galleries, and is more ignorant about\r\nArt than a French shoeblack. Art, Nature pass, and there is no dot of\r\nadmiration in his stupid eyes: nothing moves him, except when a very\r\ngreat man comes his way, and then the rigid, proud, self-confident,\r\ninflexible British Snob can be as humble as a flunkey and as supple as a\r\nharlequin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII--ENGLISH SNOBS ON THE CONTINENT\r\n\r\n\'WHAT is the use of Lord Rome\'s telescope?\' my friend Panwiski exclaimed\r\nthe other day. \'It only enables you to see a few hundred thousands of\r\nmiles farther. What were thought to be mere nebulae, turn out to be most\r\nperceivable starry systems; and beyond these, you see other nebulae,\r\nwhich a more powerful glass will show to be stars, again; and so they go\r\non glittering and winking away into eternity.\' With which my friend Pan,\r\nheaving a great sigh, as if confessing his inability to look Infinity in\r\nthe face, sank back resigned, and swallowed a large bumper of claret.\r\n\r\nI (who, like other great men, have but one idea), thought to myself,\r\nthat as the stars are, so are the Snobs:--the more you gaze upon those\r\nluminaries, the more you behold--now nebulously congregated--now faintly\r\ndistinguishable--now brightly defined--until they twinkle off in endless\r\nblazes, and fade into the immeasurable darkness. I am but as a child\r\nplaying on the sea-shore. Some telescopic philosopher will arise one\r\nday, some great Snobonomer, to find the laws of the great science which\r\nwe are now merely playing with, and to define, and settle, and classify\r\nthat which is at present but vague theory, and loose though elegant\r\nassertion.\r\n\r\nYes: a single eye can but trace a very few and simple varieties of\r\nthe enormous universe of Snobs. I sometimes think of appealing to\r\nthe public, and calling together a congress of SAVANS, such as met at\r\nSouthampton--each to bring his contributions and read his paper on the\r\nGreat Subject. For what can a single poor few do, even with the subject\r\nat present in hand? English Snobs on the Continent--though they are a\r\nhundred thousand times less numerous than on their native island, yet\r\neven these few are too many. One can only fix a stray one here and\r\nthere. The individuals are caught--the thousands escape. I have noted\r\ndown but three whom I have met with in my walk this morning through this\r\npleasant marine city of Boulogne.\r\n\r\nThere is the English Raff Snob, that frequents ESTAMINETS and CABARETS;\r\nwho is heard yelling, \'We won\'t go home till morning!\' and startling\r\nthe midnight echoes of quiet Continental towns with shrieks of English\r\nslang. The boozy unshorn wretch is seen hovering round quays as packets\r\narrive, and tippling drains in inn bars where he gets credit. He\r\ntalks French with slang familiarity: he and his like quite people the\r\ndebt-prisons on the Continent. He plays pool at the billiard-houses, and\r\nmay be seen engaged at cards and dominoes of forenoons. His signature is\r\nto be seen on countless bills of exchange: it belonged to an honourable\r\nfamily once, very likely; for the English Raff most probably began by\r\nbeing a gentleman, and has a father over the water who is ashamed to\r\nhear his name. He has cheated the old \'governor\' repeatedly in better\r\ndays, and swindled his sisters of their portions, and robbed his younger\r\nbrothers. Now he is living on his wife\'s jointure: she is hidden away in\r\nsome dismal garret, patching shabby finery and cobbling up old clothes\r\nfor her children--the most miserable and slatternly of women.\r\n\r\nOr sometimes the poor woman and her daughters go about timidly, giving\r\nlessons in English and music, or do embroidery and work under-hand, to\r\npurchase the means for the POT-AU-FEU; while Raff is swaggering on the\r\nquay, or tossing off glasses of cognac at the CAF\xc9. The unfortunate\r\ncreature has a child still every year, and her constant hypocrisy is to\r\ntry and make her girls believe that their father is a respectable man,\r\nand to huddle him out of the way when the brute comes home drunk.\r\n\r\nThose poor ruined souls get together and have a society of their own,\r\nthe which it is very affecting to watch--those tawdry pretences at\r\ngentility, those flimsy attempts at gaiety: those woful sallies: that\r\njingling old piano; oh, it makes the heart sick to see and hear them. As\r\nMrs. Raff, with her company of pale daughters, gives a penny tea to Mrs.\r\nDiddler, they talk about bygone times and the fine society they kept;\r\nand they sing feeble songs out of tattered old music-books; and while\r\nengaged in this sort of entertainment, in comes Captain Raff with his\r\ngreasy hat on one side, and straightway the whole of the dismal room\r\nreeks with a mingled odour of smoke and spirits.\r\n\r\nHas not everybody who has lived abroad met Captain Raff? His name is\r\nproclaimed, every now and then, by Mr. Sheriff\'s Officer Hemp; and about\r\nBoulogne, and Paris, and Brussels, there are so many of his sort that\r\nI will lay a wager that I shall be accused of gross personality for\r\nshowing him up. Many a less irreclaimable villain is transported; many a\r\nmore honourable man is at present at the treadmill; and although we\r\nare the noblest, greatest, most religious, and most moral people in the\r\nworld, I would still like to know where, except in the United Kingdom,\r\ndebts are a matter of joke, and making tradesmen \'suffer\' a sport that\r\ngentlemen own to? It is dishonourable to owe money in France. You never\r\nhear people in other parts of Europe brag of their swindling; or see\r\na prison in a large Continental town which is not more or less peopled\r\nwith English rogues.\r\n\r\nA still more loathsome and dangerous Snob than the above transparent and\r\npassive scamp, is frequent on the continent of Europe, and my young Snob\r\nfriends who are travelling thither should be especially warned against\r\nhim. Captain Legg is a gentleman, like Raff, though perhaps of a better\r\ndegree. He has robbed his family too, but of a great deal more, and has\r\nboldly dishonoured bills for thousands, where Raff has been boggling\r\nover the clumsy conveyance of a ten-pound note. Legg is always at the\r\nbest inn, with the finest waistcoats and moustaches, or tearing about\r\nin the flashest of britzkas, while poor Raff is tipsifying himself with\r\nspirits, and smoking cheap tobacco. It is amazing to think that Legg, so\r\noften shown up, and known everywhere, is flourishing yet. He would sink\r\ninto utter ruin, but for the constant and ardent love of gentility that\r\ndistinguishes the English Snob. There is many a young fellow of the\r\nmiddle classes who must know Legg to be a rogue and a cheat; and yet\r\nfrom his desire to be in the fashion, and his admiration of tip-top\r\nswells, and from his ambition to air himself by the side of a Lord\'s\r\nson, will let Legg make an income out of him; content to pay, so long\r\nas he can enjoy that society. Many a worthy father of a family, when he\r\nhears that his son is riding about with Captain Legg, Lord Levant\'s son,\r\nis rather pleased that young Hopeful should be in such good company.\r\n\r\nLegg and his friend, Major Macer, make professional tours through\r\nEurope, and are to be found at the right places at the right time. Last\r\nyear I heard how my young acquaintance, Mr. Muff, from Oxford, going\r\nto see a little life at a Carnival ball at Paris, was accosted by an\r\nEnglishman who did not know a word of the d----language, and hearing\r\nMuff speak it so admirably, begged him to interpret to a waiter with\r\nwhom there was a dispute about refreshments. It was quite a comfort, the\r\nstranger said, to see an honest English face; and did Muff know where\r\nthere was a good place for supper? So those two went to supper, and who\r\nshould come in, of all men in the world, but Major Macer? And so Legg\r\nintroduced Macer, and so there came on a little intimacy, and three-card\r\nloo, &c. &c.. Year after year scores of Muffs, in various places in\r\nthe world, are victimised by Legg and Macer. The story is so stale, the\r\ntrick of seduction so entirely old and clumsy, that it is only a\r\nwonder people can be taken in any more: but the temptations of vice\r\nand gentility together are too much for young English Snobs, and those\r\nsimple young victims are caught fresh every day. Though it is only to\r\nbe kicked and cheated by men of fashion, your true British Snob will\r\npresent himself for the honour.\r\n\r\nI need not allude here to that very common British Snob, who makes\r\ndesperate efforts at becoming intimate with the great Continental\r\naristocracy, such as old Rolls, the baker, who has set up his quarters\r\nin the Faubourg Saint Germain, and will receive none but Carlists, and\r\nno French gentleman under the rank of a Marquis. We can all of us laugh\r\nat THAT fellow\'s pretensions well enough--we who tremble before a great\r\nman of our own nation. But, as you say, my brave and honest John Bull\r\nof a Snob, a French Marquis of twenty descents is very different from\r\nan English Peer; and a pack of beggarly German and Italian Fuersten\r\nand Principi awaken the scorn of an honest-minded Briton. But our\r\naristocracy!--that\'s a very different matter. They are the real leaders\r\nof the world--the real old original and-no-mistake nobility.\r\n\r\nOff with your cap, Snob; down on your knees, Snob, and truckle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV--ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\nTired of the town, where the sight of the closed shutters of the\r\nnobility, my friends, makes my heart sick in my walks; afraid almost to\r\nsit in those vast Pall Mall solitudes, the Clubs, and of annoying the\r\nClub waiters, who might, I thought, be going to shoot in the country,\r\nbut for me, I determined on a brief tour in the provinces, and paying\r\nsome visits in the country which were long due.\r\n\r\nMy first visit was to my friend Major Ponto (H.P. of the Horse Marines),\r\nin Mangelwurzelshire. The Major, in his little phaeton, was in waiting\r\nto take me up at the station. The vehicle was not certainly splendid,\r\nbut such a carriage as would accommodate a plain man (as Ponto said he\r\nwas) and a numerous family. We drove by beautiful fresh fields and green\r\nhedges, through a cheerful English landscape; the high-road, as smooth\r\nand trim as the way in a nobleman\'s park, was charmingly chequered with\r\ncool shade and golden sunshine. Rustics in snowy smock-frocks jerked\r\ntheir hats off smiling as we passed. Children, with cheeks as red as the\r\napples in the orchards, bobbed curtsies to us at the cottage-doors.\r\nBlue church spires rose here and there in the distance: and as the buxom\r\ngardener\'s wife opened the white gate at the Major\'s little ivy-covered\r\nlodge, and we drove through the neat plantations of firs and evergreens,\r\nup to the house, my bosom felt a joy and elation which I thought it was\r\nimpossible to experience in the smoky atmosphere of a town. \'Here,\' I\r\nmentally exclaimed, \'is all peace, plenty, happiness. Here, I shall be\r\nrid of Snobs. There can be none in this charming Arcadian spot.\'\r\n\r\nStripes, the Major\'s man (formerly corporal in his gallant corps),\r\nreceived my portmanteau, and an elegant little present, which I had\r\nbrought from town as a peace-offering to Mrs. Ponto; viz., a cod and\r\noysters from Grove\'s, in a hamper about the size of a coffin.\r\n\r\nPonto\'s house (\'The Evergreens\' Mrs. P. has christened it) is a perfect\r\nParadise of a place. It is all over creepers, and bow-windows,\r\nand verandahs. A wavy lawn tumbles up and down all round it, with\r\nflower-beds of wonderful shapes, and zigzag gravel walks, and beautiful\r\nbut damp shrubberies of myrtles and glistening laurustines, which have\r\nprocured it its change of name. It was called Little Bullock\'s Pound\r\nin old Doctor Ponto\'s time. I had a view of the pretty grounds, and the\r\nstable, and the adjoining village and church, and a great park beyond,\r\nfrom the windows of the bedroom whither Ponto conducted me. It was the\r\nyellow bedroom, the freshest and pleasantest of bed-chambers; the air\r\nwas fragrant with a large bouquet that was placed on the writing-table;\r\nthe linen was fragrant with the lavender in which it had been laid; the\r\nchintz hangings of the bed and the big sofa were, if not fragrant with\r\nflowers, at least painted all over with them; the pen-wiper on the table\r\nwas the imitation of a double dahlia; and there was accommodation for my\r\nwatch in a sun-flower on the mantelpiece. A scarlet-leaved creeper came\r\ncurling over the windows, through which the setting sun was pouring a\r\nflood of golden light. It was all flowers and freshness. Oh, how unlike\r\nthose black chimney-pots in St. Alban\'s Place, London, on which these\r\nweary eyes are accustomed to look.\r\n\r\n\'It must be all happiness here, Ponto,\' said I, flinging myself down\r\ninto the snug BERGERE, and inhaling such a delicious draught of country\r\nair as all the MILLEFLEURS of Mr. Atkinson\'s shop cannot impart to any\r\nthe most expensive pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\'Nice place, isn\'t it?\' said Ponto. \'Quiet and unpretending. I like\r\neverything quiet. You\'ve not brought your valet with you? Stripes will\r\narrange your dressing things;\' and that functionary, entering at the\r\nsame time, proceeded to gut my portmanteau, and to lay out the black\r\nkerseymeres, \'the rich cut velvet Genoa waistcoat,\' the white choker,\r\nand other polite articles of evening costume, with great gravity and\r\ndespatch. \'A great dinner-party,\' thinks I to myself, seeing these\r\npreparations (and not, perhaps, displeased at the idea that some of the\r\nbest people in the neighbourhood were coming to see me). \'Hark, theres\r\nthe first bell ringing! \'said Ponto, moving away; and, in fact, a\r\nclamorous harbinger of victuals began clanging from the stable\r\nturret, and announced the agreeable fact that dinner would appear in\r\nhalf-an-hour. \'If the dinner is as grand as the dinner-bell,\' thought I,\r\n\'faith, I\'m in good quarters!\' and had leisure, during the half-hour\'s\r\ninterval, not only to advance my own person to the utmost polish of\r\nelegance which it is capable of receiving, to admire the pedigree of the\r\nPontos hanging over the chimney, and the Ponto crest and arms emblazoned\r\non the wash-hand basin and jug, but to make a thousand reflections on\r\nthe happiness of a country life--upon the innocent friendliness and\r\ncordiality of rustic intercourse; and to sigh for an opportunity of\r\nretiring, like Ponto, to my own fields, to my own vine and fig-tree,\r\nwith a placens uxor in my domus, and a half-score of sweet young pledges\r\nof affection sporting round my paternal knee.\r\n\r\nClang! At the end of thirty minutes, dinner-bell number two pealed from\r\nthe adjacent turret. I hastened downstairs, expecting to find a score\r\nof healthy country folk in the drawing-room. There was only one person\r\nthere; a tall and Roman-nosed lady, glistering over with bugles, in deep\r\nmourning. She rose, advanced two steps, made a majestic curtsey, during\r\nwhich all the bugles in her awful head-dress began to twiddle and\r\nquiver--and then said, \'Mr. Snob, we are very happy to see you at the\r\nEvergreens,\' and heaved a great sigh.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was Mrs. Major Ponto; to whom making my very best bow, I\r\nreplied, that I was very proud to make her acquaintance, as also that of\r\nso charming a place as the Evergreens.\r\n\r\nAnother sigh. \'We are distantly related, Mr. Snob,\' said she, shaking\r\nher melancholy head. \'Poor dear Lord Rubadub!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' said I; not knowing what the deuce Mrs. Major Ponto meant.\r\n\r\n\'Major Ponto told me that you were of the Leicestershire Snobs: a very\r\nold family, and related to Lord Snobbington, who married Laura Rubadub,\r\nwho is a cousin of mine, as was her poor dear father, for whom we are\r\nmourning. What a seizure! only sixty-three, and apoplexy quite unknown\r\nuntil now in our family! In life we are in death, Mr. Snob. Does Lady\r\nSnobbington bear the deprivation well?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, really, ma\'am, I--I don\'t know,\' I replied, more and more\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\nAs she was speaking I heard a sort of CLOOP, by which well-known sound I\r\nwas aware that somebody was opening a bottle of wine, and Ponto entered,\r\nin a huge white neckcloth, and a rather shabby black suit.\r\n\r\n\'My love,\' Mrs. Major Ponto said to her husband, \'we were talking of our\r\ncousin--poor dear Lord Rubadub. His death has placed some of the first\r\nfamilies in England in mourning. Does Lady Rubadub keep the house in\r\nHill Street, do you know?\'\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know, but I said, \'I believe she does,\' at a venture; and,\r\nlooking down to the drawing-room table, saw the inevitable, abominable,\r\nmaniacal, absurd, disgusting \'Peerage\' open on the table, interleaved\r\nwith annotations, and open at the article \'Snobbington.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dinner is served,\' says Stripes, flinging open the door; and I gave\r\nMrs. Major Ponto my arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV--A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\nOf the dinner to which we now sat down, I am not going to be a severe\r\ncritic. The mahogany I hold to be inviolable; but this I will say, that\r\nI prefer sherry to marsala when I can get it, and the latter was the\r\nwine of which I have no doubt I heard the \'cloop\' just before dinner.\r\nNor was it particularly good of its kind; however, Mrs. Major Ponto did\r\nnot evidently know the difference, for she called the liquor Amontillado\r\nduring the whole of the repast, and drank but half a glass of it,\r\nleaving the rest for the Major and his guest.\r\n\r\nStripes was in the livery of the Ponto family--a thought shabby, but\r\ngorgeous in the extreme--lots of magnificent worsted lace, and livery\r\nbuttons of a very notable size. The honest fellow\'s hands, I remarked,\r\nwere very large and black; and a fine odour of the stable was wafted\r\nabout the room as he moved to and fro in his ministration. I should have\r\npreferred a clean maidservant, but the sensations of Londoners are too\r\nacute perhaps on these subjects; and a faithful John, after all, IS more\r\ngenteel.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstance of the dinner being composed of pig\'s-head\r\nmock-turtle soup, of pig\'s fry and roast ribs of pork, I am led to\r\nimagine that one of Ponto\'s black Hampshires had been sacrificed a short\r\ntime previous to my visit. It was an excellent and comfortable repast;\r\nonly there WAS rather a sameness in it, certainly. I made a similar\r\nremark the next day\'.\r\n\r\nDuring the dinner Mrs. Ponto asked me many questions regarding the\r\nnobility, my relatives. \'When Lady Angelina Skeggs would come out;\r\nand if the countess her mamma\' (this was said with much archness and\r\nhe-he-ing) \'still wore that extraordinary purple hair-dye?\' \'Whether my\r\nLord Guttlebury kept, besides his French chef, and an English cordonbleu\r\nfor the roasts, an Italian for the confectionery?\'\r\n\r\n\'Who attended at Lady Clapperclaw\'s conversazioni?\' and \'whether Sir\r\nJohn Champignon\'s "Thursday Mornings" were pleasant?\' \'Was it true that\r\nLady Carabas, wanting to pawn her diamonds, found that they were paste,\r\nand that the Marquis had disposed of them beforehand?\' \'How was it that\r\nSnuffin, the great tobacco-merchant, broke off the marriage which was on\r\nthe tapis between him and their second daughter; and was it true that a\r\nmulatto lady came over from the Havanna and forbade the match?\'\r\n\r\n\'Upon my word, Madam,\' I had begun, and was going on to say that I\r\ndidn\'t know one word about all these matters which seemed so to interest\r\nMrs. Major Ponto, when the Major, giving me a tread or stamp with his\r\nlarge foot under the table, said--\'Come, come, Snob my boy, we are all\r\ntiled, you know. We KNOW you\'re one of the fashionable people about\r\ntown: we saw your name at Lady Clapperclaw\'s SOIREES, and the Champignon\r\nbreakfasts; and as for the Rubadubs, of course, as relations ---\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, of course, I dine there twice a-week,\' I said; and then I\r\nremembered that my cousin, Humphry Snob, of the Middle Temple, IS a\r\ngreat frequenter of genteel societies, and to have seen his name in the\r\nMORNING POST at the tag-end of several party lists. So, taking the\r\nhint, I am ashamed to say I indulged Mrs. Major Ponto with a deal of\r\ninformation about the first families in England, such as would astonish\r\nthose great personages if they knew it. I described to her most\r\naccurately the three reigning beauties of last season at Almack\'s:\r\ntold her in confidence that his Grace the D--- of W--- was going to be\r\nmarried the day after his Statue was put up; that his Grace the D--- of\r\nD--- was also about to lead the fourth daughter of the Archduke Stephen\r\nto the hymeneal altar:--and talked to her, in a word, just in the style\r\nof Mrs. Gore\'s last fashionable novel.\r\n\r\nMrs. Major was quite fascinated by this brilliant conversation. She\r\nbegan to trot out scraps of French, just for all the world as they do\r\nin the novels; and kissed her hand to me quite graciously, telling me\r\nto come soon to caffy, UNG PU DE MUSICK O SALONG--with which she tripped\r\noff like an elderly fairy.\r\n\r\n\'Shall I open a bottle of port, or do you ever drink such a thing as\r\nHollands and water?\' says Ponto, looking ruefully at me. This was a very\r\ndifferent style of thing to what I had been led to expect from him at\r\nour smoking-room at the Club: where he swaggers about his horses and\r\nhis cellar: and slapping me on the shoulder used to say, \'Come down\r\nto Mangelwurzelshire, Snob my boy, and I\'ll give you as good a day\'s\r\nshooting and as good a glass of claret as any in the county.\'--\'Well,\'\r\nI said, \'I like Hollands much better than port, and gin even better than\r\nHollands.\' This was lucky. It WAS gin; and Stripes brought in hot water\r\non a splendid plated tray.\r\n\r\nThe jingling of a harp and piano soon announced that Mrs. Ponto\'s ung PU\r\nDE MUSICK had commenced, and the smell of the stable again entering\r\nthe dining-room, in the person of Stripes, summoned us to CAFFY and the\r\nlittle concert. She beckoned me with a winning smile to the sofa, on\r\nwhich she made room for me, and where we could command a fine view\r\nof the backs of the young ladies who were performing the musical\r\nentertainment. Very broad backs they were too, strictly according to\r\nthe present mode, for crinoline or its substitutes is not an expensive\r\nluxury, and young people in the country can afford to be in the fashion\r\nat very trifling charges. Miss Emily Ponto at the piano, and her sister\r\nMaria at that somewhat exploded instrument, the harp, were in light blue\r\ndresses that looked all flounce, and spread out like Mr. Green\'s balloon\r\nwhen inflated.\r\n\r\n\'Brilliant touch Emily has--what a fine arm Maria\'s is,\' Mrs. Ponto\r\nremarked good-naturedly, pointing out the merits of her daughters, and\r\nwaving her own arm in such a way as to show that she was not a little\r\nsatisfied with the beauty of that member. I observed she had about nine\r\nbracelets and bangles, consisting of chains and padlocks, the Major\'s\r\nminiature, and a variety of brass serpents with fiery ruby or tender\r\nturquoise eyes, writhing up to her elbow almost, in the most profuse\r\ncontortions.\r\n\r\n\'You recognize those polkas? They were played at Devonshire House on\r\nthe 23rd of July, the day of the grand f\xeate.\' So I said yes--I knew \'em\r\nquite intimately; and began wagging my head as if in acknowledgment of\r\nthose old friends.\r\n\r\nWhen the performance was concluded, I had the felicity of a presentation\r\nand conversation with the two tall and scraggy Miss Pontos; and Miss\r\nWirt, the governess, sat down to entertain us with variations on \'Sich a\r\ngettin\' up Stairs.\' They were determined to be in the fashion.\r\n\r\nFor the performance of the \'Gettin\' up Stairs,\' I have no other name but\r\nthat it was a STUNNER. First Miss Wirt, with great deliberation, played\r\nthe original and beautiful melody, cutting it, as it were, out of the\r\ninstrument, and firing off each note so loud, clear, and sharp, that I\r\nam sure Stripes must have heard it in the stable.\r\n\r\n\'What a finger!\' says Mrs. Ponto; and indeed it WAS a finger, as knotted\r\nas a turkey\'s drumstick, and splaying all over the piano. When she had\r\nbanged out the tune slowly, she began a different manner of \'Gettin\' up\r\nStairs,\' and did so with a fury and swiftness quite incredible. She spun\r\nup stairs; she whirled up stairs: she galloped up stairs; she rattled up\r\nstairs; and then having got the tune to the top landing, as it were, she\r\nhurled it down again shrieking to the bottom floor, where it sank in a\r\ncrash as if exhausted by the breathless rapidity of the descent. Then\r\nMiss Wirt played the \'Gettin\' up Stairs\' with the most pathetic and\r\nravishing solemnity: plaintive moans and sobs issued from the keys--you\r\nwept and trembled as you were gettin\' up stairs. Miss Wirt\'s hands\r\nseemed to faint and wail and die in variations: again, and she went up\r\nwith a savage clang and rush of trumpets, as if Miss Wirt was storming a\r\nbreach; and although I knew nothing of music, as I sat and listened\r\nwith my mouth open to this wonderful display, my CAFFY grew cold, and I\r\nwondered the windows did not crack and the chandelier start out of the\r\nbeam at the sound of this earthquake of a piece of music.\r\n\r\n\'Glorious creature! Isn\'t she?\' said Mrs. Ponto. \'Squirtz\'s favourite\r\npupil--inestimable to have such a creature. Lady Carabas would give her\r\neyes for her! A prodigy of accomplishments! Thank you, Miss Wirt\'--and\r\nthe young ladies gave a heave and a gasp of admiration--a deep-breathing\r\ngushing sound, such as you hear at church when the sermon comes to a\r\nfull stop.\r\n\r\nMiss Wirt put her two great double-knuckled hands round a waist of her\r\ntwo pupils, and said, \'My dear children, I hope you will be able to play\r\nit soon as well as your poor little governess. When I lived with the\r\nDunsinanes, it was the dear Duchess\'s favourite, and Lady Barbara and\r\nLady Jane McBeth learned it. It was while hearing Jane play that, I\r\nremember, that dear Lord Castletoddy first fell in love with her; and\r\nthough he is but an Irish Peer, with not more than fifteen thousand\r\na year, I persuaded Jane to have him. Do you know Castletoddy, Mr.\r\nSnob?--round towers--sweet place-County Mayo. Old Lord Castletoddy (the\r\npresent Lord was then Lord Inishowan) was a most eccentric old man--they\r\nsay he was mad. I heard his Royal Highness the poor dear Duke of\r\nSussex--(SUCH a man, my dears, but alas! addicted to smoking!)--I\r\nheard his Royal Highness say to the Marquis of Anglesey, "I am sure\r\nCastletoddy is mad!" but Inishowan wasn\'t in marrying my sweet Jane,\r\nthough the dear child had but her ten thousand pounds POUR TOUT POTAGE!\'\r\n\r\n\'Most invaluable person,\' whispered Mrs. Major Ponto to me. \'Has lived\r\nin the very highest society:\' and I, who have been accustomed to see\r\ngovernesses bullied in the world, was delighted to find this one ruling\r\nthe roast, and to think that even the majestic Mrs. Ponto bent before\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAs for my pipe, so to speak, it went out at once. I hadn\'t a word to say\r\nagainst a woman who was intimate with every Duchess in the Red Book. She\r\nwasn\'t the rosebud, but she had been near it. She had rubbed shoulders\r\nwith the great, and about these we talked all the evening incessantly,\r\nand about the fashions, and about the Court, until bed-time came.\r\n\r\n\'And are there Snobs in this Elysium?\' I exclaimed, jumping into the\r\nlavender-perfumed bed. Ponto\'s snoring boomed from the neighbouring\r\nbed-room in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI--ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\nSomething like a journal of the proceedings at the Evergreens may be\r\ninteresting to those foreign readers of PUNCH who want to know the\r\ncustoms of an English gentleman\'s family and household. There\'s plenty\r\nof time to keep the Journal. Piano-strumming begins at six o\'clock in\r\nthe morning; it lasts till breakfast, with but a minute\'s intermission,\r\nwhen the instrument changes hands, and Miss Emily practises in place of\r\nher sister Miss Maria.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the confounded instrument never stops when the young ladies are\r\nat their lessons, Miss Wirt hammers away at those stunning variations,\r\nand keeps her magnificent finger in exercise.\r\n\r\nI asked this great creature in what other branches of education she\r\ninstructed her pupils? \'The modern languages,\' says she modestly:\r\n\'French, German, Spanish, and Italian, Latin and the rudiments of Greek\r\nif desired. English of course; the practice of Elocution, Geography,\r\nand Astronomy, and the Use of the Globes, Algebra (but only as far as\r\nquadratic equations); for a poor ignorant female, you know, Mr. Snob,\r\ncannot be expected to know everything. Ancient and Modern History\r\nno young woman can be without; and of these I make my beloved pupils\r\nPERFECT MISTRESSES. Botany, Geology, and Mineralogy, I consider as\r\namusements. And with these I assure you we manage to pass the days at\r\nthe Evergreens not unpleasantly.\'\r\n\r\nOnly these, thought I--what an education! But I looked in one of Miss\r\nPonto\'s manuscript song-books and found five faults of French in four\r\nwords; and in a waggish mood asking Miss Wirt whether Dante Algiery was\r\nso called because he was born at Algiers, received a smiling answer in\r\nthe affirmative, which made me rather doubt about the accuracy of Miss\r\nWirt\'s knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen the above little morning occupations are concluded, these\r\nunfortunate young women perform what they call Calisthenic Exercises\r\nin the garden. I saw them to-day, without any crinoline, pulling the\r\ngarden-roller.\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Ponto was in the garden too, and as limp as her daughters; in\r\na faded bandeau of hair, in a battered bonnet, in a holland pinafore,\r\nin pattens, on a broken chair, snipping leaves off a vine. Mrs. Ponto\r\nmeasures many yards about in an evening. Ye heavens! what a guy she is\r\nin that skeleton morning-costume!\r\n\r\nBesides Stripes, they keep a boy called Thomas or Tummus. Tummus works\r\nin the garden or about the pigsty and stable; Thomas wears a page\'s\r\ncostume of eruptive buttons.\r\n\r\nWhen anybody calls, and Stripes is out of the way, Tummus flings\r\nhimself like mad into Thomas\'s clothes, and comes out metamorphosed\r\nlike Harlequin in the pantomime. To-day, as Mrs. P. was cutting the\r\ngrapevine, as the young ladies were at the roller, down comes Tummus\r\nlike a roaring whirlwind, with \'Missus, Missus, there\'s company\r\ncoomin\'!\' Away skurry the young ladies from the roller, down comes Mrs.\r\nP. from the old chair, off flies Tummus to change his clothes, and in\r\nan incredibly short space of time Sir John Hawbuck, my Lady Hawbuck,\r\nand Master Hugh Hawbuck are introduced into the garden with brazen\r\neffrontery by Thomas, who says, \'Please Sir Jan and my Lady to walk this\r\nyear way: I KNOW Missus is in the rose-garden.\'\r\n\r\nAnd there, sure enough, she was!\r\n\r\nIn a pretty little garden bonnet, with beautiful curling ringlets, with\r\nthe smartest of aprons and the freshest of pearl-coloured gloves, this\r\namazing woman was in the arms of her dearest Lady Hawbuck. \'Dearest Lady\r\nHawbuck, how good of you! Always among my flowers! can\'t live away from\r\nthem!\'\r\n\r\n\'Sweets to the sweet! hum--a-ha--haw!\' says Sir John Hawbuck, who piques\r\nhimself on his gallantry, and says nothing without \'a-hum--a-ha--a-haw!\'\r\n\r\n\'Whereth yaw pinnafaw?\' cries Master Hugh. \'WE thaw you in it, over the\r\nwall, didn\'t we, Pa?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hum--a-ha--a-haw!\' burst out Sir John, dreadfully alarmed. \'Where\'s\r\nPonto? Why wasn\'t he at Quarter Sessions? How are his birds this year,\r\nMrs. Ponto--have those Carabas pheasants done any harm to your wheat?\r\na-hum--a-ha--a-haw!\' and all this while he was making the most ferocious\r\nand desperate signals to his youthful heir.\r\n\r\n\'Well, she WATH in her pinnafaw, wathn\'t she, Ma?\' says Hugh, quite\r\nunabashed; which question Lady Hawbuck turned away with a sudden query\r\nregarding her dear darling daughters, and the ENFANT TERRIBLE was\r\nremoved by his father.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you weren\'t disturbed by the music?\' Ponto says. \'My girls,\r\nyou know, practise four hours a day, you know--must do it, you\r\nknow--absolutely necessary. As for me, you know I\'m an early man, and in\r\nmy farm every morning at five--no, no laziness for ME.\'\r\n\r\nThe facts are these. Ponto goes to sleep directly after dinner on\r\nentering the drawing-room, and wakes up when the ladies leave off\r\npractice at ten. From seven till ten, from ten till five, is a very fair\r\nallowance of slumber for a man who says he\'s NOT a lazy man. It is my\r\nprivate opinion that when Ponto retires to what is called his \'Study,\'\r\nhe sleeps too. He locks himself up there daily two hours with the\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nI saw the HAWBUCK scene out of the Study, which commands the garden.\r\nIt\'s a curious object, that Study. Ponto\'s library mostly consists of\r\nboots. He and Stripes have important interviews here of mornings,\r\nwhen the potatoes are discussed, or the fate of the calf ordained, or\r\nsentence passed on the pig, &c.. All the Major\'s bills are docketed on\r\nthe Study table and displayed like a lawyer\'s briefs. Here, too, lie\r\ndisplayed his hooks, knives, and other gardening irons, his whistles,\r\nand strings of spare buttons. He has a drawer of endless brown paper for\r\nparcels, and another containing a prodigious and never-failing supply of\r\nstring. What a man can want with so many gig-whips I can never conceive.\r\nThese, and fishing-rods, and landing-nets, and spurs, and boot-trees,\r\nand balls for horses, and surgical implements for the same, and\r\nfavourite pots of shiny blacking, with which he paints his own shoes\r\nin the most elegant manner, and buckskin gloves stretched out on their\r\ntrees, and his gorget, sash, and sabre of the Horse Marines, with his\r\nboot-hooks underneath in atrophy; and the family medicine-chest, and\r\nin a corner the very rod with which he used to whip his son, Wellesley\r\nPonto, when a boy (Wellesley never entered the \'Study\' but for that\r\nawful purpose)--all these, with \'Mogg\'s Road Book,\' the GARDENERS\'\r\nCHRONICLE, and a backgammon-board, form the Major\'s library. Under the\r\ntrophy there\'s a picture of Mrs. Ponto, in a light blue dress and train,\r\nand no waist, when she was first married; a fox\'s brush lies over the\r\nframe, and serves to keep the dust off that work of art.\r\n\r\n\'My library\'s small, says Ponto, with the most amazing impudence, \'but\r\nwell selected, my boy--well selected. I have been reading the "History\r\nof England" all the morning.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII--A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\nWe had the fish, which, as the kind reader may remember, I had brought\r\ndown in a delicate attention to Mrs. Ponto, to variegate the repast of\r\nnext day; and cod and oyster-sauce, twice laid, salt cod and scolloped\r\noysters, formed parts of the bill of fare until I began to fancy that\r\nthe Ponto family, like our late revered monarch George II., had a fancy\r\nfor stale fish. And about this time, the pig being consumed, we began\r\nupon a sheep.\r\n\r\nBut how shall I forget the solemn splendour of a second course, which\r\nwas served up in great state by Stripes in a silver dish and cove; a\r\nnapkin round his dirty thumbs; and consisted of a landrail, not much\r\nbigger than a corpulent sparrow.\r\n\r\n\'My love, will you take any game?\' says Ponto, with prodigious gravity;\r\nand stuck his fork into that little mouthful of an island in the\r\nsilver sea. Stripes, too, at intervals, dribbled out the Marsala with\r\na solemnity which would have done honour to a Duke\'s butler. The\r\nBamnecide\'s dinner to Shacabac was only one degree removed from these\r\nsolemn banquets.\r\n\r\nAs there were plenty of pretty country places close by; a comfortable\r\ncountry town, with good houses of gentlefolks; a beautiful old\r\nparsonage, close to the church whither we went (and where the Carabas\r\nfamily have their ancestral carved and monumented Gothic pew), and every\r\nappearance of good society in the neighbourhood, I rather wondered we\r\nwere not enlivened by the appearance of some of the neighbours at the\r\nEvergreens, and asked about them.\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t in our position of life--we can\'t well associate with\r\nthe attorney\'s family, as I leave you to suppose,\' says Mrs. Ponto,\r\nconfidentially. \'Of course not,\' I answered, though I didn\'t know why.\r\n\'And the Doctor?\' said I.\r\n\r\n\'A most excellent worthy creature,\' says Mrs. P. saved Maria\'s\r\nlife--really a learned man; but what can one do in one\'s position? One\r\nmay ask one\'s medical man to one\'s table certainly: but his family, my\r\ndear Mr. Snob!\'\r\n\r\n\'Half-a-dozen little gallipots,\' interposed Miss Wirt, the governess:\r\n\'he, he, he!\' and the young ladies laughed in chorus.\r\n\r\n\'We only live with the county families,\' Miss Wirt (1) continued,\r\ntossing up her head. \'The Duke is abroad: we are at feud with the\r\nCarabases; the Ringwoods don\'t come down till Christmas: in fact,\r\nnobody\'s here till the hunting season--positively nobody.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whose is the large red house just outside of the town?\'\r\n\r\n\'What! the CHATEAU-CALICOT? he, he, he! That purse-proud ex-linendraper,\r\nMr. Yardley, with the yellow liveries, and the wife in red velvet? How\r\nCAN you, my dear Mr. Snob, be so satirical? The impertinence of those\r\npeople is really something quite overwhelming.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, there is the parson, Doctor Chrysostom. He\'s a gentleman,\r\nat any rate.\' At this Mrs. Ponto looked at Miss Wirt. After their eyes\r\nhad met and they had wagged their heads at each other. They looked up\r\nto the ceiling. So did the young ladies. They thrilled. It was evident I\r\nhad said something terrible. Another black sheep in the Church? thought\r\nI with a little sorrow; for I don\'t care to own that I have a respect\r\nfor the cloth. \'I--hope there\'s nothing wrong?\r\n\r\n\'Wrong?\' says Mrs. P., clasping her hands with a tragic air.\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' says Miss Wirt, and the two girls, gasping in chorus.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' says I, \'I\'m very sorry for it. I never saw a nicer-looking old\r\ngentleman, or a better school, or heard a better sermon.\'\r\n\r\n\'He used to preach those sermons in a surplice,\' hissed out Mrs. Ponto.\r\n\'He\'s a Puseyite, Mr. Snob.\'\r\n\r\n\'Heavenly powers!\' says I, admiring the pure ardour of these female\r\ntheologians; and Stripes came in with the tea. It\'s so weak that no\r\nwonder Ponto\'s sleep isn\'t disturbed by it.\r\n\r\nOf mornings we used to go out shooting. We had Ponto\'s own fields to\r\nsport over (where we got the landrail), and the non-preserved part of\r\nthe Hawbuck property: and one evening in a stubble of Ponto\'s skirting\r\nthe Carabas woods, we got among some pheasants, and had some real sport.\r\nI shot a hen, I know, greatly to my delight. \'Bag it,\' says Ponto, in\r\nrather a hurried manner: \'here\'s somebody coming.\' So I pocketed the\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n\'You infernal poaching thieves!\' roars out a man from the hedge in the\r\ngarb of a gamekeeper. \'I wish I could catch you on this side of the\r\nhedge. I\'d put a brace of barrels into you, that I would.\'\r\n\r\n\'Curse that Snapper,\' says Ponto, moving off; \'he\'s always watching me\r\nlike a spy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Carry off the birds, you sneaks, and sell \'em in London,\' roars the\r\nindividual, who it appears was a keeper of Lord Carabas. \'You\'ll get six\r\nshillings a brace for \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'YOU know the price of \'em well enough, and so does your master too, you\r\nscoundrel,\' says Ponto, still retreating.\r\n\r\n\'We kill \'em on our ground,\' cries Mr. Snapper. \'WE don\'t set traps for\r\nother people\'s birds. We\'re no decoy ducks. We\'re no sneaking poachers.\r\nWe don\'t shoot \'ens, like that \'ere Cockney, who\'s got the tail of one\r\na-sticking out of his pocket. Only just come across the hedge, that\'s\r\nall.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you what,\' says Stripes, who was out with us as keeper this\r\nday, (in fact he\'s keeper, coachman, gardener, valet, and bailiff, with\r\nTummus under him,) \'if YOU\'LL come across, John Snapper, and take your\r\ncoat off, I\'ll give you such a whopping as you\'ve never had since the\r\nlast time I did it at Guttlebury Fair.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whop one of your own weight,\' Mr. Snapper said, whistling his dogs\r\nand disappearing into the wood. And so we came out of this controversy\r\nrather victoriously; but I began to alter my preconceived ideas of rural\r\nfelicity.\r\n\r\nNotes.\r\n\r\n(1) I have since heard that this aristocratic lady\'s father was a\r\nlivery-button maker in St. Martin\'s Lane: where he met with misfortunes,\r\nand his daughter acquired her taste for heraldry. But it may be told\r\nto her credit, that out of her earnings she has kept the bed-ridden old\r\nbankrupt in great comfort and secrecy at Pentonville; and furnished her\r\nbrother\'s outfit for the Cadetship which her patron, Lord Swigglebiggle,\r\ngave her when he was at the Board of Control. I have this information\r\nfrom a friend. To hear Miss Wirt herself, you would fancy that her Papa\r\nwas a Rothschild, and that the markets of Europe were convulsed when he\r\nwent into the GAZETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII--ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\n\'Be hanged to your aristocrats!\' Ponto said, in some conversation we had\r\nregarding the family at Carabas, between whom and the Evergreens there\r\nwas a feud. \'When I first came into the county--it was the year before\r\nSir John Buff contested in the Blue interest--the Marquis, then Lord St.\r\nMichaels, who, of course, was Orange to the core, paid me and Mrs. Ponto\r\nsuch attentions, that I fairly confess I was taken in by the old humbug,\r\nand thought that I\'d met with a rare neighbour. \'Gad, Sir, we used to\r\nget pines from Carabas, and pheasants from Carabas, and it was--"Ponto,\r\nwhen will you come over and shoot?"--and--"Ponto, our pheasants want\r\nthinning,"--and my Lady would insist upon her dear Mrs. Ponto coming\r\nover to Carabas to sleep, and put me I don\'t know to what expense for\r\nturbans and velvet gowns for my wife\'s toilette. Well, Sir, the election\r\ntakes place, and though I was always a Liberal, personal friendship of\r\ncourse induces me to plump for St. Michaels, who comes in at the head of\r\nthe poll. Next year, Mrs. P. insists upon going to town--with lodgings\r\nin Clarges Street at ten pounds a week, with a hired brougham, and new\r\ndresses for herself and the girls, and the deuce and all to pay. Our\r\nfirst cards were to Carabas House; my Lady\'s are returned by a great big\r\nflunkey; and I leave you to fancy my poor Betsy\'s discomfiture as the\r\nlodging-house maid took in the cards, and Lady St. Michaels drives away,\r\nthough she actually saw us at the drawing-room window. Would you believe\r\nit, Sir, that though we called four times afterwards, those infernal\r\naristocrats never returned our visit; that though Lady St. Michaels gave\r\nnine dinner-parties and four DEJEUNERS that season, she never asked us\r\nto one; and that she cut us dead at the Opera, though Betsy was nodding\r\nto her the whole night? We wrote to her for tickets for Almack\'s; she\r\nwrites to say that all hers were promised; and said, in the presence of\r\nWiggins, her lady\'s-maid, who told it to Diggs, my wife\'s woman, that\r\nshe couldn\'t conceive how people in our station of life could so far\r\nforget themselves as to wish to appear in any such place! Go to\r\nCastle Carabas! I\'d sooner die than set my foot in the house of that\r\nimpertinent, insolvent, insolent jackanapes--and I hold him in scorn!\'\r\nAfter this, Ponto gave me some private information regarding Lord\r\nCarabas\'s pecuniary affairs; how he owed money all over the county; how\r\nJukes the carpenter was utterly ruined and couldn\'t get a shilling of\r\nhis bill; how Biggs the butcher hanged himself for the same reason; how\r\nthe six big footmen never received a guinea of wages, and Snaffle, the\r\nstate coachman, actually took off his blown-glass wig of ceremony and\r\nflung it at Lady Carabas\'s feet on the terrace before the Castle; all\r\nwhich stories, as they are private, I do not think proper to divulge.\r\nBut these details did not stifle my desire to see the famous mansion\r\nof Castle Carabas, nay, possibly excited my interest to know more about\r\nthat lordly house and its owners.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the park, there are a pair of great gaunt mildewed\r\nlodges--mouldy Doric temples with black chimney-pots, in the finest\r\nclassic taste, and the gates of course are surmounted by the CHATS\r\nBOTTES, the well-known supporters of the Carabas family. \'Give the\r\nlodge-keeper a shilling,\' says Ponto, (who drove me near to it in his\r\nfour-wheeled cruelty-chaise). \'I warrant it\'s the first piece of ready\r\nmoney he has received for some time. I don\'t know whether there was any\r\nfoundation for this sneer, but the gratuity was received with a curtsey,\r\nand the gate opened for me to enter. \'Poor old porteress!\' says I,\r\ninwardly. \'You little know that it is the Historian of Snobs whom you\r\nlet in!\' The gates were passed. A damp green stretch of park spread\r\nright and left immeasurably, confined by a chilly grey wall, and a damp\r\nlong straight road between two huge rows of moist, dismal lime-trees,\r\nleads up to the Castle. In the midst of the park is a great black tank\r\nor lake, bristling over with rushes, and here and there covered over\r\nwith patches of pea-soup. A shabby temple rises on an island in this\r\ndelectable lake, which is approached by a rotten barge that lies at\r\nroost in a dilapidated boat house. Clumps of elms and oaks dot over the\r\nhuge green flat. Every one of them would have been down long since, but\r\nthat the Marquis is not allowed to cut the timber.\r\n\r\nUp that long avenue the Snobographer walked in solitude. At the\r\nseventy-ninth tree on the left-hand side, the insolvent butcher hanged\r\nhimself. I scarcely wondered at the dismal deed, so woful and sad were\r\nthe impressions connected with the place. So, for a mile and a half I\r\nwalked--alone and thinking of death.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say the house is in full view all the way--except when\r\nintercepted by the trees on the miserable island in the lake--an\r\nenormous red-brick mansion, square, vast, and dingy. It is flanked by\r\nfour stone towers with weathercocks. In the midst of the grand facade is\r\na huge Ionic portico, approached by a vast, lonely, ghastly staircase.\r\nRows of black windows, framed in stone, stretch on either side, right\r\nand left--three storeys and eighteen windows of a row. You may see\r\na picture of the palace and staircase, in the \'Views of England and\r\nWales,\' with four carved and gilt carriages waiting at the gravel walk,\r\nand several parties of ladies and gentlemen in wigs and hoops, dotting\r\nthe fatiguing lines of stairs.\r\n\r\nBut these stairs are made in great houses for people NOT to ascend. The\r\nfirst Lady Carabas (they are but eighty years in the peerage), if she\r\ngot out of her gilt coach in a shower, would be wet to the skin before\r\nshe got half-way to the carved Ionic portico, where four dreary statues\r\nof Peace, Plenty, Piety and Patriotism, are the only sentinels. You\r\nenter these palaces by back-doors. \'That was the way the Carabases got\r\ntheir peerage,\' the misanthropic Ponto said after dinner.\r\n\r\nWell--I rang the bell at a little low side-door; it clanged and jingled\r\nand echoed for a long, long while, till at length a face, as of a\r\nhousekeeper, peered through the door, and, as she saw my hand in my\r\nwaistcoat pocket, opened it. Unhappy, lonely housekeeper, I thought. Is\r\nMiss Crusoe in her island more solitary? The door clapped to, and I was\r\nin Castle Carabas.\r\n\r\n\'The side entrance and All,\' says the housekeeper. \'The halligator\r\nhover the mantelpiece was brought home by Hadmiral St. Michaels, when\r\na Capting with Lord Hanson. The harms on the cheers is the harms of the\r\nCarabas family.\' The hall was rather comfortable. We went clapping up a\r\nclean stone backstair, and then into a back passage cheerfully decorated\r\nwith ragged light-green Kidderminster, and issued upon\r\n\r\n\'THE GREAT ALL.\r\n\r\n\'The great all is seventy-two feet in lenth, fifty-six in breath, and\r\nthirty-eight feet \'igh. The carvings of the chimlies, representing the\r\nbirth of Venus, and Ercules, and Eyelash, is by Van Chislum, the most\r\nfamous sculpture of his hage and country. The ceiling, by Calimanco,\r\nrepresents Painting, Harchitecture and Music (the naked female figure\r\nwith the barrel horgan) introducing George, fust Lord Carabas, to the\r\nTemple of the Muses. The winder ornaments is by Vanderputty. The floor\r\nis Patagonian marble; and the chandelier in the centre was presented to\r\nLionel, second Marquis, by Lewy the Sixteenth, whose \'ead was cut hoff\r\nin the French Revelation. We now henter\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH GALLERY.\r\n\r\n\'One \'undred and forty-eight in lenth by thirty-two in breath; it is\r\nprofusely hornaminted by the choicest works of Hart. Sir Andrew Katz,\r\nfounder of the Carabas family and banker of the Prince of Horange,\r\nKneller. Her present Ladyship, by Lawrence. Lord St. Michaels, by the\r\nsame--he is represented sittin\' on a rock in velvit pantaloons. Moses in\r\nthe bullrushes--the bull very fine, by Paul Potter. The toilet of Venus,\r\nFantaski. Flemish Bores drinking, Van Ginnums. Jupiter and Europia, de\r\nHorn. The Grandjunction Canal, Venis, by Candleetty; and Italian Bandix,\r\nby Slavata Rosa.\'--And so this worthy woman went on, from one room into\r\nanother, from the blue room to the green, and the green to the grand\r\nsaloon, and the grand saloon to the tapestry closet, cackling her list\r\nof pictures and wonders: and furtively turning up a corner of brown\r\nholland to show the colour of the old, faded, seedy, mouldy, dismal\r\nhangings.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to her Ladyship\'s bed-room. In the centre of this dreary\r\napartment there is a bed about the size of one of those whizgig temples\r\nin which the Genius appears in a pantomime. The huge gilt edifice is\r\napproached by steps, and so tall, that it might be let off in floors,\r\nfor sleeping-rooms for all the Carabas family. An awful bed! A murder\r\nmight be done at one end of that bed, and people sleeping at the other\r\nend be ignorant of it. Gracious powers! fancy little Lord Carabas in a\r\nnightcap ascending those steps after putting out the candle!\r\n\r\nThe sight of that seedy and solitary splendour was too much for me.\r\nI should go mad were I that lonely housekeeper--in those enormous\r\ngalleries--in that lonely library, filled up with ghastly folios that\r\nnobody dares read, with an inkstand on the centre table like the coffin\r\nof a baby, and sad portraits staring at you from the bleak walls with\r\ntheir solemn Mouldy eyes. No wonder that Carabas does not come down here\r\noften.\r\n\r\nIt would require two thousand footmen to make the place cheerful. No\r\nwonder the coachman resigned his wig, that the masters are insolvent,\r\nand the servants perish in this huge dreary out-at-elbow place.\r\n\r\nA single family has no more right to build itself a temple of that sort\r\nthan to erect a Tower of Babel. Such a habitation is not decent for a\r\nmere mortal man. But, after all, I suppose poor Carabas had no choice.\r\nFate put him there as it sent Napoleon to St. Helena. Suppose it had\r\nbeen decreed by Nature that you and I should be Marquises? We wouldn\'t\r\nrefuse, I suppose, but take Castle Carabas and all, with debts, duns,\r\nand mean makeshifts, and shabby pride, and swindling magnificence.\r\n\r\nNext season, when I read of Lady Carabas\'s splendid entertainments in\r\nthe MORNING POST, and see the poor old insolvent cantering through the\r\nPark--I shall have a much tenderer interest in these great people than\r\nI have had heretofore. Poor old shabby Snob! Ride on and fancy the world\r\nis still on its knees before the house of Carabas! Give yourself airs,\r\npoor old bankrupt Magnifico, who are under money-obligations to your\r\nflunkeys; and must stoop so as to swindle poor tradesmen! And for us, O\r\nmy brother Snobs, oughtn\'t we to feel happy if our walk through life is\r\nmore even, and that we are out of the reach of that surprising arrogance\r\nand that astounding meanness to which this wretched old victim is\r\nobliged to mount and descend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX--A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\nNotable as my reception had been (under that unfortunate mistake of Mrs.\r\nPonto that I was related to Lord Snobbington, which I was not permitted\r\nto correct), it was nothing compared to the bowing and kotooing, the\r\nraptures and flurry which preceded and welcomed the visit of a real live\r\nlord and lord\'s son, a brother officer of Cornet Wellesley Ponto, in\r\nthe 120th Hussars, who came over with the young Cornet from Guttlebury,\r\nwhere their distinguished regiment was quartered. This was my\r\nLord Gules, Lord Saltire\'s grandson and heir: a very young, short,\r\nsandy-haired and tobacco-smoking nobleman, who cannot have left the\r\nnursery very long, and who, though he accepted the honest Major\'s\r\ninvitation to the Evergreens in a letter written in a school-boy\r\nhandwriting, with a number of faults of spelling, may yet be a very fine\r\nclassical scholar for what I know: having had his education at Eton,\r\nwhere he and young Ponto were inseparable.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, if he can\'t write, he has mastered a number of other\r\naccomplishments wonderful for one of his age and size. He is one of the\r\nbest shots and riders in England. He rode his horse Abracadabra, and won\r\nthe famous Guttlebury steeple-chase. He has horses entered at half the\r\nraces in the country (under other people\'s names; for the old lord is a\r\nstrict hand, and will not hear of betting or gambling). He has lost and\r\nwon such sums of money as my Lord George himself might be proud of.\r\nHe knows all the stables, and all the jockeys, and has all the\r\n\'information,\' and is a match for the best Leg at Newmarket. Nobody was\r\never known to be \'too much\' for him at play or in the stable.\r\n\r\nAlthough his grandfather makes him a moderate allowance, by the aid of\r\nPOST-OBITS and convenient friends he can live in a splendour becoming\r\nhis rank. He has not distinguished himself in the knocking down of\r\npolicemen much; he is not big enough for that. But, as a light-weight,\r\nhis skill is of the very highest order. At billiards he is said to\r\nbe first-rate. He drinks and smokes as much as any two of the biggest\r\nofficers in his regiment. With such high talents, who can say how far\r\nhe may not go? He may take to politics as a DELASSEMENT, and be Prime\r\nMinister after Lord George Bentinck.\r\n\r\nMy young friend Wellesley Ponto is a gaunt and bony youth, with a pale\r\nface profusely blotched. From his continually pulling something on\r\nhis chin, I am led to fancy that he believes he has what is called an\r\nImperial growing there. That is not the only tuft that is hunted in\r\nthe family, by the way. He can\'t, of course, indulge in those expensive\r\namusements which render his aristocratic comrade so respected: he bets\r\npretty freely when he is in cash, and rides when somebody mounts him\r\n(for he can\'t afford more than his regulation chargers). At drinking\r\nhe is by no means inferior; and why do you think he brought his noble\r\nfriend, Lord Gules, to the Evergreens?--Why? because he intended to\r\nask his mother to order his father to pay his debts, which she couldn\'t\r\nrefuse before such an exalted presence. Young Ponto gave me all this\r\ninformation with the most engaging frankness. We are old friends. I used\r\nto tip him when he was at school.\r\n\r\n\'Gad!\': says he, \'our wedgment\'s so DOOTHID exthpenthif. Must hunt, you\r\nknow. A man couldn\'t live in the wedgment if he didn\'t. Mess expenses\r\nenawmuth. Must dine at mess. Must drink champagne and claret. Ours ain\'t\r\na port and sherry light-infantry mess. Uniform\'s awful. Fitzstultz, our\r\nColonel, will have \'em so. Must be a distinction you know. At his own\r\nexpense Fitzstultz altered the plumes in the men\'s caps (you called them\r\nshaving-brushes, Snob, my boy: most absurd and unjust that attack of\r\nyours, by the way); that altewation alone cotht him five hundred pound.\r\nThe year befaw latht he horthed the wegiment at an immenthe expenthe,\r\nand we\'re called the Queen\'th Own Pyebalds from that day. Ever theen uth\r\non pawade? The Empewar Nicolath burtht into tearth of envy when he thaw\r\nuth at Windthor. And you see,\' continued my young friend, \'I brought\r\nGules down with me, as the Governor is very sulky about shelling out,\r\njust to talk my mother over, who can do anything with him. Gules told\r\nher that I was Fitzstultz\'s favourite of the whole regiment; and, Gad!\r\nshe thinks the Horse Guards will give me my troop for nothing, and he\r\nhumbugged the Governor that I was the greatest screw in the army. Ain\'t\r\nit a good dodge?\'\r\n\r\nWith this Wellesley left me to go and smoke a cigar in the stables\r\nwith Lord Gules, and make merry over the cattle there, under Stripes\'s\r\nsuperintendence. Young Ponto laughed with his friend, at the venerable\r\nfour-wheeled cruelty-chaise; but seemed amazed that the latter should\r\nridicule still more an ancient chariot of the build of 1824, emblazoned\r\nimmensely with the arme of the Pontos and the Snaileys, from which\r\nlatter distinguished family Mrs. Ponto issued.\r\n\r\nI found poor Pon in his study among his boots, in such a rueful attitude\r\nof despondency, that I could not but remark it. \'Look at that!\' says\r\nthe poor fellow, handing me over a document. \'It\'s the second change\r\nin uniform since he\'s been in the army, and yet there\'s no extravagance\r\nabout the lad.

"What a blessing that boy is to me!"\r\nsaid she, as my pimple-faced young friend moved off to resume smoking\r\noperations with Gules in the now vacant kitchen;--and poor Ponto\'s\r\ndreary and desperate look, shall I ever forget that?\r\n\r\nO you parents and guardians! O you men and women of sense in England! O\r\nyou legislators about to assemble in Parliament! read over that tailor\'s\r\nbill above printed, read over that absurd catalogue of insane gimcracks\r\nand madman\'s tomfoolery--and say how are you ever to get rid of\r\nSnobbishness when society does so much for its education?\r\n\r\nThree hundred and forty pounds for a young chap\'s saddle and breeches!\r\nBefore George, I would rather be a Hottentot or a Highlander. We laugh\r\nat poor Jocko, the monkey, dancing in uniform; or at poor Jeames, the\r\nflunkey, with his quivering calves and plush tights; or at the nigger\r\nMarquis of Marmalade, dressed out with sabre and epaulets, and giving\r\nhimself the airs of a field-marshal. Lo! is not one of the Queen\'s\r\nPyebalds, in full fig, as great and foolish a monster?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX--ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\nAt last came that fortunate day at the Evergreens, when I was to be made\r\nacquainted with some of the \'county families\' with whom only people of\r\nPonto\'s rank condescended to associate. And now, although poor Ponto had\r\njust been so cruelly made to bleed on occasion of his son\'s new uniform,\r\nand though he was in the direst and most cut-throat spirits with an\r\noverdrawn account at the banker\'s, and other pressing evils of poverty;\r\nalthough a tenpenny bottle of Marsala and an awful parsimony presided\r\ngenerally at his table, yet the poor fellow was obliged to assume\r\nthe most frank and jovial air of cordiality; and all the covers being\r\nremoved from the hangings, and new dresses being procured for the young\r\nladies, and the family plate being unlocked and displayed, the house\r\nand all within assumed a benevolent and festive appearance. The\r\nkitchen fires began to blaze, the good wine ascended from the cellar,\r\na professed cook actually came over from Guttlebury to compile culinary\r\nabominations. Stripes was in a new coat, and so was Ponto, for a wonder,\r\nand Tummus\'s button-suit was worn EN PERMANENCE.\r\n\r\nAnd all this to show off the little lord, thinks I. All this in honour\r\nof a stupid little cigarrified Cornet of dragoons, who can barely write\r\nhis name,--while an eminent and profound moralist like--somebody--is\r\nfobbed off with cold mutton and relays of pig. Well, well: a martyrdom\r\nof cold mutton is just bearable. I pardon Mrs. Ponto, from my heart I\r\ndo, especially as I wouldn\'t turn out of the best bed-room, in spite of\r\nall her hints; but held my ground in the chintz tester, vowing that Lord\r\nGules, as a young man, was quite small and hardy enough to make himself\r\ncomfortable elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe great Ponto party was a very august one. The Hawbucks came in their\r\nfamily coach, with the blood-red band emblazoned all over it: and their\r\nman in yellow livery waited in country fashion at table, only to be\r\nexceeded in splendour by the Hipsleys, the opposition baronet, in light\r\nblue. The old Ladies Fitzague drove over in their little old chariot\r\nwith the fat black horses, the fat coachman, the fat footman--(why\r\nare dowagers\' horses and footmen always fat?) And soon after these\r\npersonages had arrived, with their auburn fronts and red beaks and\r\nturbans, came the Honourable and Reverend Lionel Pettipois, who with\r\nGeneral and Mrs. Sago formed the rest of the party. \'Lord and Lady\r\nFrederick Howlet were asked, but they have friends at Ivybush,\' Mrs.\r\nPonto told me; and that very morning, the Castlehaggards sent an excuse,\r\nas her ladyship had a return of the quinsy. Between ourselves, Lady\r\nCastlehaggard\'s quinsy always comes on when there is dinner at the\r\nEvergreens.\r\n\r\nIf the keeping of polite company could make a woman happy, surely my\r\nkind hostess Mrs. Ponto was on that day a happy woman. Every person\r\npresent (except the unlucky impostor who pretended to a connexion with\r\nthe Snobbington Family, and General Sago, who had brought home I don\'t\r\nknow how many lacs of rupees from India,) was related to the Peerage\r\nor the Baronetage. Mrs. P. had her heart\'s desire. If she had been an\r\nEarl\'s daughter herself could she have expected better company?--and her\r\nfamily were in the oil-trade at Bristol, as all her friends very well\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nWhat I complained of in my heart was not the dining--which, for this\r\nonce, was plentiful and comfortable enough--but the prodigious dulness\r\nof the talking part of the entertainment. O my beloved brother Snobs of\r\nthe City, if we love each other no better than our country brethren, at\r\nleast we amuse each other more; if we bore ourselves, we are not called\r\nupon to go ten miles to do it!\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Hipsleys came ten miles from the south, and the\r\nHawbucks ten miles from the north, of the Evergreens; and were magnates\r\nin two different divisions of the county of Mangelwurzelshire. Hipsley,\r\nwho is an old baronet, with a bothered estate, did not care to show his\r\ncontempt for Hawbuck, who is a new creation, and rich. Hawbuck, on his\r\npart, gives himself patronizing airs to General Sago, who looks upon the\r\nPontos as little better than paupers. \'Old Lady Blanche,\' says Ponto, \'I\r\nhope will leave something to her god-daughter--my second girl--we\'ve all\r\nof us half-poisoned ourselves with taking her physic.\'\r\n\r\nLady Blanche and Lady Rose Fitzague have, the first, a medical, and the\r\nsecond a literary turn. I am inclined to believe the former had a wet\r\nCOMPRESSE around her body, on the occasion when I had the happiness of\r\nmeeting her. She doctors everybody in the neighbourhood of which she is\r\nthe ornament; and has tried everything on her own person. She went into\r\nCourt, and testified publicly her faith in St. John Long: she swore by\r\nDoctor Buchan, she took quantities of Gambouge\'s Universal Medicine,\r\nand whole boxfuls of Parr\'s Life Pills. She has cured a multiplicity of\r\nheadaches by Squinstone\'s Eye-snuff; she wears a picture of Hahnemann\r\nin her bracelet and a lock of Priessnitz\'s hair in a brooch. She talked\r\nabout her own complaints and those of her CONFIDANTE for the time being,\r\nto every lady in the room successively, from our hostess down to\r\nMiss Wirt, taking them into corners, and whispering about bronchitis,\r\nhepatitis, St. Vitus, neuralgia, cephalalgia, and so forth. I observed\r\npoor fat Lady Hawbuck in a dreadful alarm after some communication\r\nregarding the state of her daughter Miss Lucy Hawbuck\'s health, and Mrs.\r\nSago turned quite yellow, and put down her third glass of Madeira, at a\r\nwarning glance from Lady Blanche.\r\n\r\nLady Rose talked literature, and about the book-club at Guttlebury, and\r\nis very strong in voyages and travels. She has a prodigious interest\r\nin Borneo, and displayed a knowledge of the history of the Punjaub and\r\nKaffirland that does credit to her memory. Old General Sago, who sat\r\nperfectly silent and plethoric, roused up as from a lethargy when the\r\nformer country was mentioned, and gave the company his story about a\r\nhog-hunt at Ramjugger. I observed her ladyship treated with something\r\nlike contempt her neighbour the Reverend Lionel Pettipois, a young\r\ndivine whom you may track through the country by little \'awakening\'\r\nbooks at half-a-crown a hundred, which dribble out of his pockets\r\nwherever he goes. I saw him give Miss Wirt a sheaf of \'The Little\r\nWasher-woman on Putney Common,\' and to Miss Hawbuck a couple of dozen\r\nof \'Meat in the Tray; or the Young Butcher-boy Rescued;\' and on paying\r\na visit to Guttlebury gaol, I saw two notorious fellows waiting their\r\ntrial there (and temporarily occupied with a game of cribbage), to whom\r\nhis Reverence offered a tract as he was walking over Crackshins Common,\r\nand who robbed him of his purse, umbrella, and cambric handkerchief,\r\nleaving him the tracts to distribute elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI--A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS\r\n\r\n\'Why, dear Mr. Snob,\' said a young lady of rank and fashion (to whom I\r\npresent my best compliments), \'if you found everything so SNOBBISH at\r\nthe Evergreens, if the pig bored you and the mutton was not to your\r\nliking, and Mrs. Ponto was a humbug, and Miss Wirt a nuisance, with her\r\nabominable piano practice,--why did you stay so long?\'\r\n\r\nAh, Miss, what a question! Have you never heard of gallant British\r\nsoldiers storming batteries, of doctors passing nights in plague wards\r\nof lazarettos, and other instances of martyrdom? What do you suppose\r\ninduced gentlemen to walk two miles up to the batteries of Sabroan, with\r\na hundred and fifty thundering guns bowling them down by hundreds?--not\r\npleasure, surely. What causes your respected father to quit his\r\ncomfortable home for his chambers, after dinner, and pore over the most\r\ndreary law papers until long past midnight?, Mademoiselle; duty, which\r\nmust be done alike by military, or legal, or literary gents. There\'s a\r\npower of martyrdom in our profession.\r\n\r\nYou won\'t believe it? Your rosy lips assume a smile of incredulity--a\r\nmost naughty and odious expression in a young lady\'s face. Well, then,\r\nthe fact is, that my chambers, No. 24, Pump Court, Temple, were being\r\npainted by the Honourable Society, and Mrs. Slamkin, my laundress,\r\nhaving occasion to go into Durham to see her daughter, who is married,\r\nand has presented her with the sweetest little grandson--a few weeks\r\ncould not be better spent than in rusticating. But ah, how delightful\r\nPump Court looked when I revisited its well-known chimney-pots! CARI\r\nLUOGHI. Welcome, welcome, O fog and smut!\r\n\r\nBut if you think there is no moral in the foregoing account of the\r\nPontine family, you are, Madam, most painfully mistaken. In this very\r\nchapter we are going to have the moral--why, the whole of the papers\r\nare nothing BUT the moral, setting forth as they do the folly of being a\r\nSnob.\r\n\r\nYou will remark that in the Country Snobography my poor friend Ponto has\r\nbeen held up almost exclusively for the public gaze--and why? Because\r\nwe went to no other house? Because other families did not welcome us to\r\ntheir mahogany? No, no. Sir John Hawbuck of the Haws, Sir John Hipsley\r\nof Briary Hall, don\'t shut the gates of hospitality: of General Sago\'s\r\nmulligatawny I could speak from experience. And the two old ladies at\r\nGuttlebury, were they nothing? Do you suppose that an agreeable young\r\ndog, who shall be nameless, would not be made welcome? Don\'t you know\r\nthat people are too glad to see ANYBODY in the country?\r\n\r\nBut those dignified personages do not enter into the scheme of the\r\npresent work, and are but minor characters of our Snob drama; just as,\r\nin the play, kings and emperors are not half so important as many humble\r\npersons. The DOGE OF VENICE, for instance, gives way to OTHELLO, who is\r\nbut a nigger; and the KING OF FRANCE to FALCONBRIDGE, who is a gentleman\r\nof positively no birth at all. So with the exalted characters above\r\nmentioned. I perfectly well recollect that the claret at Hawbuck\'s was\r\nnot by any means so good as that of Hipsley\'s, while, on the contrary,\r\nsome white hermitage at the Haws (by the way, the butler only gave\r\nme half a glass each time) was supernacular. And I remember the\r\nconversations. O Madam, Madam, how stupid they were! The subsoil\r\nploughing; the pheasants and poaching; the row about the representation\r\nof the county; the Earl of Mangelwurzelshire being at variance with his\r\nrelative and nominee, the Honourable Marmaduke Tomnoddy; all these I\r\ncould put down, had I a mind to violate the confidence of private\r\nlife; and a great deal of conversation about the weather, the\r\nMangelwurzelshire Hunt, new manures, and eating and drinking, of course.\r\n\r\nBut CUI BONO? In these perfectly stupid and honourable families there\r\nis not that Snobbishness which it is our purpose to expose. An ox is an\r\nox--a great hulking, fat-sided, bellowing, munching Beef. He ruminates\r\naccording to his nature, and consumes his destined portion of turnips or\r\noilcake, until the time comes for his disappearance from the pastures,\r\nto be succeeded by other deep-lunged and fat-ribbed animals. Perhaps\r\nwe do not respect an ox. We rather acquiesce in him. The Snob, my dear\r\nMadam, is the Frog that tries to swell himself to ox size. Let us pelt\r\nthe silly brute out of his folly.\r\n\r\nLook, I pray you, at the case of my unfortunate friend Ponto, a\r\ngood-natured, kindly English gentleman--not over-wise, but quite\r\npassable--fond of port-wine, of his family, of country sports and\r\nagriculture, hospitably minded, with as pretty a little patrimonial\r\ncountry-house as heart can desire, and a thousand pounds a year. It\r\nis not much; but, ENTRE NOUS, people can live for less, and not\r\nuncomfortably.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there is the doctor, whom Mrs. P. does not condescend to\r\nvisit: that man educates a mirific family, and is loved by the poor for\r\nmiles round: and gives them port-wine for physic and medicine, gratis.\r\nAnd how those people can get on with their pittance, as Mrs. Ponto says,\r\nis a wonder to HER.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is the clergyman, Doctor Chrysostom,--Mrs. P. says they\r\nquarrelled about Puseyism, but I am given to understand it was because\r\nMrs. C. had the PAS of her at the Haws--you may see what the value of\r\nhis living is any day in the \'Clerical Guide;\' but you don\'t know what\r\nhe gives away.\r\n\r\nEven Pettipois allows that, in whose eyes the Doctor\'s surplice is a\r\nscarlet abomination; and so does Pettipois do his duty in his way, and\r\nadminister not only his tracts and his talk, but his money and his means\r\nto his people. As a lord\'s son, by the way, Mrs. Ponto is uncommonly\r\nanxious that he should marry EITHER of the girls whom Lord Gules does\r\nnot intend to choose.\r\n\r\nWell, although Pon\'s income would make up almost as much as that of\r\nthese three worthies put together--oh, my dear Madam, see in what\r\nhopeless penury the poor fellow lives! What tenant can look to HIS\r\nforbearance? What poor man can hope for HIS charity? \'Master\'s the best\r\nof men,\' honest Stripes says, \'and when we was in the ridgment a more\r\nfree-handed chap didn\'t live. But the way in which Missus DU scryou, I\r\nwonder the young ladies is alive, that I du!\'\r\n\r\nThey live upon a fine governess and fine masters, and have clothes made\r\nby Lady Carabas\'s own milliner; and their brother rides with earls to\r\ncover; and only the best people in the county visit at the Evergreens,\r\nand Mrs. Ponto thinks herself a paragon of wives and mothers, and\r\na wonder of the world, for doing all this misery and humbug, and\r\nsnobbishness, on a thousand a year.\r\n\r\nWhat an inexpressible comfort it was, my dear Madam, when Stripes put\r\nmy portmanteau in the four-wheeled chaise, and (poor P on being touched\r\nwith sciatica) drove me over to \'Carabas Arms\' at Guttlebury, where we\r\ntook leave. There were some bagmen there in the Commercial Room, and one\r\ntalked about the house he represented; and another about his dinner, and\r\na third about the Inns on the road, and so forth--a talk, not very wise,\r\nbut honest and to the purpose--about as good as that of the country\r\ngentlemen: and oh, how much pleasanter than listening to Miss Wirt\'s\r\nshow-pieces on the piano, and Mrs. Ponto\'s genteel cackle about the\r\nfashion and the county families!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII--SNOBBIUM GATHERUM\r\n\r\nWHEN I see the great effect which these papers are producing on an\r\nintelligent public, I have a strong hope that before long we shall have\r\na regular Snob department in the newspapers, just as we have the\r\nPolice Courts and the Court News at present. When a flagrant case of\r\nbone-crushing or Poor-law abuse occurs in the world, who so eloquent\r\nas THE TIMES to point it out? When a gross instance of Snobbishness\r\nhappens, why should not the indignant journalist call the public\r\nattention to that delinquency too?\r\n\r\nHow, for instance, could that wonderful case of the Earl of Mangelwurzel\r\nand his brother be examined in the Snobbish point of view? Let alone\r\nthe hectoring, the bullying, the vapouring, the bad grammar, the mutual\r\nrecriminations, lie-givings, challenges, retractations, which abound\r\nin the fraternal dispute--put out of the question these points as\r\nconcerning the individual nobleman and his relative, with whose personal\r\naffairs we have nothing to do--and consider how intimately corrupt, how\r\nhabitually grovelling and mean, how entirely Snobbish in a word, a whole\r\ncounty must be which can find no better chiefs or leaders than these two\r\ngentlemen. \'We don\'t want,\' the great county of Mangelwurzelshire seems\r\nto say, \'that a man should be able to write good grammar; or that he\r\nshould keep a Christian tongue in his head; or that he should have the\r\ncommonest decency of temper, or even a fair share of good sense, in\r\norder to represent us in Parliament.\r\n\r\nAll we require is, that a man should be recommended to us by the Earl\r\nof Mangelwurzelshire. And all that we require of the Earl of\r\nMangelwurzelshire is that he should have fifty thousand a year and hunt\r\nthe country.\' O you pride of all Snobland! O you crawling, truckling,\r\nself-confessed lackeys and parasites!\r\n\r\nBut this is growing too savage: don\'t let us forget our usual amenity,\r\nand that tone of playfulness and sentiment with which the beloved\r\nreader and writer have pursued their mutual reflections hitherto. Well,\r\nSnobbishness pervades the little Social Farce as well as the great State\r\nComedy; and the self-same moral is tacked to either.\r\n\r\nThere was, for instance, an account in the papers of a young lady who,\r\nmisled by a fortune-teller, actually went part of the way to India (as\r\nfar as Bagnigge Wells, I think,) in search of a husband who was promised\r\nher there. Do you suppose this poor deluded little soul would have left\r\nher shop for a man below her in rank, or for anything but a darling of\r\na Captain in epaulets and a red coat. It was her Snobbish sentiment\r\nthat misled her, and made her vanities a prey to the swindling\r\nfortune-teller.\r\n\r\nCase 2 was that of Mademoiselle de Saugrenue, \'the interesting young\r\nFrenchwoman with a profusion of jetty ringlets,\' who lived for nothing\r\nat a boardinghouse at Gosport, was then conveyed to Fareham gratis: and\r\nbeing there, and lying on the bed of the good old lady her entertainer,\r\nthe dear girl took occasion to rip open the mattress, and steal a\r\ncash-box, with which she fled to London. How would you account for the\r\nprodigious benevolence exercised towards the interesting young French\r\nlady? Was it her jetty ringlets or her charming face?--Bah! Do ladies\r\nlove others for having faces and black hair?--she said SHE WAS A\r\nRELATION OF de Saugrenue: talked of her ladyship her aunt, and of\r\nherself as a De Saugrenue. The honest boarding-house people were at her\r\nfeet at once. Good, honest, simple, lord-loving children of Snobland.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was the case of \'the Right Honourable Mr. Vernon,\' at\r\nYork. The Right Honourable was the son of a nobleman, and practised\r\non an old lady. He procured from her dinners, money, wearing-apparel,\r\nspoons, implicit credence, and an entire refit of linen. Then he cast\r\nhis nets over a family of father, mother, and daughters, one of whom he\r\nproposed to marry. The father lent him money, the mother made jams and\r\npickles for him, the daughters vied with each other in cooking dinners\r\nfor the Right Honourable--and what was the end? One day the traitor\r\nfled, with a teapot and a basketful of cold victuals. It was the \'Right\r\nHonourable\' which baited the hook which gorged all these greedy, simple\r\nSnobs. Would they have been taken in by a commoner? What old lady is\r\nthere, my dear sir, who would take in you and me, were we ever so ill to\r\ndo, and comfort us, and clothe us, and give us her money, and her silver\r\nforks? Alas and alas! what mortal man that speaks the truth can hope\r\nfor such a landlady? And yet, all these instances of fond and credulous\r\nSnobbishness have occurred in the same week\'s paper, with who knows how\r\nmany score more?\r\n\r\nJust as we had concluded the above remarks comes a pretty little note\r\nsealed with a pretty little butterfly--bearing a northern postmark--and\r\nto the following effect:--\r\n\r\n\'19th November.\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Punch,--\'Taking great interest in your Snob Papers, we are very\r\nanxious to know under what class of that respectable fraternity you\r\nwould designate us.\r\n\r\n\'We are three sisters, from seventeen to twenty-two. Our father is\r\nHONESTLY AND TRULY of a very good family (you will say it is Snobbish\r\nto mention that, but I wish to state the plain fact); our maternal\r\ngrandfather was an Earl.\' (1)\r\n\r\n\'We CAN afford to take in a stamped edition of YOU, and all Dickens\'\r\nworks as fast as they come out, but we do NOT keep such a thing as a\r\nPEERAGE or even a BARONETAGE in the house.\r\n\r\n\'We live with every comfort, excellent cellar, &c. &c.; but as we cannot\r\nwell afford a butler, we have a neat table-maid (though our father was a\r\nmilitary man, has travelled much, been in the best society, &c.) We HAVE\r\na coachman and helper, but we don\'t put the latter into buttons, nor\r\nmake them wait at table, like Stripes and Tummus.\' (2)\r\n\r\n\'We are just the same to persons with a handle to their name as to those\r\nwithout it. We wear a moderate modicum of crinoline, (3)and are never\r\nlimp (4) in the morning. We have good and abundant dinners on CHINA\r\nthough we have plate (5), and just as good when alone as with company.\r\n\r\n\'Now, my dear MR. PUNCH, will you PLEASE give us a short answer in your\r\nnext number, and I will be SO much obliged to you. Nobody knows we are\r\nwriting to you, not even our father; nor will we ever tease (6) you\r\nagain if you will only give us an answer--just for FUN, now do!\r\n\r\n\'If you get as far as this, which is doubtful, you will probably fling\r\nit into the fire. If you do, I cannot help it; but I am of a sanguine\r\ndisposition, and entertain a lingering hope. At all events, I shall\r\nbe impatient for next Sunday, for you reach us on that day, and I am\r\nashamed to confess, we CANNOT resist opening you in the carriage driving\r\nhome from church. (7)\r\n\r\n\'I remain, &c. &c., for myself and sisters.\r\n\r\nExcuse this scrawl, but I always write headlong. (8)\r\n\r\n\'P. S.--You were rather stupid last week, don\'t you think? (9) We keep\r\nno gamekeeper, and yet have always abundant game for friends to shoot,\r\nin spite of the poachers. We never write on perfumed paper--in short, I\r\ncan\'t help thinking that if you knew us you would not think us Snobs.\'\r\n\r\nTo this I reply in the following manner:--\'My dear young ladies, I know\r\nyour post-town: and shall be at church there the Sunday AFTER next;\r\nwhen, will you please to wear a tulip or some little trifle in your\r\nbonnets, so that I may know you? You will recognize me and my dress--a\r\nquiet-looking young fellow, in a white top-coat, a crimson satin\r\nneckcloth, light blue trousers, with glossy tipped boots, and an emerald\r\nbreast-pin. I shall have a black crape round my white hat; and my usual\r\nbamboo cane with the richly-gilt knob. I am sorry there will be no time\r\nto get up moustaches between now and next week.\r\n\r\n\'From seventeen to two-and-twenty! Ye gods! what ages! Dear young\r\ncreatures, I can see you all three. Seventeen suits me, as nearest my\r\nown time of life; but mind, I don\'t say two-and-twenty is too old. No,\r\nno. And that pretty, roguish, demure, middle one. Peace, peace, thou\r\nsilly little fluttering heart!\r\n\r\n\'YOU Snobs, dear young ladies! I will pull any man\'s nose who says so.\r\nThere is no harm in being of a good family. You can\'t help it, poor\r\ndears. What\'s in a name? What is in a handle to it? I confess openly\r\nthat I should not object to being a Duke myself; and between ourselves\r\nyou might see a worse leg for a garter.\r\n\r\n\'YOU Snobs, dear little good-natured things, no that is, I hope not--I\r\nthink not--I won\'t be too confident--none of us should be--that we are\r\nnot Snobs. That very confidence savours of arrogance, and to be arrogant\r\nis to be a Snob. In all the social gradations from sneak to tyrant,\r\nnature has placed a most wondrous and various progeny of Snobs. But are\r\nthere no kindly natures, no tender hearts, no souls humble, simple, and\r\ntruth-loving? Ponder well on this question, sweet young ladies. And if\r\nyou can answer it, as no doubt you can--lucky are you--and lucky the\r\nrespected Herr Papa, and lucky the three handsome young gentlemen who\r\nare about to become each others\' brothers-in-law.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) The introduction of Grandpapa, is I fear, Snobbish.\r\n\r\n(2) That is, as you like. I don\'t object to buttons in moderation.\r\n\r\n(3) Quite right.\r\n\r\n(4) Bless you!\r\n\r\n(5) Snobbish; and I doubt whether you ought to dine as well alone as\r\nwith company. You will be getting too good dinners.\r\n\r\n(6) We like to be teased; but tell Papa.\r\n\r\n(7) O garters and stars! what will Captain Gordon and Exeter Hall say to\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n(8) Dear little enthusiast!\r\n\r\n(9) You were never more mistaken, miss, in your life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII--SNOBS AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nEverybody of the middle rank who walks through this life with a sympathy\r\nfor his companions on the same journey--at any rate, every man who has\r\nbeen jostling in the world for some three or four lustres--must make\r\nno end of melancholy reflections upon the fate of those victims whom\r\nSociety, that is, Snobbishness, is immolating every day. With love and\r\nsimplicity and natural kindness Snobbishness is perpetually at war.\r\nPeople dare not be happy for fear of Snobs. People dare not love for\r\nfear of Snobs. People pine away lonely under the tyranny of Snobs.\r\nHonest kindly hearts dry up and die. Gallant generous lads, blooming\r\nwith hearty youth, swell into bloated old-bachelorhood, and burst\r\nand tumble over. Tender girls wither into shrunken decay, and perish\r\nsolitary, from whom Snobbishness has cut off the common claim to\r\nhappiness and affection with which Nature endowed us all. My heart grows\r\nsad as I see the blundering tyrant\'s handiwork. As I behold it I swell\r\nwith cheap rage, and glow with fury against the Snob. Come down, I say,\r\nthou skulking dulness! Come down, thou stupid bully, and give up thy\r\nbrutal ghost! And I arm myself with the sword and spear, and taking\r\nleave of my family, go forth to do battle with that hideous ogre and\r\ngiant, that brutal despot in Snob Castle, who holds so many gentle\r\nhearts in torture and thrall.\r\n\r\nWhen PUNCH is king, I declare there shall be no such thing as old maids\r\nand old bachelors. The Reverend Mr. Malthus shall be burned annually,\r\ninstead of Guy Fawkes. Those who don\'t marry shall go into the\r\nworkhouse. It shall be a sin for the poorest not to have a pretty girl\r\nto love him.\r\n\r\nThe above reflections came to mind after taking a walk with an old\r\ncomrade, Jack Spiggot by name, who is just passing into the state of\r\nold-bachelorhood, after the manly and blooming youth in which I remember\r\nhim. Jack was one of the handsomest fellows in England when we entered\r\ntogether in the Highland Buffs; but I quitted the Cuttykilts early, and\r\nlost sight of him for many years.\r\n\r\nAh! how changed he is from those days! He wears a waistband now, and has\r\nbegun to dye his whiskers. His cheeks, which were red, are now mottled;\r\nhis eyes, once so bright and steadfast, are the colour of peeled\r\nplovers\' eggs.\r\n\r\n\'Are you married, Jack?\' says I, remembering how consumedly in love he\r\nwas with his cousin Letty Lovelace, when the Cuttykilts were quartered\r\nat Strathbungo some twenty years ago.\r\n\r\n\'Married? no,\' says he. \'Not money enough. Hard enough to keep myself,\r\nmuch more a family, on five hundred a year. Come to Dickinson\'s; there\'s\r\nsome of the best Madeira in London there, my boy.\' So we went and talked\r\nover old times. The bill for dinner and wine consumed was prodigious,\r\nand the quantity of brandy-and-water that Jack took showed what a\r\nregular boozer he was. \'A guinea or two guineas. What the devil do I\r\ncare what I spend for my dinner?\' says he.\r\n\r\n\'And Letty Lovelace?\' says I.\r\n\r\nJack\'s countenance fell. However, he burst into a loud laugh presently.\r\n\'Letty Lovelace!\' says he. \'She\'s Letty Lovelace still; but Gad, such a\r\nwizened old woman! She\'s as thin as a thread-paper; (you remember what a\r\nfigure she had:) her nose has got red, and her teeth blue. She\'s\r\nalways ill; always quarrelling with the rest of the family; always\r\npsalm-singing, and always taking pills. Gad, I had a rare escape THERE.\r\nPush round the grog, old boy.\'\r\n\r\nStraightway memory went back to the days when Letty was the loveliest\r\nof blooming young creatures: when to hear her sing was to make the heart\r\njump into your throat; when to see her dance, was better than Montessu\r\nor Noblet (they were the Ballet Queens of those days); when Jack used to\r\nwear a locket of her hair, with a little gold chain round his neck, and,\r\nexhilarated with toddy, after a sederunt of the Cuttykilt mess, used\r\nto pull out this token, and kiss it, and howl about it, to the great\r\namusement of the bottle-nosed old Major and the rest of the table.\r\n\r\n\'My father and hers couldn\'t put their horses together,\' Jack said. \'The\r\nGeneral wouldn\'t come down with more than six thousand. My governor said\r\nit shouldn\'t be done under eight. Lovelace told him to go and be hanged,\r\nand so we parted company. They said she was in a decline. Gammon! She\'s\r\nforty, and as tough and as sour as this bit of lemon-peel. Don\'t put\r\nmuch into your punch, Snob my boy. No man CAN stand punch after wine.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what are your pursuits, Jack?\' says I.\r\n\r\n\'Sold out when the governor died. Mother lives at Bath. Go down there\r\nonce a year for a week. Dreadful slow. Shilling whist. Four sisters--all\r\nunmarried except the youngest--awful work. Scotland in August. Italy in\r\nthe winter. Cursed rheumatism. Come to London in March, and toddle\r\nabout at the Club, old boy; and we won\'t go home till maw-aw-rning till\r\ndaylight does appear.\r\n\r\n\'And here\'s the wreck of two lives!\' mused the present Snobographer,\r\nafter taking leave of Jack Spiggot. \'Pretty merry Letty Lovelace\'s\r\nrudder lost and she cast away, and handsome Jack Spiggot stranded on the\r\nshore like a drunken Trinculo.\'\r\n\r\nWhat was it that insulted Nature (to use no higher name), and perverted\r\nher kindly intentions towards them? What cursed frost was it that\r\nnipped the love that both were bearing, and condemned the girl to sour\r\nsterility, and the lad to selfish old-bachelorhood? It was the infernal\r\nSnob tyrant who governs us all, who says, \'Thou shalt not love without\r\na lady\'s maid; thou shalt not marry without a carriage and horses; thou\r\nshalt have no wife in thy heart, and no children on thy knee, without\r\na page in buttons and a French BONNE; thou shalt go to the devil unless\r\nthou hast a brougham; marry poor, and society shall forsake thee; thy\r\nkinsmen shall avoid thee as a criminal; thy aunts and uncles shall turn\r\nup their eyes and bemoan the sad, sad manner in which Tom or Harry has\r\nthrown himself away.\' You, young woman, may sell yourself without shame,\r\nand marry old Croesus; you, young man, may lie away your heart and your\r\nlife for a jointure. But if \'you are poor, woe be to you! Society, the\r\nbrutal Snob autocrat, consigns you to solitary perdition. Wither, poor\r\ngirl, in your garret; rot, poor bachelor, in your Club.\r\n\r\nWhen I see those graceless recluses--those unnatural monks and nuns of\r\nthe order of St. Beelzebub, (1) my hatred for Snobs, and their worship,\r\nand their idols, passes all continence. Let us hew down that man-eating\r\nJuggernaut, I say, that hideous Dagon; and I glow with the heroic\r\ncourage of Tom Thumb, and join battle with the giant Snob.\r\n\r\n(1) This, of course, is understood to apply only to those unmarried\r\npersons whom a mean and Snobbish fear about money has kept from\r\nfulfilling their natural destiny. Many persons there are devoted to\r\ncelibacy because they cannot help it. Of these a man would be a brute\r\nwho spoke roughly. Indeed, after Miss O\'Toole\'s conduct to the writer,\r\nhe would be the last to condemn. But never mind, these are personal\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV--SNOBS AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nIn that noble romance called \'Ten Thousand a Year,\' I remember a\r\nprofoundly pathetic description of the Christian manner in which the\r\nhero, Mr. Aubrey, bore his misfortunes. After making a display of the\r\nmost florid and grandiloquent resignation, and quitting his country\r\nmansion, the writer supposes Aubrey to come to town in a post-chaise and\r\npair, sitting bodkin probably between his wife and sister. It is about\r\nseven o\'clock, carriages are rattling about, knockers are thundering,\r\nand tears bedim the fine eyes of Kate and Mrs. Aubrey as they think that\r\nin happier times at this hour--their Aubrey used formerly to go out to\r\ndinner to the houses of the aristocracy his friends. This is the gist of\r\nthe passage--the elegant words I forget. But the noble, noble sentiment\r\nI shall always cherish and remember. What can be more sublime than the\r\nnotion of a great man\'s relatives in tears about--his dinner? With a few\r\ntouches, what author ever more happily described A Snob?\r\n\r\nWe were reading the passage lately at the house of my friend, Raymond\r\nGray, Esquire, Barrister-at-Law, an ingenuous youth without the least\r\npractice, but who has luckily a great share of good spirits, which\r\nenables him to bide his time, and bear laughingly his humble position in\r\nthe world. Meanwhile, until it is altered, the stern laws of necessity\r\nand the expenses of the Northern Circuit oblige Mr. Gray to live in a\r\nvery tiny mansion in a very queer small square in the airy neighbourhood\r\nof Gray\'s Inn Lane.\r\n\r\nWhat is the more remarkable is, that Gray has a wife there. Mrs.\r\nGray was a Miss Harley Baker: and I suppose I need not say THAT is\r\na respectable family. Allied to the Cavendishes, the Oxfords, the\r\nMarrybones, they still, though rather DECHUS from their original\r\nsplendour, hold their heads as high as any. Mrs. Harley Baker, I know,\r\nnever goes to church without John behind to carry her prayer-book; nor\r\nwill Miss Welbeck, her sister, walk twenty yards a-shopping without the\r\nprotection of Figby, her sugar-loaf page; though the old lady is as ugly\r\nas any woman in the parish and as tall and whiskery as a grenadier.\r\nThe astonishment is, how Emily Harley Baker could have stooped to marry\r\nRaymond Gray. She, who was the prettiest and proudest of the family;\r\nshe, who refused Sir Cockle Byles, of the Bengal Service; she, who\r\nturned up her little nose at Essex Temple, Q.C., and connected with\r\nthe noble house of Albyn; she, who had but 4,000L. POUR TOUT POTAGE,\r\nto marry a man who had scarcely as much more. A scream of wrath and\r\nindignation was uttered by the whole family when they heard of this\r\nMESALLIANCE. Mrs. Harley Baker never speaks of her daughter now but\r\nwith tears in her eyes, and as a ruined creature. Miss Welbeck says, \'I\r\nconsider that man a villain;\' and has denounced poor good-natured Mrs.\r\nPerkins as a swindler, at whose ball the young people met for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Gray, meanwhile, live in Gray\'s Inn Lane aforesaid, with\r\na maid-servant and a nurse, whose hands are very full, and in a most\r\nprovoking and unnatural state of happiness. They have never once thought\r\nof crying about their dinner, like the wretchedly puling and Snobbish\r\nwomankind of my favourite Snob Aubrey, of \'Ten Thousand a Year;\' but,\r\non the contrary, accept such humble victuals as fate awards them with a\r\nmost perfect and thankful good grace--nay, actually have a portion for a\r\nhungry friend at times--as the present writer can gratefully testify.\r\n\r\nI was mentioning these dinners, and some admirable lemon puddings which\r\nMrs. Gray makes, to our mutual friend the great Mr. Goldmore, the East\r\nIndia Director, when that gentleman\'s face assumed an expression\r\nof almost apoplectic terror, and he gasped out, \'What! Do they give\r\ndinners?\' He seemed to think it a crime and a wonder that such people\r\nshould dine at all, and that it was their custom to huddle round their\r\nkitchen-fire over a bone and a crust. Whenever he meets them in society,\r\nit is a matter of wonder to him (and he always expresses his surprise\r\nvery loud) how the lady can appear decently dressed, and the man have an\r\nunpatched coat to his back. I have heard him enlarge upon this poverty\r\nbefore the whole room at the \'Conflagrative Club,\' to which he and I and\r\nGray have the honour to belong.\r\n\r\nWe meet at the Club on most days. At half-past four, Goldmore arrives\r\nin St. James\'s Street, from the City, and you may see him reading the\r\nevening papers in the bow-window of the Club, which enfilades\r\nPall Mall--a large plethoric man, with a bunch of seals in a large\r\nbow-windowed light waistcoat. He has large coat-tails, stuffed with\r\nagents\' letters and papers about companies of which he is a Director.\r\nHis seals jingle as he walks. I wish I had such a man for an uncle, and\r\nthat he himself were childless. I would love and cherish him, and be\r\nkind to him.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock in the full season, when all the world is in St. James\'s\r\nStreet, and the carriages are cutting in and out among the cabs on the\r\nstand, and the tufted dandies are showing their listless faces out of\r\n\'White\'s,\' and you see respectable grey-headed gentlemen waggling their\r\nheads to each other through the plate-glass windows of \'Arthur\'s:\' and\r\nthe red-coats wish to be Briareian, so as to hold all the gentlemen\'s\r\nhorses; and that wonderful red-coated royal porter is sunning himself\r\nbefore Marlborough House;--at the noon of London time, you see a\r\nlight-yellow carriage with black horses, and a coachman in a tight\r\nfloss-silk wig, and two footmen in powder and white and yellow liveries,\r\nand a large woman inside in shot-silk, a poodle, and a pink parasol,\r\nwhich drives up to the gate of the Conflagrative, and the page goes\r\nand says to Mr. Goldmore (who is perfectly aware of the fact, as he\r\nis looking out of the windows with about forty other \'Conflagrative\'\r\nbucks), \'Your carriage, Sir.\' G. wags his head. \'Remember, eight o\'clock\r\nprecisely,\' says he to Mulligatawney, the other East India Director;\r\nand, ascending the carriage, plumps down by the side of Mrs. Goldmore\r\nfor a drive in the Park, and then home to Portland Place. As the\r\ncarriage whirls off, all the young bucks in the Club feel a secret\r\nelation. It is a part of their establishment, as it were. That carriage\r\nbelongs to their Club, and their Club belongs to them. They follow the\r\nequipage with interest; they eye it knowingly as they see it in the\r\nPark. But halt! we are not come to the Club Snobs yet. O my brave Snobs,\r\nwhat a flurry there will be among you when those papers appear!\r\n\r\nWell, you may judge, from the above description, what sort of a man\r\nGoldmore is. A dull and pompous Leadenhall Street Croesus, good-natured\r\nwithal, and affable--cruelly affable. \'Mr. Goldmore can never forget,\'\r\nhis lady used to say, \'that it was Mrs. Gray\'s Grandfather who sent\r\nhim to India; and though that young woman has made the most imprudent\r\nmarriage in the world, and has left her station in society, her husband\r\nseems an ingenious and laborious young man, and we shall do everything\r\nin our power to be of use to him.\' So they used to ask the Grays to\r\ndinner twice or thrice in a season, when, by way of increasing the\r\nkindness, Buff, the butler, is ordered to hire a fly to convey them to\r\nand from Portland Place.\r\n\r\nOf course I am much too good-natured a friend of both parties not to\r\ntell Gray of Goldmore\'s opinion in him, and the nabob\'s astonishment\r\nat the of the briefless barrister having any dinner at all. Indeed,\r\nGoldmore\'s saying became a joke against Gray amongst us wags at the\r\nClub, and we used to ask him when he tasted meat last? whether we should\r\nbring him home something from dinner? and cut a thousand other mad\r\npranks with him in our facetious way.\r\n\r\nOne day, then, coming home from the Club, Mr. Gray conveyed to his wife\r\nthe astounding information that he had asked Goldmore to dinner.\r\n\r\n\'My love,\' says Mrs. Gray, in a tremor, \'how could you be so cruel? Why,\r\nthe dining-room won\'t hold Mrs. Goldmore.\'\r\n\r\n\'Make your mind easy, Mrs. Gray; her ladyship is in Paris. It is only\r\nCroesus that\'s coming, and we are going to the play afterwards--to\r\nSadler\'s Wells. Goldmore said at the Club that he thought Shakspeare was\r\na great dramatic poet, and ought to be patronized; whereupon, fired with\r\nenthusiasm, I invited him to our banquet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Goodness gracious! what CAN we give him for dinner? He has two French\r\ncooks; you know Mrs. Goldmore is always telling us about them; and he\r\ndines with Aldermen every day.\'\r\n\r\n\'"A plain leg of mutton, my Lucy, I prythee get ready at three; Have it\r\ntender, and smoking, and juicy, And what better meat can there be?"\'\r\n\r\nsays Gray, quoting my favourite poet.\r\n\r\n\'But the cook is ill; and you know that horrible Pattypan the\r\npastrycook\'s---\'\r\n\r\n\'Silence, Frau!\' says Gray, in a deep tragedy voice. \'I will have the\r\nordering of this repast. Do all things as I bid thee. Invite our friend\r\nSnob here to partake of the feast. Be mine the task of procuring it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be expensive, Raymond,\' says his wife.\r\n\r\n\'Peace, thou timid partner of the briefless one. Goldmore\'s dinner shall\r\nbe suited to our narrow means. Only do thou in all things my commands.\'\r\nAnd seeing by the peculiar expression of the rogue\'s countenance, that\r\nsome mad waggery was in preparation, I awaited the morrow with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV--SNOBS AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nPunctual to the hour--(by the way, I cannot omit to mark down my hatred,\r\nscorn, and indignation towards those miserable Snobs who come to dinner\r\nat nine when they are asked at eight, in order to make a sensation in\r\nthe company. May the loathing of honest folks, the backbiting of others,\r\nthe curses of cooks, pursue these wretches, and avenge the society on\r\nwhich they trample!)--Punctual, I say, to the hour of five, which Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Raymond Gray had appointed, a youth of an elegant appearance,\r\nin a neat evening-dress, whose trim whiskers indicated neatness, whose\r\nlight step denoted activity (for in sooth he was hungry, and always is\r\nat the dinner hour, whatsoever that hour may be), and whose rich\r\ngolden hair, curling down his shoulders, was set off by a perfectly new\r\nfour-and-ninepenny silk hat, was seen wending his way down Bittlestone\r\nStreet, Bittlestone Square, Gray\'s Inn. The person in question, I need\r\nnot say, was Mr. Snob. HE was never late when invited to dine. But to\r\nproceed my narrative:--\r\n\r\nMr. Snob may have flattered himself that he made a sensation as he\r\nstrutted down Bittlestone with his richly gilt knobbed cane (and indeed\r\nI vow I saw heads looking at me from Miss Squilsby\'s, the brass-plated\r\nmilliner opposite Raymond Gray\'s, who has three silver-paper bonnets,\r\nand two fly-blown prints of fashion in the window), yet what was the\r\nemotion produced by my arrival, compared to that which the little street\r\nthrilled, when at five minutes past five the floss-wigged coachman, the\r\nyellow hammer-cloth and flunkeys, the black horses and blazing silver\r\nharness of Mr. Goldmore whirled down the street!\r\n\r\nIt is a very little street, of very little houses, most of them with\r\nvery large brass plates like Miss Squilsby\'s. Coal-merchants, architects\r\nand surveyors, two surgeons, a solicitor, a dancing-master, and of\r\ncourse several house-agents, occupy the houses--little two-storeyed\r\nedifices with little stucco porticoes. Goldmore\'s carriage overtopped\r\nthe roofs almost; the first floors might shake hands with Croesus as\r\nhe lolled inside; all the windows of those first floors thronged\r\nwith children and women in a twinkling. There was Mrs. Hammerly in\r\ncurl-papers; Mrs. Saxby with her front awry; Mr. Wriggles peering\r\nthrough the gauze curtains, holding the while his hot glass of\r\nrum-and-water--in fine, a tremendous commotion in Bittlestone Street, as\r\nthe Goldmore carriage drove up to Mr. Raymond Gray\'s door.\r\n\r\n\'How kind it is of him to come with BOTH the footmen!\' says little Mrs.\r\nGray, peeping at the vehicle too. The huge domestic, descending from his\r\nperch, gave a rap at the door which almost drove in the building. All\r\nthe heads were out; the sun was shining; the very organ-boy paused; the\r\nfootman, the coach, and Goldmore\'s red face and white waistcoat were\r\nblazing in splendour. The herculean plushed one went back to open the\r\ncarriage-door.\r\n\r\nRaymond Gray opened his--in his shirt-sleeves. He ran up to the\r\ncarriage. \'Come in, Goldmore,\' says he; \'just in time, my boy. Open\r\nthe door, What-d\'ye-call\'um, and let your master out,\'--and\r\nWhat-d\'ye-call\'um obeyed mechanically, with a face of wonder and\r\nhorror, only to be equalled by the look of stupefied astonishment which\r\nornamented the purple countenance of his master.\r\n\r\n\'Wawt taim will you please have the CAGE, sir?\' says What-d\'ye-call\'um,\r\nin that peculiar, unspellable, inimitable, flunkefied pronunciation\r\nwhich forms one of the chief charms of existence.\r\n\r\nBest have it to the theatre at night,\' Gray exclaims; \'it is but a step\r\nfrom here to the Wells, and we can walk there. I\'ve got tickets for all.\r\nBe at Sadler\'s Wells at eleven.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, at eleven,\' exclaims Goldmore, perturbedly, and walks with a\r\nflurried step into the house, as if he were going to execution (as\r\nindeed he was, with that wicked Gray as a Jack Ketch over him). The\r\ncarriage drove away, followed by numberless eyes from doorsteps and\r\nbalconies; its appearance is still a wonder in Bittlestone Street.\r\n\r\n\'Go in there, and amuse yourself with Snob,\' says Gray, opening the\r\nlittle drawing-room door. \'I\'ll call out as soon as the chops are ready.\r\nFanny\'s below, seeing to the pudding.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gracious mercy!\' says Goldmore to me, quite confidentially, \'how could\r\nhe ask us? I really had no idea of this--this utter destitution.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dinner, dinner!\' roars out Gray, from the diningroom, whence issued a\r\ngreat smoking and frying; and entering that apartment we find Mrs. Gray\r\nready to receive us, and looking perfectly like a Princess who, by\r\nsome accident, had a bowl of potatoes in her hand, which vegetables she\r\nplaced on the table. Her husband \'was meanwhile cooking mutton-chops on\r\na gridiron over the fire.\r\n\r\nFanny has made the roly-poly pudding,\' says he; the chops are my part.\r\nHere\'s a fine one; try this, Goldmore.\' And he popped a fizzing cutlet\r\non that gentleman\'s plate. What words, what notes of exclamation can\r\ndescribe the nabob\'s astonishment?\r\n\r\nThe tablecloth was a very old one, darned in a score places. There was\r\nmustard in a teacup, a silver fork for Goldmore--all ours were iron.\r\n\r\n\'I wasn\'t born with a silver spoon in my mouth,\' says Gray, gravely.\r\n\'That fork is the only one we have. Fanny has it generally.\'\r\n\r\n\'Raymond!\'--cries Mrs. Gray, with an imploring face. \'She was used to\r\nbetter things, you know: and I hope one day to get her a dinner-service.\r\nI\'m told the electro-plate is uncommonly good. Where the deuce IS\r\nthat boy with the beer? And now,\' said he, springing up, \'I\'ll be a\r\ngentleman.\' And so he put on his coat, and sat down quite gravely, with\r\nfour fresh mutton-chops which he had by this time broiled.\r\n\r\n\'We don\'t have meat every day, Mr. Goldmore,\' he continued, \'and it\'s a\r\ntreat to me to get a dinner like this. You little know, you gentlemen of\r\nEngland, who live at home at ease, what hardships briefless barristers\r\nendure.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gracious mercy!\' says Mr. Goldmore.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s the half-and-half? Fanny, go over to the \'Keys\' and get the\r\nbeer. Here\'s sixpence.\' And what was our astonishment when Fanny got up\r\nas if to go!\r\n\r\n\'Gracious mercy! let ME,\' cries Goldmore.\r\n\r\n\'Not for worlds, my dear sir. She\'s used to it. They wouldn\'t serve\r\nyou as well as they serve her. Leave her alone. Law bless you!\' Raymond\r\nsaid, with astounding composure. And Mrs. Gray left the room, and\r\nactually came back with a tray on which there was a pewter flagon of\r\nbeer. Little Polly (to whom, at her christening, I had the honour\r\nof presenting a silver mug EX OFFICIO) followed with a couple of\r\ntobacco-pipes, and the queerest roguish look in her round little chubby\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\'Did you speak to Tapling about the gin, Fanny, my dear?\' Gray asked,\r\nafter bidding Polly put the pipes on the chimney-piece, which that\r\nlittle person had some difficulty in reaching. \'The last was turpentine,\r\nand even your brewing didn\'t make good punch of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You would hardly suspect, Goldmore, that my wife, a Harley Baker, would\r\never make gin-punch? I think my mother-in-law would commit suicide if\r\nshe saw her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be always laughing at mamma, Raymond,\' says Mrs. Gray.\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, she wouldn\'t die, and I DON\'T wish she would. And you don\'t\r\nmake gin-punch, and you don\'t like it either and--Goldmore do you drink\r\nyour beer out of the glass, or out of the pewter?\'\r\n\r\n\'Gracious mercy!\' ejaculates Croesus once more, as little Polly, taking\r\nthe pot with both her little bunches of hands, offers it, smiling, to\r\nthat astonished Director.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in a word, the dinner commenced, and was presently ended in a\r\nsimilar fashion. Gray pursued his unfortunate guest with the most queer\r\nand outrageous description of his struggles, misery, and poverty. He\r\ndescribed how he cleaned the knives when they were first married; and\r\nhow he used to drag the children in a little cart; how his wife could\r\ntoss pancakes; and what parts of his dress she made. He told Tibbits,\r\nhis clerk (who was in fact the functionary who had brought the beer from\r\nthe public-house, which Mrs. Fanny had fetched from the neighbouring\r\napartment)--to fetch \'the bottle of port-wine,\' when the dinner was\r\nover; and told Goldmore as wonderful a history about the way in which\r\nthat bottle of wine had come into his hands as any of his former stories\r\nhad been. When the repast was all over, and it was near time to move\r\nto the play, and Mrs. Gray had retired, and we were sitting ruminating\r\nrather silently over the last glasses of the port, Gray suddenly breaks\r\nthe silence by slapping Goldmore on the shoulder, and saying, \'Now,\r\nGoldmore, tell me something.\'\r\n\r\n\'What?\' asks Croesus.\r\n\r\n\'Haven\'t you had a good dinner?\'\r\n\r\nGoldmore started, as if a sudden truth had just dawned upon him. He HAD\r\nhad a good dinner; and didn\'t know it until then. The three mutton-chops\r\nconsumed by him were best of the mutton kind; the potatoes were perfect\r\nof their order; as for the rolypoly, it was too good. The porter was\r\nfrothy and cool, and the port-wine was worthy of the gills of a bishop.\r\nI speak with ulterior views; for there is more in Gray\'s cellar.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' says Goldmore, after a pause, during which he took time to\r\nconsider the momentous question Gray put to him--\' \'Pon my word--now\r\nyou say so--I--I have--I really have had a monsous good dinnah--monsous\r\ngood, upon my ward! Here\'s your health, Gray my boy, and your amiable\r\nlady; and when Mrs. Goldmore comes back, I hope we shall see you more in\r\nPortland Place.\' And with this the time came for the play, and we went\r\nto see Mr. Phelps at Sadler\'s Wells. The best of this story (for the\r\ntruth of every word of which I pledge my honour) is, that after this\r\nbanquet, which Goldmore enjoyed so, the honest fellow felt a prodigious\r\ncompassion and regard for the starving and miserable giver of the feast,\r\nand determined to help him in his profession. And being a Director of\r\nthe newly-established Antibilious Life Assurance Company, he has had\r\nGray appointed Standing Counsel, with a pretty annual fee; and\r\nonly yesterday, in an appeal from Bombay (Buckmuckjee Bobbachee v.\r\nRamchowder-Bahawder) in the Privy Council, Lord Brougham complimented\r\nMr. Gray, who was in the case, on his curious and exact knowledge of the\r\nSanscrit language.\r\n\r\nWhether he knows Sanscrit or not, I can\'t say; but Goldmore got him the\r\nbusiness; and so I cannot help having a lurking regard for that pompous\r\nold Bigwig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI--SNOBS AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\'We Bachelors in Clubs are very much obliged to you,\' says my old school\r\nand college companion, Essex Temple, \'for the opinion which you hold of\r\nus. You call us selfish, purple-faced, bloated, and other pretty names.\r\nYou state, in the simplest possible terms, that we shall go to the\r\ndeuce. You bid us rot in loneliness, and deny us all claims to honesty,\r\nconduct, decent Christian life. Who are you, Mr. Snob, to judge us. Who\r\nare you, with your infernal benevolent smirk and grin, that laugh at all\r\nour generation?\r\n\r\n\'I will tell you my case,\' says Essex Temple; \'mine and my sister\r\nPolly\'s, and you may make what you like of it; and sneer at old maids,\r\nand bully old bachelors, if you will.\r\n\r\n\'I will whisper to you confidentially that my sister was engaged to\r\nSerjeant Shirker--a fellow whose talents one cannot deny, and be hanged\r\nto them, but whom I have always known to be mean, selfish, and a prig.\r\nHowever, women don\'t see these faults in the men whom Love throws in\r\ntheir way. Shirker, who has about as much warmth as an eel, made up to\r\nPolly years and years ago, and was no bad match for a briefless\r\nbarrister, as he was then.\r\n\r\nHave you ever read Lord Eldon\'s Life? Do you remember how the sordid old\r\nSnob narrates his going out to purchase twopence-worth of sprats, which\r\nhe and Mrs. Scott fried between them? And how he parades his humility,\r\nand exhibits his miserable poverty--he who, at that time, must have been\r\nmaking a thousand pounds a year? Well, Shirker was just as proud of his\r\nprudence--just as thankful for his own meanness, and of course would not\r\nmarry without a competency. Who so honourable? Polly waited, and waited\r\nfaintly, from year to year. HE wasn\'t sick at heart; HIS passion never\r\ndisturbed his six hours\' sleep, or kept his ambition out of mind. He\r\nwould rather have hugged an attorney any day than have kissed Polly,\r\nthough she was one of the prettiest creatures in the world; and while\r\nshe was pining alone upstairs, reading over the stock of half-a-dozen\r\nfrigid letters that the confounded prig had condescended to write\r\nto her, HE, be sure, was never busy with anything but his briefs in\r\nchambers--always frigid, rigid, self-satisfied, and at his duty. The\r\nmarriage trailed on year after year, while Mr. Serjeant Shirker grew to\r\nbe the famous lawyer he is.\r\n\r\n\'Meanwhile, my younger brother, Pump Temple, who was in the 120th\r\nHussars, and had the same little patrimony which fell to the lot of\r\nmyself and Polly, must fall in love with our cousin, Fanny Figtree, and\r\nmarry her out of hand. You should have seen the wedding! Six\r\nbridesmaids in pink, to hold the fan, bouquet, gloves, scent-bottle,\r\nand pocket-handkerchief of the bride; basketfuls of white favours in\r\nthe vestry, to be pinned on to the footmen and horses; a genteel\r\ncongregation of curious acquaintance in the pews, a shabby one of poor\r\non the steps; all the carriages of all our acquaintance, whom Aunt\r\nFigtree had levied for the occasion; and of course four horses for Mr.\r\nPump\'s bridal vehicle.\r\n\r\n\'Then comes the breakfast, or DEJEUNER, if you please, with a brass band\r\nin the street, and policemen to keep order. The happy bridegroom\r\nspends about a year\'s income in dresses for the bridesmaids and\r\npretty presents; and the bride must have a TROUSSEAU of laces, satins,\r\njewel-boxes and tomfoolery, to make her fit to be a lieutenant\'s wife.\r\nThere was no hesitation about Pump. He flung about his money as if it\r\nhad been dross; and Mrs. P. Temple, on the horse Tom Tiddler, which her\r\nhusband gave her, was the most dashing of military women at Brighton or\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nHow old Mrs. Figtree used to bore me and Polly with stories of Pump\'s\r\ngrandeur and the noble company he kept! Polly lives with the Figtrees,\r\nas I am not rich enough to keep a home for her.\r\n\r\n\'Pump and I have always been rather distant. Not having the slightest\r\nnotions about horseflesh, he has a natural contempt for me; and in our\r\nmother\'s lifetime, when the good old lady was always paying his debts\r\nand petting him, I\'m not sure there was not a little jealousy. It used\r\nto be Polly that kept the peace between us.\r\n\r\n\'She went to Dublin to visit Pump, and brought back grand accounts\r\nof his doings--gayest man about town--Aide-de-Camp to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant--Fanny admired everywhere--Her Excellency godmother to\r\nthe second boy: the eldest with a string of aristocratic Christian-names\r\nthat made the grandmother wild with delight. Presently Fanny and Pump\r\nobligingly came to London, where the third was born.\r\n\r\n\'Polly was godmother to this, and who so loving as she and Pump now?\r\n"Oh, Essex," says she to me, "he is so good, so generous, so fond of his\r\nfamily; so handsome; who can help loving him, and pardoning his little\r\nerrors?" One day, while Mrs. Pump was yet in the upper regions, and\r\nDoctor Fingerfee\'s brougham at her door every day, having business at\r\nGuildhall, whom should I meet in Cheapside but Pump and Polly? The poor\r\ngirl looked more happy and rosy than I have seen her these twelve years.\r\nPump, on the contrary, was rather blushing and embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t be mistaken in her face and its look of mischief and\r\ntriumph. She had been committing some act of sacrifice. I went to the\r\nfamily stockbroker. She had sold out two thousand pounds that morning\r\nand given them to Pump. Quarrelling was useless--Pump had the money; he\r\nwas off to Dublin by the time I reached his mother\'s, and Polly radiant\r\nstill. He was going to make his fortune; he was going to embark the\r\nmoney in the Bog of Allen--I don\'t know what. The fact is, he was going\r\nto pay his losses upon the last Manchester steeple-chase, and I leave\r\nyou to imagine how much principal or interest poor Polly ever saw back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\'It was more than half her fortune, and he has had another thousand\r\nsince from her. Then came efforts to stave off ruin and prevent\r\nexposure; struggles on all our parts, and sacrifices, that\' (here Mr.\r\nEssex Temple began to hesitate)--\'that needn\'t be talked of; but they\r\nare of no more use than such sacrifices ever are. Pump and his wife are\r\nabroad--I don\'t like to ask where; Polly has the three children, and Mr.\r\nSerjeant Shirker has formally written to break off an engagement, on the\r\nconclusion of which Miss Temple must herself have speculated, when she\r\nalienated the greater part of her fortune.\r\n\r\n\'And here\'s your famous theory of poor marriages!\' Essex Temple cries,\r\nconcluding the above history. \'How do you know that I don\'t want to\r\nmarry myself? How do you dare sneer at my poor sister? What are we\r\nbut martyrs of the reckless marriage system which Mr. Snob, forsooth,\r\nchooses to advocate?\' And he thought he had the better of the argument,\r\nwhich, strange to say, is not my opinion.\r\n\r\nBut for the infernal Snob-worship, might not every one of these people\r\nbe happy? If poor Polly\'s happiness lay in linking her tender arms round\r\nsuch a heartless prig as the sneak who has deceived her, she might have\r\nbeen happy now--as happy as Raymond Raymond in the ballad, with the\r\nstone statue by his side. She is wretched because Mr. Serjeant Shirker\r\nworships money and ambition, and is a Snob and a coward.\r\n\r\nIf the unfortunate Pump Temple and his giddy hussy of a wife have ruined\r\nthemselves, and dragged down others into their calamity, it is because\r\nthey loved rank, and horses, and plate, and carriages, and COURT GUIDES,\r\nand millinery, and would sacrifice all to attain those objects.\r\n\r\nAnd who misguides them? If the world were more simple, would not those\r\nfoolish people follow the fashion? Does not the world love COURT\r\nGUIDES, and millinery, and plate, and carriages? Mercy on us! Read the\r\nfashionable intelligence; read the COURT CIRCULAR; read the genteel\r\nnovels; survey mankind, from Pimlico to Red Lion Square, and see how the\r\nPoor Snob is aping the Rich Snob; how the Mean Snob is grovelling at the\r\nfeet of the Proud Snob; and the Great Snob is lording it over his humble\r\nbrother. Does the idea of equality ever enter Dives\' head? Will it ever?\r\nWill the Duchess of Fitzbattleaxe (I like a good name) ever believe that\r\nLady Croesus, her next-door neighbour in Belgrave Square, is as good a\r\nlady as her Grace? Will Lady Croesus ever leave off pining the Duchess\'s\r\nparties, and cease patronizing Mrs. Broadcloth whose husband has not got\r\nhis Baronetcy yet? Will Mrs. Broadcloth ever heartily shake hands with\r\nMrs. Seedy, and give up those odious calculations about poor dear Mrs.\r\nSeedy\'s income? Will Mrs. Seedy who is starving in her great house, go\r\nand live comfortably in a little one, or in lodgings? Will her landlady,\r\nMiss Letsam, ever stop wondering at the familiarity of tradespeople, or\r\nrebuking the insolence of Suky, the maid, who wears flowers under her\r\nbonnet like a lady?\r\n\r\nBut why hope, why wish for such times? Do I wish all Snobs to perish? Do\r\nI wish these Snob papers to determine? Suicidal fool, art not thou, too,\r\na Snob and a brother?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nAs I wish to be particularly agreeable to the ladies (to whom I make my\r\nmost humble obeisance), we will now, if you please, commence maligning\r\na class of Snobs against whom, I believe, most female minds are\r\nembittered--I mean Club Snobs. I have very seldom heard even the most\r\ngentle and placable woman speak without a little feeling of bitterness\r\nagainst those social institutions, those palaces swaggering in St.\r\nJames\'s, which are open to the men; while the ladies have but their\r\ndingy three-windowed brick boxes in Belgravia or in Paddingtonia, or in\r\nthe region between the road of Edgware and that of Gray\'s Inn.\r\n\r\nIn my grandfather\'s time it used to be Freemasonry that roused their\r\nanger. It was my grand-aunt (whose portrait we still have in the family)\r\nwho got into the clock-case at the Royal Rosicrucian Lodge at Bungay,\r\nSuffolk, to spy the proceedings of the Society, of which her husband\r\nwas a member, and being frightened by the sudden whirring and striking\r\neleven of the clock (just as the Deputy-Grand-Master was bringing in the\r\nmystic gridiron for the reception of a neophyte), rushed out into the\r\nmidst of the lodge assembled; and was elected, by a desperate unanimity,\r\nDeputy-Grand-Mistress for life. Though that admirable and courageous\r\nfemale never subsequently breathed a word with regard to the secrets\r\nof the initiation, yet she inspired all our family with such a terror\r\nregarding the mysteries of Jachin and Boaz, that none of our family have\r\never since joined the Society, or worn the dreadful Masonic insignia.\r\n\r\nIt is known that Orpheus was torn to pieces by some justly indignant\r\nThracian ladies for belonging to an Harmonic Lodge. \'Let him go back\r\nto Eurydice,\' they said, \'whom he is pretending to regret so.\' But the\r\nhistory is given in Dr. Lempriere\'s elegant dictionary in a manner much\r\nmore forcible than any this feeble pen can attempt. At once, then, and\r\nwithout verbiage, let us take up this subject-matter of Clubs.\r\n\r\nClubs ought not, in my mind, to be permitted to bachelors. If my friend\r\nof the Cuttykilts had not our club, the \'Union Jack,\' to go to (I belong\r\nto the \'U.J. and nine other similar institutions), who knows but he\r\nnever would be a bachelor at this present moment? Instead of being made\r\ncomfortable, and cockered up with every luxury, as they are at Clubs,\r\nbachelors ought to be rendered profoundly miserable, in my opinion.\r\nEvery encouragement should be given to the rendering their spare time\r\ndisagreeable. There can be no more odious object, according to my\r\nsentiments, than young Smith in the pride of health, commanding his\r\ndinner of three courses; than middle-aged Jones wallowing (as I may\r\nsay) in an easy padded arm-chair, over the delicious novel or brilliant\r\nmagazine; or than old Brown, that selfish old reprobate for whom mere\r\nliterature has no charms, stretched on the best sofa, sitting on the\r\nsecond edition of THE TIMES, having the MORNING CHRONICLE between his\r\nknees, the HERALD pushed in between his coat and waistcoat, the STANDARD\r\nunder his arm, the GLOBE under the other pinion, and the DAILY NEWS\r\nin perusal. \'I\'ll trouble you for PUNCH, Mr. Wiggins\' says the\r\nunconscionable old gormandiser, interrupting our friend, who is laughing\r\nover the periodical in question.\r\n\r\nThis kind of selfishness ought not to be. No, no. Young Smith, instead\r\nof his dinner and his wine, ought to be, where?--at the festive\r\ntea-table, to be sure, by the side of Miss Higgs, sipping the bohea, or\r\ntasting the harmless muffin; while old Mrs. Higgs looks on, pleased at\r\ntheir innocent dalliance, and my friend Miss Wirt, the governess, is\r\nperforming Thalberg\'s last sonata in treble X., totally unheeded, at the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\nWhere should the middle-aged Jones be? At his time of life, he ought\r\nto be the father of a family. At such an hour--say, at nine o\'clock at\r\nnight--the nursery-bell should have just rung the children to bed. He\r\nand Mrs. J. ought to be, by rights, seated on each side of the fire by\r\nthe dining-room table, a bottle of port-wine between them, not so full\r\nas it was an hour since. Mrs. J. has had two glasses; Mrs. Grumble\r\n(Jones\'s mother-in-law) has had three; Jones himself has finished the\r\nrest, and dozes comfortably until bed-time.\r\n\r\nAnd Brown, that old newspaper-devouring miscreant, what right has HE at\r\na club at a decent hour of night? He ought to be playing his rubber with\r\nMiss MacWhirter, his wife, and the family apothecary. His candle ought\r\nto be brought to him at ten o\'clock, and he should retire to rest just\r\nas the young people were thinking of a dance. How much finer, simpler,\r\nnobler are the several employments I have sketched out for these\r\ngentlemen than their present nightly orgies at the horrid Club.\r\n\r\nAnd, ladies, think of men who do not merely frequent the dining-room and\r\nlibrary, but who use other apartments of those horrible dens which it\r\nis my purpose to batter down; think of Cannon, the wretch, with his coat\r\noff, at his age and size, clattering the balls over the billiard-table\r\nall night, and making bets with that odious Captain Spot!--think of\r\nPam in a dark room with Bob Trumper, Jack Deuceace, and Charley Vole,\r\nplaying, the poor dear misguided wretch, guinea points and five pounds\r\non the rubber!--above all, think--oh, think of that den of abomination,\r\nwhich, I am told, has been established in SOME clubs, called THE\r\nSMOKING-ROOM,--think of the debauchees who congregate there, the\r\nquantities of reeking whisky-punch or more dangerous sherry-cobbler\r\nwhich they consume;--think of them coming home at cock-crow and letting\r\nthemselves into the quiet house with the Chubb key;--think of them, the\r\nhypocrites, taking off their insidious boots before they slink upstairs,\r\nthe children sleeping overhead, the wife of their bosom alone with\r\nthe waning rushlight in the two-pair front--that chamber so soon to\r\nbe rendered hateful by the smell of their stale cigars: I am not an\r\nadvocate of violence; I am not, by nature, of an incendiary turn of\r\nmind: but if, my dear ladies, you are for assassinating Mr. Chubb and\r\nburning down Club-houses in St. James\'s, there is ONE Snob at who will\r\nnot think the worse of you.\r\n\r\nThe only men who, as I opine, ought to be allowed the use of Clubs, are\r\nmarried men without a profession. The continual presence of these in a\r\nhouse cannot be thought, even by the most loving of wives, desirable.\r\nSay the girls are beginning to practise their music, which in an\r\nhonourable English family, ought to occupy every young gentlewoman three\r\nhours; it would be rather hard to call upon poor papa to sit in the\r\ndrawing-room all that time, and listen to the interminable discords and\r\nshrieks which are elicited from the miserable piano during the above\r\nnecessary operation. A man with a good ear, especially, would go mad, if\r\ncompelled daily to submit to this horror.\r\n\r\nOr suppose you have a fancy to go to the milliner\'s, or to Howell and\r\nJames\'s, it is manifest, my dear Madam, that your husband is much better\r\nat the Club during these operations than by your side in the carriage,\r\nor perched in wonder upon one of the stools at Shawl and Gimcrack\'s,\r\nwhilst young counter-dandies are displaying their wares.\r\n\r\nThis sort of husbands should be sent out after breakfast, and if not\r\nMembers of Parliament, or Directors of a Railroad, or an Insurance\r\nCompany, should be put into their clubs, and told to remain there until\r\ndinner-time. No sight is more agreeable to my truly regulated mind than\r\nto see the noble characters so worthily employed. Whenever I pass by\r\nSt. James\'s Street, having the privilege, like the rest of the world, of\r\nlooking in at the windows of \'Blight\'s,\' or \'Foodle\'s,\' or \'Snook\'s,\'\r\nor the great bay at the \'Contemplative Club,\' I behold with respectful\r\nappreciation the figures within--the honest rosy old fogies, the mouldy\r\nold dandies, the waist-belts and glossy wigs and tight cravats of those\r\nmost vacuous and respectable men. Such men are best there during the\r\nday-time surely. When you part with them, dear ladies, think of the\r\nrapture consequent on their return. You have transacted your household\r\naffairs; you have made your purchases; you have paid your visits; you\r\nhave aired your poodle in the Park; your French maid has completed the\r\ntoilette which renders you so ravishingly beautiful by candlelight, and\r\nyou are fit to make home pleasant to him who has been absent all day.\r\n\r\nSuch men surely ought to have their Clubs, and we will not class them\r\namong Club Snobs therefore:--on whom let us reserve our attack for the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nSuch a Sensation has been created in the Clubs by the appearance of the\r\nlast paper on Club Snobs, as can\'t but be complimentary to me who am one\r\nof their number.\r\n\r\nI belong to many Clubs. The \'Union Jack,\' the \'Sash and\r\nMarlin-spike\'--Military Clubs. \'The True Blue,\' the \'No Surrender,\'\r\nthe \'Blue and Buff,\' the \'Guy Fawkes,\' and the \'Cato Street\'--Political\r\nClubs. \'The Brummel\' and the \'Regent\'--Dandy Clubs. The \'Acropolis,\' the\r\n\'Palladium,\' the \'Areopagus,\' the \'Pnyx\' the \'Pentelicus,\' the \'Ilissus\'\r\nand the \'Poluphloisboio Thalasses\'--Literary Clubs. I never could make\r\nout how the latter set of Clubs got their names; I don\'t know Greek for\r\none, and I wonder how many other members of those institutions do? Ever\r\nsince the Club Snobs have been announced, I observe a sensation created\r\non my entrance into any one of these places. Members get up and hustle\r\ntogether; they nod, they scowl, as they glance towards the present Snob.\r\n\'Infernal impudent jackanapes! If he shows me up,\' says Colonel Bludyer,\r\n\'I\'ll break every bone in his skin.\' \'I told you what would come of\r\nadmitting literary men into the Club,\' says Ranville Ranville to his\r\ncolleague, Spooney, of the Tape and Sealing-Wax Office. \'These people\r\nare very well in their proper places, and as a public man, I make a\r\npoint of shaking hands with them, and that sort of thing; but to have\r\none\'s privacy obtruded upon by such people is really too much. Come\r\nalong, Spooney,\' and the pair of prigs retire superciliously.\r\n\r\nAs I came into the coffee-room at the \'No Surrender,\' old Jawkins was\r\nholding out to a knot of men, who were yawning, as usual. There he\r\nstood, waving the STANDARD, and swaggering before the fire. \'What,\' says\r\nhe, \'did I tell Peel last year? If you touch the Corn Laws, you touch\r\nthe Sugar Question; if you touch the Sugar, you touch the Tea. I am no\r\nmonopolist. I am a liberal man, but I cannot forget that I stand on\r\nthe brink of a precipice; and if were to have Free Trade, give me\r\nreciprocity. And what was Sir Robert Peel\'s answer to me? "Mr. Jawkins,"\r\nhe said--\'\r\n\r\nHere Jawkins\'s eye suddenly turning on your humble servant, he stopped\r\nhis sentence, with a guilty look--his stale old stupid sentence, which\r\nevery one of us at the Club has heard over and over again.\r\n\r\nJawkins is a most pertinacious Club Snob. Every day he is at\r\nthat fireplace, holding that STANDARD, of which he reads up the\r\nleading-article, and pours it out ORE ROTUNDO, with the most astonishing\r\ncomposure, in the face of his neighbour, who has just read every word\r\nof it in the paper. Jawkins has money, as you may see by the tie of his\r\nneckcloth. He passes the morning swaggering about the City, in bankers\'\r\nand brokers parlours, and says:--\'I spoke with Peel yesterday, and his\r\nintentions are so and so. Graham and I were talking over the matter,\r\nand I pledge you my word of honour, his opinion coincides with mine; and\r\nthat What-d\'ye-call-um is the only measure Government will venture on\r\ntrying.\' By evening-paper time he is at the Club: \'I can tell you the\r\nopinion of the City, my lord,\' says he, \'and the way in which Jones Loyd\r\nlooks at it is briefly this: Rothschilds told me so themselves. In\r\nMark Lane, people\'s minds are QUITE made up.\' He is considered rather a\r\nwell-informed man.\r\n\r\nHe lives in Belgravia, of course; in a drab-coloured genteel house,\r\nand has everything about him that is properly grave, dismal, and\r\ncomfortable. His dinners are in the MORNING HERALD, among the parties\r\nfor the week; and his wife and daughters make a very handsome appearance\r\nat the Drawing-Room, once a year, when he comes down to the Club in his\r\nDeputy-Lieutenant\'s uniform.\r\n\r\nHe is fond of beginning a speech to you by saying, \'When I was in the\r\nHouse, I &c.\'--in fact he sat for Skittlebury for three weeks in the\r\nfirst Reformed Parliament, and was unseated for bribery; since which he\r\nhas three times unsuccessfully contested that honourable borough.\r\n\r\nAnother sort of Political Snob I have seen at most Clubs and that is\r\nthe man who does not care so much for home politics, but is great upon\r\nforeign affairs. I think this sort of man is scarcely found anywhere BUT\r\nin Clubs. It is for him the papers provide their foreign articles,\r\nat the expense of some ten thousand a-year each. He is the man who is\r\nreally seriously uncomfortable about the designs of Russia, and the\r\natrocious treachery of Louis Philippe. He it is who expects a French\r\nfleet in the Thames, and has a constant eye upon the American President,\r\nevery word of whose speech (goodness help him!) he reads. He knows the\r\nnames of the contending leaders in Portugal, and what they are fighting\r\nabout: and it is he who says that Lord Aberdeen ought to be impeached,\r\nand Lord Palmerston hanged, or VICE VERSA.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston\'s being sold to Russia, the exact number of roubles\r\npaid, by what house in the City, is a favourite theme with this kind of\r\nSnob. I once overheard him--it was Captain Spitfire, R.N., (who had been\r\nrefused a ship by the Whigs, by the way)--indulging in the following\r\nconversation with Mr. Minns after dinner.\r\n\r\nWhy wasn\'t the Princess Scragamoffsky at Lady Palmerston\'s party, Minns?\r\nBecause SHE CAN\'T SHOW--why can\'t she show? Shall I tell you, Minns,\r\nwhy she can\'t show? The Princess Scragainoffsky\'s back is flayed alive,\r\nMinns--I tell you it\'s raw, sir! On Tuesday last, at twelve o\'clock,\r\nthree drummers of the Preobajinski Regiment arrived at Ashburnham House,\r\nand at half-past twelve, in the yellow drawing-room at the Russian\r\nEmbassy, before the ambassadress and four ladies\'-maids, the Greek Papa,\r\nand the Secretary of Embassy, Madame de Scragamoffsky received thirteen\r\ndozen. She was knouted, sir, knouted in the midst of England--in\r\nBerkeley Square, for having said that the Grand Duchess Olga\'s hair was\r\nred. And now, sir, will you tell me Lord Palmerston ought to continue\r\nMinister?\'\r\n\r\nMinns: \'Good Ged!\'\r\n\r\nMinns follows Spitfire about, and thinks him the greatest and wisest of\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nWhy does not some great author write \'The Mysteries of the Club-houses;\r\nor St. James\'s Street unveiled?\' It would be a fine subject for an\r\nimaginative writer. We must all, as boys, remember when we went to the\r\nfair, and had spent all our money--the sort of awe and anxiety with\r\nwhich we loitered round the outside of the show, speculating upon the\r\nnature of the entertainment going on within.\r\n\r\nMan is a Drama--of Wonder and Passion, and Mystery and Meanness, and\r\nBeauty and Truthfulness, and Etcetera. Each Bosom is a Booth in Vanity\r\nFair. But let us stop this capital style, I should die if I kept it\r\nup for a column (a pretty thing a column all capitals would be, by the\r\nway). In a Club, though there mayn\'t be a soul of your acquaintance\r\nin the room, you have always the chance of watching strangers, and\r\nspeculating on what is going on within those tents and curtains of their\r\nsouls, their coats and waistcoats. This is a never-failing sport. Indeed\r\nI am told there are some Clubs in the town where nobody ever speaks to\r\nanybody. They sit in the coffee-room, quite silent, and watching each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nYet how little you can tell from a man\'s outward demeanour! There\'s a\r\nman at our Club--large, heavy, middle-aged--gorgeously dressed--rather\r\nbald--with lacquered boots--and a boa when he goes out; quiet in\r\ndemeanour, always ordering and consuming a RECHERCHE little dinner: whom\r\nI have mistaken for Sir John Pocklington any time these five years, and\r\nrespected as a man with five hundred pounds PER DIEM; and I find he\r\nis but a clerk in an office in the City, with not two hundred pounds\r\nincome, and his name is Jubber. Sir John Pocklington was, on the\r\ncontrary, the dirty little snuffy man who cried out so about the bad\r\nquality of the beer, and grumbled at being overcharged three-halfpence\r\nfor a herring, seated at the next table to Jubber on the day when some\r\none pointed the Baronet out to me.\r\n\r\nTake a different sort of mystery. I see, for instance, old Fawney\r\nstealing round the rooms of the Club, with glassy, meaningless eyes,\r\nand an endless greasy simper--he fawns on everybody he meets, and\r\nshakes hands with you, and blesses you, and betrays the most tender and\r\nastonishing interest in your welfare. You know him to be a quack and a\r\nrogue, and he knows you know it. But he wriggles on his way, and leaves\r\na track of slimy flattery after him wherever he goes. Who can penetrate\r\nthat man\'s mystery? What earthly good can he get from you or me? You\r\ndon\'t know what is working under that leering tranquil mask. You have\r\nonly the dim instinctive repulsion that warns you, you are in the\r\npresence of a knave--beyond which fact all Fawney\'s soul is a secret to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI think I like to speculate on the young men best. Their play is opener.\r\nYou know the cards in their hand, as it were. Take, for example, Messrs.\r\nSpavin and Cockspur.\r\n\r\nA specimen or two of the above sort of young fellows may be found, I\r\nbelieve, at most Clubs. They know nobody. They bring a fine smell of\r\ncigars into the room with them, and they growl together, in a corner,\r\nabout sporting matters. They recollect the history of that short period\r\nin which they have been ornaments of the world by the names of winning\r\nhorses. As political men talk about \'the Reform year,\' \'the year the\r\nWhigs went out,\' and so forth, these young sporting bucks speak of\r\nTARNATION\'S year, or OPODELDOC\'S year, or the year when CATAWAMPUS ran\r\nsecond for the Chester Cup. They play at billiards in the morning,\r\nthey absorb pale ale for breakfast, and \'top up\' with glasses of strong\r\nwaters. They read BELL\'S LIFE (and a very pleasant paper too, with a\r\ngreat deal of erudition in the answers to correspondents). They go down\r\nto Tattersall\'s, and swagger in the Park, with their hands plunged in\r\nthe pockets of their paletots.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes me especially in the outward demeanour of sporting youth\r\nis their amazing gravity, their conciseness of speech, and careworn and\r\nmoody air. In the smoking-room at the \'Regent,\' when Joe Millerson\r\nwill be setting the whole room in a roar with laughter, you hear young\r\nMessrs. Spavin and Cockspur grumbling together in a corner. \'I\'ll take\r\nyour five-and-twenty to one about Brother to Bluenose,\' whispers Spavin.\r\n\'Can\'t do it at the price,\' Cockspur says, wagging his head ominously.\r\nThe betting-book is always present in the minds of those unfortunate\r\nyoungsters. I think I hate that work even more than the \'Peerage.\' There\r\nis some good in the latter--though, generally speaking, a vain record:\r\nthough De Mogyns is not descended from the giant Hogyn Mogyn; though\r\nhalf the other genealogies are equally false and foolish; yet the\r\nmottoes are good reading--some of them; and the book itself a sort of\r\ngold-laced and livened lackey to History, and in so far serviceable. But\r\nwhat good ever came out of, or went into, a betting-book? If I could\r\nbe Caliph Omar for a week, I would pitch every one of those despicable\r\nmanuscripts into the flames; from my Lord\'s, who is \'in\' with Jack\r\nSnaffle\'s stable, and is over-reaching worse-informed rogues and\r\nswindling greenhorns, down to Sam\'s, the butcher-boy\'s, who books\r\neighteenpenny odds in the tap-room, and \'stands to win five-and-twenty\r\nbob.\'\r\n\r\nIn a turf transaction, either Spavin or Cockspur would try to get the\r\nbetter of his father, and, to gain a point in the odds, victimise his\r\nbest friends. One day we shall hear of one or other levanting; an\r\nevent at which, not being sporting men, we shall not break our hearts.\r\nSee--Mr. Spavin is settling his toilette previous to departure; giving a\r\ncurl in the glass to his side-wisps of hair. Look at him! It is only\r\nat the hulks, or among turf-men, that you ever see a face so mean, so\r\nknowing, and so gloomy.\r\n\r\nA much more humane being among the youthful Clubbists is the\r\nLady-killing Snob. I saw Wiggle just now in the dressing-room, talking\r\nto Waggle, his inseparable.\r\n\r\nWAGGLE.--\'Pon my honour, Wiggle, she did.\'\r\n\r\nWIGGLE.--\'Well, Waggle, as you say--I own I think she DID look at me\r\nrather kindly. We\'ll see to-night at the French play.\'\r\n\r\nAnd having arrayed their little persons, these two harmless young bucks\r\ngo upstairs to dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nBoth sorts of young men, mentioned in my last under the flippant names\r\nof Wiggle and Waggle, may be found in tolerable plenty, I think, in\r\nClubs. Wiggle and Waggle are both idle. They come of the middle classes.\r\nOne of them very likely makes believe to be a barrister, and the other\r\nhas smart apartments about Piccadilly. They are a sort of second-chop\r\ndandies; they cannot imitate that superb listlessness of demeanour, and\r\nthat admirable vacuous folly which distinguish the noble and high-born\r\nchiefs of the race; but they lead lives almost as bad (were it but for\r\nthe example), and are personally quite as useless. I am not going to\r\narm a thunderbolt, and launch it at the beads of these little Pall\r\nMall butterflies. They don\'t commit much public harm, or private\r\nextravagance. They don\'t spend a thousand pounds for diamond earrings\r\nfor an Opera-dancer, as Lord Tarquin can: neither of them ever set up a\r\npublic-house or broke the bank of a gambling-club, like the young Earl\r\nof Martingale. They have good points, kind feelings, and deal honourably\r\nin money-transactions--only in their characters of men of second-rate\r\npleasure about town, they and their like are so utterly mean,\r\nself-contented, and absurd, that they must not be omitted in a work\r\ntreating on Snobs.\r\n\r\nWiggle has been abroad, where he gives you to understand that his\r\nsuccess among the German countesses and Italian princesses, whom he met\r\nat the TABLES-D\'HOTE, was perfectly terrific. His rooms are hung round\r\nwith pictures of actresses and ballet-dancers. He passes his mornings\r\nin a fine dressing-gown, burning pastilles, and reading \'Don Juan\' and\r\nFrench novels (by the way, the life of the author of \'Don Juan,\' as\r\ndescribed by himself, was the model of the life of a Snob). He has\r\ntwopenny-halfpenny French prints of women with languishing eyes, dressed\r\nin dominoes,--guitars, gondolas, and so forth,--and tells you stories\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a bad print,\' says he, \'I know, but I\'ve a reason for liking it.\r\nIt reminds me of somebody--somebody I knew in other climes. You have\r\nheard of the Principessa di Monte Pulciano? I met her at Rimini. Dear,\r\ndear Francesca! That fair-haired, bright-eyed thing in the Bird of\r\nParadise and the Turkish Simar with the love-bird on her finger, I\'m\r\nsure must have been taken from--from somebody perhaps whom you don\'t\r\nknow--but she\'s known at Munich, Waggle my boy,--everybody knows the\r\nCountess Ottilia de Eulenschreckenstein. Gad, sir, what a beautiful\r\ncreature she was when I danced with her on the birthday of Prince Attila\r\nof Bavaria, in \'44. Prince Carloman was our vis-a-vis, and Prince\r\nPepin danced the same CONTREDANSE. She had a Polyanthus in her bouquet.\r\nWaggle, I HAVE IT NOW.\' His countenance assumes an agonized and\r\nmysterious expression, and he buries his head in the sofa cushions, as\r\nif plunging into a whirlpool of passionate recollections.\r\n\r\nLast year he made a considerable sensation by having on his table a\r\nmorocco miniature-case locked by a gold key, which he always wore round\r\nhis neck, and on which was stamped a serpent--emblem of eternity--with\r\nthe letter M in the circle. Sometimes he laid this upon his little\r\nmorocco writing-table, as if it were on an altar--generally he had\r\nflowers upon it; in the middle of a conversation he would start up and\r\nkiss it. He would call out from his bed-room to his valet, \'Hicks, bring\r\nme my casket!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know who it is,\' Waggle would say. \'Who DOES know that fellow\'s\r\nintrigues! Desborough Wiggle, sir, is the slave of passion. I suppose\r\nyou have heard the story of the Italian princess locked up in the\r\nConvent of Saint Barbara, at Rimini? He hasn\'t told you? Then I\'m not\r\nat liberty to speak. Or the countess, about whom he nearly had the duel\r\nwith Prince Witikind of Bavaria? Perhaps you haven\'t even heard about\r\nthat beautiful girl at Pentonville, daughter of a most respectable\r\nDissenting clergyman. She broke her heart when she found he was engaged\r\n(to a most lovely creature of high family, who afterwards proved false\r\nto him), and she\'s now in Hanwell.\'\r\n\r\nWaggle\'s belief in his friend amounts to frantic adoration. \'What a\r\ngenius he is, if he would but apply himself!\' he whispers to me. \'He\r\ncould be anything, sir, but for his passions. His poems are the most\r\nbeautiful things you ever saw. He\'s written a continuation of "Don\r\nJuan," from his own adventures. Did you ever read his lines to Mary?\r\nThey\'re superior to Byron, sir--superior to Byron.\'\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear this from so accomplished a critic as Waggle; for\r\nthe fact is, I had composed the verses myself for honest Wiggle one\r\nday, whom I found at his chambers plunged in thought over a very dirty\r\nold-fashioned album, in which he had not as yet written a single word.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t,\' says he. \'Sometimes I can write whole cantos, and to-day not\r\na line. Oh, Snob! such an opportunity! Such a divine creature! She\'s\r\nasked me to write verses for her album, and I can\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is she rich?\' said I. \'I thought you would never marry any but an\r\nheiress.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Snob! she\'s the most accomplished, highly-connected creature!--and\r\nI can\'t get out a line.\'\r\n\r\n\'How will you have it?\' says I. \'Hot, with sugar?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t, don\'t! You trample on the most sacred feelings, Snob. I want\r\nsomething wild and tender,--like Byron. I want to tell her that amongst\r\nthe festive balls, and that sort of thing, you know--I only think about\r\nher, you know--that I scorn the world, and am weary of it, you know,\r\nand--something about a gazelle, and a bulbul, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'And a yataghan to finish off with,\' the present writer observed, and we\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\n\'TO MARY\r\n\r\n\'I seem, in the midst of the crowd, The lightest of all; My laughter\r\nrings cheery and loud, In banquet and ball. My lip hath its smiles and\r\nits sneers, For all men to see; But my soul, and my truth, and my tears,\r\nAre for thee, are for thee!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you call THAT neat, Wiggle?\' says I. \'I declare it almost makes me\r\ncry myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now suppose,\' says Wiggle, \'we say that all the world is at my\r\nfeet--make her jealous, you know, and that sort of thing--and that--that\r\nI\'m going to TRAVEL, you know? That perhaps may work upon her feelings.\'\r\n\r\nSo WE (as this wretched prig said) began again:--\r\n\r\n\'Around me they flatter and fawn--The young and the old, The fairest are\r\nready to pawn Their hearts for my gold. They sue me--I laugh as I spurn\r\nThe slaves at my knee, But in faith and in fondness I turn Unto thee,\r\nunto thee!\'\r\n\r\n\'Now for the travelling, Wiggle my boy!\' And I began, in a voice choked\r\nwith emotion--\r\n\r\n\'Away! for my heart knows no rest Since you taught it to feel; The\r\nsecret must die in my breast I burn to reveal; The passion I may\r\nnot. . . .\'\r\n\r\n\'I say, Snob!\' Wiggle here interrupted the excited bard (just as I was\r\nabout to break out into four lines so pathetic that they would drive you\r\ninto hysterics). \'I say--ahem--couldn\'t you say that I was--a--military\r\nman, and that there was some danger of my life?\'\r\n\r\n\'You a military man?--danger of your life? What the deuce do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why,\' said Wiggle, blushing a great deal, \'I told her I was going\r\nout--on--the--Ecuador--expedition.\'\r\n\r\n\'You abominable young impostor,\' I exclaimed. \'Finish the poem for\r\nyourself!\' And so he did, and entirely out of all metre, and bragged\r\nabout the work at the Club as his own performance.\r\n\r\nPoor Waggle fully believed in his friend\'s genius, until one day last\r\nweek he came with a grin on his countenance to the Club, and said, \'Oh,\r\nSnob, I\'ve made SUCH a discovery! Going down to the skating to-day, whom\r\nshould I see but Wiggle walking with that splendid woman--that lady of\r\nillustrious family and immense fortune, Mary, you know, whom he wrote\r\nthe beautiful verses about. She\'s five-and-forty. She\'s red hair. She\'s\r\na nose like a pump-handle. Her father made his fortune by keeping a\r\nham-and-beef shop, and Wiggle\'s going to marry her next week.\'\r\n\r\n\'So much the better, Waggle, my young friend,\' I exclaimed. \'Better\r\nfor the sake of womankind that this dangerous dog should leave off\r\nlady-killing--this Blue-Beard give up practice. Or, better rather\r\nfor his own sake. For as there is not a word of truth in any of those\r\nprodigious love-stories which you used to swallow, nobody has been\r\nhurt except Wiggle himself, whose affections will now centre in the\r\nham-and-beef shop. There ARE people, Mr. Waggle, who do these things\r\nin earnest, and hold a good rank in the world too. But these are not\r\nsubjects for ridicule, and though certainly Snobs, are scoundrels\r\nlikewise. Their cases go up to a higher Court.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nBacchus is the divinity to whom Waggle devotes his especial worship.\r\n\'Give me wine, my boy,\' says he to his friend Wiggle, who is prating\r\nabout lovely woman; and holds up his glass full of the rosy fluid, and\r\nwinks at it portentously, and sips it, and smacks his lips after it, and\r\nmeditates on it, as if he were the greatest of connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nI have remarked this excessive wine-amateurship especially in youth.\r\nSnoblings from college, Fledglings from the army, Goslings from the\r\npublic schools, who ornament our Clubs, are frequently to be heard in\r\ngreat force upon wine questions. \'This bottle\'s corked,\' says Snobling;\r\nand Mr. Sly, the butler, taking it away, returns presently with the same\r\nwine in another jug, which the young amateur pronounces excellent. \'Hang\r\nchampagne!\' says Fledgling, \'it\'s only fit for gals and children.\r\nGive me pale sherry at dinner, and my twenty-three claret afterwards.\'\r\n\'What\'s port now?\' says Gosling; \'disgusting thick sweet stuff--where\'s\r\nthe old dry wine one USED to get?\' Until the last twelvemonth, Fledgling\r\ndrank small-beer at Doctor Swishtail\'s; and Gosling used to get his dry\r\nold port at a gin-shop in Westminster--till he quitted that seminary, in\r\n1844.\r\n\r\nAnybody who has looked at the caricatures of thirty years ago,\r\nmust remember how frequently bottle-noses, pimpled faces, and other\r\nBardolphian features are introduced by the designer. They are much more\r\nrare now (in nature, and in pictures, therefore,) than in those good old\r\ntimes; but there are still to be found amongst the youth of our Clubs\r\nlads who glory in drinking-bouts, and whose faces, quite sickly and\r\nyellow, for the most part are decorated with those marks which Rowland\'s\r\nKalydor is said to efface. \'I was SO cut last night--old boy!\' Hopkins\r\nsays to Tomkins (with amiable confidence). \'I tell you what we did. We\r\nbreakfasted with Jack Herring at twelve, and kept up with brandy and\r\nsoda-water and weeds till four; then we toddled into the Park for an\r\nhour; then we dined and drank mulled port till half-price; then we\r\nlooked in for an hour at the Haymarket; then we came back to the Club,\r\nand had grills and whisky punch till all was blue--Hullo, waiter! Get me\r\na glass of cherry-brandy.\' Club waiters, the civilest, the kindest, the\r\npatientest of men, die under the infliction of these cruel young topers.\r\nBut if the reader wishes to see a perfect picture on the stage of this\r\nclass of young fellows, I would recommend him to witness the ingenious\r\ncomedy of LONDON ASSURANCE--the amiable heroes of which are represented,\r\nnot only as drunkards and five-o\'clock-in-the-morning men, but as\r\nshowing a hundred other delightful traits of swindling, lying, and\r\ngeneral debauchery, quite edifying to witness.\r\n\r\nHow different is the conduct of these outrageous youths to the decent\r\nbehaviour of my friend, Mr. Papworthy; who says to Poppins, the butler\r\nat the Club:--\r\n\r\nPAPWORTHY.--\'Poppins, I\'m thinking of dining early; is there any cold\r\ngame in the house?\'\r\n\r\nPOPPINS.--\'There\'s a game pie, sir; there\'s cold grouse, sir; there\'s\r\ncold pheasant, sir; there\'s cold peacock, sir; cold swan, sir; cold\r\nostrich, sir,\' &c. &c. (as the case may be).\r\n\r\nPAPWORTHY.--\'Hem! What\'s your best claret now, Poppins?--in pints, I\r\nmean.\'\r\n\r\nPOPPINS.--\'There\'s Cooper and Magnum\'s Lafitte, sir: there\'s Lath and\r\nSawdust\'s St. Julien, sir; Bung\'s Leoville is considered remarkably\r\nfine; and I think you\'d like Jugger\'s Chateau-Margaux.\'\r\n\r\nPAPWORTHY.--\'Hum!--hah!--well--give me a crust of bread and a glass of\r\nbeer. I\'ll only LUNCH, Poppins.\r\n\r\nCaptain Shindy is another sort of Club bore. He has been known to throw\r\nall the Club in an uproar about the quality of his mutton-chop.\r\n\r\n\'Look at it, sir! Is it cooked, sir? Smell it, sir! Is it meat fit for\r\na gentleman?\' he roars out to the steward, who stands trembling before\r\nhim, and who in vain tells him that the Bishop of Bullocksmithy has just\r\nhad three from the same loin. All the waiters in the Club are huddled\r\nround the captain\'s mutton-chop. He roars out the most horrible curses\r\nat John for not bringing the pickles; he utters the most dreadful\r\noaths because Thomas has not arrived with the Harvey Sauce; Peter comes\r\ntumbling with the water-jug over Jeames, who is bringing \'the glittering\r\ncanisters with bread.\' Whenever Shindy enters the room (such is the\r\nforce of character), every table is deserted, every gentleman must dine\r\nas he best may, and all those big footmen are in terror.\r\n\r\nHe makes his account of it. He scolds, and is better waited upon in\r\nconsequence. At the Club he has ten servants scudding about to do his\r\nbidding.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Shindy and the children are, meanwhile, in dingy lodgings\r\nsomewhere, waited upon by a charity-girl in pattens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nEvery well-bred English female will sympathize with the subject of\r\nthe harrowing tale, the history of Sackville Maine, I am now about to\r\nrecount. The pleasures of Clubs have been spoken of: let us now glance\r\nfor a moment at the dangers of those institutions, and for this purpose\r\nI must introduce you to my young acquaintance, Sackville Maine.\r\n\r\nIt was at a ball at the house of my respected friend, Mrs. Perkins, that\r\nI was introduced to this gentleman and his charming lady. Seeing a young\r\ncreature before me in a white dress, with white satin shoes; with a pink\r\nribbon, about a yard in breadth, flaming out as she twirled in a polka\r\nin the arms of Monsieur de Springbock, the German diplomatist; with a\r\ngreen wreath on her head, and the blackest hair this individual set eyes\r\non--seeing, I say, before me a charming young woman whisking beautifully\r\nin a beautiful dance, and presenting, as she wound and wound round the\r\nroom, now a full face, then a three-quarter face, then a profile--a\r\nface, in fine, which in every way you saw it, looked pretty, and rosy,\r\nand happy, I felt (as I trust) a not unbecoming curiosity regarding the\r\nowner of this pleasant countenance, and asked Wagley (who was standing\r\nby, in conversation with an acquaintance) who was the lady in question?\r\n\r\n\'Which?\' says Wagley.\r\n\r\n\'That one with the coal-black eyes,\' I replied.\r\n\r\n\'Hush!\' says he; and the gentleman with whom he was talking moved off,\r\nwith rather a discomfited air.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Wagley burst out laughing. \'COAL-BLACK eyes!\' said\r\nhe; \'you\'ve just hit it. That\'s Mrs. Sackville Maine, and that was her\r\nhusband who just went away. He\'s a coal-merchant, Snob my boy, and I\r\nhave no doubt Mr. Perkins\'s Wallsends are supplied from his wharf. He is\r\nin a flaming furnace when he hears coals mentioned. He and his wife and\r\nhis mother are very proud of Mrs. Sackville\'s family; she was a Miss\r\nChuff, daughter of Captain Chuff, R.N. That is the widow; that stout\r\nwoman in crimson tabinet, battling about the odd trick with old Mr.\r\nDumps, at the card-table.\'\r\n\r\nAnd so, in fact, it was. Sackville Maine (whose name is a hundred times\r\nmore elegant, surely, than that of Chuff) was blest with a pretty wife,\r\nand a genteel mother-in-law, both of whom some people may envy him.\r\n\r\nSoon after his marriage the old lady was good enough to come and pay him\r\na visit--just for a fortnight--at his pretty little cottage, Kennington\r\nOval; and, such is her affection for the place, has never quitted it\r\nthese four years. She has also brought her son, Nelson Collingwood\r\nChuff, to live with her; but he is not so much at home as his mamma,\r\ngoing as a day-boy to Merchant Taylors\' School, where he is getting a\r\nsound classical education.\r\n\r\nIf these beings, so closely allied to his wife, and so justly dear to\r\nher, may be considered as drawbacks to Maine\'s happiness, what man is\r\nthere that has not some things in life to complain of? And when I first\r\nknew Mr. Maine, no man seemed more comfortable than he. His cottage was\r\na picture of elegance and comfort; his table and cellar were excellently\r\nand neatly supplied. There was every enjoyment, but no ostentation. The\r\nomnibus took him to business of a morning; the boat brought him back to\r\nthe happiest of homes, where he would while away the long evenings by\r\nreading out the fashionable novels to the ladies as they worked; or\r\naccompany his wife on the flute (which he played elegantly); or in any\r\none of the hundred pleasing and innocent amusements of the domestic\r\ncircle. Mrs. Chuff covered the drawing-rooms with prodigious tapestries,\r\nthe work of her hands. Mrs. Sackville had a particular genius for making\r\ncovers of tape or network for these tapestried cushions. She could make\r\nhome-made wines. She could make preserves and pickles. She had an\r\nalbum, into which, during the time of his courtship, Sackville Maine bad\r\nwritten choice scraps of Byron\'s and Moore\'s poetry, analogous to his\r\nown situation, and in a fine mercantile hand. She had a large manuscript\r\nreceipt-book--every quality, in a word, which indicated a virtuous and\r\nwell-bred English female mind.\r\n\r\n\'And as for Nelson Collingwood,\' Sackville would say, laughing, \'we\r\ncouldn\'t do without him in the house. If he didn\'t spoil the tapestry we\r\nshould be \'over-cushioned in a few months; and whom could we get but him\r\nto drink Laura\'s home-made wine?\' The truth is, the gents who came from\r\nthe City to dine at the \'Oval\' could not be induced to drink it--in\r\nwhich fastidiousness, I myself, when I grew to be intimate with the\r\nfamily, confess that I shared.\r\n\r\n\'And yet, sir, that green ginger has been drunk by some of England\'s\r\nproudest heroes,\' Mrs. Chuff would exclaim. \'Admiral Lord Exmouth\r\ntasted and praised it, sir, on board Captain Chuff\'s ship, the\r\n"Nebuchadnezzar," 74, at Algiers; and he had three dozen with turn\r\nin the "Pitchfork" frigate, a part of which was served out to the men\r\nbefore he went into his immortal action with the "Furibonde," Captain\r\nChoufleur, in the Gulf of Panama.\'\r\n\r\nAll this, though the old dowager told us the story every day when the\r\nwine was produced, never served to get rid of any quantity of it--and\r\nthe green ginger, though it had fired British tars for combat and\r\nvictory, was not to the taste of us peaceful and degenerate gents of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nI see Sackville now, as on the occasion when, presented by\r\nWagley, I paid my first visit to him. It was in July--a Sunday\r\nafternoon--Sackville Maine was coming from church, with his wife on one\r\narm, and his mother-ill-law (in red tabinet, as usual,) on the other.\r\nA half-grown, or hobbadehoyish footman, so to speak, walked after them,\r\ncarrying their shining golden prayer-books--the ladies had splendid\r\nparasols with tags and fringes. Mrs. Chuff\'s great gold watch, fastened\r\nto her stomach, gleamed there like a ball of fire. Nelson Collingwood\r\nwas in the distance, shying stones at an old horse on Kennington Common.\r\n\'Twas on that verdant spot we met--nor can I ever forget the majestic\r\ncourtesy of Mrs. Chuff, as she remembered having had the pleasure of\r\nseeing me at Mrs. Perkins\'s--nor the glance of scorn which she threw\r\nat an unfortunate gentleman who was preaching an exceedingly desultory\r\ndiscourse to a sceptical audience of omnibus-cads and nurse-maids, on a\r\ntub, as we passed by. \'I cannot help it, sir,\' says she; \'I am the widow\r\nof an officer of Britain\'s Navy: I was taught to honour my Church and my\r\nKing: and I cannot bear a Radical or a Dissenter.\'\r\n\r\nWith these fine principles I found Sackville Maine impressed. \'Wagley,\'\r\nsaid he, to my introducer, \'if no better engagement, why shouldn\'t self\r\nand friend dine at the "Oval?" Mr. Snob, sir, the mutton\'s coming off\r\nthe spit at this very minute. Laura and Mrs. Chuff\' (he said LAURAR and\r\nMrs. Chuff; but I hate people who make remarks on these peculiarities of\r\npronunciation,) \'will be most happy to see you; and I can promise you a\r\nhearty welcome, and as good a glass of port-wine as any in England.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is better than dining at the "Sarcophagus,"\' thinks I to myself,\r\nat which Club Wagley and I had intended to take our meal; and so we\r\naccepted the kindly invitation, whence arose afterwards a considerable\r\nintimacy.\r\n\r\nEverything about this family and house was so good-natured, comfortable,\r\nand well-conditioned, that a cynic would have ceased to growl there.\r\nMrs. Laura was all graciousness and smiles, and looked to as great\r\nadvantage in her pretty morning-gown as in her dress-robe at Mrs.\r\nPerkins\'s. Mrs. Chuff fired off her stories about the \'Nebuchadnezzar,\'\r\n74, the action between the \'Pitchfork\' and the \'Furibonde\'--the heroic\r\nresistance of Captain Choufleur, and the quantity of snuff he took, &c.\r\n&c.; which, as they were heard for the first time, were pleasanter than\r\nI have subsequently found them. Sackville Maine was the best of hosts.\r\nHe agreed in everything everybody said, altering his opinions without\r\nthe slightest reservation upon the slightest possible contradiction.\r\nHe was not one of those beings who would emulate a Schonbein or\r\nFriar Bacon, or act the part of an incendiary towards the Thames, his\r\nneighbour--but a good, kind, simple, honest, easy fellow--in love with\r\nhis wife--well disposed to all the world--content with himself, content\r\neven with his mother-in-law. Nelson Collingwood, I remember, in the\r\ncourse of the evening, when whisky-and-water was for some reason\r\nproduced, grew a little tipsy. This did not in the least move\r\nSackville\'s equanimity. \'Take him upstairs, Joseph,\' said he to the\r\nhobbadehoy, \'and--Joseph--don\'t tell his mamma.\'\r\n\r\nWhat could make a man so happily disposed, unhappy? What could cause\r\ndiscomfort, bickering, and estrangement in a family so friendly and\r\nunited? Ladies, it was not my fault--it was Mrs. Chuff\'s doing--but the\r\nrest of the tale you shall have on a future day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nThe misfortune which befell the simple and good-natured young Sackville,\r\narose entirely from that abominable \'Sarcophagus Club;\' and that he ever\r\nentered it was partly the fault of the present writer.\r\n\r\nFor seeing Mrs. Chuff, his mother-in-law, had a taste for the\r\ngenteel--(indeed, her talk was all about Lord Collingwood, Lord Gambier,\r\nSir Jahaleel Brenton, and the Gosport and Plymouth balls)--Wagley and I,\r\naccording to our wont, trumped her conversation, and talked about\r\nLords, Dukes, Marquises, and Baronets, as if those dignitaries were our\r\nfamiliar friends.\r\n\r\n\'Lord Sextonbury,\' says I, \'seems to have recovered her ladyship\'s\r\ndeath. He and the Duke were very jolly over their wine at the\r\n"Sarcophagus" last night; weren\'t they, Wagley?\'\r\n\r\n\'Good fellow, the Duke,\' Wagley replied. \'Pray, ma\'am\' (to Mrs. Chuff),\r\n\'you who know the world and etiquette, will you tell me what a man ought\r\nto do in my case? Last June, his Grace, his son Lord Castlerampant,\r\nTom Smith, and myself were dining at the Club, when I offered the odds\r\nagainst DADDYLONGLEGS for the Derby--forty to one, in sovereigns only.\r\nHis Grace took the bet, and of course I won. He has never paid me. Now,\r\ncan I ask such a great man for a sovereign?--One more lump of sugar, if\r\nyou please, my dear madam.\'\r\n\r\nIt was lucky Wagley gave her this opportunity to elude the question,\r\nfor it prostrated the whole worthy family among whom we were. They\r\ntelegraphed each other with wondering eyes. Mrs. Chuff\'s stories about\r\nthe naval nobility grew quite faint and kind little Mrs. Sackville\r\nbecame uneasy, and went upstairs to look at the children--not at\r\nthat young monster, Nelson Collingwood, who was sleeping off the\r\nwhisky-and-water--but at a couple of little ones who had made their\r\nappearance at dessert, and of whom she and Sackville were the happy\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe end of this and subsequent meetings with Mr. Maine was, that we\r\nproposed and got him elected as a member of the \'Sarcophagus Club.\'\r\n\r\nIt was not done without a deal of opposition--the secret having been\r\nwhispered that the candidate was a coal-merchant. You may be sure some\r\nof the proud people and most of the parvenus of the Club were ready\r\nto blackball him. We combated this opposition successfully, however.\r\nWe pointed out to the parvenus that the Lambtons and the Stuarts sold\r\ncoals: we mollified the proud by accounts of his good birth, good\r\nnature, and good behaviour; and Wagley went about on the day of\r\nelection, describing with great eloquence, the action between the\r\n\'Pitchfork\' and the \'Furibonde,\' and the valour of Captain Maine, our\r\nfriend\'s father. There was a slight mistake in the narrative; but we\r\ncarried our man, with only a trifling sprinkling of black beans in the\r\nboxes: Byles\'s, of course, who blackballs everybody: and Bung\'s, who\r\nlooks down upon a coal-merchant, having himself lately retired from the\r\nwine-trade.\r\n\r\nSome fortnight afterwards I saw Sackville Maine under the following\r\ncircumstances:--\r\n\r\nHe was showing the Club to his family. He had \'brought them thither\r\nin the light-blue fly, waiting at the Club door; with Mrs. Chuff\'s\r\nhobbadehoy footboy on the box, by the side of the flyman, in a sham\r\nlivery. Nelson Collingwood; pretty Mrs. Sackville; Mrs. Captain Chuff\r\n(Mrs. Commodore Chuff we call her), were all there; the latter, of\r\ncourse, in the vermilion tabinet, which, splendid as it is, is nothing\r\nin comparison to the splendour of the \'Sarcophagus.\' The delighted\r\nSackville Maine was pointing out the beauties of the place to them. It\r\nseemed as beautiful as Paradise to that little party.\r\n\r\nThe \'Sarcophagus\' displays every known variety of architecture and\r\ndecoration. The great library is Elizabethan; the small library is\r\npointed Gothic; the dining-room is severe Doric; the strangers\' room\r\nhas an Egyptian look; the drawing-rooms are Louis Quatorze (so called\r\nbecause the hideous ornaments displayed were used in the time of Louis\r\nQuinze); the CORTILE, or hall, is Morisco-Italian. It is all over\r\nmarble, maplewood, looking-glasses, arabesques, ormolu, and scagliola.\r\nScrolls, ciphers, dragons, Cupids, polyanthuses, and other flowers\r\nwrithe up the walls in every kind of cornucopiosity. Fancy every\r\ngentleman in Jullien\'s band playing with all his might, and\r\neach performing a different tune; the ornaments at our Club, the\r\n\'Sarcophagus,\' so bewilder and affect me. Dazzled with emotions which I\r\ncannot describe, and which she dared not reveal, Mrs. Chuff, followed\r\nby her children and son-in-law, walked wondering amongst these blundering\r\nsplendours.\r\n\r\nIn the great library (225 feet long by 150) the only man Mrs. Chuff saw,\r\nwas Tiggs. He was lying on a crimson-velvet sofa, reading a French novel\r\nof Paul de Kock. It was a very little book. He is a very little man.\r\nIn that enormous hall he looked like a mere speck. As the ladies passed\r\nbreathless and trembling in the vastness of the magnificent solitude,\r\nhe threw a knowing, killing glance at the fair strangers, as much as to\r\nsay, \'Ain\'t I a fine fellow?\' They thought so, I am sure.\r\n\r\n\'WHO IS THAT?\' hisses out Mrs. Chuff, when we were about fifty yards\r\noff him at the other end of the room.\r\n\r\n\'Tiggs!\' says I, in a similar whisper.\r\n\r\n\'Pretty comfortable this, isn\'t it, my dear?\' says Maine in a\r\nfree-and-easy way to Mrs. Sackville; \'all the magazines, you see--writing\r\nmaterials--new works--choice library, containing every work of\r\nimportance--what have we here?--"Dugdale\'s Monasticon," a most valuable\r\nand, I believe, entertaining book.\'\r\n\r\nAnd proposing to take down one of the books for Mrs. Maine\'s inspection,\r\nhe selected Volume VII., to which he was attracted by the singular fact\r\nthat a brass door-handle grew out of the back. Instead of pulling out\r\na book, however, he pulled open a cupboard, only inhabited by a lazy\r\nhousemaid\'s broom and duster, at which he looked exceedingly discomfited;\r\nwhile Nelson Collingwood, losing all respect, burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the rummest book I ever saw,\' says Nelson. \'I wish we\'d no\r\nothers at Merchant Taylors\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush, Nelson!\' cries Mrs. Chuff, and we went into the other magnificent\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nHow they did admire the drawing-room hangings, (pink and silver brocade,\r\nmost excellent wear for London,) and calculated the price per yard;\r\nand revelled on the luxurious sofas; and gazed on the immeasurable\r\nlooking-glasses.\r\n\r\n\'Pretty well to shave by, eh?\' says Maine to his mother-in-law. (He was\r\ngetting more abominably conceited every minute.) \'Get away, Sackville,\'\r\nsays she, quite delighted, and threw a glance over her shoulder,\r\nand spread out the wings of the red tabinet, and took a good look\r\nat herself; so did Mrs. Sackville--just one, and I thought the glass\r\nreflected a very smiling, pretty creature.\r\n\r\nBut what\'s a woman at a looking-glass? Bless the little dears, it\'s\r\ntheir place. They fly to it naturally. It pleases them, and they adorn\r\nit. What I like to see, and watch with increasing joy and adoration,\r\nis the Club MEN at the great looking-glasses. Old Gills pushing up his\r\ncollars and grinning at his own mottled face. Hulker looking solemnly at\r\nhis great person, and tightening his coat to give himself a waist. Fred\r\nMinchin simpering by as he is going out to dine, and casting upon the\r\nreflection of his white neckcloth a pleased moony smile. What a deal of\r\nvanity that Club mirror has reflected, to be sure!\r\n\r\nWell, the ladies went through the whole establishment with perfect\r\npleasure. They beheld the coffee-rooms, and the little tables laid for\r\ndinner, and the gentlemen who were taking their lunch, and old Jawkins\r\nthundering away as usual; they saw the reading-rooms, and the rush for\r\nthe evening papers; they saw the kitchens--those wonders of art--where\r\nthe CHEF was presiding over twenty pretty kitchen-maids, and ten\r\nthousand shining saucepans: and they got into the light-blue fly\r\nperfectly bewildered with pleasure.\r\n\r\nSackville did not enter it, though little Laura took the back seat on\r\npurpose, and left him the front place alongside of Mrs. Chuff\'s red\r\ntabinet.\r\n\r\n\'We have your favourite dinner,\' says she, in a timid voice; \'won\'t you\r\ncome, Sackville?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall take a chop here to-day, my dear,\' Sackville replied. \'Home,\r\nJames.\' And he went up the steps of the \'Sarcophagus,\' and the pretty\r\nface looked very sad out of the carriage, as the blue fly drove away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV--CLUB SNOBS\r\n\r\nWhy--Why did I and Wagley ever do so cruel an action as to introduce\r\nyoung Sackville Maine into that odious \'Sarcophagus\'? Let our imprudence\r\nand his example be a warning to other gents; let his fate and that of\r\nhis poor wife be remembered by every British female. The consequences of\r\nhis entering the Club were as follows:--\r\n\r\nOne of the first vices the unhappy wretch acquired in this abode of\r\nfrivolity was that of SMOKING. Some of the dandies of the Club, such as\r\nthe Marquis of Macabaw, Lord Doodeen, and fellows of that high order,\r\nare in the habit of indulging in this propensity upstairs in the\r\nbilliard-rooms of the \'Sarcophagus\'--and, partly to make their\r\nacquaintance, partly from a natural aptitude for crime, Sackville Maine\r\nfollowed them, and became an adept in the odious custom. Where it is\r\nintroduced into a family I need not say how sad the consequences\r\nare, both to the furniture and the morals. Sackville smoked in his\r\ndining-room at home, and caused an agony to his wife and mother-in-law\r\nwhich I do not venture to describe.\r\n\r\nHe then became a professed BILLIARD-PLAYER, wasting hours upon hours\r\nat that amusement; betting freely, playing tolerably, losing awfully to\r\nCaptain Spot and Col. Cannon. He played matches of a hundred games with\r\nthese gentlemen, and would not only continue until four or five o\'clock\r\nin the morning at this work, but would be found at the Club of a\r\nforenoon, indulging himself to the detriment of his business, the ruin\r\nof his health, and the neglect of his wife.\r\n\r\nFrom billiards to whist is but a step--and when a man gets to whist and\r\nfive pounds on a rubber, my opinion is, that it is all up with him. How\r\nwas the coal business to go on, and the connection of the firm to be\r\nkept up, and the senior partner always at the card-table?\r\n\r\nConsorting now with genteel persons and Pall Mall bucks, Sackville\r\nbecame ashamed of his snug little residence in Kennington Oval, and\r\ntransported his family to Pimlico, where, though Mrs. Chuff, his\r\nmother-in-law, was at first happy, as the quarter was elegant and\r\nnear her Sovereign, poor little Laura and the children found a woful\r\ndifference. Where were her friends who came in with their work of a\r\nmorning?--At Kennington and in the vicinity of Clapham. \'Where were her\r\nchildren\'s little playmates?--On Kennington Common. The great thundering\r\ncarriages that roared up and down the drab-coloured streets of the\r\nnew quarter, contained no friends for the sociable little Laura.\r\nThe children that paced the squares, attended by a BONNE or a prim\r\ngoverness, were not like those happy ones that flew kites, or played\r\nhop-scotch, on the well-beloved old Common. And ah! what a difference at\r\nChurch too!--between St. Benedict\'s of Pimlico, with open seats, service\r\nin sing-song--tapers--albs--surplices--garlands and processions, and\r\nthe honest old ways of Kennington! The footmen, too, attending St.\r\nBenedict\'s were so splendid and enormous, that James, Mrs. Chuff\'s boy,\r\ntrembled amongst them, and said he would give warning rather than carry\r\nthe books to that church any more.\r\n\r\nThe furnishing of the house was not done without expense.\r\n\r\nAnd, ye gods! what a difference there was between Sackville\'s dreary\r\nFrench banquets in Pimlico, and the jolly dinners at the Oval! No more\r\nlegs-of-mutton, no more of \'the best port-wine in England;\' but ENTREES\r\non plate, and dismal twopenny champagne, and waiters in gloves, and\r\nthe Club bucks for company--among whom Mrs. Chuff was uneasy and Mrs.\r\nSackville quite silent.\r\n\r\nNot that he dined at home often. The wretch had become a perfect\r\nepicure, and dined commonly at the Club with the gormandising clique\r\nthere; with old Doctor Maw, Colonel Cramley (who is as lean as a\r\ngreyhound and has jaws like a jack), and the rest of them. Here you\r\nmight see the wretch tippling Sillery champagne and gorging himself with\r\nFrench viands; and I often looked with sorrow from my table, (on which\r\ncold meat, the Club small-beer, and a half-pint of Marsala form the\r\nmodest banquet,) and sighed to think it was my work.\r\n\r\nAnd there were other beings present to my repentant thoughts. Where\'s\r\nhis wife, thought I? Where\'s poor, good, kind little Laura? At this\r\nvery moment--it\'s about the nursery bed-time, and while yonder\r\ngood-for-nothing is swilling his wine--the little ones are at Laura\'s\r\nknees lisping their prayers: and she is teaching them to say--\'Pray God\r\nbless Papa.\'\r\n\r\nWhen she has put them to bed, her day\'s occupation is gone; and she is\r\nutterly lonely all night, and sad, and waiting for him.\r\n\r\nOh, for shame! Oh, for shame! Go home, thou idle tippler.\r\n\r\nHow Sackville lost his health: how he lost his business; how he got\r\ninto scrapes; how he got into debt; how he became a railroad director;\r\nhow the Pimlico house was shut up; how he went to Boulogne,--all this\r\nI could tell, only I am too much ashamed of my part of the transaction.\r\nThey returned to England, because, to the surprise of everybody, Mrs.\r\nChuff came down with a great sum of money (which nobody knew she had\r\nsaved), and paid his liabilities. He is in England; but at Kennington.\r\nHis name is taken off the books of the \'Sarcophagus\' long ago. When we\r\nmeet, he crosses over to the other side of the street; I don\'t call, as\r\nI should be sorry to see a look of reproach or sadness in Laura\'s sweet\r\nface.\r\n\r\nNot, however, all evil, as I am proud to think, has been the influence\r\nof the Snob of England upon Clubs in general:--Captain Shindy is afraid\r\nto bully the waiters any more, and eats his mutton-chop without moving\r\nAcheron. Gobemouche does not take more than two papers at a time for\r\nhis private reading. Tiggs does not ring the bell and cause the\r\nlibrary-waiter to walk about a quarter of a mile in order to give him\r\nVol. II., which lies on the next table. Growler has ceased to walk from\r\ntable to table in the coffee-room, and inspect what people are having\r\nfor dinner. Trotty Veck takes his own umbrella from the hall--the cotton\r\none; and Sydney Scraper\'s paletot lined with silk has been brought back\r\nby Jobbins, who entirely mistook it for his own. Wiggle has discontinued\r\ntelling stories about the ladies he has killed. Snooks does not any\r\nmore think it gentlemanlike to blackball attorneys. Snuffler no longer\r\npublicly spreads out his great red cotton pocket-handkerchief before the\r\nfire, for the admiration of two hundred gentlemen; and if one Club Snob\r\nhas been brought back to the paths of rectitude, and if one poor John\r\nhas been spared a journey or a scolding--say, friends and brethren if\r\nthese sketches of Club Snobs have been in vain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS ON SNOBS\r\n\r\nHow it is that we have come to No. 45 of this present series of papers,\r\nmy dear friends and brother Snobs, I hardly know--but for a whole mortal\r\nyear have we been together, prattling, and abusing the human race; and\r\nwere we to live for a hundred years more, I believe there is plenty of\r\nsubject for conversation in the enormous theme of Snobs.\r\n\r\nThe national mind is awakened to the subject. Letters pour in every\r\nday, conveying marks of sympathy; directing the attention of the Snob\r\nof England to races of Snobs yet undescribed. \'Where are your Theatrical\r\nSnobs; your Commercial Snobs; your Medical and Chirurgical Snobs; your\r\nOfficial Snobs; your Legal Snobs; your Artistical Snobs; your Musical\r\nSnobs; your Sporting Snobs?\' write my esteemed correspondents. \'Surely\r\nyou are not going to miss the Cambridge Chancellor election, and omit\r\nshowing up your Don Snobs, who are coming, cap in hand, to a young\r\nPrince of six-and-twenty, and to implore him to be the chief of their\r\nrenowned University?\' writes a friend who seals with the signet of the\r\nCam and Isis Club. \'Pray, pray,\' cries another, \'now the Operas are\r\nopening, give us a lecture about Omnibus Snobs.\' Indeed, I should like\r\nto write a chapter about the Snobbish Dons very much, and another about\r\nthe Snobbish Dandies. Of my dear Theatrical Snobs I think with a pang;\r\nand I can hardly break away from some Snobbish artists, with whom I have\r\nlong, long intended to have a palaver.\r\n\r\nBut what\'s the use of delaying? When these were done there would be\r\nfresh Snobs to pourtray. The labour is endless. No single man could\r\ncomplete it. Here are but fifty-two bricks--and a pyramid to build. It\r\nis best to stop. As Jones always quits the room as soon as he has said\r\nhis good thing,--as Cincinnatus and General Washington both retired into\r\nprivate life in the height of their popularity,--as Prince Albert,\r\nwhen he laid the first stone of the Exchange, left the bricklayers to\r\ncomplete that edifice and went home to his royal dinner,--as the poet\r\nBunn comes forward at the end of the season, and with feelings too\r\ntumultuous to describe, blesses his KYIND friends over the footlights:\r\nso, friends, in the flush of conquest and the splendour of victory, amid\r\nthe shouts and the plaudits of a people--triumphant yet modest--the Snob\r\nof England bids ye farewell.\r\n\r\nBut only for a season. Not for ever. No, no. There is one celebrated\r\nauthor whom I admire very much--who has been taking leave of the public\r\nany time these ten years in his prefaces, and always comes back again\r\nwhen everybody is glad to see him. How can he have the heart to be\r\nsaying good-bye so often? I believe that Bunn is affected when he\r\nblesses the people. Parting is always painful. Even the familiar bore is\r\ndear to you. I should be sorry to shake hands even with Jawkins for\r\nthe last time. I think a well-constituted convict, on coming home\r\nfrom transportation, ought to be rather sad when he takes leave of\r\nVan Diemen\'s Land. When the curtain goes down on the last night of a\r\npantomime, poor old clown must be very dismal, depend on it. Ha! with\r\nwhat joy he rushes forward on the evening of the 26th of December\r\nnext, and says--\'How are you?--Here we are!\' But I am growing too\r\nsentimental:--to return to the theme.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL MIND IS AWAKENED TO THE SUBJECT OF SNOBS. The word Snob\r\nhas taken a place in our honest English vocabulary. We can\'t define it,\r\nperhaps. We can\'t say what it is, any more than we can define wit, or\r\nhumour, or humbug; but we KNOW what it is. Some weeks since, happening\r\nto have the felicity to sit next to a young lady at a hospitable table,\r\nwhere poor old Jawkins was holding forth in a very absurd pompous\r\nmanner, I wrote upon the spotless damask \'S--B,\' and called my\r\nneighbour\'s attention to the little remark.\r\n\r\nThat young lady smiled. She knew it at once. Her mind straightway filled\r\nup the two letters concealed by apostrophic reserve, and I read in her\r\nassenting eyes that she knew Jawkins was a Snob. You seldom get them\r\nto make use of the word as yet, it is true; but it is inconceivable how\r\npretty an expression their little smiling mouths assume when they speak\r\nit out. If any young lady doubts, just let her go up to her own room,\r\nlook at herself steadily in the glass, and say \'Snob.\' If she tries this\r\nsimple experiment, my life for it, she will smile, and own that the word\r\nbecomes her mouth amazingly. A pretty little round word, all composed of\r\nsoft letters, with a hiss at the beginning, just to make it piquant, as\r\nit were.\r\n\r\nJawkins, meanwhile, went on blundering, and bragging and boring, quite\r\nunconsciously. And so he will, no doubt, go on roaring and braying, to\r\nthe end of time or at least so long as people will hear him. You cannot\r\nalter the nature of men and Snobs by any force of satire; as, by laying\r\never so many stripes on a donkey\'s back, you can\'t turn him into a\r\nzebra.\r\n\r\nBut we can warn the neighbourhood that the person whom they and Jawkins\r\nadmire is an impostor. We apply the Snob test to him, and try whether he\r\nis conceited and a quack, whether pompous and lacking humility--whether\r\nuncharitable and proud of his narrow soul? How does he treat a great\r\nman--how regard a small one? How does he comport himself in the presence\r\nof His Grace the Duke; and how in that of Smith the tradesman?\r\n\r\nAnd it seems to me that all English society is cursed by this\r\nmammoniacal superstition; and that we are sneaking and bowing and\r\ncringing on the one hand, or bullying and scorning on the other,\r\nfrom the lowest to the highest. My wife speaks with great\r\ncircumspection--\'proper pride,\' she calls it--to our neighbour the\r\ntradesman\'s lady: and she, I mean Mrs. Snob,--Eliza--would give one of\r\nher eyes to go to Court, as her cousin, the Captain\'s wife, did. She,\r\nagain, is a good soul, but it costs her agonies to be obliged to confess\r\nthat we live in Upper Thompson Street, Somers Town. And though I believe\r\nin her heart Mrs. Whiskerington is fonder of us than of her cousins,\r\nthe Smigsmags, you should hear how she goes on prattling about Lady\r\nSmigsmag,--and \'I said to Sir John, my dear John;\' and about the\r\nSmigsmags\' house and parties in Hyde Park Terrace.\r\n\r\nLady Smigsmag, when she meets Eliza,--who is a sort of a kind of a\r\nspecies of a connection of the family, pokes out one finger, which my\r\nwife is at liberty to embrace in the most cordial manner she can devise.\r\nBut oh, you should see her ladyship\'s behaviour on her first-chop\r\ndinner-party days, when Lord and Lady Longears come!\r\n\r\nI can bear it no longer--this diabolical invention of gentility which\r\nkills natural kindliness and honest friendship. Proper pride, indeed!\r\nRank and precedence, forsooth! The table of ranks and degrees is a lie,\r\nand should be flung into the fire. Organize rank and precedence! that\r\nwas well for the masters of ceremonies of former ages. Come forward,\r\nsome great marshal, and organize Equality in society, and your rod\r\nshall swallow up all the juggling old court goldsticks. If this is\r\nnot gospel-truth--if the world does not tend to this--if\r\nhereditary-great-man worship is not a humbug and an idolatry--let us\r\nhave the Stuarts back again, and crop the Free Press\'s ears in the\r\npillory.\r\n\r\nIf ever our cousins, the Smigsmags, asked me to meet Lord Longears,\r\nI would like to take an opportunity after dinner and say, in the most\r\ngood-natured way in the world:--Sir, Fortune makes you a present of\r\na number of thousand pounds every year. The ineffable wisdom of our\r\nancestors has placed you as a chief and hereditary legislator over me.\r\nOur admirable Constitution (the pride of Britons and envy of surrounding\r\nnations) obliges me to receive you as my senator, superior, and\r\nguardian. Your eldest son, Fitz-Heehaw, is sure of a place in\r\nParliament; your younger sons, the De Brays, will kindly condescend\r\nto be post-captains and lieutenants-colonels, and to represent us in\r\nforeign courts or to take a good living when it falls convenient.\r\nThese prizes our admirable Constitution (the pride and envy of, &c.)\r\npronounces to be your due: without count of your dulness, your vices,\r\nyour selfishness; or your entire incapacity and folly. Dull as you may\r\nbe (and we have as good a right to assume that my lord is an ass, as the\r\nother proposition, that he is an enlightened patriot);--dull, I say,\r\nas you may be, no one will accuse you of such monstrous folly, as to\r\nsuppose that you are indifferent to the good luck which you possess, or\r\nhave any inclination to part with it. No--and patriots as we are, under\r\nhappier circumstances, Smith and I, I have no doubt, were we dukes\r\nourselves, would stand by our order.\r\n\r\nWe would submit good-naturedly to sit in a high place. We would\r\nacquiesce in that admirable Constitution (pride and envy of, &c.)\r\nwhich made us chiefs and the world our inferiors; we would not cavil\r\nparticularly at that notion of hereditary superiority which brought many\r\nsimple people cringing to our knees. May be we would rally round the\r\nCorn-Laws; we would make a stand against the Reform Bill; we would die\r\nrather than repeal the Acts against Catholics and Dissenters; we would,\r\nby our noble system of class-legislation, bring Ireland to its present\r\nadmirable condition.\r\n\r\nBut Smith and I are not Earls as yet. \'We don\'t believe that it is\r\nfor the interest of Smith\'s army that De Bray should be a Colonel at\r\nfive-and-twenty, of Smith\'s diplomatic relations that Lord Longears\r\nshould go Ambassador to Constantinople,--of our politics, that Longears\r\nshould put his hereditary foot into them.\r\n\r\nThis bowing and cringing Smith believes to be the act of Snobs; and he\r\nwill do all in his might and main to be a Snob and to submit to Snobs\r\nno longer. To Longears he says, \'We can\'t help seeing, Longears, that\r\nwe are as good as you. We can spell even better; can think quite as\r\nrightly; we will not have you for our master, or black your shoes any\r\nmore. Your footmen do it, but they are paid; and the fellow who comes to\r\nget a list of the company when you give a banquet or a dancing breakfast\r\nat Longueoreille House, gets money from the newspapers for performing\r\nthat service. But for us, thank you for nothing, Longears my boy, and we\r\ndon\'t wish to pay you any more than we owe. We will take off our hats to\r\nWellington because he is Wellington; but to you--who are you?\'\r\n\r\nI am sick of COURT CIRCULARS. I loathe HAUT-TON intelligence. I believe\r\nsuch words as Fashionable, Exclusive, Aristocratic, and the like, to\r\nbe wicked, unchristian epithets, that ought to be banished from honest\r\nvocabularies. A Court system that sends men of genius to the second\r\ntable, I hold to be a Snobbish system. A society that sets up to be\r\npolite, and ignores Arts and Letters, I hold to be a Snobbish society.\r\nYou, who despise your neighbour, are a Snob; you, who forget your own\r\nfriends, meanly to follow after those of a higher degree, are a Snob;\r\nyou, who are ashamed of your poverty, and blush for your calling, are\r\na Snob; as are you who boast of your pedigree, or are proud of your\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nTo laugh at such is MR. PUNCH\'S business. May he laugh honestly, hit\r\nno foul blow, and tell the truth when at his very broadest grin--never\r\nforgetting that if Fun is good, Truth is still better, and Love best of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Book of Snobs, by William Makepeace Thackeray\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BOOK OF SNOBS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2686-8.txt or 2686-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/6/8/2686/\r\n\r\nProduced by Sean Hackett; David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
