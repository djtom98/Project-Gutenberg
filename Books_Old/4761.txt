The squeak of wheels is seldom heard in the\r\nsnow-covered street. There are no lights left in the windows and the\r\nstreet lamps have been extinguished. Only the sound of bells, borne\r\nover the city from the church towers, suggests the approach of morning.\r\nThe streets are deserted. At rare intervals a night-cabman\'s sledge\r\nkneads up the snow and sand in the street as the driver makes his way\r\nto another corner where he falls asleep while waiting for a fare. An\r\nold woman passes by on her way to church, where a few wax candles burn\r\nwith a red light reflected on the gilt mountings of the icons. Workmen\r\nare already getting up after the long winter night and going to their\r\nwork--but for the gentlefolk it is still evening.\r\n\r\nFrom a window in Chevalier\'s Restaurant a light--illegal at that\r\nhour--is still to be seen through a chink in the shutter. At the\r\nentrance a carriage, a sledge, and a cabman\'s sledge, stand close\r\ntogether with their backs to the curbstone. A three-horse sledge from\r\nthe post-station is there also. A yard-porter muffled up and pinched\r\nwith cold is sheltering behind the corner of the house.\r\n\r\n\'And what\'s the good of all this jawing?\' thinks the footman who sits\r\nin the hall weary and haggard. \'This always happens when I\'m on duty.\'\r\nFrom the adjoining room are heard the voices of three young men,\r\nsitting there at a table on which are wine and the remains of supper.\r\nOne, a rather plain, thin, neat little man, sits looking with tired\r\nkindly eyes at his friend, who is about to start on a journey. Another,\r\na tall man, lies on a sofa beside a table on which are empty bottles,\r\nand plays with his watch-key. A third, wearing a short, fur-lined coat,\r\nis pacing up and down the room stopping now and then to crack an almond\r\nbetween his strong, rather thick, but well-tended fingers. He keeps\r\nsmiling at something and his face and eyes are all aglow. He speaks\r\nwarmly and gesticulates, but evidently does not find the words he wants\r\nand those that occur to him seem to him inadequate to express what has\r\nrisen to his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Now I can speak out fully,\' said the traveller. \'I don\'t want to\r\ndefend myself, but I should like you at least to understand me as I\r\nunderstand myself, and not look at the matter superficially. You say I\r\nhave treated her badly,\' he continued, addressing the man with the\r\nkindly eyes who was watching him.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you are to blame,\' said the latter, and his look seemed to\r\nexpress still more kindliness and weariness.\r\n\r\n\'I know why you say that,\' rejoined the one who was leaving. \'To be\r\nloved is in your opinion as great a happiness as to love, and if a man\r\nobtains it, it is enough for his whole life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, quite enough, my dear fellow, more than enough!\' confirmed the\r\nplain little man, opening and shutting his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'But why shouldn\'t the man love too?\' said the traveller thoughtfully,\r\nlooking at his friend with something like pity. \'Why shouldn\'t one\r\nlove? Because love doesn\'t come ... No, to be beloved is a misfortune.\r\nIt is a misfortune to feel guilty because you do not give something you\r\ncannot give. O my God!\' he added, with a gesture of his arm. \'If it all\r\nhappened reasonably, and not all topsy-turvy--not in our way but in a\r\nway of its own! Why, it\'s as if I had stolen that love! You think so\r\ntoo, don\'t deny it. You must think so. But will you believe it, of all\r\nthe horrid and stupid things I have found time to do in my life--and\r\nthere are many--this is one I do not and cannot repent of. Neither at\r\nthe beginning nor afterwards did I lie to myself or to her. It seemed\r\nto me that I had at last fallen in love, but then I saw that it was an\r\ninvoluntary falsehood, and that that was not the way to love, and I\r\ncould not go on, but she did. Am I to blame that I couldn\'t? What was I\r\nto do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s ended now!\' said his friend, lighting a cigar to master his\r\nsleepiness. \'The fact is that you have not yet loved and do not know\r\nwhat love is.\'\r\n\r\nThe man in the fur-lined coat was going to speak again, and put his\r\nhands to his head, but could not express what he wanted to say.\r\n\r\n\'Never loved! ... Yes, quite true, I never have! But after all, I have\r\nwithin me a desire to love, and nothing could be stronger than that\r\ndesire! But then, again, does such love exist? There always remains\r\nsomething incomplete. Ah well! What\'s the use of talking? I\'ve made an\r\nawful mess of life! But anyhow it\'s all over now; you are quite right.\r\nAnd I feel that I am beginning a new life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Which you will again make a mess of,\' said the man who lay on the sofa\r\nplaying with his watch-key. But the traveller did not listen to him.\r\n\r\n\'I am sad and yet glad to go,\' he continued. \'Why I am sad I don\'t\r\nknow.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the traveller went on talking about himself, without noticing that\r\nthis did not interest the others as much as it did him. A man is never\r\nsuch an egotist as at moments of spiritual ecstasy. At such times it\r\nseems to him that there is nothing on earth more splendid and\r\ninteresting than himself.\r\n\r\n\'Dmitri Andreich! The coachman won\'t wait any longer!\' said a young\r\nserf, entering the room in a sheepskin coat, with a scarf tied round\r\nhis head. \'The horses have been standing since twelve, and it\'s now\r\nfour o\'clock!\'\r\n\r\nDmitri Andreich looked at his serf, Vanyusha. The scarf round\r\nVanyusha\'s head, his felt boots and sleepy face, seemed to be calling\r\nhis master to a new life of labour, hardship, and activity.\r\n\r\n\'True enough! Good-bye!\' said he, feeling for the unfastened hook and\r\neye on his coat.\r\n\r\nIn spite of advice to mollify the coachman by another tip, he put on\r\nhis cap and stood in the middle of the room. The friends kissed once,\r\nthen again, and after a pause, a third time. The man in the fur-lined\r\ncoat approached the table and emptied a champagne glass, then took the\r\nplain little man\'s hand and blushed.\r\n\r\n\'Ah well, I will speak out all the same ... I must and will be frank\r\nwith you because I am fond of you ... Of course you love her--I always\r\nthought so--don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' answered his friend, smiling still more gently.\r\n\r\n\'And perhaps...\'\r\n\r\n\'Please sir, I have orders to put out the candles,\' said the sleepy\r\nattendant, who had been listening to the last part of the conversation\r\nand wondering why gentlefolk always talk about one and the same thing.\r\n\'To whom shall I make out the bill? To you, sir?\' he added, knowing\r\nwhom to address and turning to the tall man.\r\n\r\n\'To me,\' replied the tall man. \'How much?\'\r\n\r\n\'Twenty-six rubles.\'\r\n\r\nThe tall man considered for a moment, but said nothing and put the bill\r\nin his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe other two continued their talk.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, you are a capital fellow!\' said the short plain man with the\r\nmild eyes. Tears filled the eyes of both. They stepped into the porch.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, by the by,\' said the traveller, turning with a blush to the tall\r\nman, \'will you settle Chevalier\'s bill and write and let me know?\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, all right!\' said the tall man, pulling on his gloves. \'How\r\nI envy you!\' he added quite unexpectedly when they were out in the\r\nporch.\r\n\r\nThe traveller got into his sledge, wrapped his coat about him, and\r\nsaid: \'Well then, come along!\' He even moved a little to make room in\r\nthe sledge for the man who said he envied him--his voice trembled.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, Mitya! I hope that with God\'s help you...\' said the tall\r\none. But his wish was that the other would go away quickly, and so he\r\ncould not finish the sentence.\r\n\r\nThey were silent a moment. Then someone again said, \'Good-bye,\' and a\r\nvoice cried, \'Ready,\' and the coachman touched up the horses.\r\n\r\n\'Hy, Elisar!\' One of the friends called out, and the other coachman and\r\nthe sledge-drivers began moving, clicking their tongues and pulling at\r\nthe reins. Then the stiffened carriage-wheels rolled squeaking over the\r\nfrozen snow.\r\n\r\n\'A fine fellow, that Olenin!\' said one of the friends. \'But what an\r\nidea to go to the Caucasus--as a cadet, too! I wouldn\'t do it for\r\nanything. ... Are you dining at the club to-morrow?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\nThey separated.\r\n\r\nThe traveller felt warm, his fur coat seemed too hot. He sat on the\r\nbottom of the sledge and unfastened his coat, and the three shaggy\r\npost-horses dragged themselves out of one dark street into another,\r\npast houses he had never before seen. It seemed to Olenin that only\r\ntravellers starting on a long journey went through those streets. All\r\nwas dark and silent and dull around him, but his soul was full of\r\nmemories, love, regrets, and a pleasant tearful feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\n\'I\'m fond of them, very fond! ... First-rate fellows! ... Fine!\' he\r\nkept repeating, and felt ready to cry. But why he wanted to cry, who\r\nwere the first-rate fellows he was so fond of--was more than he quite\r\nknew. Now and then he looked round at some house and wondered why it\r\nwas so curiously built; sometimes he began wondering why the post-boy\r\nand Vanyusha, who were so different from himself, sat so near, and\r\ntogether with him were being jerked about and swayed by the tugs the\r\nside-horses gave at the frozen traces, and again he repeated: \'First\r\nrate ... very fond!\' and once he even said: \'And how it seizes one ...\r\nexcellent!\' and wondered what made him say it. \'Dear me, am I drunk?\'\r\nhe asked himself. He had had a couple of bottles of wine, but it was\r\nnot the wine alone that was having this effect on Olenin. He remembered\r\nall the words of friendship heartily, bashfully, spontaneously (as he\r\nbelieved) addressed to him on his departure. He remembered the clasp of\r\nhands, glances, the moments of silence, and the sound of a voice\r\nsaying, \'Good-bye, Mitya!\' when he was already in the sledge. He\r\nremembered his own deliberate frankness. And all this had a touching\r\nsignificance for him. Not only friends and relatives, not only people\r\nwho had been indifferent to him, but even those who did not like him,\r\nseemed to have agreed to become fonder of him, or to forgive him,\r\nbefore his departure, as people do before confession or death. \'Perhaps\r\nI shall not return from the Caucasus,\' he thought. And he felt that he\r\nloved his friends and some one besides. He was sorry for himself. But\r\nit was not love for his friends that so stirred and uplifted his heart\r\nthat he could not repress the meaningless words that seemed to rise of\r\nthemselves to his lips; nor was it love for a woman (he had never yet\r\nbeen in love) that had brought on this mood. Love for himself, love\r\nfull of hope--warm young love for all that was good in his own soul\r\n(and at that moment it seemed to him that there was nothing but good in\r\nit)--compelled him to weep and to mutter incoherent words.\r\n\r\nOlenin was a youth who had never completed his university course, never\r\nserved anywhere (having only a nominal post in some government office\r\nor other), who had squandered half his fortune and had reached the age\r\nof twenty-four without having done anything or even chosen a career. He\r\nwas what in Moscow society is termed un jeune homme.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen he was free--as only rich young Russians in the\r\n\'forties who had lost their parents at an early age could be. Neither\r\nphysical nor moral fetters of any kind existed for him; he could do as\r\nhe liked, lacking nothing and bound by nothing. Neither relatives, nor\r\nfatherland, nor religion, nor wants, existed for him. He believed in\r\nnothing and admitted nothing. But although he believed in nothing he\r\nwas not a morose or blase young man, nor self-opinionated, but on the\r\ncontrary continually let himself be carried away. He had come to the\r\nconclusion that there is no such thing as love, yet his heart always\r\noverflowed in the presence of any young and attractive woman. He had\r\nlong been aware that honours and position were nonsense, yet\r\ninvoluntarily he felt pleased when at a ball Prince Sergius came up and\r\nspoke to him affably. But he yielded to his impulses only in so far as\r\nthey did not limit his freedom. As soon as he had yielded to any\r\ninfluence and became conscious of its leading on to labour and\r\nstruggle, he instinctively hastened to free himself from the feeling or\r\nactivity into which he was being drawn and to regain his freedom. In\r\nthis way he experimented with society-life, the civil service, farming,\r\nmusic--to which at one time he intended to devote his life--and even\r\nwith the love of women in which he did not believe. He meditated on the\r\nuse to which he should devote that power of youth which is granted to\r\nman only once in a lifetime: that force which gives a man the power of\r\nmaking himself, or even--as it seemed to him--of making the universe,\r\ninto anything he wishes: should it be to art, to science, to love of\r\nwoman, or to practical activities? It is true that some people are\r\ndevoid of this impulse, and on entering life at once place their necks\r\nunder the first yoke that offers itself and honestly labour under it\r\nfor the rest of their lives. But Olenin was too strongly conscious of\r\nthe presence of that all-powerful God of Youth--of that capacity to be\r\nentirely transformed into an aspiration or idea--the capacity to wish\r\nand to do--to throw oneself headlong into a bottomless abyss without\r\nknowing why or wherefore. He bore this consciousness within himself,\r\nwas proud of it and, without knowing it, was happy in that\r\nconsciousness. Up to that time he had loved only himself, and could not\r\nhelp loving himself, for he expected nothing but good of himself and\r\nhad not yet had time to be disillusioned. On leaving Moscow he was in\r\nthat happy state of mind in which a young man, conscious of past\r\nmistakes, suddenly says to himself, \'That was not the real thing.\' All\r\nthat had gone before was accidental and unimportant. Till then he had\r\nnot really tried to live, but now with his departure from Moscow a new\r\nlife was beginning--a life in which there would be no mistakes, no\r\nremorse, and certainly nothing but happiness.\r\n\r\nIt is always the case on a long journey that till the first two or\r\nthree stages have been passed imagination continues to dwell on the\r\nplace left behind, but with the first morning on the road it leaps to\r\nthe end of the journey and there begins building castles in the air. So\r\nit happened to Olenin.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the town behind, he gazed at the snowy fields and felt\r\nglad to be alone in their midst. Wrapping himself in his fur coat, he\r\nlay at the bottom of the sledge, became tranquil, and fell into a doze.\r\nThe parting with his friends had touched him deeply, and memories of\r\nthat last winter spent in Moscow and images of the past, mingled with\r\nvague thoughts and regrets, rose unbidden in his imagination.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the friend who had seen him off and his relations with\r\nthe girl they had talked about. The girl was rich. "How could he love\r\nher knowing that she loved me?" thought he, and evil suspicions crossed\r\nhis mind. "There is much dishonesty in men when one comes to reflect."\r\nThen he was confronted by the question: "But really, how is it I have\r\nnever been in love? Every one tells me that I never have. Can it be\r\nthat I am a moral monstrosity?" And he began to recall all his\r\ninfatuations. He recalled his entry into society, and a friend\'s sister\r\nwith whom he spent several evenings at a table with a lamp on it which\r\nlit up her slender fingers busy with needlework, and the lower part of\r\nher pretty delicate face. He recalled their conversations that dragged\r\non like the game in which one passes on a stick which one keeps alight\r\nas long as possible, and the general awkwardness and restraint and his\r\ncontinual feeling of rebellion at all that conventionality. Some voice\r\nhad always whispered: "That\'s not it, that\'s not it," and so it had\r\nproved. Then he remembered a ball and the mazurka he danced with the\r\nbeautiful D----. "How much in love I was that night and how happy! And\r\nhow hurt and vexed I was next morning when I woke and felt myself still\r\nfree! Why does not love come and bind me hand and foot?" thought he.\r\n"No, there is no such thing as love! That neighbour who used to tell\r\nme, as she told Dubrovin and the Marshal, that she loved the stars, was\r\nnot IT either." And now his farming and work in the country recurred to\r\nhis mind, and in those recollections also there was nothing to dwell on\r\nwith pleasure. "Will they talk long of my departure?" came into his\r\nhead; but who "they" were he did not quite know. Next came a thought\r\nthat made him wince and mutter incoherently. It was the recollection of\r\nM. Cappele the tailor, and the six hundred and seventy-eight rubles he\r\nstill owed him, and he recalled the words in which he had begged him to\r\nwait another year, and the look of perplexity and resignation which had\r\nappeared on the tailor\'s face. \'Oh, my God, my God!\' he repeated,\r\nwincing and trying to drive away the intolerable thought. \'All the same\r\nand in spite of everything she loved me,\' thought he of the girl they\r\nhad talked about at the farewell supper. \'Yes, had I married her I\r\nshould not now be owing anything, and as it is I am in debt to\r\nVasilyev.\' Then he remembered the last night he had played with\r\nVasilyev at the club (just after leaving her), and he recalled his\r\nhumiliating requests for another game and the other\'s cold refusal. \'A\r\nyear\'s economizing and they will all be paid, and the devil take\r\nthem!\'... But despite this assurance he again began calculating his\r\noutstanding debts, their dates, and when he could hope to pay them off.\r\n\'And I owe something to Morell as well as to Chevalier,\' thought he,\r\nrecalling the night when he had run up so large a debt. It was at a\r\ncarousel at the gipsies arranged by some fellows from Petersburg:\r\nSashka B---, an aide-de-camp to the Tsar, Prince D---, and that pompous\r\nold----. \'How is it those gentlemen are so self-satisfied?\' thought he,\r\n\'and by what right do they form a clique to which they think others\r\nmust be highly flattered to be admitted? Can it be because they are on\r\nthe Emperor\'s staff? Why, it\'s awful what fools and scoundrels they\r\nconsider other people to be! But I showed them that I at any rate, on\r\nthe contrary, do not at all want their intimacy. All the same, I fancy\r\nAndrew, the steward, would be amazed to know that I am on familiar\r\nterms with a man like Sashka B---, a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the\r\nTsar! Yes, and no one drank more than I did that evening, and I taught\r\nthe gipsies a new song and everyone listened to it. Though I have done\r\nmany foolish things, all the same I am a very good fellow,\' thought he.\r\n\r\nMorning found him at the third post-stage. He drank tea, and himself\r\nhelped Vanyusha to move his bundles and trunks and sat down among them,\r\nsensible, erect, and precise, knowing where all his belongings were,\r\nhow much money he had and where it was, where he had put his passport\r\nand the post-horse requisition and toll-gate papers, and it all seemed\r\nto him so well arranged that he grew quite cheerful and the long\r\njourney before him seemed an extended pleasure-trip.\r\n\r\nAll that morning and noon he was deep in calculations of how many\r\nversts he had travelled, how many remained to the next stage, how many\r\nto the next town, to the place where he would dine, to the place where\r\nhe would drink tea, and to Stavropol, and what fraction of the whole\r\njourney was already accomplished. He also calculated how much money he\r\nhad with him, how much would be left over, how much would pay off all\r\nhis debts, and what proportion of his income he would spend each month.\r\nTowards evening, after tea, he calculated that to Stavropol there still\r\nremained seven-elevenths of the whole journey, that his debts would\r\nrequire seven months\' economy and one-eighth of his whole fortune; and\r\nthen, tranquillized, he wrapped himself up, lay down in the sledge, and\r\nagain dozed off. His imagination was now turned to the future: to the\r\nCaucasus. All his dreams of the future were mingled with pictures of\r\nAmalat-Beks, Circassian women, mountains, precipices, terrible\r\ntorrents, and perils. All these things were vague and dim, but the love\r\nof fame and the danger of death furnished the interest of that future.\r\nNow, with unprecedented courage and a strength that amazed everyone, he\r\nslew and subdued an innumerable host of hillsmen; now he was himself a\r\nhillsman and with them was maintaining their independence against the\r\nRussians. As soon as he pictured anything definite, familiar Moscow\r\nfigures always appeared on the scene. Sashka B---fights with the\r\nRussians or the hillsmen against him. Even the tailor Cappele in some\r\nstrange way takes part in the conqueror\'s triumph. Amid all this he\r\nremembered his former humiliations, weaknesses, and mistakes, and the\r\nrecollection was not disagreeable. It was clear that there among the\r\nmountains, waterfalls, fair Circassians, and dangers, such mistakes\r\ncould not recur. Having once made full confession to himself there was\r\nan end of it all. One other vision, the sweetest of them all, mingled\r\nwith the young man\'s every thought of the future--the vision of a woman.\r\n\r\nAnd there, among the mountains, she appeared to his imagination as a\r\nCircassian slave, a fine figure with a long plait of hair and deep\r\nsubmissive eyes. He pictured a lonely hut in the mountains, and on the\r\nthreshold she stands awaiting him when, tired and covered with dust,\r\nblood, and fame, he returns to her. He is conscious of her kisses, her\r\nshoulders, her sweet voice, and her submissiveness. She is enchanting,\r\nbut uneducated, wild, and rough. In the long winter evenings he begins\r\nher education. She is clever and gifted and quickly acquires all the\r\nknowledge essential. Why not? She can quite easily learn foreign\r\nlanguages, read the French masterpieces and understand them: Notre Dame\r\nde Paris, for instance, is sure to please her. She can also speak\r\nFrench. In a drawing-room she can show more innate dignity than a lady\r\nof the highest society. She can sing, simply, powerfully, and\r\npassionately.... \'Oh, what nonsense!\' said he to himself. But here they\r\nreached a post-station and he had to change into another sledge and\r\ngive some tips. But his fancy again began searching for the \'nonsense\'\r\nhe had relinquished, and again fair Circassians, glory, and his return\r\nto Russia with an appointment as aide-de-camp and a lovely wife rose\r\nbefore his imagination. \'But there\'s no such thing as love,\' said he to\r\nhimself. \'Fame is all rubbish. But the six hundred and seventy-eight\r\nrubles? ... And the conquered land that will bring me more wealth than\r\nI need for a lifetime? It will not be right though to keep all that\r\nwealth for myself. I shall have to distribute it. But to whom? Well,\r\nsix hundred and seventy-eight rubles to Cappele and then we\'ll see.\'\r\n... Quite vague visions now cloud his mind, and only Vanyusha\'s voice\r\nand the interrupted motion of the sledge break his healthy youthful\r\nslumber. Scarcely conscious, he changes into another sledge at the next\r\nstage and continues his journey.\r\n\r\nNext morning everything goes on just the same: the same kind of\r\npost-stations and tea-drinking, the same moving horses\' cruppers, the\r\nsame short talks with Vanyusha, the same vague dreams and drowsiness,\r\nand the same tired, healthy, youthful sleep at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farther Olenin travelled from Central Russia the farther he left\r\nhis memories behind, and the nearer he drew to the Caucasus the lighter\r\nhis heart became. "I\'ll stay away for good and never return to show\r\nmyself in society," was a thought that sometimes occurred to him.\r\n"These people whom I see here are NOT people. None of them know me and\r\nnone of them can ever enter the Moscow society I was in or find out\r\nabout my past. And no one in that society will ever know what I am\r\ndoing, living among these people." And quite a new feeling of freedom\r\nfrom his whole past came over him among the rough beings he met on the\r\nroad whom he did not consider to be PEOPLE in the sense that his Moscow\r\nacquaintances were. The rougher the people and the fewer the signs of\r\ncivilization the freer he felt. Stavropol, through which he had to\r\npass, irked him. The signboards, some of them even in French, ladies in\r\ncarriages, cabs in the marketplace, and a gentleman wearing a fur cloak\r\nand tall hat who was walking along the boulevard and staring at the\r\npassersby, quite upset him. "Perhaps these people know some of my\r\nacquaintances," he thought; and the club, his tailor, cards, society\r\n... came back to his mind. But after Stavropol everything was\r\nsatisfactory--wild and also beautiful and warlike, and Olenin felt\r\nhappier and happier. All the Cossacks, post-boys, and post-station\r\nmasters seemed to him simple folk with whom he could jest and converse\r\nsimply, without having to consider to what class they belonged. They\r\nall belonged to the human race which, without his thinking about it,\r\nall appeared dear to Olenin, and they all treated him in a friendly way.\r\n\r\nAlready in the province of the Don Cossacks his sledge had been\r\nexchanged for a cart, and beyond Stavropol it became so warm that\r\nOlenin travelled without wearing his fur coat. It was already\r\nspring--an unexpected joyous spring for Olenin. At night he was no\r\nlonger allowed to leave the Cossack villages, and they said it was\r\ndangerous to travel in the evening. Vanyusha began to be uneasy, and\r\nthey carried a loaded gun in the cart. Olenin became still happier. At\r\none of the post-stations the post-master told of a terrible murder that\r\nhad been committed recently on the high road. They began to meet armed\r\nmen. "So this is where it begins!" thought Olenin, and kept expecting\r\nto see the snowy mountains of which mention was so often made. Once,\r\ntowards evening, the Nogay driver pointed with his whip to the\r\nmountains shrouded in clouds. Olenin looked eagerly, but it was dull\r\nand the mountains were almost hidden by the clouds. Olenin made out\r\nsomething grey and white and fleecy, but try as he would he could find\r\nnothing beautiful in the mountains of which he had so often read and\r\nheard. The mountains and the clouds appeared to him quite alike, and he\r\nthought the special beauty of the snow peaks, of which he had so often\r\nbeen told, was as much an invention as Bach\'s music and the love of\r\nwomen, in which he did not believe. So he gave up looking forward to\r\nseeing the mountains. But early next morning, being awakened in his\r\ncart by the freshness of the air, he glanced carelessly to the right.\r\nThe morning was perfectly clear. Suddenly he saw, about twenty paces\r\naway as it seemed to him at first glance, pure white gigantic masses\r\nwith delicate contours, the distinct fantastic outlines of their\r\nsummits showing sharply against the far-off sky. When he had realized\r\nthe distance between himself and them and the sky and the whole\r\nimmensity of the mountains, and felt the infinitude of all that beauty,\r\nhe became afraid that it was but a phantasm or a dream. He gave himself\r\na shake to rouse himself, but the mountains were still the same.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that! What is it?" he said to the driver.\r\n\r\n"Why, the mountains," answered the Nogay driver with indifference.\r\n\r\n"And I too have been looking at them for a long while," said Vanyusha.\r\n"Aren\'t they fine? They won\'t believe it at home."\r\n\r\nThe quick progress of the three-horsed cart along the smooth road\r\ncaused the mountains to appear to be running along the horizon, while\r\ntheir rosy crests glittered in the light of the rising sun. At first\r\nOlenin was only astonished at the sight, then gladdened by it; but\r\nlater on, gazing more and more intently at that snow-peaked chain that\r\nseemed to rise not from among other black mountains, but straight out\r\nof the plain, and to glide away into the distance, he began by slow\r\ndegrees to be penetrated by their beauty and at length to FEEL the\r\nmountains. From that moment all he saw, all he thought, and all he\r\nfelt, acquired for him a new character, sternly majestic like the\r\nmountains! All his Moscow reminiscences, shame, and repentance, and his\r\ntrivial dreams about the Caucasus, vanished and did not return. \'Now it\r\nhas begun,\' a solemn voice seemed to say to him. The road and the\r\nTerek, just becoming visible in the distance, and the Cossack villages\r\nand the people, all no longer appeared to him as a joke. He looked at\r\nhimself or Vanyusha, and again thought of the mountains. ... Two\r\nCossacks ride by, their guns in their cases swinging rhythmically\r\nbehind their backs, the white and bay legs of their horses mingling\r\nconfusedly ... and the mountains! Beyond the Terek rises the smoke from\r\na Tartar village... and the mountains! The sun has risen and glitters\r\non the Terek, now visible beyond the reeds ... and the mountains! From\r\nthe village comes a Tartar wagon, and women, beautiful young women,\r\npass by... and the mountains! \'Abreks canter about the plain, and here\r\nam I driving along and do not fear them! I have a gun, and strength,\r\nand youth... and the mountains!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThat whole part of the Terek line (about fifty miles) along which lie\r\nthe villages of the Grebensk Cossacks is uniform in character both as\r\nto country and inhabitants. The Terek, which separates the Cossacks\r\nfrom the mountaineers, still flows turbid and rapid though already\r\nbroad and smooth, always depositing greyish sand on its low reedy right\r\nbank and washing away the steep, though not high, left bank, with its\r\nroots of century-old oaks, its rotting plane trees, and young\r\nbrushwood. On the right bank lie the villages of pro-Russian, though\r\nstill somewhat restless, Tartars. Along the left bank, back half a mile\r\nfrom the river and standing five or six miles apart from one another,\r\nare Cossack villages. In olden times most of these villages were\r\nsituated on the banks of the river; but the Terek, shifting northward\r\nfrom the mountains year by year, washed away those banks, and now there\r\nremain only the ruins of the old villages and of the gardens of pear\r\nand plum trees and poplars, all overgrown with blackberry bushes and\r\nwild vines. No one lives there now, and one only sees the tracks of the\r\ndeer, the wolves, the hares, and the pheasants, who have learned to\r\nlove these places. From village to village runs a road cut through the\r\nforest as a cannon-shot might fly. Along the roads are cordons of\r\nCossacks and watch-towers with sentinels in them. Only a narrow strip\r\nabout seven hundred yards wide of fertile wooded soil belongs to the\r\nCossacks. To the north of it begin the sand-drifts of the Nogay or\r\nMozdok steppes, which fetch far to the north and run, Heaven knows\r\nwhere, into the Trukhmen, Astrakhan, and Kirghiz-Kaisatsk steppes. To\r\nthe south, beyond the Terek, are the Great Chechnya river, the\r\nKochkalov range, the Black Mountains, yet another range, and at last\r\nthe snowy mountains, which can just be seen but have never yet been\r\nscaled. In this fertile wooded strip, rich in vegetation, has dwelt as\r\nfar back as memory runs the fine warlike and prosperous Russian tribe\r\nbelonging to the sect of Old Believers, and called the Grebensk\r\nCossacks.\r\n\r\nLong long ago their Old Believer ancestors fled from Russia and settled\r\nbeyond the Terek among the Chechens on the Greben, the first range of\r\nwooded mountains of Chechnya. Living among the Chechens the Cossacks\r\nintermarried with them and adopted the manners and customs of the hill\r\ntribes, though they still retained the Russian language in all its\r\npurity, as well as their Old Faith. A tradition, still fresh among\r\nthem, declares that Tsar Ivan the Terrible came to the Terek, sent for\r\ntheir Elders, and gave them the land on this side of the river,\r\nexhorting them to remain friendly to Russia and promising not to\r\nenforce his rule upon them nor oblige them to change their faith. Even\r\nnow the Cossack families claim relationship with the Chechens, and the\r\nlove of freedom, of leisure, of plunder and of war, still form their\r\nchief characteristics. Only the harmful side of Russian influence shows\r\nitself--by interference at elections, by confiscation of church bells,\r\nand by the troops who are quartered in the country or march through it.\r\nA Cossack is inclined to hate less the dzhigit hillsman who maybe has\r\nkilled his brother, than the soldier quartered on him to defend his\r\nvillage, but who has defiled his hut with tobacco-smoke. He respects\r\nhis enemy the hillsman and despises the soldier, who is in his eyes an\r\nalien and an oppressor. In reality, from a Cossack\'s point of view a\r\nRussian peasant is a foreign, savage, despicable creature, of whom he\r\nsees a sample in the hawkers who come to the country and in the\r\nUkrainian immigrants whom the Cossack contemptuously calls\r\n\'woolbeaters\'. For him, to be smartly dressed means to be dressed like\r\na Circassian. The best weapons are obtained from the hillsmen and the\r\nbest horses are bought, or stolen, from them. A dashing young Cossack\r\nlikes to show off his knowledge of Tartar, and when carousing talks\r\nTartar even to his fellow Cossack. In spite of all these things this\r\nsmall Christian clan stranded in a tiny corner of the earth, surrounded\r\nby half-savage Mohammedan tribes and by soldiers, considers itself\r\nhighly advanced, acknowledges none but Cossacks as human beings, and\r\ndespises everybody else. The Cossack spends most of his time in the\r\ncordon, in action, or in hunting and fishing. He hardly ever works at\r\nhome. When he stays in the village it is an exception to the general\r\nrule and then he is holiday-making. All Cossacks make their own wine,\r\nand drunkenness is not so much a general tendency as a rite, the\r\nnon-fulfilment of which would be considered apostasy. The Cossack looks\r\nupon a woman as an instrument for his welfare; only the unmarried girls\r\nare allowed to amuse themselves. A married woman has to work for her\r\nhusband from youth to very old age: his demands on her are the Oriental\r\nones of submission and labour. In consequence of this outlook women are\r\nstrongly developed both physically and mentally, and though they\r\nare--as everywhere in the East--nominally in subjection, they possess\r\nfar greater influence and importance in family-life than Western women.\r\nTheir exclusion from public life and inurement to heavy male labour\r\ngive the women all the more power and importance in the household. A\r\nCossack, who before strangers considers it improper to speak\r\naffectionately or needlessly to his wife, when alone with her is\r\ninvoluntarily conscious of her superiority. His house and all his\r\nproperty, in fact the entire homestead, has been acquired and is kept\r\ntogether solely by her labour and care. Though firmly convinced that\r\nlabour is degrading to a Cossack and is only proper for a Nogay\r\nlabourer or a woman, he is vaguely aware of the fact that all he makes\r\nuse of and calls his own is the result of that toil, and that it is in\r\nthe power of the woman (his mother or his wife) whom he considers his\r\nslave, to deprive him of all he possesses. Besides, the continuous\r\nperformance of man\'s heavy work and the responsibilities entrusted to\r\nher have endowed the Grebensk women with a peculiarly independent\r\nmasculine character and have remarkably developed their physical\r\npowers, common sense, resolution, and stability. The women are in most\r\ncases stronger, more intelligent, more developed, and handsomer than\r\nthe men. A striking feature of a Grebensk woman\'s beauty is the\r\ncombination of the purest Circassian type of face with the broad and\r\npowerful build of Northern women. Cossack women wear the Circassian\r\ndress--a Tartar smock, beshmet, and soft slippers--but they tie their\r\nkerchiefs round their heads in the Russian fashion. Smartness,\r\ncleanliness and elegance in dress and in the arrangement of their huts,\r\nare with them a custom and a necessity. In their relations with men the\r\nwomen, and especially the unmarried girls, enjoy perfect freedom.\r\n\r\nNovomlinsk village was considered the very heart of Grebensk\r\nCossackdom. In it more than elsewhere the customs of the old Grebensk\r\npopulation have been preserved, and its women have from time immemorial\r\nbeen renowned all over the Caucasus for their beauty. A Cossack\'s\r\nlivelihood is derived from vineyards, fruit-gardens, water melon and\r\npumpkin plantations, from fishing, hunting, maize and millet growing,\r\nand from war plunder. Novomlinsk village lies about two and a half\r\nmiles away from the Terek, from which it is separated by a dense\r\nforest. On one side of the road which runs through the village is the\r\nriver; on the other, green vineyards and orchards, beyond which are\r\nseen the driftsands of the Nogay Steppe. The village is surrounded by\r\nearth-banks and prickly bramble hedges, and is entered by tall gates\r\nhung between posts and covered with little reed-thatched roofs. Beside\r\nthem on a wooden gun-carriage stands an unwieldy cannon captured by the\r\nCossacks at some time or other, and which has not been fired for a\r\nhundred years. A uniformed Cossack sentinel with dagger and gun\r\nsometimes stands, and sometimes does not stand, on guard beside the\r\ngates, and sometimes presents arms to a passing officer and sometimes\r\ndoes not. Below the roof of the gateway is written in black letters on\r\na white board: \'Houses 266: male inhabitants 897: female 1012.\' The\r\nCossacks\' houses are all raised on pillars two and a half feet from the\r\nground. They are carefully thatched with reeds and have large carved\r\ngables. If not new they are at least all straight and clean, with high\r\nporches of different shapes; and they are not built close together but\r\nhave ample space around them, and are all picturesquely placed along\r\nbroad streets and lanes. In front of the large bright windows of many\r\nof the houses, beyond the kitchen gardens, dark green poplars and\r\nacacias with their delicate pale verdure and scented white blossoms\r\novertop the houses, and beside them grow flaunting yellow sunflowers,\r\ncreepers, and grape vines. In the broad open square are three shops\r\nwhere drapery, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, locust beans and\r\ngingerbreads are sold; and surrounded by a tall fence, loftier and\r\nlarger than the other houses, stands the Regimental Commander\'s\r\ndwelling with its casement windows, behind a row of tall poplars. Few\r\npeople are to be seen in the streets of the village on weekdays,\r\nespecially in summer. The young men are on duty in the cordons or on\r\nmilitary expeditions; the old ones are fishing or helping the women in\r\nthe orchards and gardens. Only the very old, the sick, and the\r\nchildren, remain at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those wonderful evenings that occur only in the Caucasus.\r\nThe sun had sunk behind the mountains but it was still light. The\r\nevening glow had spread over a third of the sky, and against its\r\nbrilliancy the dull white immensity of the mountains was sharply\r\ndefined. The air was rarefied, motionless, and full of sound. The\r\nshadow of the mountains reached for several miles over the steppe. The\r\nsteppe, the opposite side of the river, and the roads, were all\r\ndeserted. If very occasionally mounted men appeared, the Cossacks in\r\nthe cordon and the Chechens in their aouls (villages) watched them with\r\nsurprised curiosity and tried to guess who those questionable men could\r\nbe. At nightfall people from fear of one another flock to their\r\ndwellings, and only birds and beasts fearless of man prowl in those\r\ndeserted spaces. Talking merrily, the women who have been tying up the\r\nvines hurry away from the gardens before sunset. The vineyards, like\r\nall the surrounding district, are deserted, but the villages become\r\nvery animated at that time of the evening. From all sides, walking,\r\nriding, or driving in their creaking carts, people move towards the\r\nvillage. Girls with their smocks tucked up and twigs in their hands run\r\nchatting merrily to the village gates to meet the cattle that are\r\ncrowding together in a cloud of dust and mosquitoes which they bring\r\nwith them from the steppe. The well-fed cows and buffaloes disperse at\r\na run all over the streets and Cossack women in coloured beshmets go to\r\nand fro among them. You can hear their merry laughter and shrieks\r\nmingling with the lowing of the cattle. There an armed and mounted\r\nCossack, on leave from the cordon, rides up to a hut and, leaning\r\ntowards the window, knocks. In answer to the knock the handsome head of\r\na young woman appears at the window and you can hear caressing,\r\nlaughing voices. There a tattered Nogay labourer, with prominent\r\ncheekbones, brings a load of reeds from the steppes, turns his creaking\r\ncart into the Cossack captain\'s broad and clean courtyard, and lifts\r\nthe yoke off the oxen that stand tossing their heads while he and his\r\nmaster shout to one another in Tartar. Past a puddle that reaches\r\nnearly across the street, a barefooted Cossack woman with a bundle of\r\nfirewood on her back makes her laborious way by clinging to the fences,\r\nholding her smock high and exposing her white legs. A Cossack returning\r\nfrom shooting calls out in jest: \'Lift it higher, shameless thing!\' and\r\npoints his gun at her. The woman lets down her smock and drops the\r\nwood. An old Cossack, returning home from fishing with his trousers\r\ntucked up and his hairy grey chest uncovered, has a net across his\r\nshoulder containing silvery fish that are still struggling; and to take\r\na short cut climbs over his neighbour\'s broken fence and gives a tug to\r\nhis coat which has caught on the fence. There a woman is dragging a dry\r\nbranch along and from round the corner comes the sound of an axe.\r\nCossack children, spinning their tops wherever there is a smooth place\r\nin the street, are shrieking; women are climbing over fences to avoid\r\ngoing round. From every chimney rises the odorous kisyak smoke. From\r\nevery homestead comes the sound of increased bustle, precursor to the\r\nstillness of night.\r\n\r\nGranny Ulitka, the wife of the Cossack cornet who is also teacher in\r\nthe regimental school, goes out to the gates of her yard like the other\r\nwomen, and waits for the cattle which her daughter Maryanka is driving\r\nalong the street. Before she has had time fully to open the wattle gate\r\nin the fence, an enormous buffalo cow surrounded by mosquitoes rushes\r\nup bellowing and squeezes in. Several well-fed cows slowly follow her,\r\ntheir large eyes gazing with recognition at their mistress as they\r\nswish their sides with their tails. The beautiful and shapely Maryanka\r\nenters at the gate and throwing away her switch quickly slams the gate\r\nto and rushes with all the speed of her nimble feet to separate and\r\ndrive the cattle into their sheds. \'Take off your slippers, you devil\'s\r\nwench!\' shouts her mother, \'you\'ve worn them into holes!\' Maryanka is\r\nnot at all offended at being called a \'devil\'s wench\', but accepting it\r\nas a term of endearment cheerfully goes on with her task. Her face is\r\ncovered with a kerchief tied round her head. She is wearing a pink\r\nsmock and a green beshmet. She disappears inside the lean-to shed in\r\nthe yard, following the big fat cattle; and from the shed comes her\r\nvoice as she speaks gently and persuasively to the buffalo: \'Won\'t she\r\nstand still? What a creature! Come now, come old dear!\' Soon the girl\r\nand the old woman pass from the shed to the dairy carrying two large\r\npots of milk, the day\'s yield. From the dairy chimney rises a thin\r\ncloud of kisyak smoke: the milk is being used to make into clotted\r\ncream. The girl makes up the fire while her mother goes to the gate.\r\nTwilight has fallen on the village. The air is full of the smell of\r\nvegetables, cattle, and scented kisyak smoke. From the gates and along\r\nthe streets Cossack women come running, carrying lighted rags. From the\r\nyards one hears the snorting and quiet chewing of the cattle eased of\r\ntheir milk, while in the street only the voices of women and children\r\nsound as they call to one another. It is rare on a week-day to hear the\r\ndrunken voice of a man.\r\n\r\nOne of the Cossack wives, a tall, masculine old woman, approaches\r\nGranny Ulitka from the homestead opposite and asks her for a light. In\r\nher hand she holds a rag.\r\n\r\n\'Have you cleared up. Granny?\'\r\n\r\n\'The girl is lighting the fire. Is it fire you want?\' says Granny\r\nUlitka, proud of being able to oblige her neighbour.\r\n\r\nBoth women enter the hut, and coarse hands unused to dealing with small\r\narticles tremblingly lift the lid of a matchbox, which is a rarity in\r\nthe Caucasus. The masculine-looking new-comer sits down on the doorstep\r\nwith the evident intention of having a chat.\r\n\r\n\'And is your man at the school. Mother?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s always teaching the youngsters. Mother. But he writes that he\'ll\r\ncome home for the holidays,\' said the cornet\'s wife.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he\'s a clever man, one sees; it all comes useful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course it does.\'\r\n\r\n\'And my Lukashka is at the cordon; they won\'t let him come home,\' said\r\nthe visitor, though the cornet\'s wife had known all this long ago. She\r\nwanted to talk about her Lukashka whom she had lately fitted out for\r\nservice in the Cossack regiment, and whom she wished to marry to the\r\ncornet\'s daughter, Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'So he\'s at the cordon?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is. Mother. He\'s not been home since last holidays. The other day I\r\nsent him some shirts by Fomushkin. He says he\'s all right, and that his\r\nsuperiors are satisfied. He says they are looking out for abreks again.\r\nLukashka is quite happy, he says.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah well, thank God,\' said the cornet\'s wife.\' "Snatcher" is certainly\r\nthe only word for him.\' Lukashka was surnamed \'the Snatcher\' because of\r\nhis bravery in snatching a boy from a watery grave, and the cornet\'s\r\nwife alluded to this, wishing in her turn to say something agreeable to\r\nLukashka\'s mother.\r\n\r\n\'I thank God, Mother, that he\'s a good son! He\'s a fine fellow,\r\neveryone praises him,\' says Lukashka\'s mother. \'All I wish is to get\r\nhim married; then I could die in peace.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, aren\'t there plenty of young women in the village?\' answered the\r\ncornet\'s wife slyly as she carefully replaced the lid of the matchbox\r\nwith her horny hands.\r\n\r\n\'Plenty, Mother, plenty,\' remarked Lukashka\'s mother, shaking her head.\r\n\'There\'s your girl now, your Maryanka--that\'s the sort of girl! You\'d\r\nhave to search through the whole place to find such another!\' The\r\ncornet\'s wife knows what Lukashka\'s mother is after, but though she\r\nbelieves him to be a good Cossack she hangs back: first because she is\r\na cornet\'s wife and rich, while Lukashka is the son of a simple Cossack\r\nand fatherless, secondly because she does not want to part with her\r\ndaughter yet, but chiefly because propriety demands it.\r\n\r\n\'Well, when Maryanka grows up she\'ll be marriageable too,\' she answers\r\nsoberly and modestly.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll send the matchmakers to you--I\'ll send them! Only let me get the\r\nvineyard done and then we\'ll come and make our bows to you,\' says\r\nLukashka\'s mother. \'And we\'ll make our bows to Elias Vasilich too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Elias, indeed!\' says the cornet\'s wife proudly. \'It\'s to me you must\r\nspeak! All in its own good time.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka\'s mother sees by the stern face of the cornet\'s wife that it\r\nis not the time to say anything more just now, so she lights her rag\r\nwith the match and says, rising: \'Don\'t refuse us, think of my words.\r\nI\'ll go, it is time to light the fire.\'\r\n\r\nAs she crosses the road swinging the burning rag, she meets Maryanka,\r\nwho bows.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, she\'s a regular queen, a splendid worker, that girl!\' she thinks,\r\nlooking at the beautiful maiden. \'What need for her to grow any more?\r\nIt\'s time she was married and to a good home; married to Lukashka!\'\r\n\r\nBut Granny Ulitka had her own cares and she remained sitting on the\r\nthreshold thinking hard about something, till the girl called her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe male population of the village spend their time on military\r\nexpeditions and in the cordon--or \'at their posts\', as the Cossacks\r\nsay. Towards evening, that same Lukashka the Snatcher, about whom the\r\nold women had been talking, was standing on a watch-tower of the\r\nNizhni-Prototsk post situated on the very banks of the Terek. Leaning\r\non the railing of the tower and screwing up his eyes, he looked now far\r\ninto the distance beyond the Terek, now down at his fellow Cossacks,\r\nand occasionally he addressed the latter. The sun was already\r\napproaching the snowy range that gleamed white above the fleecy clouds.\r\nThe clouds undulating at the base of the mountains grew darker and\r\ndarker. The clearness of evening was noticeable in the air. A sense of\r\nfreshness came from the woods, though round the post it was still hot.\r\nThe voices of the talking Cossacks vibrated more sonorously than\r\nbefore. The moving mass of the Terek\'s rapid brown waters contrasted\r\nmore vividly with its motionless banks. The waters were beginning to\r\nsubside and here and there the wet sands gleamed drab on the banks and\r\nin the shallows. The other side of the river, just opposite the cordon,\r\nwas deserted; only an immense waste of low-growing reeds stretched far\r\naway to the very foot of the mountains. On the low bank, a little to\r\none side, could be seen the flat-roofed clay houses and the\r\nfunnel-shaped chimneys of a Chechen village. The sharp eyes of the\r\nCossack who stood on the watch-tower followed, through the evening\r\nsmoke of the pro-Russian village, the tiny moving figures of the\r\nChechen women visible in the distance in their red and blue garments.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Cossacks expected abreks to cross over and attack them\r\nfrom the Tartar side at any moment, especially as it was May when the\r\nwoods by the Terek are so dense that it is difficult to pass through\r\nthem on foot and the river is shallow enough in places for a horseman\r\nto ford it, and despite the fact that a couple of days before a Cossack\r\nhad arrived with a circular from the commander of the regiment\r\nannouncing that spies had reported the intention of a party of some\r\neight men to cross the Terek, and ordering special vigilance--no\r\nspecial vigilance was being observed in the cordon. The Cossacks,\r\nunarmed and with their horses unsaddled just as if they were at home,\r\nspent their time some in fishing, some in drinking, and some in\r\nhunting. Only the horse of the man on duty was saddled, and with its\r\nfeet hobbled was moving about by the brambles near the wood, and only\r\nthe sentinel had his Circassian coat on and carried a gun and sword.\r\nThe corporal, a tall thin Cossack with an exceptionally long back and\r\nsmall hands and feet, was sitting on the earth-bank of a hut with his\r\nbeshmet unbuttoned. On his face was the lazy, bored expression of a\r\nsuperior, and having shut his eyes he dropped his head upon the palm\r\nfirst of one hand and then of the other. An elderly Cossack with a\r\nbroad greyish-black beard was lying in his shirt, girdled with a black\r\nstrap, close to the river and gazing lazily at the waves of the Terek\r\nas they monotonously foamed and swirled. Others, also overcome by the\r\nheat and half naked, were rinsing clothes in the Terek, plaiting a\r\nfishing line, or humming tunes as they lay on the hot sand of the river\r\nbank. One Cossack, with a thin face much burnt by the sun, lay near the\r\nhut evidently dead drunk, by a wall which though it had been in shadow\r\nsome two hours previously was now exposed to the sun\'s fierce slanting\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nLukashka, who stood on the watch-tower, was a tall handsome lad about\r\ntwenty years old and very like his mother. His face and whole build, in\r\nspite of the angularity of youth, indicated great strength, both\r\nphysical and moral. Though he had only lately joined the Cossacks at\r\nthe front, it was evident from the expression of his face and the calm\r\nassurance of his attitude that he had already acquired the somewhat\r\nproud and warlike bearing peculiar to Cossacks and to men generally who\r\ncontinually carry arms, and that he felt he was a Cossack and fully\r\nknew his own value. His ample Circassian coat was torn in some places,\r\nhis cap was on the back of his head Chechen fashion, and his leggings\r\nhad slipped below his knees. His clothing was not rich, but he wore it\r\nwith that peculiar Cossack foppishness which consists in imitating the\r\nChechen brave. Everything on a real brave is ample, ragged, and\r\nneglected, only his weapons are costly. But these ragged clothes and\r\nthese weapons are belted and worn with a certain air and matched in a\r\ncertain manner, neither of which can be acquired by everybody and which\r\nat once strike the eye of a Cossack or a hillsman. Lukashka had this\r\nresemblance to a brave. With his hands folded under his sword, and his\r\neyes nearly closed, he kept looking at the distant Tartar village.\r\nTaken separately his features were not beautiful, but anyone who saw\r\nhis stately carriage and his dark-browed intelligent face would\r\ninvoluntarily say, \'What a fine fellow!\'\r\n\r\n\'Look at the women, what a lot of them are walking about in the\r\nvillage,\' said he in a sharp voice, languidly showing his brilliant\r\nwhite teeth and not addressing anyone in particular.\r\n\r\nNazarka who was lying below immediately lifted his head and remarked:\r\n\r\n\'They must be going for water.\'\r\n\r\n\'Supposing one scared them with a gun?\' said Lukashka, laughing,\r\n\'Wouldn\'t they be frightened?\'\r\n\r\n\'It wouldn\'t reach.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! Mine would carry beyond. Just wait a bit, and when their feast\r\ncomes round I\'ll go and visit Girey Khan and drink buza there,\' said\r\nLukashka, angrily swishing away the mosquitoes which attached\r\nthemselves to him.\r\n\r\nA rustling in the thicket drew the Cossack\'s attention. A pied mongrel\r\nhalf-setter, searching for a scent and violently wagging its scantily\r\nfurred tail, came running to the cordon. Lukashka recognized the dog as\r\none belonging to his neighbour, Uncle Eroshka, a hunter, and saw,\r\nfollowing it through the thicket, the approaching figure of the hunter\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nUncle Eroshka was a gigantic Cossack with a broad, snow-white beard and\r\nsuch broad shoulders and chest that in the wood, where there was no one\r\nto compare him with, he did not look particularly tall, so well\r\nproportioned were his powerful limbs. He wore a tattered coat and, over\r\nthe bands with which his legs were swathed, sandals made of undressed\r\ndeer\'s hide tied on with strings; while on his head he had a rough\r\nlittle white cap. He carried over one shoulder a screen to hide behind\r\nwhen shooting pheasants, and a bag containing a hen for luring hawks,\r\nand a small falcon; over the other shoulder, attached by a strap, was a\r\nwild cat he had killed; and stuck in his belt behind were some little\r\nbags containing bullets, gunpowder, and bread, a horse\'s tail to swish\r\naway the mosquitoes, a large dagger in a torn scabbard smeared with old\r\nbloodstains, and two dead pheasants. Having glanced at the cordon he\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\'Hy, Lyam!\' he called to the dog in such a ringing bass that it awoke\r\nan echo far away in the wood; and throwing over his shoulder his big\r\ngun, of the kind the Cossacks call a \'flint\', he raised his cap.\r\n\r\n\'Had a good day, good people, eh?\' he said, addressing the Cossacks in\r\nthe same strong and cheerful voice, quite without effort, but as loudly\r\nas if he were shouting to someone on the other bank of the river.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes. Uncle!\' answered from all sides the voices of the young\r\nCossacks.\r\n\r\n\'What have you seen? Tell us!\' shouted Uncle Eroshka, wiping the sweat\r\nfrom his broad red face with the sleeve of his coat.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, there\'s a vulture living in the plane tree here, Uncle. As soon as\r\nnight comes he begins hovering round,\' said Nazarka, winking and\r\njerking his shoulder and leg.\r\n\r\n\'Come, come!\' said the old man incredulously.\r\n\r\n\'Really, Uncle! You must keep watch,\' replied Nazarka with a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe other Cossacks began laughing.\r\n\r\nThe wag had not seen any vulture at all, but it had long been the\r\ncustom of the young Cossacks in the cordon to tease and mislead Uncle\r\nEroshka every time he came to them.\r\n\r\n\'Eh, you fool, always lying!\' exclaimed Lukashka from the tower to\r\nNazarka.\r\n\r\nNazarka was immediately silenced.\r\n\r\n\'It must be watched. I\'ll watch,\' answered the old man to the great\r\ndelight of all the Cossacks. \'But have you seen any boars?\'\r\n\r\n\'Watching for boars, are you?\' said the corporal, bending forward and\r\nscratching his back with both hands, very pleased at the chance of some\r\ndistraction. \'It\'s abreks one has to hunt here and not boars! You\'ve\r\nnot heard anything, Uncle, have you?\' he added, needlessly screwing up\r\nhis eyes and showing his close-set white teeth.\r\n\r\n\'Abreks,\' said the old man. \'No, I haven\'t. I say, have you any\r\nchikhir? Let me have a drink, there\'s a good man. I\'m really quite done\r\nup. When the time comes I\'ll bring you some fresh meat, I really will.\r\nGive me a drink!\' he added.\r\n\r\n\'Well, and are you going to watch?\' inquired the corporal, as though he\r\nhad not heard what the other said.\r\n\r\n\'I did mean to watch tonight,\' replied Uncle Eroshka. \'Maybe, with\r\nGod\'s help, I shall kill something for the holiday. Then you shall have\r\na share, you shall indeed!\'\r\n\r\n\'Uncle! Hallo, Uncle!\' called out Lukashka sharply from above,\r\nattracting everybody\'s attention. All the Cossacks looked up at him.\r\n\'Just go to the upper water-course, there\'s a fine herd of boars there.\r\nI\'m not inventing, really! The other day one of our Cossacks shot one\r\nthere. I\'m telling you the truth,\' added he, readjusting the musket at\r\nhis back and in a tone that showed he was not joking.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! Lukashka the Snatcher is here!\' said the old man, looking up.\r\n\'Where has he been shooting?\'\r\n\r\n\'Haven\'t you seen? I suppose you\'re too young!\' said Lukashka. \'Close\r\nby the ditch,\' he went on seriously with a shake of the head. \'We were\r\njust going along the ditch when all at once we heard something\r\ncrackling, but my gun was in its case. Elias fired suddenly ... But\r\nI\'ll show you the place, it\'s not far. You just wait a bit. I know\r\nevery one of their footpaths ... Daddy Mosev,\' said he, turning\r\nresolutely and almost commandingly to the corporal, \'it\'s time to\r\nrelieve guard!\' and holding aloft his gun he began to descend from the\r\nwatch-tower without waiting for the order.\r\n\r\n\'Come down!\' said the corporal, after Lukashka had started, and glanced\r\nround. \'Is it your turn, Gurka? Then go ... True enough your Lukashka\r\nhas become very skilful,\' he went on, addressing the old man. \'He keeps\r\ngoing about just like you, he doesn\'t stay at home. The other day he\r\nkilled a boar.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun had already set and the shades of night were rapidly spreading\r\nfrom the edge of the wood. The Cossacks finished their task round the\r\ncordon and gathered in the hut for supper. Only the old man still\r\nstayed under the plane tree watching for the vulture and pulling the\r\nstring tied to the falcon\'s leg, but though a vulture was really\r\nperching on the plane tree it declined to swoop down on the lure.\r\nLukashka, singing one song after another, was leisurely placing nets\r\namong the very thickest brambles to trap pheasants. In spite of his\r\ntall stature and big hands every kind of work, both rough and delicate,\r\nprospered under Lukashka\'s fingers.\r\n\r\n\'Hallo, Luke!\' came Nazarka\'s shrill, sharp voice calling him from the\r\nthicket close by. \'The Cossacks have gone in to supper.\'\r\n\r\nNazarka, with a live pheasant under his arm, forced his way through the\r\nbrambles and emerged on the footpath.\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' said Lukashka, breaking off in his song, \'where did you get that\r\ncock pheasant? I suppose it was in my trap?\'\r\n\r\nNazarka was of the same age as Lukashka and had also only been at the\r\nfront since the previous spring.\r\n\r\nHe was plain, thin and puny, with a shrill voice that rang in one\'s\r\nears. They were neighbours and comrades. Lukashka was sitting on the\r\ngrass crosslegged like a Tartar, adjusting his nets.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know whose it was--yours, I expect.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was it beyond the pit by the plane tree? Then it is mine! I set the\r\nnets last night.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka rose and examined the captured pheasant. After stroking the\r\ndark burnished head of the bird, which rolled its eyes and stretched\r\nout its neck in terror, Lukashka took the pheasant in his hands.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll have it in a pilau tonight. You go and kill and pluck it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And shall we eat it ourselves or give it to the corporal?\'\r\n\r\n\'He has plenty!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like killing them,\' said Nazarka.\r\n\r\n\'Give it here!\'\r\n\r\nLukashka drew a little knife from under his dagger and gave it a swift\r\njerk. The bird fluttered, but before it could spread its wings the\r\nbleeding head bent and quivered.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s how one should do it!\' said Lukashka, throwing down the\r\npheasant. \'It will make a fat pilau.\'\r\n\r\nNazarka shuddered as he looked at the bird.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Lukashka, that fiend will be sending us to the ambush again\r\ntonight,\' he said, taking up the bird. (He was alluding to the\r\ncorporal.) \'He has sent Fomushkin to get wine, and it ought to be his\r\nturn. He always puts it on us.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka went whistling along the cordon.\r\n\r\n\'Take the string with you,\' he shouted.\r\n\r\nNazirka obeyed.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll give him a bit of my mind today, I really will,\' continued\r\nNazarka. \'Let\'s say we won\'t go; we\'re tired out and there\'s an end of\r\nit! No, really, you tell him, he\'ll listen to you. It\'s too bad!\'\r\n\r\n\'Get along with you! What a thing to make a fuss about!\' said Lukashka,\r\nevidently thinking of something else. \'What bosh! If he made us turn\r\nout of the village at night now, that would be annoying: there one can\r\nhave some fun, but here what is there? It\'s all one whether we\'re in\r\nthe cordon or in ambush. What a fellow you are!\'\r\n\r\n\'And are you going to the village?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go for the holidays.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gurka says your Dunayka is carrying on with Fomushkin,\' said Nazarka\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, let her go to the devil,\' said Lukashka, showing his regular\r\nwhite teeth, though he did not laugh. \'As if I couldn\'t find another!\'\r\n\r\n\'Gurka says he went to her house. Her husband was out and there was\r\nFomushkin sitting and eating pie. Gurka stopped awhile and then went\r\naway, and passing by the window he heard her say, "He\'s gone, the\r\nfiend.... Why don\'t you eat your pie, my own? You needn\'t go home for\r\nthe night," she says. And Gurka under the window says to himself,\r\n"That\'s fine!"\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re making it up.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, quite true, by Heaven!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if she\'s found another let her go to the devil,\' said Lukashka,\r\nafter a pause. \'There\'s no lack of girls and I was sick of her anyway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, see what a devil you are!\' said Nazarka. \'You should make up to\r\nthe cornet\'s girl, Maryanka. Why doesn\'t she walk out with any one?\'\r\n\r\nLukashka frowned. \'What of Maryanka? They\'re all alike,\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you just try...\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you think? Are girls so scarce in the village?\'\r\n\r\nAnd Lukashka recommenced whistling, and went along the cordon pulling\r\nleaves and branches from the bushes as he went. Suddenly, catching\r\nsight of a smooth sapling, he drew the knife from the handle of his\r\ndagger and cut it down. \'What a ramrod it will make,\' he said, swinging\r\nthe sapling till it whistled through the air.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks were sitting round a low Tartar table on the earthen floor\r\nof the clay-plastered outer room of the hut, when the question of whose\r\nturn it was to lie in ambush was raised. \'Who is to go tonight?\'\r\nshouted one of the Cossacks through the open door to the corporal in\r\nthe next room.\r\n\r\n\'Who is to go?\' the corporal shouted back. \'Uncle Burlak has been and\r\nFomushkin too,\' said he, not quite confidently. \'You two had better go,\r\nyou and Nazarka,\' he went on, addressing Lukashka. \'And Ergushov must\r\ngo too; surely he has slept it off?\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t sleep it off yourself so why should he?\' said Nazarka in a\r\nsubdued voice.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks laughed.\r\n\r\nErgushov was the Cossack who had been lying drunk and asleep near the\r\nhut. He had only that moment staggered into the room rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\nLukashka had already risen and was getting his gun ready.\r\n\r\n\'Be quick and go! Finish your supper and go!\' said the corporal; and\r\nwithout waiting for an expression of consent he shut the door,\r\nevidently not expecting the Cossack to obey. \'Of course,\' thought he,\r\n\'if I hadn\'t been ordered to I wouldn\'t send anyone, but an officer\r\nmight turn up at any moment. As it is, they say eight abreks have\r\ncrossed over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I suppose I must go,\' remarked Ergushov, \'it\'s the regulation.\r\nCan\'t be helped! The times are such. I say, we must go.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lukashka, holding a big piece of pheasant to his mouth with\r\nboth hands and glancing now at Nazarka, now at Ergushov, seemed quite\r\nindifferent to what passed and only laughed at them both. Before the\r\nCossacks were ready to go into ambush. Uncle Eroshka, who had been\r\nvainly waiting under the plane tree till night fell, entered the dark\r\nouter room.\r\n\r\n\'Well, lads,\' his loud bass resounded through the low-roofed room\r\ndrowning all the other voices, \'I\'m going with you. You\'ll watch for\r\nChechens and I for boars!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Uncle Eroshka and the three Cossacks, in their\r\ncloaks and shouldering their guns, left the cordon and went towards the\r\nplace on the Terek where they were to lie in ambush. Nazarka did not\r\nwant to go at all, but Lukashka shouted at him and they soon started.\r\nAfter they had gone a few steps in silence the Cossacks turned aside\r\nfrom the ditch and went along a path almost hidden by reeds till they\r\nreached the river. On its bank lay a thick black log cast up by the\r\nwater. The reeds around it had been recently beaten down.\r\n\r\n\'Shall we lie here?\' asked Nazarka.\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\' answered Lukashka. \'Sit down here and I\'ll be back in a\r\nminute. I\'ll only show Daddy where to go.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is the best place; here we can see and not be seen,\' said\r\nErgushov, \'so it\'s here we\'ll lie. It\'s a first-rate place!\'\r\n\r\nNazarka and Ergushov spread out their cloaks and settled down behind\r\nthe log, while Lukashka went on with Uncle Eroshka.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not far from here. Daddy,\' said Lukashka, stepping softly in\r\nfront of the old man; \'I\'ll show you where they\'ve been--I\'m the only\r\none that knows. Daddy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Show me! You\'re a fine fellow, a regular Snatcher!\' replied the old\r\nman, also whispering.\r\n\r\nHaving gone a few steps Lukashka stopped, stooped down over a puddle,\r\nand whistled. \'That\'s where they come to drink, d\'you see?\' He spoke in\r\na scarcely audible voice, pointing to fresh hoof-prints.\r\n\r\n\'Christ bless you,\' answered the old man. \'The boar will be in the\r\nhollow beyond the ditch,\' he added. Til watch, and you can go.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka pulled his cloak up higher and walked back alone, throwing\r\nswift glances now to the left at the wall of reeds, now to the Terek\r\nrushing by below the bank. \'I daresay he\'s watching or creeping along\r\nsomewhere,\' thought he of a possible Chechen hillsman. Suddenly a loud\r\nrustling and a splash in the water made him start and seize his musket.\r\nFrom under the bank a boar leapt up--his dark outline showing for a\r\nmoment against the glassy surface of the water and then disappearing\r\namong the reeds. Lukashka pulled out his gun and aimed, but before he\r\ncould fire the boar had disappeared in the thicket. Lukashka spat with\r\nvexation and went on. On approaching the ambuscade he halted again and\r\nwhistled softly. His whistle was answered and he stepped up to his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nNazarka, all curled up, was already asleep. Ergushov sat with his legs\r\ncrossed and moved slightly to make room for Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'How jolly it is to sit here! It\'s really a good place,\' said he. \'Did\r\nyou take him there?\'\r\n\r\n\'Showed him where,\' answered Lukashka, spreading out his cloak. \'But\r\nwhat a big boar I roused just now close to the water! I expect it was\r\nthe very one! You must have heard the crash?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did hear a beast crashing through. I knew at once it was a beast. I\r\nthought to myself: "Lukashka has roused a beast,"\' Ergushov said,\r\nwrapping himself up in his cloak. \'Now I\'ll go to sleep,\' he added.\r\n\'Wake me when the cocks crow. We must have discipline. I\'ll lie down\r\nand have a nap, and then you will have a nap and I\'ll watch--that\'s the\r\nway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Luckily I don\'t want to sleep,\' answered Lukashka.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, warm, and still. Only on one side of the sky the\r\nstars were shining, the other and greater part was overcast by one huge\r\ncloud stretching from the mountaintops. The black cloud, blending in\r\nthe absence of any wind with the mountains, moved slowly onwards, its\r\ncurved edges sharply denned against the deep starry sky. Only in front\r\nof him could the Cossack discern the Terek and the distance beyond.\r\nBehind and on both sides he was surrounded by a wall of reeds.\r\nOccasionally the reeds would sway and rustle against one another\r\napparently without cause. Seen from down below, against the clear part\r\nof the sky, their waving tufts looked like the feathery branches of\r\ntrees. Close in front at his very feet was the bank, and at its base\r\nthe rushing torrent. A little farther on was the moving mass of glassy\r\nbrown water which eddied rhythmically along the bank and round the\r\nshallows. Farther still, water, banks, and cloud all merged together in\r\nimpenetrable gloom. Along the surface of the water floated black\r\nshadows, in which the experienced eyes of the Cossack detected trees\r\ncarried down by the current. Only very rarely sheet-lightning, mirrored\r\nin the water as in a black glass, disclosed the sloping bank opposite.\r\nThe rhythmic sounds of night--the rustling of the reeds, the snoring of\r\nthe Cossacks, the hum of mosquitoes, and the rushing water, were every\r\nnow and then broken by a shot fired in the distance, or by the gurgling\r\nof water when a piece of bank slipped down, the splash of a big fish,\r\nor the crashing of an animal breaking through the thick undergrowth in\r\nthe wood. Once an owl flew past along the Terek, flapping one wing\r\nagainst the other rhythmically at every second beat. Just above the\r\nCossack\'s head it turned towards the wood and then, striking its wings\r\nno longer after every other flap but at every flap, it flew to an old\r\nplane tree where it rustled about for a long time before settling down\r\namong the branches. At every one of these unexpected sounds the\r\nwatching Cossack listened intently, straining his hearing, and screwing\r\nup his eyes while he deliberately felt for his musket.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the night was past. The black cloud that had moved\r\nwestward revealed the clear starry sky from under its torn edge, and\r\nthe golden upturned crescent of the moon shone above the mountains with\r\na reddish light. The cold began to be penetrating. Nazarka awoke, spoke\r\na little, and fell asleep again. Lukashka feeling bored got up, drew\r\nthe knife from his dagger-handle and began to fashion his stick into a\r\nramrod. His head was full of the Chechens who lived over there in the\r\nmountains, and of how their brave lads came across and were not afraid\r\nof the Cossacks, and might even now be crossing the river at some other\r\nspot. He thrust himself out of his hiding-place and looked along the\r\nriver but could see nothing. And as he continued looking out at\r\nintervals upon the river and at the opposite bank, now dimly\r\ndistinguishable from the water in the faint moonlight, he no longer\r\nthought about the Chechens but only of when it would be time to wake\r\nhis comrades, and of going home to the village. In the village he\r\nimagined Dunayka, his \'little soul\', as the Cossacks call a man\'s\r\nmistress, and thought of her with vexation. Silvery mists, a sign of\r\ncoming morning, glittered white above the water, and not far from him\r\nyoung eagles were whistling and flapping their wings. At last the\r\ncrowing of a cock reached him from the distant village, followed by the\r\nlong-sustained note of another, which was again answered by yet other\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\n\'Time to wake them,\' thought Lukashka, who had finished his ramrod and\r\nfelt his eyes growing heavy. Turning to his comrades he managed to make\r\nout which pair of legs belonged to whom, when it suddenly seemed to him\r\nthat he heard something splash on the other side of the Terek. He\r\nturned again towards the horizon beyond the hills, where day was\r\nbreaking under the upturned crescent, glanced at the outline of the\r\nopposite bank, at the Terek, and at the now distinctly visible\r\ndriftwood upon it. For one instant it seemed to him that he was moving\r\nand that the Terek with the drifting wood remained stationary. Again he\r\npeered out. One large black log with a branch particularly attracted\r\nhis attention. The tree was floating in a strange way right down the\r\nmiddle of the stream, neither rocking nor whirling. It even appeared\r\nnot to be floating altogether with the current, but to be crossing it\r\nin the direction of the shallows. Lukashka stretching out his neck\r\nwatched it intently. The tree floated to the shallows, stopped, and\r\nshifted in a peculiar manner. Lukashka thought he saw an arm stretched\r\nout from beneath the tree. \'Supposing I killed an abrek all by myself!\'\r\nhe thought, and seized his gun with a swift, unhurried movement,\r\nputting up his gun-rest, placing the gun upon it, and holding it\r\nnoiselessly in position. Cocking the trigger, with bated breath he took\r\naim, still peering out intently. \'I won\'t wake them,\' he thought. But\r\nhis heart began beating so fast that he remained motionless, listening.\r\nSuddenly the trunk gave a plunge and again began to float across the\r\nstream towards our bank. \'Only not to miss ...\' thought he, and now by\r\nthe faint light of the moon he caught a glimpse of a Tartar\'s head in\r\nfront of the floating wood. He aimed straight at the head which\r\nappeared to be quite near--just at the end of his rifle\'s barrel. He\r\nglanced cross. \'Right enough it is an abrek! he thought joyfully, and\r\nsuddenly rising to his knees he again took aim. Having found the sight,\r\nbarely visible at the end of the long gun, he said: \'In the name of the\r\nFather and of the Son,\' in the Cossack way learnt in his childhood, and\r\npulled the trigger. A flash of lightning lit up for an instant the\r\nreeds and the water, and the sharp, abrupt report of the shot was\r\ncarried across the river, changing into a prolonged roll somewhere in\r\nthe far distance. The piece of driftwood now floated not across, but\r\nwith the current, rocking and whirling.\r\n\r\n\'Stop, I say!\' exclaimed Ergushov, seizing his musket and raising\r\nhimself behind the log near which he was lying.\r\n\r\n\'Shut up, you devil!\' whispered Lukashka, grinding his teeth. \'abreks!\'\r\n\r\n\'Whom have you shot?\' asked Nazarka. \'Who was it, Lukashka?\'\r\n\r\nLukashka did not answer. He was reloading his gun and watching the\r\nfloating wood. A little way off it stopped on a sand-bank, and from\r\nbehind it something large that rocked in the water came into view.\r\n\r\n\'What did you shoot? Why don\'t you speak?\' insisted the Cossacks.\r\n\r\n\'Abreks, I tell you!\' said Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t humbug! Did the gun go off? ...\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve killed an abrek, that\'s what I fired at,\' muttered Lukashka in a\r\nvoice choked by emotion, as he jumped to his feet. \'A man was\r\nswimming...\' he said, pointing to the sandbank. \'I killed him. Just\r\nlook there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have done with your humbugging!\' said Ergushov again, rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Have done with what? Look there,\' said Lukashka, seizing him by the\r\nshoulders and pulling him with such force that Ergushov groaned.\r\n\r\nHe looked in the direction in which Lukashka pointed, and discerning a\r\nbody immediately changed his tone.\r\n\r\n\'O Lord! But I say, more will come! I tell you the truth,\' said he\r\nsoftly, and began examining his musket. \'That was a scout swimming\r\nacross: either the others are here already or are not far off on the\r\nother side--I tell you for sure!\' Lukashka was unfastening his belt and\r\ntaking off his Circassian coat.\r\n\r\n\'What are you up to, you idiot?\' exclaimed Ergushov. \'Only show\r\nyourself and you\'ve lost all for nothing, I tell you true! If you\'ve\r\nkilled him he won\'t escape. Let me have a little powder for my\r\nmusket-pan--you have some? Nazarka, you go back to the cordon and look\r\nalive; but don\'t go along the bank or you\'ll be killed--I tell you\r\ntrue.\'\r\n\r\n\'Catch me going alone! Go yourself!\' said Nazarka angrily.\r\n\r\nHaving taken off his coat, Lukashka went down to the bank.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t go in, I tell you!\' said Ergushov, putting some powder on the\r\npan. \'Look, he\'s not moving. I can see. It\'s nearly morning; wait till\r\nthey come from the cordon. You go, Nazarka. You\'re afraid! Don\'t be\r\nafraid, I tell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Luke, I say, Lukashka! Tell us how you did it!\' said Nazarka.\r\n\r\nLukashka changed his mind about going into the water just then. \'Go\r\nquick to the cordon and I will watch. Tell the Cossacks to send out the\r\npatrol. If the ABREKS are on this side they must be caught,\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s what I say. They\'ll get off,\' said Ergushov, rising. \'True,\r\nthey must be caught!\'\r\n\r\nErgushov and Nazarka rose and, crossing themselves, started off for the\r\ncordon--not along the riverbank but breaking their way through the\r\nbrambles to reach a path in the wood.\r\n\r\n\'Now mind, Lukashka--they may cut you down here, so you\'d best keep a\r\nsharp look-out, I tell you!\'\r\n\r\n\'Go along; I know,\' muttered Lukashka; and having examined his gun\r\nagain he sat down behind the log.\r\n\r\nHe remained alone and sat gazing at the shallows and listening for the\r\nCossacks; but it was some distance to the cordon and he was tormented\r\nby impatience. He kept thinking that the other ABREKS who were with the\r\none he had killed would escape. He was vexed with the ABREKS who were\r\ngoing to escape just as he had been with the boar that had escaped the\r\nevening before. He glanced round and at the opposite bank, expecting\r\nevery moment to see a man, and having arranged his gun-rest he was\r\nready to fire. The idea that he might himself be killed never entered\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was growing light. The Chechen\'s body which was gently rocking in\r\nthe shallow water was now clearly visible. Suddenly the reeds rustled\r\nnot far from Luke and he heard steps and saw the feathery tops of the\r\nreeds moving. He set his gun at full cock and muttered: \'In the name of\r\nthe Father and of the Son,\' but when the cock clicked the sound of\r\nsteps ceased.\r\n\r\n\'Hallo, Cossacks! Don\'t kill your Daddy!\' said a deep bass voice\r\ncalmly; and moving the reeds apart Daddy Eroshka came up close to Luke.\r\n\r\n\'I very nearly killed you, by God I did!\' said Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'What have you shot?\' asked the old man.\r\n\r\nHis sonorous voice resounded through the wood and downward along the\r\nriver, suddenly dispelling the mysterious quiet of night around the\r\nCossack. It was as if everything had suddenly become lighter and more\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\n\'There now. Uncle, you have not seen anything, but I\'ve killed a\r\nbeast,\' said Lukashka, uncocking his gun and getting up with unnatural\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\nThe old man was staring intently at the white back, now clearly\r\nvisible, against which the Terek rippled.\r\n\r\n\'He was swimming with a log on his back. I spied him out! ... Look\r\nthere. There! He\'s got blue trousers, and a gun I think.... Do you\r\nsee?\' inquired Luke.\r\n\r\n \'How can one help seeing?\' said the old man angrily, and a\r\nserious and stern expression appeared on his face. \'You\'ve killed a\r\nbrave,\' he said, apparently with regret.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I sat here and suddenly saw something dark on the other side. I\r\nspied him when he was still over there. It was as if a man had come\r\nthere and fallen in. Strange! And a piece of driftwood, a good-sized\r\npiece, comes floating, not with the stream but across it; and what do I\r\nsee but a head appearing from under it! Strange! I stretched out of the\r\nreeds but could see nothing; then I rose and he must have heard, the\r\nbeast, and crept out into the shallow and looked about. "No, you\r\ndon\'t!" I said, as soon as he landed and looked round, "you won\'t get\r\naway!" Oh, there was something choking me! I got my gun ready but did\r\nnot stir, and looked out. He waited a little and then swam out again;\r\nand when he came into the moonlight I could see his whole back. "In the\r\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost"... and through\r\nthe smoke I see him struggling. He moaned, or so it seemed to me. "Ah,"\r\nI thought, "the Lord be thanked, I\'ve killed him!" And when he drifted\r\nonto the sand-bank I could see him distinctly: he tried to get up but\r\ncouldn\'t. He struggled a bit and then lay down. Everything could be\r\nseen. Look, he does not move--he must be dead! The Cossacks have gone\r\nback to the cordon in case there should be any more of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'And so you got him!\' said the old man. \'He is far away now, my lad!\r\n...\' And again he shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\nJust then the sound reached them of breaking bushes and the loud voices\r\nof Cossacks approaching along the bank on horseback and on foot. \'Are\r\nyou bringing the skiff?\' shouted Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a trump, Luke! Lug it to the bank!\' shouted one of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for the skiff Lukashka began to undress, keeping an eye\r\nall the while on his prey.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a bit, Nazarka is bringing the skiff,\' shouted the corporal.\r\n\r\n\'You fool! Maybe he is alive and only pretending! Take your dagger with\r\nyou!\' shouted another Cossack.\r\n\r\n\'Get along,\' cried Luke, pulling off his trousers. He quickly undressed\r\nand, crossing himself, jumped, plunging with a splash into the river.\r\nThen with long strokes of his white arms, lifting his back high out of\r\nthe water and breathing deeply, he swam across the current of the Terek\r\ntowards the shallows. A crowd of Cossacks stood on the bank talking\r\nloudly. Three horsemen rode off to patrol. The skiff appeared round a\r\nbend. Lukashka stood up on the sandbank, leaned over the body, and gave\r\nit a couple of shakes.\r\n\r\n\'Quite dead!\' he shouted in a shrill voice.\r\n\r\nThe Chechen had been shot in the head. He had on a pair of blue\r\ntrousers, a shirt, and a Circassian coat, and a gun and dagger were\r\ntied to his back. Above all these a large branch was tied, and it was\r\nthis which at first had misled Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'What a carp you\'ve landed!\' cried one of the Cossacks who had\r\nassembled in a circle, as the body, lifted out of the skiff, was laid\r\non the bank, pressing down the grass.\r\n\r\n\'How yellow he is!\' said another.\r\n\r\n\'Where have our fellows gone to search? I expect the rest of them are\r\non the other bank. If this one had not been a scout he would not have\r\nswum that way. Why else should he swim alone?\' said a third.\r\n\r\n\'Must have been a smart one to offer himself before the others; a\r\nregular brave!\' said Lukashka mockingly, shivering as he wrung out his\r\nclothes that had got wet on the bank.\r\n\r\n\'His beard is dyed and cropped.\'\r\n\r\n\'And he has tied a bag with a coat in it to his back.\'\r\n\r\n\'That would make it easier for him to swim,\' said some one.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Lukashka,\' said the corporal, who was holding the dagger and\r\ngun taken from the dead man. \'Keep the dagger for yourself and the coat\r\ntoo; but I\'ll give you three rubles for the gun. You see it has a hole\r\nin it,\' said he, blowing into the muzzle. \'I want it just for a\r\nsouvenir.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka did not answer. Evidently this sort of begging vexed him but\r\nhe knew it could not be avoided.\r\n\r\n\'See, what a devil!\' said he, frowning and throwing down the Chechen\'s\r\ncoat. \'If at least it were a good coat, but it\'s a mere rag.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'ll do to fetch firewood in,\' said one of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\n\'Mosev, I\'ll go home,\' said Lukashka, evidently forgetting his vexation\r\nand wishing to get some advantage out of having to give a present to\r\nhis superior.\r\n\r\n\'All right, you may go!\'\r\n\r\n\'Take the body beyond the cordon, lads,\' said the corporal, still\r\nexamining the gun, \'and put a shelter over him from the sun. Perhaps\r\nthey\'ll send from the mountains to ransom it.\'\r\n\r\n\'It isn\'t hot yet,\' said someone.\r\n\r\n\'And supposing a jackal tears him? Would that be well?\' remarked\r\nanother Cossack.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll set a watch; if they should come to ransom him it won\'t do for\r\nhim to have been torn.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Lukashka, whatever you do you must stand a pail of vodka for the\r\nlads,\' said the corporal gaily.\r\n\r\n\'Of course! That\'s the custom,\' chimed in the Cossacks. \'See what luck\r\nGod has sent you! Without ever having seen anything of the kind before,\r\nyou\'ve killed a brave!\'\r\n\r\n\'Buy the dagger and coat and don\'t be stingy, and I\'ll let you have the\r\ntrousers too,\' said Lukashka. \'They\'re too tight for me; he was a thin\r\ndevil.\'\r\n\r\nOne Cossack bought the coat for a ruble and another gave the price of\r\ntwo pails of vodka for the dagger.\r\n\r\n\'Drink, lads! I\'ll stand you a pail!\' said Luke. \'I\'ll bring it myself\r\nfrom the village.\'\r\n\r\n\'And cut up the trousers into kerchiefs for the girls!\' said Nazarka.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\'Have done laughing!\' said the corporal. \'And take the body away. Why\r\nhave you put the nasty thing by the hut?\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you standing there for? Haul him along, lads!\' shouted\r\nLukashka in a commanding voice to the Cossacks, who reluctantly took\r\nhold of the body, obeying him as though he were their chief. After\r\ndragging the body along for a few steps the Cossacks let fall the legs,\r\nwhich dropped with a lifeless jerk, and stepping apart they then stood\r\nsilent for a few moments. Nazarka came up and straightened the head,\r\nwhich was turned to one side so that the round wound above the temple\r\nand the whole of the dead man\'s face were visible. \'See what a mark he\r\nhas made right in the brain,\' he said. \'He won\'t get lost. His owners\r\nwill always know him!\' No one answered, and again the Angel of Silence\r\nflew over the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen high and its diverging beams were lighting up the\r\ndewy grass. Near by, the Terek murmured in the awakened wood and,\r\ngreeting the morning, the pheasants called to one another. The Cossacks\r\nstood still and silent around the dead man, gazing at him. The brown\r\nbody, with nothing on but the wet blue trousers held by a girdle over\r\nthe sunken stomach, was well shaped and handsome. The muscular arms lay\r\nstretched straight out by his sides; the blue, freshly shaven, round\r\nhead with the clotted wound on one side of it was thrown back. The\r\nsmooth tanned forehead contrasted sharply with the shaven part of the\r\nhead. The open glassy eyes with lowered pupils stared upwards, seeming\r\nto gaze past everything. Under the red trimmed moustache the fine lips,\r\ndrawn at the corners, seemed stiffened into a smile of good-natured\r\nsubtle raillery. The fingers of the small hands covered with red hairs\r\nwere bent inward, and the nails were dyed red.\r\n\r\nLukashka had not yet dressed. He was wet. His neck was redder and his\r\neyes brighter than usual, his broad jaws twitched, and from his healthy\r\nbody a hardly perceptible steam rose in the fresh morning air.\r\n\r\n\'He too was a man!\' he muttered, evidently admiring the corpse.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, if you had fallen into his hands you would have had short\r\nshrift,\' said one of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe Angel of Silence had taken wing. The Cossacks began bustling about\r\nand talking. Two of them went to cut brushwood for a shelter, others\r\nstrolled towards the cordon. Luke and Nazarka ran to get ready to go to\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later they were both on their way homewards, talking\r\nincessantly and almost running through the dense woods which separated\r\nthe Terek from the village.\r\n\r\n\'Mind, don\'t tell her I sent you, but just go and find out if her\r\nhusband is at home,\' Luke was saying in his shrill voice.\r\n\r\n\'And I\'ll go round to Yamka too,\' said the devoted Nazarka. \'We\'ll have\r\na spree, shall we?\'\r\n\r\n\'When should we have one if not to-day?\' replied Luke.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the village the two Cossacks drank, and lay down to\r\nsleep till evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the events above described, two companies of a\r\nCaucasian infantry regiment arrived at the Cossack village of\r\nNovomlinsk. The horses had been unharnessed and the companies\' wagons\r\nwere standing in the square. The cooks had dug a pit, and with logs\r\ngathered from various yards (where they had not been sufficiently\r\nsecurely stored) were now cooking the food; the pay-sergeants were\r\nsettling accounts with the soldiers. The Service Corps men were driving\r\npiles in the ground to which to tie the horses, and the quartermasters\r\nwere going about the streets just as if they were at home, showing\r\nofficers and men to their quarters. Here were green ammunition boxes in\r\na line, the company\'s carts, horses, and cauldrons in which buckwheat\r\nporridge was being cooked. Here were the captain and the lieutenant and\r\nthe sergeant-major, Onisim Mikhaylovich, and all this was in the\r\nCossack village where it was reported that the companies were ordered\r\nto take up their quarters: therefore they were at home here. But why\r\nthey were stationed there, who the Cossacks were, and whether they\r\nwanted the troops to be there, and whether they were Old Believers or\r\nnot--was all quite immaterial. Having received their pay and been\r\ndismissed, tired out and covered with dust, the soldiers noisily and in\r\ndisorder, like a swarm of bees about to settle, spread over the squares\r\nand streets; quite regardless of the Cossacks\' ill will, chattering\r\nmerrily and with their muskets clinking, by twos and threes they\r\nentered the huts and hung up their accoutrements, unpacked their bags,\r\nand bantered the women. At their favourite spot, round the\r\nporridge-cauldrons, a large group of soldiers assembled and with little\r\npipes between their teeth they gazed, now at the smoke which rose into\r\nthe hot sky, becoming visible when it thickened into white clouds as it\r\nrose, and now at the camp fires which were quivering in the pure air\r\nlike molten glass, and bantered and made fun of the Cossack men and\r\nwomen because they do not live at all like Russians. In all the yards\r\none could see soldiers and hear their laughter and the exasperated and\r\nshrill cries of Cossack women defending their houses and refusing to\r\ngive the soldiers water or cooking utensils. Little boys and girls,\r\nclinging to their mothers and to each other, followed all the movements\r\nof the troopers (never before seen by them) with frightened curiosity,\r\nor ran after them at a respectful distance. The old Cossacks came out\r\nsilently and dismally and sat on the earthen embankments of their huts,\r\nand watched the soldiers\' activity with an air of leaving it all to the\r\nwill of God without understanding what would come of it.\r\n\r\nOlenin, who had joined the Caucasian Army as a cadet three months\r\nbefore, was quartered in one of the best houses in the village, the\r\nhouse of the cornet, Elias Vasilich--that is to say at Granny Ulitka\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Goodness knows what it will be like, Dmitri Andreich,\' said the\r\npanting Vanyusha to Olenin, who, dressed in a Circassian coat and\r\nmounted on a Kabarda horse which he had bought in Groznoe, was after a\r\nfive-hours\' march gaily entering the yard of the quarters assigned to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s the matter?\' he asked, caressing his horse and looking\r\nmerrily at the perspiring, dishevelled, and worried Vanyusha, who had\r\narrived with the baggage wagons and was unpacking.\r\n\r\nOlenin looked quite a different man. In place of his clean-shaven lips\r\nand chin he had a youthful moustache and a small beard. Instead of a\r\nsallow complexion, the result of nights turned into day, his cheeks,\r\nhis forehead, and the skin behind his ears were now red with healthy\r\nsunburn. In place of a clean new black suit he wore a dirty white\r\nCircassian coat with a deeply pleated skirt, and he bore arms. Instead\r\nof a freshly starched collar, his neck was tightly clasped by the red\r\nband of his silk BESHMET. He wore Circassian dress but did not wear it\r\nwell, and anyone would have known him for a Russian and not a Tartar\r\nbrave. It was the thing--but not the real thing. But for all that, his\r\nwhole person breathed health, joy, and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it seems funny to you,\' said Vanyusha, \'but just try to talk to\r\nthese people yourself: they set themselves against one and there\'s an\r\nend of it. You can\'t get as much as a word out of them.\' Vanyusha\r\nangrily threw down a pail on the threshold. \'Somehow they don\'t seem\r\nlike Russians.\'\r\n\r\n\'You should speak to the Chief of the Village!\'\r\n\r\n\'But I don\'t know where he lives,\' said Vanyusha in an offended tone.\r\n\r\n\'Who has upset you so?\' asked Olenin, looking round.\r\n\r\n\'The devil only knows. Faugh! There is no real master here. They say he\r\nhas gone to some kind of KRIGA, and the old woman is a real devil. God\r\npreserve us!\' answered Vanyusha, putting his hands to his head. \'How we\r\nshall live here I don\'t know. They are worse than Tartars, I do\r\ndeclare--though they consider themselves Christians! A Tartar is bad\r\nenough, but all the same he is more noble. Gone to the KRIGA indeed!\r\nWhat this KRIGA they have invented is, I don\'t know!\' concluded\r\nVanyusha, and turned aside.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not as it is in the serfs\' quarters at home, eh?\' chaffed Olenin\r\nwithout dismounting.\r\n\r\n\'Please sir, may I have your horse?\' said Vanyusha, evidently perplexed\r\nby this new order of things but resigning himself to his fate.\r\n\r\n\'So a Tartar is more noble, eh, Vanyusha?\' repeated Olenin, dismounting\r\nand slapping the saddle.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you\'re laughing! You think it funny,\' muttered Vanyusha angrily.\r\n\r\n\'Come, don\'t be angry, Vanyusha,\' replied Olenin, still smiling. \'Wait\r\na minute, I\'ll go and speak to the people of the house; you\'ll see I\r\nshall arrange everything. You don\'t know what a jolly life we shall\r\nhave here. Only don\'t get upset.\'\r\n\r\nVanyusha did not answer. Screwing up his eyes he looked contemptuously\r\nafter his master, and shook his head. Vanyusha regarded Olenin as only\r\nhis master, and Olenin regarded Vanyusha as only his servant; and they\r\nwould both have been much surprised if anyone had told them that they\r\nwere friends, as they really were without knowing it themselves.\r\nVanyusha had been taken into his proprietor\'s house when he was only\r\neleven and when Olenin was the same age. When Olenin was fifteen he\r\ngave Vanyusha lessons for a time and taught him to read French, of\r\nwhich the latter was inordinately proud; and when in specially good\r\nspirits he still let off French words, always laughing stupidly when he\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\nOlenin ran up the steps of the porch and pushed open the door of the\r\nhut. Maryanka, wearing nothing but a pink smock, as all Cossack women\r\ndo in the house, jumped away from the door, frightened, and pressing\r\nherself against the wall covered the lower part of her face with the\r\nbroad sleeve of her Tartar smock. Having opened the door wider, Olenin\r\nin the semi-darkness of the passage saw the whole tall, shapely figure\r\nof the young Cossack girl. With the quick and eager curiosity of youth\r\nhe involuntarily noticed the firm maidenly form revealed by the fine\r\nprint smock, and the beautiful black eyes fixed on him with childlike\r\nterror and wild curiosity. \'This is SHE,\' thought Olenin. \'But there\r\nwill be many others like her\' came at once into his head, and he opened\r\nthe inner door. Old Granny Ulitka, also dressed only in a smock, was\r\nstooping with her back turned to him, sweeping the floor.\r\n\r\n\'Good-day to you. Mother! I\'ve come about my lodgings,\' he began.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack woman, without unbending, turned her severe but still\r\nhandsome face towards him.\r\n\r\n\'What have you come here for? Want to mock at us, eh? I\'ll teach you to\r\nmock; may the black plague seize you!\' she shouted, looking askance\r\nfrom under her frowning brow at the new-comer.\r\n\r\nOlenin had at first imagined that the way-worn, gallant Caucasian Army\r\n(of which he was a member) would be everywhere received joyfully, and\r\nespecially by the Cossacks, our comrades in the war; and he therefore\r\nfelt perplexed by this reception. Without losing presence of mind\r\nhowever he tried to explain that he meant to pay for his lodgings, but\r\nthe old woman would not give him a hearing.\r\n\r\n\'What have you come for? Who wants a pest like you, with your scraped\r\nface? You just wait a bit; when the master returns he\'ll show you your\r\nplace. I don\'t want your dirty money! A likely thing--just as if we had\r\nnever seen any! You\'ll stink the house out with your beastly tobacco\r\nand want to put it right with money! Think we\'ve never seen a pest! May\r\nyou be shot in your bowels and your heart!\' shrieked the old woman in a\r\npiercing voice, interrupting Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'It seems Vanyusha was right!\' thought Olenin. "A Tartar would be\r\nnobler",\' and followed by Granny Ulitka\'s abuse he went out of the hut.\r\nAs he was leaving, Maryanka, still wearing only her pink smock, but\r\nwith her forehead covered down to her eyes by a white kerchief,\r\nsuddenly slipped out from the passage past him. Pattering rapidly down\r\nthe steps with her bare feet she ran from the porch, stopped, and\r\nlooking round hastily with laughing eyes at the young man, vanished\r\nround the corner of the hut.\r\n\r\nHer firm youthful step, the untamed look of the eyes glistening from\r\nunder the white kerchief, and the firm stately build of the young\r\nbeauty, struck Olenin even more powerfully than before. \'Yes, it must\r\nbe SHE,\' he thought, and troubling his head still less about the\r\nlodgings, he kept looking round at Maryanka as he approached Vanyusha.\r\n\r\n\'There you see, the girl too is quite savage, just like a wild filly!\'\r\nsaid Vanyusha, who though still busy with the luggage wagon had now\r\ncheered up a bit. \'LA FAME!\' he added in a loud triumphant voice and\r\nburst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards evening the master of the house returned from his fishing, and\r\nhaving learnt that the cadet would pay for the lodging, pacified the\r\nold woman and satisfied Vanyusha\'s demands.\r\n\r\nEverything was arranged in the new quarters. Their hosts moved into the\r\nwinter hut and let their summer hut to the cadet for three rubles a\r\nmonth. Olenin had something to eat and went to sleep. Towards evening\r\nhe woke up, washed and made himself tidy, dined, and having lit a\r\ncigarette sat down by the window that looked onto the street. It was\r\ncooler. The slanting shadow of the hut with its ornamental gables fell\r\nacross the dusty road and even bent upwards at the base of the wall of\r\nthe house opposite. The steep reed-thatched roof of that house shone in\r\nthe rays of the setting sun. The air grew fresher. Everything was\r\npeaceful in the village. The soldiers had settled down and become\r\nquiet. The herds had not yet been driven home and the people had not\r\nreturned from their work.\r\n\r\nOlenin\'s lodging was situated almost at the end of the village. At rare\r\nintervals, from somewhere far beyond the Terek in those parts whence\r\nOlenin had just come (the Chechen or the Kumytsk plain), came muffled\r\nsounds of firing. Olenin was feeling very well contented after three\r\nmonths of bivouac life. His newly washed face was fresh and his\r\npowerful body clean (an unaccustomed sensation after the campaign) and\r\nin all his rested limbs he was conscious of a feeling of tranquillity\r\nand strength. His mind, too, felt fresh and clear. He thought of the\r\ncampaign and of past dangers. He remembered that he had faced them no\r\nworse than other men, and that he was accepted as a comrade among\r\nvaliant Caucasians. His Moscow recollections were left behind Heaven\r\nknows how far! The old life was wiped out and a quite new life had\r\nbegun in which there were as yet no mistakes. Here as a new man among\r\nnew men he could gain a new and good reputation. He was conscious of a\r\nyouthful and unreasoning joy of life. Looking now out of the window at\r\nthe boys spinning their tops in the shadow of the house, now round his\r\nneat new lodging, he thought how pleasantly he would settle down to\r\nthis new Cossack village life. Now and then he glanced at the mountains\r\nand the blue sky, and an appreciation of the solemn grandeur of nature\r\nmingled with his reminiscences and dreams. His new life had begun, not\r\nas he imagined it would when he left Moscow, but unexpectedly well.\r\n\'The mountains, the mountains, the mountains!\' they permeated all his\r\nthoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s kissed his dog and licked the jug! ... Daddy Eroshka has kissed\r\nhis dog!\' suddenly the little Cossacks who had been spinning their tops\r\nunder the window shouted, looking towards the side street. \'He\'s drunk\r\nhis bitch, and his dagger!\' shouted the boys, crowding together and\r\nstepping backwards.\r\n\r\nThese shouts were addressed to Daddy Eroshka, who with his gun on his\r\nshoulder and some pheasants hanging at his girdle was returning from\r\nhis shooting expedition.\r\n\r\n\'I have done wrong, lads, I have!\' he said, vigorously swinging his\r\narms and looking up at the windows on both sides of the street. \'I have\r\ndrunk the bitch; it was wrong,\' he repeated, evidently vexed but\r\npretending not to care.\r\n\r\nOlenin was surprised by the boys\' behavior towards the old hunter, but\r\nwas still more struck by the expressive, intelligent face and the\r\npowerful build of the man whom they called Daddy Eroshka.\r\n\r\n\'Here Daddy, here Cossack!\' he called. \'Come here!\'\r\n\r\nThe old man looked into the window and stopped.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, good man,\' he said, lifting his little cap off his\r\ncropped head.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, good man,\' replied Olenin. \'What is it the youngsters\r\nare shouting at you?\'\r\n\r\nDaddy Eroshka came up to the window. \'Why, they\'re teasing the old man.\r\nNo matter, I like it. Let them joke about their old daddy,\' he said\r\nwith those firm musical intonations with which old and venerable people\r\nspeak. \'Are you an army commander?\' he added.\r\n\r\n\'No, I am a cadet. But where did you kill those pheasants?\' asked\r\nOlenin.\r\n\r\n\'I dispatched these three hens in the forest,\' answered the old man,\r\nturning his broad back towards the window to show the hen pheasants\r\nwhich were hanging with their heads tucked into his belt and staining\r\nhis coat with blood. \'Haven\'t you seen any?\' he asked. \'Take a brace if\r\nyou like! Here you are,\' and he handed two of the pheasants in at the\r\nwindow. \'Are you a sportsman yourself?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'I am. During the campaign I killed four myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Four? What a lot!\' said the old man sarcastically. \'And are you a\r\ndrinker? Do you drink CHIKHIR?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not? I like a drink.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I see you are a trump! We shall be KUNAKS, you and I,\' said Daddy\r\nEroshka.\r\n\r\n\'Step in,\' said Olenin. \'We\'ll have a drop of CHIKHIR.\'\r\n\r\n\'I might as well,\' said the old man, \'but take the pheasants.\' The old\r\nman\'s face showed that he liked the cadet. He had seen at once that he\r\ncould get free drinks from him, and that therefore it would be all\r\nright to give him a brace of pheasants.\r\n\r\nSoon Daddy Eroshka\'s figure appeared in the doorway of the hut, and it\r\nwas only then that Olenin became fully conscious of the enormous size\r\nand sturdy build of this man, whose red-brown face with its perfectly\r\nwhite broad beard was all furrowed by deep lines produced by age and\r\ntoil. For an old man, the muscles of his legs, arms, and shoulders were\r\nquite exceptionally large and prominent. There were deep scars on his\r\nhead under the short-cropped hair. His thick sinewy neck was covered\r\nwith deep intersecting folds like a bull\'s. His horny hands were\r\nbruised and scratched. He stepped lightly and easily over the\r\nthreshold, unslung his gun and placed it in a corner, and casting a\r\nrapid glance round the room noted the value of the goods and chattels\r\ndeposited in the hut, and with out-turned toes stepped softly, in his\r\nsandals of raw hide, into the middle of the room. He brought with him a\r\npenetrating but not unpleasant smell of CHIKHIR wine, vodka, gunpowder,\r\nand congealed blood.\r\n\r\nDaddy Eroshka bowed down before the icons, smoothed his beard, and\r\napproaching Olenin held out his thick brown hand. \'Koshkildy,\' said he;\r\nThat is Tartar for "Good-day"--"Peace be unto you," it means in their\r\ntongue.\'\r\n\r\n\'Koshkildy, I know,\' answered Olenin, shaking hands.\r\n\r\n\'Eh, but you don\'t, you won\'t know the right order! Fool!\' said Daddy\r\nEroshka, shaking his head reproachfully. \'If anyone says "Koshkildy" to\r\nyou, you must say "Allah rasi bo sun," that is, "God save you." That\'s\r\nthe way, my dear fellow, and not "Koshkildy." But I\'ll teach you all\r\nabout it. We had a fellow here, Elias Mosevich, one of your Russians,\r\nhe and I were kunaks. He was a trump, a drunkard, a thief, a\r\nsportsman--and what a sportsman! I taught him everything.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what will you teach me?\' asked Olenin, who was becoming more and\r\nmore interested in the old man.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll take you hunting and teach you to fish. I\'ll show you Chechens\r\nand find a girl for you, if you like--even that! That\'s the sort I am!\r\nI\'m a wag!\'--and the old man laughed. \'I\'ll sit down. I\'m tired.\r\nKarga?\' he added inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\'And what does "Karga" mean?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Why, that means "All right" in Georgian. But I say it just so. It is a\r\nway I have, it\'s my favourite word. Karga, Karga. I say it just so; in\r\nfun I mean. Well, lad, won\'t you order the chikhir? You\'ve got an\r\norderly, haven\'t you? Hey, Ivan!\' shouted the old man. \'All your\r\nsoldiers are Ivans. Is yours Ivan?\'\r\n\r\n\'True enough, his name is Ivan--Vanyusha. Here Vanyusha! Please get\r\nsome chikhir from our landlady and bring it here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ivan or Vanyusha, that\'s all one. Why are all your soldiers Ivans?\r\nIvan, old fellow,\' said the old man, \'you tell them to give you some\r\nfrom the barrel they have begun. They have the best chikhir in the\r\nvillage. But don\'t give more than thirty kopeks for the quart, mind,\r\nbecause that witch would be only too glad.... Our people are anathema\r\npeople; stupid people,\' Daddy Eroshka continued in a confidential tone\r\nafter Vanyusha had gone out. \'They do not look upon you as on men, you\r\nare worse than a Tartar in their eyes. "Worldly Russians" they say. But\r\nas for me, though you are a soldier you are still a man, and have a\r\nsoul in you. Isn\'t that right? Elias Mosevich was a soldier, yet what a\r\ntreasure of a man he was! Isn\'t that so, my dear fellow? That\'s why our\r\npeople don\'t like me; but I don\'t care! I\'m a merry fellow, and I like\r\neverybody. I\'m Eroshka; yes, my dear fellow.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the old Cossack patted the young man affectionately on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n\r\nVanyusha, who meanwhile had finished his housekeeping arrangements and\r\nhad even been shaved by the company\'s barber and had pulled his\r\ntrousers out of his high boots as a sign that the company was stationed\r\nin comfortable quarters, was in excellent spirits. He looked\r\nattentively but not benevolently at Eroshka, as at a wild beast he had\r\nnever seen before, shook his head at the floor which the old man had\r\ndirtied and, having taken two bottles from under a bench, went to the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, kind people,\' he said, having made up his mind to be\r\nvery gentle. \'My master has sent me to get some chikhir. Will you draw\r\nsome for me, good folk?\'\r\n\r\nThe old woman gave no answer. The girl, who was arranging the kerchief\r\non her head before a little Tartar mirror, looked round at Vanyusha in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll pay money for it, honoured people,\' said Vanyusha, jingling the\r\ncoppers in his pocket. \'Be kind to us and we, too will be kind to you,\'\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n\'How much?\' asked the old woman abruptly. \'A quart.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go, my own, draw some for them,\' said Granny Ulitka to her daughter.\r\n\'Take it from the cask that\'s begun, my precious.\'\r\n\r\nThe girl took the keys and a decanter and went out of the hut with\r\nVanyusha.\r\n\r\n\'Tell me, who is that young woman?\' asked Olenin, pointing to Maryanka,\r\nwho was passing the window. The old man winked and nudged the young man\r\nwith his elbow.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a bit,\' said he and reached out of the window. \'Khm,\' he coughed,\r\nand bellowed, \'Maryanka dear. Hallo, Maryanka, my girlie, won\'t you\r\nlove me, darling? I\'m a wag,\' he added in a whisper to Olenin. The\r\ngirl, not turning her head and swinging her arms regularly and\r\nvigorously, passed the window with the peculiarly smart and bold gait\r\nof a Cossack woman and only turned her dark shaded eyes slowly towards\r\nthe old man.\r\n\r\n\'Love me and you\'ll be happy,\' shouted Eroshka, winking, and he looked\r\nquestioningly at the cadet.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a fine fellow, I\'m a wag!\' he added. \'She\'s a regular queen, that\r\ngirl. Eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'She is lovely,\' said Olenin. \'Call her here!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' said the old man. \'For that one a match is being arranged\r\nwith Lukashka, Luke, a fine Cossack, a brave, who killed an abrek the\r\nother day. I\'ll find you a better one. I\'ll find you one that will be\r\nall dressed up in silk and silver. Once I\'ve said it I\'ll do it. I\'ll\r\nget you a regular beauty!\'\r\n\r\n\'You, an old man--and say such things,\' replied Olenin. \'Why, it\'s a\r\nsin!\'\r\n\r\n\'A sin? Where\'s the sin?\' said the old man emphatically. \'A sin to look\r\nat a nice girl? A sin to have some fun with her? Or is it a sin to love\r\nher? Is that so in your parts? ... No, my dear fellow, it\'s not a sin,\r\nit\'s salvation! God made you and God made the girl too. He made it all;\r\nso it is no sin to look at a nice girl. That\'s what she was made for;\r\nto be loved and to give joy. That\'s how I judge it, my good fellow.\'\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the yard and entered a cool dark storeroom filled with\r\nbarrels, Maryanka went up to one of them and repeating the usual prayer\r\nplunged a dipper into it. Vanyusha standing in the doorway smiled as he\r\nlooked at her. He thought it very funny that she had only a smock on,\r\nclose-fitting behind and tucked up in front, and still funnier that she\r\nwore a necklace of silver coins. He thought this quite un-Russian and\r\nthat they would all laugh in the serfs\' quarters at home if they saw a\r\ngirl like that. \'La fille comme c\'est tres bien, for a change,\' he\r\nthought. \'I\'ll tell that to my master.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you standing in the light for, you devil!\' the girl suddenly\r\nshouted. \'Why don\'t you pass me the decanter!\'\r\n\r\nHaving filled the decanter with cool red wine, Maryanka handed it to\r\nVanyusha.\r\n\r\n\'Give the money to Mother,\' she said, pushing away the hand in which he\r\nheld the money.\r\n\r\nVanyusha laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Why are you so cross, little dear?\' he said good-naturedly,\r\nirresolutely shuffling with his feet while the girl was covering the\r\nbarrel.\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\'And you! Are you kind?\'\r\n\r\n\'We, my master and I, are very kind,\' Vanyusha answered decidedly. \'We\r\nare so kind that wherever we have stayed our hosts were always very\r\ngrateful. It\'s because he\'s generous.\'\r\n\r\nThe girl stood listening.\r\n\r\n\'And is your master married?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'No. The master is young and unmarried, because noble gentlemen can\r\nnever marry young,\' said Vanyusha didactically.\r\n\r\n\'A likely thing! See what a fed-up buffalo he is--and too young to\r\nmarry! Is he the chief of you all?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'My master is a cadet; that means he\'s not yet an officer, but he\'s\r\nmore important than a general--he\'s an important man! Because not only\r\nour colonel, but the Tsar himself, knows him,\' proudly explained\r\nVanyusha. \'We are not like those other beggars in the line regiment,\r\nand our papa himself was a Senator. He had more than a thousand serfs,\r\nall his own, and they send us a thousand rubles at a time. That\'s why\r\neveryone likes us. Another may be a captain but have no money. What\'s\r\nthe use of that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Go away. I\'ll lock up,\' said the girl, interrupting him.\r\n\r\nVanyusha brought Olenin the wine and announced that \'La fille c\'est\r\ntres joulie,\' and, laughing stupidly, at once went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tattoo had sounded in the village square. The people had\r\nreturned from their work. The herd lowed as in clouds of golden dust it\r\ncrowded at the village gate. The girls and the women hurried through\r\nthe streets and yards, turning in their cattle. The sun had quite\r\nhidden itself behind the distant snowy peaks. One pale bluish shadow\r\nspread over land and sky. Above the darkened gardens stars just\r\ndiscernible were kindling, and the sounds were gradually hushed in the\r\nvillage. The cattle having been attended to and left for the night, the\r\nwomen came out and gathered at the corners of the streets and, cracking\r\nsunflower seeds with their teeth, settled down on the earthen\r\nembankments of the houses. Later on Maryanka, having finished milking\r\nthe buffalo and the other two cows, also joined one of these groups.\r\n\r\nThe group consisted of several women and girls and one old Cossack man.\r\n\r\nThey were talking about the abrek who had been killed.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack was narrating and the women questioning him.\r\n\r\n\'I expect he\'ll get a handsome reward,\' said one of the women.\r\n\r\n\'Of course. It\'s said that they\'ll send him a cross.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mosev did try to wrong him. Took the gun away from him, but the\r\nauthorities at Kizlyar heard of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'A mean creature that Mosev is!\'\r\n\r\n\'They say Lukashka has come home,\' remarked one of the girls.\r\n\r\n\'He and Nazarka are merry-making at Yamka\'s.\' (Yamka was an unmarried,\r\ndisreputable Cossack woman who kept an illicit pot-house.) \'I heard say\r\nthey had drunk half a pailful.\'\r\n\r\n\'What luck that Snatcher has,\' somebody remarked. \'A real snatcher. But\r\nthere\'s no denying he\'s a fine lad, smart enough for anything, a\r\nright-minded lad! His father was just such another. Daddy Kiryak was:\r\nhe takes after his father. When he was killed the whole village howled.\r\nLook, there they are,\' added the speaker, pointing to the Cossacks who\r\nwere coming down the street towards them.\r\n\r\n\'And Ergushov has managed to come along with them too! The drunkard!\'\r\n\r\nLukashka, Nazarka, and Ergushov, having emptied half a pail of vodka,\r\nwere coming towards the girls. The faces of all three, but especially\r\nthat of the old Cossack, were redder than usual. Ergushov was reeling\r\nand kept laughing and nudging Nazarka in the ribs.\r\n\r\n\'Why are you not singing?\' he shouted to the girls. \'Sing to our\r\nmerry-making, I tell you!\'\r\n\r\nThey were welcomed with the words, \'Had a good day? Had a good day?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why sing? It\'s not a holiday,\' said one of the women. \'You\'re tight,\r\nso you go and sing.\'\r\n\r\nErgushov roared with laughter and nudged Nazarka. \'You\'d better sing.\r\nAnd I\'ll begin too. I\'m clever, I tell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you asleep, fair ones?\' said Nazarka. \'We\'ve come from the cordon\r\nto drink your health. We\'ve already drunk Lukashka\'s health.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka, when he reached the group, slowly raised his cap and stopped\r\nin front of the girls. His broad cheekbones and neck were red. He stood\r\nand spoke softly and sedately, but in his tranquillity and sedateness\r\nthere was more of animation and strength than in all Nazarka\'s\r\nloquacity and bustle. He reminded one of a playful colt that with a\r\nsnort and a flourish of its tail suddenly stops short and stands as\r\nthough nailed to the ground with all four feet. Lukashka stood quietly\r\nin front of the girls, his eyes laughed, and he spoke but little as he\r\nglanced now at his drunken companions and now at the girls. When\r\nMaryanka joined the group he raised his cap with a firm deliberate\r\nmovement, moved out of her way and then stepped in front of her with\r\none foot a little forward and with his thumbs in his belt, fingering\r\nhis dagger. Maryanka answered his greeting with a leisurely bow of her\r\nhead, settled down on the earth-bank, and took some seeds out of the\r\nbosom of her smock. Lukashka, keeping his eyes fixed on Maryanka,\r\nslowly cracked seeds and spat out the shells. All were quiet when\r\nMaryanka joined the group.\r\n\r\n\'Have you come for long?\' asked a woman, breaking the silence.\r\n\r\n\'Till to-morrow morning,\' quietly replied Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'Well, God grant you get something good,\' said the Cossack; \'I\'m glad\r\nof it, as I\'ve just been saying.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I say so too,\' put in the tipsy Ergushov, laughing. \'What a lot of\r\nvisitors have come,\' he added, pointing to a soldier who was passing\r\nby. \'The soldiers\' vodka is good--I like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'They\'ve sent three of the devils to us,\' said one of the women.\r\n\'Grandad went to the village Elders, but they say nothing can be done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, ha! Have you met with trouble?\' said Ergushov.\r\n\r\n\'I expect they have smoked you out with their tobacco?\' asked another\r\nwoman. \'Smoke as much as you like in the yard, I say, but we won\'t\r\nallow it inside the hut. Not if the Elder himself comes, I won\'t allow\r\nit. Besides, they may rob you. He\'s not quartered any of them on\r\nhimself, no fear, that devil\'s son of an Elder.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t like it?\' Ergushov began again.\r\n\r\n\'And I\'ve also heard say that the girls will have to make the soldiers\'\r\nbeds and offer them chikhir and honey,\' said Nazarka, putting one foot\r\nforward and tilting his cap like Lukashka.\r\n\r\nErgushov burst into a roar of laughter, and seizing the girl nearest to\r\nhim, he embraced her. \'I tell you true.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now then, you black pitch!\' squealed the girl, \'I\'ll tell your old\r\nwoman.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell her,\' shouted he. \'That\'s quite right what Nazarka says; a\r\ncircular has been sent round. He can read, you know. Quite true!\' And\r\nhe began embracing the next girl.\r\n\r\n\'What are you up to, you beast?\' squealed the rosy, round-faced\r\nUstenka, laughing and lifting her arm to hit him.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack stepped aside and nearly fell.\r\n\r\n\'There, they say girls have no strength, and you nearly killed me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Get away, you black pitch, what devil has brought you from the\r\ncordon?\' said Ustenka, and turning away from him she again burst out\r\nlaughing. \'You were asleep and missed the abrek, didn\'t you? Suppose he\r\nhad done for you it would have been all the better.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'d have howled, I expect,\' said Nazarka, laughing.\r\n\r\n\'Howled! A likely thing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just look, she doesn\'t care. She\'d howl, Nazarka, eh? Would she?\' said\r\nErgushov.\r\n\r\nLukishka all this time had stood silently looking at Maryanka. His gaze\r\nevidently confused the girl.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Maryanka! I hear they\'ve quartered one of the chiefs on you?\' he\r\nsaid, drawing nearer.\r\n\r\nMaryanka, as was her wont, waited before she replied, and slowly\r\nraising her eyes looked at the Cossack. Lukashka\'s eyes were laughing\r\nas if something special, apart from what was said, was taking place\r\nbetween himself and the girl.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it\'s all right for them as they have two huts,\' replied an old\r\nwoman on Maryanka\'s behalf, \'but at Fomushkin\'s now they also have one\r\nof the chiefs quartered on them and they say one whole corner is packed\r\nfull with his things, and the family have no room left. Was such a\r\nthing ever heard of as that they should turn a whole horde loose in the\r\nvillage?\' she said. \'And what the plague are they going to do here?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve heard say they\'ll build a bridge across the Terek,\' said one of\r\nthe girls.\r\n\r\n\'And I\'ve been told that they will dig a pit to put the girls in\r\nbecause they don\'t love the lads,\' said Nazarka, approaching Ustenka;\r\nand he again made a whimsical gesture which set everybody laughing, and\r\nErgushov, passing by Maryanka, who was next in turn, began to embrace\r\nan old woman.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t you hug Maryanka? You should do it to each in turn,\' said\r\nNazarka.\r\n\r\n\'No, my old one is sweeter,\' shouted the Cossack, kissing the\r\nstruggling old woman.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll throttle me,\' she screamed, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe tramp of regular footsteps at the other end of the street\r\ninterrupted their laughter. Three soldiers in their cloaks, with their\r\nmuskets on their shoulders, were marching in step to relieve guard by\r\nthe ammunition wagon.\r\n\r\nThe corporal, an old cavalry man, looked angrily at the Cossacks and\r\nled his men straight along the road where Lukashka and Nazarka were\r\nstanding, so that they should have to get out of the way. Nazarka\r\nmoved, but Lukashka only screwed up his eyes and turned his broad back\r\nwithout moving from his place.\r\n\r\n\'People are standing here, so you go round,\' he muttered, half turning\r\nhis head and tossing it contemptuously in the direction of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers passed by in silence, keeping step regularly along the\r\ndusty road.\r\n\r\nMaryanka began laughing and all the other girls chimed in.\r\n\r\n\'What swells!\' said Nazarka, \'Just like long-skirted choristers,\' and\r\nhe walked a few steps down the road imitating the soldiers.\r\n\r\nAgain everyone broke into peals of laughter.\r\n\r\nLukashka came slowly up to Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'And where have you put up the chief?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nMaryanka thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve let him have the new hut,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'And is he old or young,\' asked Lukashka, sitting down beside her.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think I\'ve asked?\' answered the girl. \'I went to get him some\r\nchikhir and saw him sitting at the window with Daddy Eroshka.\r\nRed-headed he seemed. They\'ve brought a whole cartload of things.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she dropped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, how glad I am that I got leave from the cordon!\' said Lukashka,\r\nmoving closer to the girl and looking straight in her eyes all the time.\r\n\r\n\'And have you come for long?\' asked Maryanka, smiling slightly.\r\n\r\n\'Till the morning. Give me some sunflower seeds,\' he said, holding out\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nMaryanka now smiled outright and unfastened the neckband of her smock.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t take them all,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Really I felt so dull all the time without you, I swear I did,\' he\r\nsaid in a calm, restrained whisper, helping himself to some seeds out\r\nof the bosom of the girl\'s smock, and stooping still closer over her he\r\ncontinued with laughing eyes to talk to her in low tones.\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t come, I tell you,\' Maryanka suddenly said aloud, leaning away\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\'No really ... what I wanted to say to you, ...\' whispered Lukashka.\r\n\'By the Heavens! Do come!\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka shook her head, but did so with a smile.\r\n\r\n\'Nursey Maryanka! Hallo Nursey! Mammy is calling! Supper time!\' shouted\r\nMaryanka\'s little brother, running towards the group.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m coming,\' replied the girl. \'Go, my dear, go alone--I\'ll come in a\r\nminute.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka rose and raised his cap.\r\n\r\n\'I expect I had better go home too, that will be best,\' he said, trying\r\nto appear unconcerned but hardly able to repress a smile, and he\r\ndisappeared behind the corner of the house.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile night had entirely enveloped the village. Bright stars were\r\nscattered over the dark sky. The streets became dark and empty. Nazarka\r\nremained with the women on the earth-bank and their laughter was still\r\nheard, but Lukashka, having slowly moved away from the girls, crouched\r\ndown like a cat and then suddenly started running lightly, holding his\r\ndagger to steady it: not homeward, however, but towards the cornet\'s\r\nhouse. Having passed two streets he turned into a lane and lifting the\r\nskirt of his coat sat down on the ground in the shadow of a fence. \'A\r\nregular cornet\'s daughter!\' he thought about Maryanka. \'Won\'t even have\r\na lark--the devil! But just wait a bit.\'\r\n\r\nThe approaching footsteps of a woman attracted his attention. He began\r\nlistening, and laughed all by himself. Maryanka with bowed head,\r\nstriking the pales of the fences with a switch, was walking with rapid\r\nregular strides straight towards him. Lukashka rose. Maryanka started\r\nand stopped.\r\n\r\n\'What an accursed devil! You frightened me! So you have not gone home?\'\r\nshe said, and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\nLukashka put one arm round her and with the other hand raised her face.\r\n\'What I wanted to tell you, by Heaven!\' his voice trembled and broke.\r\n\r\n\'What are you talking of, at night time!\' answered Maryanka. \'Mother is\r\nwaiting for me, and you\'d better go to your sweetheart.\'\r\n\r\nAnd freeing herself from his arms she ran away a few steps. When she\r\nhad reached the wattle fence of her home she stopped and turned to the\r\nCossack who was running beside her and still trying to persuade her to\r\nstay a while with him.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what do you want to say, midnight-gadabout?\' and she again began\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t laugh at me, Maryanka! By the Heaven! Well, what if I have a\r\nsweetheart? May the devil take her! Only say the word and now I\'ll love\r\nyou--I\'ll do anything you wish. Here they are!\' and he jingled the\r\nmoney in his pocket. \'Now we can live splendidly. Others have\r\npleasures, and I? I get no pleasure from you, Maryanka dear!\'\r\n\r\nThe girl did not answer. She stood before him breaking her switch into\r\nlittle bits with a rapid movement of her fingers.\r\n\r\nLukashka suddenly clenched his teeth and fists.\r\n\r\n\'And why keep waiting and waiting? Don\'t I love you, darling? You can\r\ndo what you like with me,\' said he suddenly, frowning angrily and\r\nseizing both her hands.\r\n\r\nThe calm expression of Maryanka\'s face and voice did not change.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t bluster, Lukashka, but listen to me,\' she answered, not pulling\r\naway her hands but holding the Cossack at arm\'s length. \'It\'s true I am\r\na girl, but you listen to me! It does not depend on me, but if you love\r\nme I\'ll tell you this. Let go my hands, I\'ll tell you without.--I\'ll\r\nmarry you, but you\'ll never get any nonsense from me,\' said Maryanka\r\nwithout turning her face.\r\n\r\n\'What, you\'ll marry me? Marriage does not depend on us. Love me\r\nyourself, Maryanka dear,\' said Lukashka, from sullen and furious\r\nbecoming again gentle, submissive, and tender, and smiling as he looked\r\nclosely into her eyes.\r\n\r\nMaryanka clung to him and kissed him firmly on the lips.\r\n\r\n\'Brother dear!\' she whispered, pressing him convulsively to her. Then,\r\nsuddenly tearing herself away, she ran into the gate of her house\r\nwithout looking round.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Cossack\'s entreaties to wait another minute to hear\r\nwhat he had to say, Maryanka did not stop.\r\n\r\n\'Go,\' she cried, \'you\'ll be seen! I do believe that devil, our lodger,\r\nis walking about the yard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cornet\'s daughter,\' thought Lukashka. \'She will marry me. Marriage is\r\nall very well, but you just love me!\'\r\n\r\nHe found Nazarka at Yamka\'s house, and after having a spree with him\r\nwent to Dunayka\'s house, where, in spite of her not being faithful to\r\nhim, he spent the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that Olenin had been walking about the yard when\r\nMaryanka entered the gate, and had heard her say, \'That devil, our\r\nlodger, is walking about.\' He had spent that evening with Daddy Eroshka\r\nin the porch of his new lodging. He had had a table, a samovar, wine,\r\nand a candle brought out, and over a cup of tea and a cigar he listened\r\nto the tales the old man told seated on the threshold at his feet.\r\nThough the air was still, the candle dripped and flickered: now\r\nlighting up the post of the porch, now the table and crockery, now the\r\ncropped white head of the old man. Moths circled round the flame and,\r\nshedding the dust of their wings, fluttered on the table and in the\r\nglasses, flew into the candle flame, and disappeared in the black space\r\nbeyond. Olenin and Eroshka had emptied five bottles of chikhir. Eroshka\r\nfilled the glasses every time, offering one to Olenin, drinking his\r\nhealth, and talking untiringly. He told of Cossack life in the old\r\ndays: of his father, \'The Broad\', who alone had carried on his back a\r\nboar\'s carcass weighing three hundredweight, and drank two pails of\r\nchikhir at one sitting. He told of his own days and his chum Girchik,\r\nwith whom during the plague he used to smuggle felt cloaks across the\r\nTerek. He told how one morning he had killed two deer, and about his\r\n\'little soul\' who used to run to him at the cordon at night. He told\r\nall this so eloquently and picturesquely that Olenin did not notice how\r\ntime passed. \'Ah yes, my dear fellow, you did not know me in my golden\r\ndays; then I\'d have shown you things. Today it\'s "Eroshka licks the\r\njug", but then Eroshka was famous in the whole regiment. Whose was the\r\nfinest horse? Who had a Gurda sword? To whom should one go to get a\r\ndrink? With whom go on the spree? Who should be sent to the mountains\r\nto kill Ahmet Khan? Why, always Eroshka! Whom did the girls love?\r\nAlways Eroshka had to answer for it. Because I was a real brave: a\r\ndrinker, a thief (I used to seize herds of horses in the mountains), a\r\nsinger; I was a master of every art! There are no Cossacks like that\r\nnowadays. It\'s disgusting to look at them. When they\'re that high\r\n[Eroshka held his hand three feet from the ground] they put on idiotic\r\nboots and keep looking at them--that\'s all the pleasure they know. Or\r\nthey\'ll drink themselves foolish, not like men but all wrong. And who\r\nwas I? I was Eroshka, the thief; they knew me not only in this village\r\nbut up in the mountains. Tartar princes, my kunaks, used to come to see\r\nme! I used to be everybody\'s kunak. If he was a Tartar--with a Tartar;\r\nan Armenian--with an Armenian; a soldier--with a soldier; an\r\nofficer--with an officer! I didn\'t care as long as he was a drinker. He\r\nsays you should cleanse yourself from intercourse with the world, not\r\ndrink with soldiers, not eat with a Tartar.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who says all that?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Why, our teacher! But listen to a Mullah or a Tartar Cadi. He says,\r\n"You unbelieving Giaours, why do you eat pig?" That shows that everyone\r\nhas his own law. But I think it\'s all one. God has made everything for\r\nthe joy of man. There is no sin in any of it. Take example from an\r\nanimal. It lives in the Tartar\'s reeds or in ours. Wherever it happens\r\nto go, there is its home! Whatever God gives it, that it eats! But our\r\npeople say we have to lick red-hot plates in hell for that. And I think\r\nit\'s all a fraud,\' he added after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'What is a fraud?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what the preachers say. We had an army captain in Chervlena who\r\nwas my kunak: a fine fellow just like me. He was killed in Chechnya.\r\nWell, he used to say that the preachers invent all that out of their\r\nown heads. "When you die the grass will grow on your grave and that\'s\r\nall!"\' The old man laughed. \'He was a desperate fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how old are you?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'The Lord only knows! I must be about seventy. When a Tsaritsa reigned\r\nin Russia I was no longer very small. So you can reckon it out. I must\r\nbe seventy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes you must, but you are still a fine fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, thank Heaven I am healthy, quite healthy, except that a woman, a\r\nwitch, has harmed me....\'\r\n\r\n\'How?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, just harmed me.\'\r\n\r\n\'And so when you die the grass will grow?\' repeated Olenin.\r\n\r\nEroshka evidently did not wish to express his thought clearly. He was\r\nsilent for a while.\r\n\r\n\'And what did you think? Drink!\' he shouted suddenly, smiling and\r\nhanding Olenin some wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Well, what was I saying?\' he continued, trying to remember. \'Yes,\r\nthat\'s the sort of man I am. I am a hunter. There is no hunter to equal\r\nme in the whole army. I will find and show you any animal and any bird,\r\nand what and where. I know it all! I have dogs, and two guns, and nets,\r\nand a screen and a hawk. I have everything, thank the Lord! If you are\r\nnot bragging but are a real sportsman, I\'ll show you everything. Do you\r\nknow what a man I am? When I have found a track--I know the animal. I\r\nknow where he will lie down and where he\'ll drink or wallow. I make\r\nmyself a perch and sit there all night watching. What\'s the good of\r\nstaying at home? One only gets into mischief, gets drunk. And here\r\nwomen come and chatter, and boys shout at me--enough to drive one mad.\r\nIt\'s a different matter when you go out at nightfall, choose yourself a\r\nplace, press down the reeds and sit there and stay waiting, like a\r\njolly fellow. One knows everything that goes on in the woods. One looks\r\nup at the sky: the stars move, you look at them and find out from them\r\nhow the time goes. One looks round--the wood is rustling; one goes on\r\nwaiting, now there comes a crackling--a boar comes to rub himself; one\r\nlistens to hear the young eaglets screech and then the cocks give voice\r\nin the village, or the geese. When you hear the geese you know it is\r\nnot yet midnight. And I know all about it! Or when a gun is fired\r\nsomewhere far away, thoughts come to me. One thinks, who is that\r\nfiring? Is it another Cossack like myself who has been watching for\r\nsome animal? And has he killed it? Or only wounded it so that now the\r\npoor thing goes through the reeds smearing them with its blood all for\r\nnothing? I don\'t like that! Oh, how I dislike it! Why injure a beast?\r\nYou fool, you fool! Or one thinks, "Maybe an abrek has killed some\r\nsilly little Cossack." All this passes through one\'s mind. And once as\r\nI sat watching by the river I saw a cradle floating down. It was sound\r\nexcept for one corner which was broken off. Thoughts did come that\r\ntime! I thought some of your soldiers, the devils, must have got into a\r\nTartar village and seized the Chechen women, and one of the devils has\r\nkilled the little one: taken it by its legs, and hit its head against a\r\nwall. Don\'t they do such things? Ah! Men have no souls! And thoughts\r\ncame to me that filled me with pity. I thought: they\'ve thrown away the\r\ncradle and driven the wife out, and her brave has taken his gun and\r\ncome across to our side to rob us. One watches and thinks. And when one\r\nhears a litter breaking through the thicket, something begins to knock\r\ninside one. Dear one, come this way! "They\'ll scent me," one thinks;\r\nand one sits and does not stir while one\'s heart goes dun! dun! dun!\r\nand simply lifts you. Once this spring a fine litter came near me, I\r\nsaw something black. "In the name of the Father and of the Son," and I\r\nwas just about to fire when she grunts to her pigs: "Danger, children,"\r\nshe says, "there\'s a man here," and off they all ran, breaking through\r\nthe bushes. And she had been so close I could almost have bitten her.\'\r\n\r\n\'How could a sow tell her brood that a man was there?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'What do you think? You think the beast\'s a fool? No, he is wiser than\r\na man though you do call him a pig! He knows everything. Take this for\r\ninstance. A man will pass along your track and not notice it; but a pig\r\nas soon as it gets onto your track turns and runs at once: that shows\r\nthere is wisdom in him, since he scents your smell and you don\'t. And\r\nthere is this to be said too: you wish to kill it and it wishes to go\r\nabout the woods alive. You have one law and it has another. It is a\r\npig, but it is no worse than you--it too is God\'s creature. Ah, dear!\r\nMan is foolish, foolish, foolish!\' The old man repeated this several\r\ntimes and then, letting his head drop, he sat thinking.\r\n\r\nOlenin also became thoughtful, and descending from the porch with his\r\nhands behind his back began pacing up and down the yard.\r\n\r\nEroshka, rousing himself, raised his head and began gazing intently at\r\nthe moths circling round the flickering flame of the candle and burning\r\nthemselves in it.\r\n\r\n\'Fool, fool!\' he said. \'Where are you flying to? Fool, fool!\' He rose\r\nand with his thick fingers began to drive away the moths.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll burn, little fool! Fly this way, there\'s plenty of room.\' He\r\nspoke tenderly, trying to catch them delicately by their wings with his\r\nthick fingers and then letting them fly again. \'You are killing\r\nyourself and I am sorry for you!\'\r\n\r\nHe sat a long time chattering and sipping out of the bottle. Olenin\r\npaced up and down the yard. Suddenly he was struck by the sound of\r\nwhispering outside the gate. Involuntarily holding his breath, he heard\r\na woman\'s laughter, a man\'s voice, and the sound of a kiss.\r\nIntentionally rustling the grass under his feet he crossed to the\r\nopposite side of the yard, but after a while the wattle fence creaked.\r\nA Cossack in a dark Circassian coat and a white sheepskin cap passed\r\nalong the other side of the fence (it was Luke), and a tall woman with\r\na white kerchief on her head went past Olenin. \'You and I have nothing\r\nto do with one another\' was what Maryanka\'s firm step gave him to\r\nunderstand. He followed her with his eyes to the porch of the hut, and\r\nhe even saw her through the window take off her kerchief and sit down.\r\nAnd suddenly a feeling of lonely depression and some vague longings and\r\nhopes, and envy of someone or other, overcame the young man\'s soul.\r\n\r\nThe last lights had been put out in the huts. The last sounds had died\r\naway in the village. The wattle fences and the cattle gleaming white in\r\nthe yards, the roofs of the houses and the stately poplars, all seemed\r\nto be sleeping the labourers\' healthy peaceful sleep. Only the\r\nincessant ringing voices of frogs from the damp distance reached the\r\nyoung man. In the east the stars were growing fewer and fewer and\r\nseemed to be melting in the increasing light, but overhead they were\r\ndenser and deeper than before. The old man was dozing with his head on\r\nhis hand. A cock crowed in the yard opposite, but Olenin still paced up\r\nand down thinking of something. The sound of a song sung by several\r\nvoices reached him and he stepped up to the fence and listened. The\r\nvoices of several young Cossacks carolled a merry song, and one voice\r\nwas distinguishable among them all by its firm strength.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know who is singing there?\' said the old man, rousing himself.\r\n\'It is the Brave, Lukashka. He has killed a Chechen and now he\r\nrejoices. And what is there to rejoice at? ... The fool, the fool!\'\r\n\r\n\'And have you ever killed people?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'You devil!\' shouted the old man. \'What are you asking? One must not\r\ntalk so. It is a serious thing to destroy a human being ... Ah, a very\r\nserious thing! Good-bye, my dear fellow. I\'ve eaten my fill and am\r\ndrunk,\' he said rising. \'Shall I come to-morrow to go shooting?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, come!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mind, get up early; if you oversleep you will be fined!\'\r\n\r\n\'Never fear, I\'ll be up before you,\' answered Olenin.\r\n\r\nThe old man left. The song ceased, but one could hear footsteps and\r\nmerry talk. A little later the singing broke out again but farther\r\naway, and Eroshka\'s loud voice chimed in with the other. \'What people,\r\nwhat a life!\' thought Olenin with a sigh as he returned alone to his\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nDaddy Eroshka was a superannuated and solitary Cossack: twenty years\r\nago his wife had gone over to the Orthodox Church and run away from him\r\nand married a Russian sergeant-major, and he had no children. He was\r\nnot bragging when he spoke of himself as having been the boldest\r\ndare-devil in the village when he was young. Everybody in the regiment\r\nknew of his old-time prowess. The death of more than one Russian, as\r\nwell as Chechen, lay on his conscience. He used to go plundering in the\r\nmountains, and robbed the Russians too; and he had twice been in\r\nprison. The greater part of his life was spent in the forests, hunting.\r\nThere he lived for days on a crust of bread and drank nothing but\r\nwater. But on the other hand, when he was in the village he made merry\r\nfrom morning to night. After leaving Olenin he slept for a couple of\r\nhours and awoke before it was light. He lay on his bed thinking of the\r\nman he had become acquainted with the evening before. Olenin\'s\r\n\'simplicity\' (simplicity in the sense of not grudging him a drink)\r\npleased him very much, and so did Olenin himself. He wondered why the\r\nRussians were all \'simple\' and so rich, and why they were educated, and\r\nyet knew nothing. He pondered on these questions and also considered\r\nwhat he might get out of Olenin.\r\n\r\nDaddy Eroshka\'s hut was of a good size and not old, but the absence of\r\na woman was very noticeable in it. Contrary to the usual cleanliness of\r\nthe Cossacks, the whole of this hut was filthy and exceedingly untidy.\r\nA blood-stained coat had been thrown on the table, half a dough-cake\r\nlay beside a plucked and mangled crow with which to feed the hawk.\r\nSandals of raw hide, a gun, a dagger, a little bag, wet clothes, and\r\nsundry rags lay scattered on the benches. In a corner stood a tub with\r\nstinking water, in which another pair of sandals were being steeped,\r\nand near by was a gun and a hunting-screen. On the floor a net had been\r\nthrown down and several dead pheasants lay there, while a hen tied by\r\nits leg was walking about near the table pecking among the dirt. In the\r\nunheated oven stood a broken pot with some kind of milky liquid. On the\r\ntop of the oven a falcon was screeching and trying to break the cord by\r\nwhich it was tied, and a moulting hawk sat quietly on the edge of the\r\noven, looking askance at the hen and occasionally bowing its head to\r\nright and left. Daddy Eroshka himself, in his shirt, lay on his back on\r\na short bed rigged up between the wall and the oven, with his strong\r\nlegs raised and his feet on the oven. He was picking with his thick\r\nfingers at the scratches left on his hands by the hawk, which he was\r\naccustomed to carry without wearing gloves. The whole room, especially\r\nnear the old man, was filled with that strong but not unpleasant\r\nmixture of smells that he always carried about with him.\r\n\r\n\'Uyde-ma, Daddy?\' (Is Daddy in?) came through the window in a sharp\r\nvoice, which he at once recognized as Lukashka\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Uyde, Uyde, Uyde. I am in!\' shouted the old man. \'Come in, neighbour\r\nMark, Luke Mark. Come to see Daddy? On your way to the cordon?\'\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his master\'s shout the hawk flapped his wings and\r\npulled at his cord.\r\n\r\nThe old man was fond of Lukashka, who was the only man he excepted from\r\nhis general contempt for the younger generation of Cossacks. Besides\r\nthat, Lukashka and his mother, as near neighbours, often gave the old\r\nman wine, clotted cream, and other home produce which Eroshka did not\r\npossess. Daddy Eroshka, who all his life had allowed himself to get\r\ncarried away, always explained his infatuations from a practical point\r\nof view. \'Well, why not?\' he used to say to himself. \'I\'ll give them\r\nsome fresh meat, or a bird, and they won\'t forget Daddy: they\'ll\r\nsometimes bring a cake or a piece of pie.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good morning. Mark! I am glad to see you,\' shouted the old man\r\ncheerfully, and quickly putting down his bare feet he jumped off his\r\nbed and walked a step or two along the creaking floor, looked down at\r\nhis out-turned toes, and suddenly, amused by the appearance of his\r\nfeet, smiled, stamped with his bare heel on the ground, stamped again,\r\nand then performed a funny dance-step. \'That\'s clever, eh?\' he asked,\r\nhis small eyes glistening. Lukashka smiled faintly. \'Going back to the\r\ncordon?\' asked the old man.\r\n\r\n\'I have brought the chikhir I promised you when we were at the cordon.\'\r\n\r\n\'May Christ save you!\' said the old man, and he took up the extremely\r\nwide trousers that were lying on the floor, and his beshmet, put them\r\non, fastened a strap round his waist, poured some water from an\r\nearthenware pot over his hands, wiped them on the old trousers,\r\nsmoothed his beard with a bit of comb, and stopped in front of\r\nLukashka. \'Ready,\' he said.\r\n\r\nLukashka fetched a cup, wiped it and filled it with wine, and then\r\nhanded it to the old man.\r\n\r\n\'Your health! To the Father and the Son!\' said the old man, accepting\r\nthe wine with solemnity. \'May you have what you desire, may you always\r\nbe a hero, and obtain a cross.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka also drank a little after repeating a prayer, and then put the\r\nwine on the table. The old man rose and brought out some dried fish\r\nwhich he laid on the threshold, where he beat it with a stick to make\r\nit tender; then, having put it with his horny hands on a blue plate\r\n(his only one), he placed it on the table.\r\n\r\n\'I have all I want. I have victuals, thank God!\' he said proudly.\r\n\'Well, and what of Mosev?\' he added.\r\n\r\nLukashka, evidently wishing to know the old man\'s opinion, told him how\r\nthe officer had taken the gun from him.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind the gun,\' said the old man. \'If you don\'t give the gun you\r\nwill get no reward.\'\r\n\r\n\'But they say. Daddy, it\'s little reward a fellow gets when he is not\r\nyet a mounted Cossack; and the gun is a fine one, a Crimean, worth\r\neighty rubles.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh, let it go! I had a dispute like that with an officer, he wanted my\r\nhorse. "Give it me and you\'ll be made a cornet," says he. I wouldn\'t,\r\nand I got nothing!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Daddy, but you see I have to buy a horse; and they say you can\'t\r\nget one the other side of the river under fifty rubles, and mother has\r\nnot yet sold our wine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh, we didn\'t bother,\' said the old man; \'when Daddy Eroshka was your\r\nage he already stole herds of horses from the Nogay folk and drove them\r\nacross the Terek. Sometimes we\'d give a fine horse for a quart of vodka\r\nor a cloak.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why so cheap?\' asked Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a fool, a fool, Mark,\' said the old man contemptuously. \'Why,\r\nthat\'s what one steals for, so as not to be stingy! As for you, I\r\nsuppose you haven\'t so much as seen how one drives off a herd of\r\nhorses? Why don\'t you speak?\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s one to say. Daddy?\' replied Lukashka. \'It seems we are not the\r\nsame sort of men as you were.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a fool. Mark, a fool! "Not the same sort of men!"\' retorted the\r\nold man, mimicking the Cossack lad. \'I was not that sort of Cossack at\r\nyour age.\'\r\n\r\n\'How\'s that?\' asked Lukashka.\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\'Daddy Eroshka was simple; he did not grudge anything! That\'s why I was\r\nkunak with all Chechnya. A kunak would come to visit me and I\'d make\r\nhim drunk with vodka and make him happy and put him to sleep with me,\r\nand when I went to see him I\'d take him a present--a dagger! That\'s the\r\nway it is done, and not as you do nowadays: the only amusement lads\r\nhave now is to crack seeds and spit out the shells!\' the old man\r\nfinished contemptuously, imitating the present-day Cossacks cracking\r\nseeds and spitting out the shells.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know,\' said Lukashka; \'that\'s so!\'\r\n\r\n\'If you wish to be a fellow of the right sort, be a brave and not a\r\npeasant! Because even a peasant can buy a horse--pay the money and take\r\nthe horse.\'\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while.\r\n\r\n\'Well, of course it\'s dull both in the village and the cordon, Daddy:\r\nbut there\'s nowhere one can go for a bit of sport. All our fellows are\r\nso timid. Take Nazarka. The other day when we went to the Tartar\r\nvillage, Girey Khan asked us to come to Nogay to take some horses, but\r\nno one went, and how was I to go alone?\'\r\n\r\n\'And what of Daddy? Do you think I am quite dried up? ... No, I\'m not\r\ndried up. Let me have a horse and I\'ll be off to Nogay at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the good of talking nonsense!\' said Luke. \'You\'d better tell me\r\nwhat to do about Girey Khan. He says, "Only bring horses to the Terek,\r\nand then even if you bring a whole stud I\'ll find a place for them."\r\nYou see he\'s also a shaven-headed Tartar--how\'s one to believe him?\'\r\n\r\n\'You may trust Girey Khan, all his kin were good people. His father too\r\nwas a faithful kunak. But listen to Daddy and I won\'t teach you wrong:\r\nmake him take an oath, then it will be all right. And if you go with\r\nhim, have your pistol ready all the same, especially when it comes to\r\ndividing up the horses. I was nearly killed that way once by a Chechen.\r\nI wanted ten rubles from him for a horse. Trusting is all right, but\r\ndon\'t go to sleep without a gun.\' Lukashka listened attentively to the\r\nold man.\r\n\r\n\'I say. Daddy, have you any stone-break grass?\' he asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'No, I haven\'t any, but I\'ll teach you how to get it. You\'re a good lad\r\nand won\'t forget the old man.... Shall I tell you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell me, Daddy.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know a tortoise? She\'s a devil, the tortoise is!\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course I know!\'\r\n\r\n\'Find her nest and fence it round so that she can\'t get in. Well,\r\nshe\'ll come, go round it, and then will go off to find the stone-break\r\ngrass and will bring some along and destroy the fence. Anyhow next\r\nmorning come in good time, and where the fence is broken there you\'ll\r\nfind the stone-break grass lying. Take it wherever you like. No lock\r\nand no bar will be able to stop you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you tried it yourself. Daddy?\'\r\n\r\n\'As for trying, I have not tried it, but I was told of it by good\r\npeople. I used only one charm: that was to repeat the Pilgrim rhyme\r\nwhen mounting my horse; and no one ever killed me!\'\r\n\r\n\'What is the Pilgrim rhyme. Daddy?\'\r\n\r\n\'What, don\'t you know it? Oh, what people! You\'re right to ask Daddy.\r\nWell, listen, and repeat after me:\r\n\r\n\'Hail! Ye, living in Sion, This is your King, Our steeds we shall sit\r\non, Sophonius is weeping. Zacharias is speaking, Father Pilgrim,\r\nMankind ever loving.\'\r\n\r\n\'Kind ever loving,\' the old man repeated. \'Do you know it now? Try it.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Come, Daddy, was it that that hindered their killing you? Maybe it\r\njust happened so!\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve grown too clever! You learn it all, and say it. It will do you\r\nno harm. Well, suppose you have sung "Pilgrim", it\'s all right,\' and\r\nthe old man himself began laughing. \'But just one thing, Luke, don\'t\r\nyou go to Nogay!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\'\r\n\r\n\'Times have changed. You are not the same men. You\'ve become rubbishy\r\nCossacks! And see how many Russians have come down on us! You\'d get to\r\nprison. Really, give it up! Just as if you could! Now Girchik and I, we\r\nused...\'\r\n\r\nAnd the old man was about to begin one of his endless tales, but\r\nLukashka glanced at the window and interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\'It is quite light. Daddy. It\'s time to be off. Look us up some day.\'\r\n\r\n\'May Christ save you! I\'ll go to the officer; I promised to take him\r\nout shooting. He seems a good fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Eroshka\'s hut Lukashka went home. As he returned, the dewy mists\r\nwere rising from the ground and enveloped the village. In various\r\nplaces the cattle, though out of sight, could be heard beginning to\r\nstir. The cocks called to one another with increasing frequency and\r\ninsistence. The air was becoming more transparent, and the villagers\r\nwere getting up. Not till he was close to it could Lukishka discern the\r\nfence of his yard, all wet with dew, the porch of the hut, and the open\r\nshed. From the misty yard he heard the sound of an axe chopping wood.\r\nLukashka entered the hut. His mother was up, and stood at the oven\r\nthrowing wood into it. His little sister was still lying in bed asleep.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Lukashka, had enough holiday-making?\' asked his mother softly.\r\n\'Where did you spend the night?\'\r\n\r\n\'I was in the village,\' replied her son reluctantly, reaching for his\r\nmusket, which he drew from its cover and examined carefully.\r\n\r\nHis mother swayed her head.\r\n\r\nLukashka poured a little gunpowder onto the pan, took out a little bag\r\nfrom which he drew some empty cartridge cases which he began filling,\r\ncarefully plugging each one with a ball wrapped in a rag. Then, having\r\ntested the loaded cartridges with his teeth and examined them, he put\r\ndown the bag.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Mother, I told you the bags wanted mending; have they been\r\ndone?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, our dumb girl was mending something last night. Why, is it\r\ntime for you to be going back to the cordon? I haven\'t seen anything of\r\nyou!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, as soon as I have got ready I shall have to go,\' answered\r\nLukashka, tying up the gunpowder. \'And where is our dumb one? Outside?\'\r\n\r\n\'Chopping wood, I expect. She kept fretting for you. "I shall not see\r\nhim at all!" she said. She puts her hand to her face like this, and\r\nclicks her tongue and presses her hands to her heart as much as to\r\nsay--"sorry." Shall I call her in? She understood all about the abrek.\'\r\n\r\n\'Call her,\' said Lukashka. \'And I had some tallow there; bring it: I\r\nmust grease my sword.\'\r\n\r\nThe old woman went out, and a few minutes later Lukashka\'s dumb sister\r\ncame up the creaking steps and entered the hut. She was six years older\r\nthan her brother and would have been extremely like him had it not been\r\nfor the dull and coarsely changeable expression (common to all deaf and\r\ndumb people) of her face. She wore a coarse smock all patched; her feet\r\nwere bare and muddy, and on her head she had an old blue kerchief. Her\r\nneck, arms, and face were sinewy like a peasant\'s. Her clothing and her\r\nwhole appearance indicated that she always did the hard work of a man.\r\nShe brought in a heap of logs which she threw down by the oven. Then\r\nshe went up to her brother, and with a joyful smile which made her\r\nwhole face pucker up, touched him on the shoulder and began making\r\nrapid signs to him with her hands, her face, and whole body.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right, that\'s right, Stepka is a trump!\' answered the brother,\r\nnodding. \'She\'s fetched everything and mended everything, she\'s a\r\ntrump! Here, take this for it!\' He brought out two pieces of\r\ngingerbread from his pocket and gave them to her.\r\n\r\nThe dumb woman\'s face flushed with pleasure, and she began making a\r\nweird noise for joy. Having seized the gingerbread she began to\r\ngesticulate still more rapidly, frequently pointing in one direction\r\nand passing her thick finger over her eyebrows and her face. Lukashka\r\nunderstood her and kept nodding, while he smiled slightly. She was\r\ntelling him to give the girls dainties, and that the girls liked him,\r\nand that one girl, Maryanka--the best of them all--loved him. She\r\nindicated Maryanka by rapidly pointing in the direction of Maryanka\'s\r\nhome and to her own eyebrows and face, and by smacking her lips and\r\nswaying her head. \'Loves\' she expressed by pressing her hands to her\r\nbreast, kissing her hand, and pretending to embrace someone. Their\r\nmother returned to the hut, and seeing what her dumb daughter was\r\nsaying, smiled and shook her head. Her daughter showed her the\r\ngingerbread and again made the noise which expressed joy.\r\n\r\n\'I told Ulitka the other day that I\'d send a matchmaker to them,\' said\r\nthe mother. \'She took my words well.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka looked silently at his mother.\r\n\r\n\'But how about selling the wine, mother? I need a horse.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll cart it when I have time. I must get the barrels ready,\' said the\r\nmother, evidently not wishing her son to meddle in domestic matters.\r\n\'When you go out you\'ll find a bag in the passage. I borrowed from the\r\nneighbours and got something for you to take back to the cordon; or\r\nshall I put it in your saddle-bag?\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' answered Lukashka. \'And if Girey Khan should come across\r\nthe river send him to me at the cordon, for I shan\'t get leave again\r\nfor a long time now; I have some business with him.\'\r\n\r\nHe began to get ready to start.\r\n\r\n\'I will send him on,\' said the old woman. \'It seems you have been\r\nspreeing at Yamka\'s all the time. I went out in the night to see the\r\ncattle, and I think it was your voice I heard singing songs.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka did not reply, but went out into the passage, threw the bags\r\nover his shoulder, tucked up the skirts of his coat, took his musket,\r\nand then stopped for a moment on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, mother!\' he said as he closed the gate behind him. \'Send me\r\na small barrel with Nazarka. I promised it to the lads, and he\'ll call\r\nfor it.\'\r\n\r\n\'May Christ keep you, Lukashka. God be with you! I\'ll send you some,\r\nsome from the new barrel,\' said the old woman, going to the fence: \'But\r\nlisten,\' she added, leaning over the fence.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack stopped.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve been making merry here; well, that\'s all right. Why should not\r\na young man amuse himself? God has sent you luck and that\'s good. But\r\nnow look out and mind, my son. Don\'t you go and get into mischief.\r\nAbove all, satisfy your superiors: one has to! And I will sell the wine\r\nand find money for a horse and will arrange a match with the girl for\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, all right!\' answered her son, frowning.\r\n\r\nHis deaf sister shouted to attract his attention. She pointed to her\r\nhead and the palm of her hand, to indicate the shaved head of a\r\nChechen. Then she frowned, and pretending to aim with a gun, she\r\nshrieked and began rapidly humming and shaking her head. This meant\r\nthat Lukashka should kill another Chechen.\r\n\r\nLukashka understood. He smiled, and shifting the gun at his back under\r\nhis cloak stepped lightly and rapidly, and soon disappeared in the\r\nthick mist.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, having stood a little while at the gate, returned\r\nsilently to the hut and immediately began working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLukasha returned to the cordon and at the same time Daddy Eroshka\r\nwhistled to his dogs and, climbing over his wattle fence, went to\r\nOlenin\'s lodging, passing by the back of the houses (he disliked\r\nmeeting women before going out hunting or shooting). He found Olenin\r\nstill asleep, and even Vanyusha, though awake, was still in bed and\r\nlooking round the room considering whether it was not time to get up,\r\nwhen Daddy Eroshka, gun on shoulder and in full hunter\'s trappings,\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n\'A cudgel!\' he shouted in his deep voice. \'An alarm! The Chechens are\r\nupon us! Ivan! get the samovar ready for your master, and get up\r\nyourself--quick,\' cried the old man. \'That\'s our way, my good man! Why\r\neven the girls are already up! Look out of the window. See, she\'s going\r\nfor water and you\'re still sleeping!\'\r\n\r\nOlenin awoke and jumped up, feeling fresh and lighthearted at the sight\r\nof the old man and at the sound of his voice.\r\n\r\n\'Quick, Vanyusha, quick!\' he cried.\r\n\r\n\'Is that the way you go hunting?\' said the old man. \'Others are having\r\ntheir breakfast and you are asleep! Lyam! Here!\' he called to his dog.\r\n\'Is your gun ready?\' he shouted, as loud as if a whole crowd were in\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s true I\'m guilty, but it can\'t be helped! The powder,\r\nVanyusha, and the wads!\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'A fine!\' shouted the old man.\r\n\r\n\'Du tay voulay vou?\' asked Vanyusha, grinning.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re not one of us--your gabble is not like our speech, you devil!\'\r\nthe old man shouted at Vanyusha, showing the stumps of his teeth.\r\n\r\n\'A first offence must be forgiven,\' said Olenin playfully, drawing on\r\nhis high boots.\r\n\r\n\'The first offence shall be forgiven,\' answered Eroshka, \'but if you\r\noversleep another time you\'ll be fined a pail of chikhir. When it gets\r\nwarmer you won\'t find the deer.\'\r\n\r\n\'And even if we do find him he is wiser than we are,\' said Olenin,\r\nrepeating the words spoken by the old man the evening before, \'and you\r\ncan\'t deceive him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, laugh away! You kill one first, and then you may talk. Now then,\r\nhurry up! Look, there\'s the master himself coming to see you,\' added\r\nEroshka, looking out of the window. \'Just see how he\'s got himself up.\r\nHe\'s put on a new coat so that you should see that he\'s an officer. Ah,\r\nthese people, these people!\'\r\n\r\nSure enough Vanyusha came in and announced that the master of the house\r\nwished to see Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'L\'arjan!\' he remarked profoundly, to forewarn his master of the\r\nmeaning of this visitation. Following him, the master of the house in a\r\nnew Circassian coat with an officer\'s stripes on the shoulders and with\r\npolished boots (quite exceptional among Cossacks) entered the room,\r\nswaying from side to side, and congratulated his lodger on his safe\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nThe cornet, Elias Vasilich, was an educated Cossack. He had been to\r\nRussia proper, was a regimental schoolteacher, and above all he was\r\nnoble. He wished to appear noble, but one could not help feeling\r\nbeneath his grotesque pretence of polish, his affectation, his\r\nself-confidence, and his absurd way of speaking, he was just the same\r\nas Daddy Eroshka. This could also be clearly seen by his sunburnt face\r\nand his hands and his red nose. Olenin asked him to sit down.\r\n\r\n\'Good morning. Father Elias Vasilich,\' said Eroshka, rising with (or so\r\nit seemed to Olenin) an ironically low bow.\r\n\r\n\'Good morning. Daddy. So you\'re here already,\' said the cornet, with a\r\ncareless nod.\r\n\r\nThe cornet was a man of about forty, with a grey pointed beard, skinny\r\nand lean, but handsome and very fresh-looking for his age. Having come\r\nto see Olenin he was evidently afraid of being taken for an ordinary\r\nCossack, and wanted to let Olenin feel his importance from the first.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s our Egyptian Nimrod,\' he remarked, addressing Olenin and\r\npointing to the old man with a self-satisfied smile. \'A mighty hunter\r\nbefore the Lord! He\'s our foremost man on every hand. You\'ve already\r\nbeen pleased to get acquainted with him.\'\r\n\r\nDaddy Eroshka gazed at his feet in their shoes of wet raw hide and\r\nshook his head thoughtfully at the cornet\'s ability and learning, and\r\nmuttered to himself: \'Gyptian Nimvrod! What things he invents!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you see we mean to go hunting,\' answered Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir, exactly,\' said the cornet, \'but I have a small business with\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you want?\'\r\n\r\n\'Seeing that you are a gentleman,\' began the cornet, \'and as I may\r\nunderstand myself to be in the rank of an officer too, and therefore we\r\nmay always progressively negotiate, as gentlemen do.\' (He stopped and\r\nlooked with a smile at Olenin and at the old man.) \'But if you have the\r\ndesire with my consent, then, as my wife is a foolish woman of our\r\nclass, she could not quite comprehend your words of yesterday\'s date.\r\nTherefore my quarters might be let for six rubles to the Regimental\r\nAdjutant, without the stables; but I can always avert that from myself\r\nfree of charge. But, as you desire, therefore I, being myself of an\r\nofficer\'s rank, can come to an agreement with you in everything\r\npersonally, as an inhabitant of this district, not according to our\r\ncustoms, but can maintain the conditions in every way....\'\r\n\r\n\'Speaks clearly!\' muttered the old man.\r\n\r\nThe cornet continued in the same strain for a long time. At last, not\r\nwithout difficulty, Olenin gathered that the cornet wished to let his\r\nrooms to him, Olenin, for six rubles a month. The latter gladly agreed\r\nto this, and offered his visitor a glass of tea. The cornet declined it.\r\n\r\n\'According to our silly custom we consider it a sort of sin to drink\r\nout of a "worldly" tumbler,\' he said. \'Though, of course, with my\r\neducation I may understand, but my wife from her human weakness...\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then, will you have some tea?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you will permit me, I will bring my own particular glass,\' answered\r\nthe cornet, and stepped out into the porch.\r\n\r\n\'Bring me my glass!\' he cried.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the door opened and a young sunburnt arm in a print\r\nsleeve thrust itself in, holding a tumbler in the hand. The cornet went\r\nup, took it, and whispered something to his daughter. Olenin poured tea\r\nfor the cornet into the latter\'s own \'particular\' glass, and for\r\nEroshka into a \'worldly\' glass.\r\n\r\n\'However, I do not desire to detain you,\' said the cornet, scalding his\r\nlips and emptying his tumbler. \'I too have a great liking for fishing,\r\nand I am here, so to say, only on leave of absence for recreation from\r\nmy duties. I too have the desire to tempt fortune and see whether some\r\nGifts of the Terek may not fall to my share. I hope you too will come\r\nand see us and have a drink of our wine, according to the custom of our\r\nvillage,\' he added.\r\n\r\nThe cornet bowed, shook hands with Olenin, and went out. While Olenin\r\nwas getting ready, he heard the cornet giving orders to his family in\r\nan authoritative and sensible tone, and a few minutes later he saw him\r\npass by the window in a tattered coat with his trousers rolled up to\r\nhis knees and a fishing net over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\'A rascal!\' said Daddy Eroshka, emptying his \'worldly\' tumbler. \'And\r\nwill you really pay him six rubles? Was such a thing ever heard of?\r\nThey would let you the best hut in the village for two rubles. What a\r\nbeast! Why, I\'d let you have mine for three!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'ll remain here,\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Six rubles! ... Clearly it\'s a fool\'s money. Eh, eh, eh! answered the\r\nold man. \'Let\'s have some chikhir, Ivan!\'\r\n\r\nHaving had a snack and a drink of vodka to prepare themselves for the\r\nroad, Olenin and the old man went out together before eight o\'clock.\r\n\r\nAt the gate they came up against a wagon to which a pair of oxen were\r\nharnessed. With a white kerchief tied round her head down to her eyes,\r\na coat over her smock, and wearing high boots, Maryanka with a long\r\nswitch in her hand was dragging the oxen by a cord tied to their horns.\r\n\r\n\'Mammy,\' said the old man, pretending that he was going to seize her.\r\n\r\nMaryanka flourished her switch at him and glanced merrily at them both\r\nwith her beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\nOlenin felt still more light-hearted.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, come on, come on,\' he said, throwing his gun on his shoulder\r\nand conscious of the girl\'s eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n\'Gee up!\' sounded Maryanka\'s voice behind them, followed by the creak\r\nof the moving wagon.\r\n\r\nAs long as their road lay through the pastures at the back of the\r\nvillage Eroshka went on talking. He could not forget the cornet and\r\nkept on abusing him.\r\n\r\n\'Why are you so angry with him?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s stingy. I don\'t like it,\' answered the old man. \'He\'ll leave it\r\nall behind when he dies! Then who\'s he saving up for? He\'s built two\r\nhouses, and he\'s got a second garden from his brother by a law-suit.\r\nAnd in the matter of papers what a dog he is! They come to him from\r\nother villages to fill up documents. As he writes it out, exactly so it\r\nhappens. He gets it quite exact. But who is he saving for? He\'s only\r\ngot one boy and the girl; when she\'s married who\'ll be left?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then, he\'s saving up for her dowry,\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'What dowry? The girl is sought after, she\'s a fine girl. But he\'s such\r\na devil that he must yet marry her to a rich fellow. He wants to get a\r\nbig price for her. There\'s Luke, a Cossack, a neighbour and a nephew of\r\nmine, a fine lad. It\'s he who killed the Chechen--he has been wooing\r\nher for a long time, but he hasn\'t let him have her. He\'s given one\r\nexcuse, and another, and a third. "The girl\'s too young," he says. But\r\nI know what he is thinking. He wants to keep them bowing to him. He\'s\r\nbeen acting shamefully about that girl. Still, they will get her for\r\nLukashka, because he is the best Cossack in the village, a brave, who\r\nhas killed an abrek and will be rewarded with a cross.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how about this? When I was walking up and down the yard last\r\nnight, I saw my landlord\'s daughter and some Cossack kissing,\' said\r\nOlenin.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re pretending!\' cried the old man, stopping.\r\n\r\n\'On my word,\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Women are the devil,\' said Eroshka pondering. \'But what Cossack was\r\nit?\'\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t see.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, what sort of a cap had he, a white one?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'And a red coat? About your height?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, a bit taller.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s he!\' and Eroshka burst out laughing. \'It\'s himself, it\'s Mark. He\r\nis Luke, but I call him Mark for a joke. His very self! I love him. I\r\nwas just such a one myself. What\'s the good of minding them? My\r\nsweetheart used to sleep with her mother and her sister-in-law, but I\r\nmanaged to get in. She used to sleep upstairs; that witch her mother\r\nwas a regular demon; it\'s awful how she hated me. Well, I used to come\r\nwith a chum, Girchik his name was. We\'d come under her window and I\'d\r\nclimb on his shoulders, push up the window and begin groping about. She\r\nused to sleep just there on a bench. Once I woke her up and she nearly\r\ncalled out. She hadn\'t recognized me. "Who is there?" she said, and I\r\ncould not answer. Her mother was even beginning to stir, but I took off\r\nmy cap and shoved it over her mouth; and she at once knew it by a seam\r\nin it, and ran out to me. I used not to want anything then. She\'d bring\r\nalong clotted cream and grapes and everything,\' added Eroshka (who\r\nalways explained things practically), \'and she wasn\'t the only one. It\r\nwas a life!\'\r\n\r\n\'And what now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now we\'ll follow the dog, get a pheasant to settle on a tree, and then\r\nyou may fire.\'\r\n\r\n\'Would you have made up to Maryanka?\'\r\n\r\n\'Attend to the dogs. I\'ll tell you tonight,\' said the old man, pointing\r\nto his favourite dog, Lyam.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause they continued talking, while they went about a hundred\r\npaces. Then the old man stopped again and pointed to a twig that lay\r\nacross the path.\r\n\r\n\'What do you think of that?\' he said. \'You think it\'s nothing? It\'s bad\r\nthat this stick is lying so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why is it bad?\'\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, you don\'t know anything. Just listen to me. When a stick lies like\r\nthat don\'t you step across it, but go round it or throw it off the path\r\nthis way, and say "Father and Son and Holy Ghost," and then go on with\r\nGod\'s blessing. Nothing will happen to you. That\'s what the old men\r\nused to teach me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, what rubbish!\' said Olenin. \'You\'d better tell me more about\r\nMaryanka. Does she carry on with Lukashka?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush ... be quiet now!\' the old man again interrupted in a whisper:\r\n\'just listen, we\'ll go round through the forest.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the old man, stepping quietly in his soft shoes, led the way by a\r\nnarrow path leading into the dense, wild, overgrown forest. Now and\r\nagain with a frown he turned to look at Olenin, who rustled and\r\nclattered with his heavy boots and, carrying his gun carelessly,\r\nseveral times caught the twigs of trees that grew across the path.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t make a noise. Step softly, soldier!\' the old man whispered\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\nThere was a feeling in the air that the sun had risen. The mist was\r\ndissolving but it still enveloped the tops of the trees. The forest\r\nlooked terribly high. At every step the aspect changed: what had\r\nappeared like a tree proved to be a bush, and a reed looked like a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mist had partly lifted, showing the wet reed thatches, and was now\r\nturning into dew that moistened the road and the grass beside the\r\nfence. Smoke rose everywhere in clouds from the chimneys. The people\r\nwere going out of the village, some to their work, some to the river,\r\nand some to the cordon. The hunters walked together along the damp,\r\ngrass-grown path. The dogs, wagging their tails and looking at their\r\nmasters, ran on both sides of them. Myriads of gnats hovered in the air\r\nand pursued the hunters, covering their backs, eyes, and hands. The air\r\nwas fragrant with the grass and with the dampness of the forest. Olenin\r\ncontinually looked round at the ox-cart in which Maryanka sat urging on\r\nthe oxen with a long switch.\r\n\r\nIt was calm. The sounds from the village, audible at first, now no\r\nlonger reached the sportsmen. Only the brambles cracked as the dogs ran\r\nunder them, and now and then birds called to one another. Olenin knew\r\nthat danger lurked in the forest, that abreks always hid in such\r\nplaces. But he knew too that in the forest, for a man on foot, a gun is\r\na great protection. Not that he was afraid, but he felt that another in\r\nhis place might be; and looking into the damp misty forest and\r\nlistening to the rare and faint sounds with strained attention, he\r\nchanged his hold on his gun and experienced a pleasant feeling that was\r\nnew to him. Daddy Eroshka went in front, stopping and carefully\r\nscanning every puddle where an animal had left a double track, and\r\npointing it out to Olenin. He hardly spoke at all and only occasionally\r\nmade remarks in a whisper. The track they were following had once been\r\nmade by wagons, but the grass had long overgrown it. The elm and\r\nplane-tree forest on both sides of them was so dense and overgrown with\r\ncreepers that it was impossible to see anything through it. Nearly\r\nevery tree was enveloped from top to bottom with wild grape vines, and\r\ndark bramble bushes covered the ground thickly. Every little glade was\r\novergrown with blackberry bushes and grey feathery reeds. In places,\r\nlarge hoof-prints and small funnel-shaped pheasant-trails led from the\r\npath into the thicket. The vigour of the growth of this forest,\r\nuntrampled by cattle, struck Olenin at every turn, for he had never\r\nseen anything like it. This forest, the danger, the old man and his\r\nmysterious whispering, Maryanka with her virile upright bearing, and\r\nthe mountains--all this seemed to him like a dream.\r\n\r\n\'A pheasant has settled,\' whispered the old man, looking round and\r\npulling his cap over his face--\'Cover your mug! A pheasant!\' he waved\r\nhis arm angrily at Olenin and pushed forward almost on all fours. \'He\r\ndon\'t like a man\'s mug.\'\r\n\r\nOlenin was still behind him when the old man stopped and began\r\nexamining a tree. A cock-pheasant on the tree clucked at the dog that\r\nwas barking at it, and Olenin saw the pheasant; but at that moment a\r\nreport, as of a cannon, came from Eroshka\'s enormous gun, the bird\r\nfluttered up and, losing some feathers, fell to the ground. Coming up\r\nto the old man Olenin disturbed another, and raising his gun he aimed\r\nand fired. The pheasant flew swiftly up and then, catching at the\r\nbranches as he fell, dropped like a stone to the ground.\r\n\r\n\'Good man!\' the old man (who could not hit a flying bird) shouted,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nHaving picked up the pheasants they went on. Olenin, excited by the\r\nexercise and the praise, kept addressing remarks to the old man.\r\n\r\n\'Stop! Come this way,\' the old man interrupted. \'I noticed the track of\r\ndeer here yesterday.\'\r\n\r\nAfter they had turned into the thicket and gone some three hundred\r\npaces they scrambled through into a glade overgrown with reeds and\r\npartly under water. Olenin failed to keep up with the old huntsman and\r\npresently Daddy Eroshka, some twenty paces in front, stooped down,\r\nnodding and beckoning with his arm. On coming up with him Olenin saw a\r\nman\'s footprint to which the old man was pointing.\r\n\r\n\'D\'you see?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, well?\' said Olenin, trying to speak as calmly as he could. \'A\r\nman\'s footstep!\'\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily a thought of Cooper\'s Pathfinder and of abreks flashed\r\nthrough Olenin\'s mind, but noticing the mysterious manner with which\r\nthe old man moved on, he hesitated to question him and remained in\r\ndoubt whether this mysteriousness was caused by fear of danger or by\r\nthe sport.\r\n\r\n\'No, it\'s my own footprint,\' the old man said quietly, and pointed to\r\nsome grass under which the track of an animal was just perceptible.\r\n\r\nThe old man went on; and Olenin kept up with him.\r\n\r\nDescending to lower ground some twenty paces farther on they came upon\r\na spreading pear-tree, under which, on the black earth, lay the fresh\r\ndung of some animal.\r\n\r\nThe spot, all covered over with wild vines, was like a cosy arbour,\r\ndark and cool.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s been here this morning,\' said the old man with a sigh; \'the lair\r\nis still damp, quite fresh.\'\r\n\r\nSuddenly they heard a terrible crash in the forest some ten paces from\r\nwhere they stood. They both started and seized their guns, but they\r\ncould see nothing and only heard the branches breaking. The rhythmical\r\nrapid thud of galloping was heard for a moment and then changed into a\r\nhollow rumble which resounded farther and farther off, re-echoing in\r\nwider and wider circles through the forest. Olenin felt as though\r\nsomething had snapped in his heart. He peered carefully but vainly into\r\nthe green thicket and then turned to the old man. Daddy Eroshka with\r\nhis gun pressed to his breast stood motionless; his cap was thrust\r\nbackwards, his eyes gleamed with an unwonted glow, and his open mouth,\r\nwith its worn yellow teeth, seemed to have stiffened in that position.\r\n\r\n\'A homed stag!\' he muttered, and throwing down his gun in despair he\r\nbegan pulling at his grey beard, \'Here it stood. We should have come\r\nround by the path.... Fool! fool!\' and he gave his beard an angry tug.\r\nFool! Pig!\' he repeated, pulling painfully at his own beard. Through\r\nthe forest something seemed to fly away in the mist, and ever farther\r\nand farther off was heard the sound of the flight of the stag.\r\n\r\nIt was already dusk when, hungry, tired, but full of vigour, Olenin\r\nreturned with the old man. Dinner was ready. He ate and drank with the\r\nold man till he felt warm and merry. Olenin then went out into the\r\nporch. Again, to the west, the mountains rose before his eyes. Again\r\nthe old man told his endless stories of hunting, of abreks, of\r\nsweethearts, and of all that free and reckless life. Again the fair\r\nMaryanka went in and out and across the yard, her beautiful powerful\r\nform outlined by her smock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Olenin went alone to the spot where he and the old man\r\nstartled the stag. Instead of passing round through the gate he climbed\r\nover the prickly hedge, as everybody else did, and before he had had\r\ntime to pull out the thorns that had caught in his coat, his dog, which\r\nhad run on in front, started two pheasants. He had hardly stepped among\r\nthe briers when the pheasants began to rise at every step (the old man\r\nhad not shown him that place the day before as he meant to keep it for\r\nshooting from behind the screen). Olenin fired twelve times and killed\r\nfive pheasants, but clambering after them through the briers he got so\r\nfatigued that he was drenched with perspiration. He called off his dog,\r\nuncocked his gun, put in a bullet above the small shot, and brushing\r\naway the mosquitoes with the wide sleeve of his Circassian coat he went\r\nslowly to the spot where they had been the day before. It was however\r\nimpossible to keep back the dog, who found trails on the very path, and\r\nOlenin killed two more pheasants, so that after being detained by this\r\nit was getting towards noon before he began to find the place he was\r\nlooking for.\r\n\r\nThe day was perfectly clear, calm, and hot. The morning moisture had\r\ndried up even in the forest, and myriads of mosquitoes literally\r\ncovered his face, his back, and his arms. His dog had turned from black\r\nto grey, its back being covered with mosquitoes, and so had Olenin\'s\r\ncoat through which the insects thrust their stings. Olenin was ready to\r\nrun away from them and it seemed to him that it was impossible to live\r\nin this country in the summer. He was about to go home, but remembering\r\nthat other people managed to endure such pain he resolved to bear it\r\nand gave himself up to be devoured. And strange to say, by noontime the\r\nfeeling became actually pleasant. He even felt that without this\r\nmosquito-filled atmosphere around him, and that mosquito-paste mingled\r\nwith perspiration which his hand smeared over his face, and that\r\nunceasing irritation all over his body, the forest would lose for him\r\nsome of its character and charm. These myriads of insects were so well\r\nsuited to that monstrously lavish wild vegetation, these multitudes of\r\nbirds and beasts which filled the forest, this dark foliage, this hot\r\nscented air, these runlets filled with turbid water which everywhere\r\nsoaked through from the Terek and gurgled here and there under the\r\noverhanging leaves, that the very thing which had at first seemed to\r\nhim dreadful and intolerable now seemed pleasant. After going round the\r\nplace where yesterday they had found the animal and not finding\r\nanything, he felt inclined to rest. The sun stood right above the\r\nforest and poured its perpendicular rays down on his back and head\r\nwhenever he came out into a glade or onto the road. The seven heavy\r\npheasants dragged painfully at his waist. Having found the traces of\r\nyesterday\'s stag he crept under a bush into the thicket just where the\r\nstag had lain, and lay down in its lair. He examined the dark foliage\r\naround him, the place marked by the stag\'s perspiration and yesterday\'s\r\ndung, the imprint of the stag\'s knees, the bit of black earth it had\r\nkicked up, and his own footprints of the day before. He felt cool and\r\ncomfortable and did not think of or wish for anything. And suddenly he\r\nwas overcome by such a strange feeling of causeless joy and of love for\r\neverything, that from an old habit of his childhood he began crossing\r\nhimself and thanking someone. Suddenly, with extraordinary clearness,\r\nhe thought: \'Here am I, Dmitri Olenin, a being quite distinct from\r\nevery other being, now lying all alone Heaven only knows where--where a\r\nstag used to live--an old stag, a beautiful stag who perhaps had never\r\nseen a man, and in a place where no human being has ever sat or thought\r\nthese thoughts. Here I sit, and around me stand old and young trees,\r\none of them festooned with wild grape vines, and pheasants are\r\nfluttering, driving one another about and perhaps scenting their\r\nmurdered brothers.\' He felt his pheasants, examined them, and wiped the\r\nwarm blood off his hand onto his coat. \'Perhaps the jackals scent them\r\nand with dissatisfied faces go off in another direction: above me,\r\nflying in among the leaves which to them seem enormous islands,\r\nmosquitoes hang in the air and buzz: one, two, three, four, a hundred,\r\na thousand, a million mosquitoes, and all of them buzz something or\r\nother and each one of them is separate from all else and is just such a\r\nseparate Dmitri Olenin as I am myself.\' He vividly imagined what the\r\nmosquitoes buzzed: \'This way, this way, lads! Here\'s some one we can\r\neat!\' They buzzed and stuck to him. And it was clear to him that he was\r\nnot a Russian nobleman, a member of Moscow society, the friend and\r\nrelation of so-and-so and so-and-so, but just such a mosquito, or\r\npheasant, or deer, as those that were now living all around him. \'Just\r\nas they, just as Daddy Eroshka, I shall live awhile and die, and as he\r\nsays truly:\r\n\r\n"grass will grow and nothing more".\r\n\r\n\'But what though the grass does grow?\' he continued thinking. \'Still I\r\nmust live and be happy, because happiness is all I desire. Never mind\r\nwhat I am--an animal like all the rest, above whom the grass will grow\r\nand nothing more; or a frame in which a bit of the one God has been\r\nset,--still I must live in the very best way. How then must I live to\r\nbe happy, and why was I not happy before?\' And he began to recall his\r\nformer life and he felt disgusted with himself. He appeared to himself\r\nto have been terribly exacting and selfish, though he now saw that all\r\nthe while he really needed nothing for himself. And he looked round at\r\nthe foliage with the light shining through it, at the setting sun and\r\nthe clear sky, and he felt just as happy as before. \'Why am I happy,\r\nand what used I to live for?\' thought he. \'How much I exacted for\r\nmyself; how I schemed and did not manage to gain anything but shame and\r\nsorrow! and, there now, I require nothing to be happy;\' and suddenly a\r\nnew light seemed to reveal itself to him. \'Happiness is this!\' he said\r\nto himself. \'Happiness lies in living for others. That is evident. The\r\ndesire for happiness is innate in every man; therefore it is\r\nlegitimate. When trying to satisfy it selfishly--that is, by seeking\r\nfor oneself riches, fame, comforts, or love--it may happen that\r\ncircumstances arise which make it impossible to satisfy these desires.\r\nIt follows that it is these desires that are illegitimate, but not the\r\nneed for happiness. But what desires can always be satisfied despite\r\nexternal circumstances? What are they? Love, self-sacrifice.\' He was so\r\nglad and excited when he had discovered this, as it seemed to him, new\r\ntruth, that he jumped up and began impatiently seeking some one to\r\nsacrifice himself for, to do good to and to love. \'Since one wants\r\nnothing for oneself,\' he kept thinking, \'why not live for others?\' He\r\ntook up his gun with the intention of returning home quickly to think\r\nthis out and to find an opportunity of doing good. He made his way out\r\nof the thicket. When he had come out into the glade he looked around\r\nhim; the sun was no longer visible above the tree-tops. It had grown\r\ncooler and the place seemed to him quite strange and not like the\r\ncountry round the village. Everything seemed changed--the weather and\r\nthe character of the forest; the sky was wrapped in clouds, the wind\r\nwas rustling in the tree-tops, and all around nothing was visible but\r\nreeds and dying broken-down trees. He called to his dog who had run\r\naway to follow some animal, and his voice came back as in a desert. And\r\nsuddenly he was seized with a terrible sense of weirdness. He grew\r\nfrightened. He remembered the abreks and the murders he had been told\r\nabout, and he expected every moment that an abrek would spring from\r\nbehind every bush and he would have to defend his life and die, or be a\r\ncoward. He thought of God and of the future life as for long he had not\r\nthought about them. And all around was that same gloomy stern wild\r\nnature. \'And is it worth while living for oneself,\' thought he, \'when\r\nat any moment you may die, and die without having done any good, and so\r\nthat no one will know of it?\' He went in the direction where he fancied\r\nthe village lay. Of his shooting he had no further thought; but he felt\r\ntired to death and peered round at every bush and tree with particular\r\nattention and almost with terror, expecting every moment to be called\r\nto account for his life. After having wandered about for a considerable\r\ntime he came upon a ditch down which was flowing cold sandy water from\r\nthe Terek, and, not to go astray any longer, he decided to follow it.\r\nHe went on without knowing where the ditch would lead him. Suddenly the\r\nreeds behind him crackled. He shuddered and seized his gun, and then\r\nfelt ashamed of himself: the over-excited dog, panting hard, had thrown\r\nitself into the cold water of the ditch and was lapping it!\r\n\r\nHe too had a drink, and then followed the dog in the direction it\r\nwished to go, thinking it would lead him to the village. But despite\r\nthe dog\'s company everything around him seemed still more dreary. The\r\nforest grew darker and the wind grew stronger and stronger in the tops\r\nof the broken old trees. Some large birds circled screeching round\r\ntheir nests in those trees. The vegetation grew poorer and he came\r\noftener and oftener upon rustling reeds and bare sandy spaces covered\r\nwith animal footprints. To the howling of the wind was added another\r\nkind of cheerless monotonous roar. Altogether his spirits became\r\ngloomy. Putting his hand behind him he felt his pheasants, and found\r\none missing. It had broken off and was lost, and only the bleeding head\r\nand beak remained sticking in his belt. He felt more frightened than he\r\nhad ever done before. He began to pray to God, and feared above all\r\nthat he might die without having done anything good or kind; and he so\r\nwanted to live, and to live so as to perform a feat of self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly it was as though the sun had shone into his soul. He heard\r\nRussian being spoken, and also heard the rapid smooth flow of the\r\nTerek, and a few steps farther in front of him saw the brown moving\r\nsurface of the river, with the dim-coloured wet sand of its banks and\r\nshallows, the distant steppe, the cordon watch-tower outlined above the\r\nwater, a saddled and hobbled horse among the brambles, and then the\r\nmountains opening out before him. The red sun appeared for an instant\r\nfrom under a cloud and its last rays glittered brightly along the river\r\nover the reeds, on the watch-tower, and on a group of Cossacks, among\r\nwhom Lukashka\'s vigorous figure attracted Olenin\'s involuntary\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nOlenin felt that he was again, without any apparent cause, perfectly\r\nhappy. He had come upon the Nizhni-Prototsk post on the Terek, opposite\r\na pro-Russian Tartar village on the other side of the river. He\r\naccosted the Cossacks, but not finding as yet any excuse for doing\r\nanyone a kindness, he entered the hut; nor in the hut did he find any\r\nsuch opportunity. The Cossacks received him coldly. On entering the mud\r\nhut he lit a cigarette. The Cossacks paid little attention to him,\r\nfirst because he was smoking a cigarette, and secondly because they had\r\nsomething else to divert them that evening. Some hostile Chechens,\r\nrelatives of the abrek who had been killed, had come from the hills\r\nwith a scout to ransom the body; and the Cossacks were waiting for\r\ntheir Commanding Officer\'s arrival from the village. The dead man\'s\r\nbrother, tall and well shaped with a short cropped beard which was dyed\r\nred, despite his very tattered coat and cap was calm and majestic as a\r\nking. His face was very like that of the dead abrek. He did not deign\r\nto look at anyone, and never once glanced at the dead body, but sitting\r\non his heels in the shade he spat as he smoked his short pipe, and\r\noccasionally uttered some few guttural sounds of command, which were\r\nrespectfully listened to by his companion. He was evidently a brave who\r\nhad met Russians more than once before in quite other circumstances,\r\nand nothing about them could astonish or even interest him. Olenin was\r\nabout to approach the dead body and had begun to look at it when the\r\nbrother, looking up at him from under his brows with calm contempt,\r\nsaid something sharply and angrily. The scout hastened to cover the\r\ndead man\'s face with his coat. Olenin was struck by the dignified and\r\nstem expression of the brave\'s face. He began to speak to him, asking\r\nfrom what village he came, but the Chechen, scarcely giving him a\r\nglance, spat contemptuously and turned away. Olenin was so surprised at\r\nthe Chechen not being interested in him that he could only put it down\r\nto the man\'s stupidity or ignorance of Russian; so he turned to the\r\nscout, who also acted as interpreter. The scout was as ragged as the\r\nother, but instead of being red-haired he was black-haired, restless,\r\nwith extremely white gleaming teeth and sparkling black eyes. The scout\r\nwillingly entered into conversation and asked for a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\'There were five brothers,\' began the scout in his broken Russian.\r\n\'This is the third brother the Russians have killed, only two are left.\r\nHe is a brave, a great brave!\' he said, pointing to the Chechen. \'When\r\nthey killed Ahmet Khan (the dead brave) this one was sitting on the\r\nopposite bank among the reeds. He saw it all. Saw him laid in the skiff\r\nand brought to the bank. He sat there till the night and wished to kill\r\nthe old man, but the others would not let him.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka went up to the speaker, and sat down. \'Of what village?\' asked\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\'From there in the hills,\' replied the scout, pointing to the misty\r\nbluish gorge beyond the Terek. \'Do you know Suuk-su? It is about eight\r\nmiles beyond that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know Girey Khan in Suuk-su?\' asked Lukashka, evidently proud of\r\nthe acquaintance. \'He is my kunak.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is my neighbour,\' answered the scout.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s a trump!\' and Lukashka, evidently much interested, began talking\r\nto the scout in Tartar.\r\n\r\nPresently a Cossack captain, with the head of the village, arrived on\r\nhorseback with a suite of two Cossacks. The captain--one of the new\r\ntype of Cossack officers--wished the Cossacks \'Good health,\' but no one\r\nshouted in reply, \'Hail! Good health to your honour,\' as is customary\r\nin the Russian Army, and only a few replied with a bow. Some, and among\r\nthem Lukashka, rose and stood erect. The corporal replied that all was\r\nwell at the outposts. All this seemed ridiculous: it was as if these\r\nCossacks were playing at being soldiers. But these formalities soon\r\ngave place to ordinary ways of behaviour, and the captain, who was a\r\nsmart Cossack just like the others, began speaking fluently in Tartar\r\nto the interpreter. They filled in some document, gave it to the scout,\r\nand received from him some money. Then they approached the body.\r\n\r\n\'Which of you is Luke Gavrilov?\' asked the captain.\r\n\r\nLukishka took off his cap and came forward.\r\n\r\n\'I have reported your exploit to the Commander. I don\'t know what will\r\ncome of it. I have recommended you for a cross; you\'re too young to be\r\nmade a sergeant. Can you read?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what a fine fellow to look at!\' said the captain, again playing\r\nthe commander. \'Put on your cap. Which of the Gavrilovs does he come\r\nof? ... the Broad, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'His nephew,\' replied the corporal.\r\n\r\n\'I know, I know. Well, lend a hand, help them,\' he said, turning to the\r\nCossacks.\r\n\r\nLukashka\'s face shone with joy and seemed handsomer than usual. He\r\nmoved away from the corporal, and having put on his cap sat down beside\r\nOlenin.\r\n\r\nWhen the body had been carried to the skiff the brother Chechen\r\ndescended to the bank. The Cossacks involuntarily stepped aside to let\r\nhim pass. He jumped into the boat and pushed off from the bank with his\r\npowerful leg, and now, as Olenin noticed, for the first time threw a\r\nrapid glance at all the Cossacks and then abruptly asked his companion\r\na question. The latter answered something and pointed to Lukashka. The\r\nChechen looked at him and, turning slowly away, gazed at the opposite\r\nbank. That look expressed not hatred but cold contempt. He again made\r\nsome remark.\r\n\r\n\'What is he saying?\' Olenin asked of the fidgety scout.\r\n\r\n\'Yours kill ours, ours slay yours. It\'s always the same,\' replied the\r\nscout, evidently inventing, and he smiled, showing his white teeth, as\r\nhe jumped into the skiff.\r\n\r\nThe dead man\'s brother sat motionless, gazing at the opposite bank. He\r\nwas so full of hatred and contempt that there was nothing on this side\r\nof the river that moved his curiosity. The scout, standing up at one\r\nend of the skiff and dipping his paddle now on one side now on the\r\nother, steered skilfully while talking incessantly. The skiff became\r\nsmaller and smaller as it moved obliquely across the stream, the voices\r\nbecame scarcely audible, and at last, still within sight, they landed\r\non the opposite bank where their horses stood waiting. There they\r\nlifted out the corpse and (though the horse shied) laid it across one\r\nof the saddles, mounted, and rode at a foot-pace along the road past a\r\nTartar village from which a crowd came out to look at them. The\r\nCossacks on the Russian side of the river were highly satisfied and\r\njovial. Laughter and jokes were heard on all sides. The captain and the\r\nhead of the village entered the mud hut to regale themselves. Lukashka,\r\nvainly striving to impart a sedate expression to his merry face, sat\r\ndown with his elbows on his knees beside Olenin and whittled away at a\r\nstick.\r\n\r\n\'Why do you smoke?\' he said with assumed curiosity. \'Is it good?\'\r\n\r\nHe evidently spoke because he noticed Olenin felt ill at ease and\r\nisolated among the Cossacks.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s just a habit,\' answered Olenin. \'Why?\'\r\n\r\n\'H\'m, if one of us were to smoke there would be a row! Look there now,\r\nthe mountains are not far off,\' continued Lukashka, \'yet you can\'t get\r\nthere! How will you get back alone? It\'s getting dark. I\'ll take you,\r\nif you like. You ask the corporal to give me leave.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a fine fellow!\' thought Olenin, looking at the Cossack\'s bright\r\nface. He remembered Maryanka and the kiss he had heard by the gate, and\r\nhe was sorry for Lukashka and his want of culture. \'What confusion it\r\nis,\' he thought. \'A man kills another and is happy and satisfied with\r\nhimself as if he had done something excellent. Can it be that nothing\r\ntells him that it is not a reason for any rejoicing, and that happiness\r\nlies not in killing, but in sacrificing oneself?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you had better not meet him again now, mate!\' said one of the\r\nCossacks who had seen the skiff off, addressing Lukashka. \'Did you hear\r\nhim asking about you?\'\r\n\r\nLukashka raised his head.\r\n\r\n\'My godson?\' said Lukashka, meaning by that word the dead Chechen.\r\n\r\n\'Your godson won\'t rise, but the red one is the godson\'s brother!\'\r\n\r\n\'Let him thank God that he got off whole himself,\' replied Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\'What are you glad about?\' asked Olenin. \'Supposing your brother had\r\nbeen killed; would you be glad?\'\r\n\r\nThe Cossack looked at Olenin with laughing eyes. He seemed to have\r\nunderstood all that Olenin wished to say to him, but to be above such\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n\'Well, that happens too! Don\'t our fellows get killed sometimes?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Captain and the head of the village rode away, and Olenin, to\r\nplease Lukashka as well as to avoid going back alone through the dark\r\nforest, asked the corporal to give Lukashka leave, and the corporal did\r\nso. Olenin thought that Lukashka wanted to see Maryanka and he was also\r\nglad of the companionship of such a pleasant-looking and sociable\r\nCossack. Lukashka and Maryanka he involuntarily united in his mind, and\r\nhe found pleasure in thinking about them. \'He loves Maryanka,\' thought\r\nOlenin, \'and I could love her,\' and a new and powerful emotion of\r\ntenderness overcame him as they walked homewards together through the\r\ndark forest. Lukashka too felt happy; something akin to love made\r\nitself felt between these two very different young men. Every time they\r\nglanced at one another they wanted to laugh.\r\n\r\n\'By which gate do you enter?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'By the middle one. But I\'ll see you as far as the marsh. After that\r\nyou have nothing to fear.\'\r\n\r\nOlenin laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think I am afraid? Go back, and thank you. I can get on alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right! What have I to do? And how can you help being afraid?\r\nEven we are afraid,\' said Lukashka to set Olenin\'s self-esteem at rest,\r\nand he laughed too.\r\n\r\n\'Then come in with me. We\'ll have a talk and a drink and in the morning\r\nyou can go back.\'\r\n\r\n\'Couldn\'t I find a place to spend the night?\' laughed Lukashka. \'But\r\nthe corporal asked me to go back.\'\r\n\r\n\'I heard you singing last night, and also saw you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Every one...\' and Luke swayed his head.\r\n\r\n\'Is it true you are getting married?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Mother wants me to marry. But I have not got a horse yet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aren\'t you in the regular service?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear no! I\'ve only just joined, and have not got a horse yet, and\r\ndon\'t know how to get one. That\'s why the marriage does not come off.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what would a horse cost?\'\r\n\r\n\'We were bargaining for one beyond the river the other day and they\r\nwould not take sixty rubles for it, though it is a Nogay horse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you come and be my drabant?\' (A drabant was a kind of orderly\r\nattached to an officer when campaigning.) \'I\'ll get it arranged and\r\nwill give you a horse,\' said Olenin suddenly. \'Really now, I have two\r\nand I don\'t want both.\'\r\n\r\n\'How--don\'t want it?\' Lukashka said, laughing. \'Why should you make me\r\na present? We\'ll get on by ourselves by God\'s help.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, really! Or don\'t you want to be a drabant?\' said Olenin, glad that\r\nit had entered his head to give a horse to Lukashka, though, without\r\nknowing why, he felt uncomfortable and confused and did not know what\r\nto say when he tried to speak.\r\n\r\nLukashka was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n\'Have you a house of your own in Russia?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nOlenin could not refrain from replying that he had not only one, but\r\nseveral houses.\r\n\r\n\'A good house? Bigger than ours?\' asked Lukashka good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\'Much bigger; ten times as big and three storeys high,\' replied Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'And have you horses such as ours?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have a hundred horses, worth three or four hundred rubles each, but\r\nthey are not like yours. They are trotters, you know.... But still, I\r\nlike the horses here best.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, and did you come here of your own free will, or were you sent?\'\r\nsaid Lukashka, laughing at him. \'Look! that\'s where you lost your way,\'\r\nhe added, \'you should have turned to the right.\'\r\n\r\n\'I came by my own wish,\' replied Olenin. \'I wanted to see your parts\r\nand to join some expeditions.\'\r\n\r\n\'I would go on an expedition any day,\' said Lukashka. \'D\'you hear the\r\njackals howling?\' he added, listening.\r\n\r\n\'I say, don\'t you feel any horror at having killed a man?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s there to be frightened about? But I should like to join an\r\nexpedition,\' Lukashka repeated. \'How I want to! How I want to!\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps we may be going together. Our company is going before the\r\nholidays, and your "hundred" too.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what did you want to come here for? You\'ve a house and horses and\r\nserfs. In your place I\'d do nothing but make merry! And what is your\r\nrank?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am a cadet, but have been recommended for a commission.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if you\'re not bragging about your home, if I were you I\'d never\r\nhave left it! Yes, I\'d never have gone away anywhere. Do you find it\r\npleasant living among us?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, very pleasant,\' answered Olenin.\r\n\r\nIt had grown quite dark before, talking in this way, they approached\r\nthe village. They were still surrounded by the deep gloom of the\r\nforest. The wind howled through the tree-tops. The jackals suddenly\r\nseemed to be crying close beside them, howling, chuckling, and sobbing;\r\nbut ahead of them in the village the sounds of women\'s voices and the\r\nbarking of dogs could already be heard; the outlines of the huts were\r\nclearly to be seen; lights gleamed and the air was filled with the\r\npeculiar smell of kisyak smoke. Olenin felt keenly, that night\r\nespecially, that here in this village was his home, his family, all his\r\nhappiness, and that he never had and never would live so happily\r\nanywhere as he did in this Cossack village. He was so fond of everybody\r\nand especially of Lukashka that night. On reaching home, to Lukashka\'s\r\ngreat surprise, Olenin with his own hands led out of the shed a horse\r\nhe had bought in Groznoe--it was not the one he usually rode but\r\nanother--not a bad horse though no longer young, and gave it to\r\nLukashka.\r\n\r\n\'Why should you give me a present?\' said Lukashka, \'I have not yet done\r\nanything for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Really it is nothing,\' answered Olenin. \'Take it, and you will give me\r\na present, and we\'ll go on an expedition against the enemy together.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka became confused.\r\n\r\n\'But what d\'you mean by it? As if a horse were of little value,\' he\r\nsaid without looking at the horse.\r\n\r\n\'Take it, take it! If you don\'t you will offend me. Vanyusha! Take the\r\ngrey horse to his house.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka took hold of the halter.\r\n\r\n\'Well then, thank you! This is something unexpected, undreamt of.\'\r\n\r\nOlenin was as happy as a boy of twelve.\r\n\r\n\'Tie it up here. It\'s a good horse. I bought it in Groznoe; it gallops\r\nsplendidly! Vanyusha, bring us some chikhir. Come into the hut.\'\r\n\r\nThe wine was brought. Lukashka sat down and took the wine-bowl.\r\n\r\n\'God willing I\'ll find a way to repay you,\' he said, finishing his\r\nwine. \'How are you called?\'\r\n\r\n\'Dmitri Andreich.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, \'Mitry Andreich, God bless you. We will be kunaks. Now you must\r\ncome to see us. Though we are not rich people still we can treat a\r\nkunak, and I will tell mother in case you need anything--clotted cream\r\nor grapes--and if you come to the cordon I\'m your servant to go hunting\r\nor to go across the river, anywhere you like! There now, only the other\r\nday, what a boar I killed, and I divided it among the Cossacks, but if\r\nI had only known, I\'d have given it to you.\' \'That\'s all right, thank\r\nyou! But don\'t harness the horse, it has never been in harness.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why harness the horse? And there is something else I\'ll tell you if\r\nyou like,\' said Lukashka, bending his head. \'I have a kunak, Girey\r\nKhan. He asked me to lie in ambush by the road where they come down\r\nfrom the mountains. Shall we go together? I\'ll not betray you. I\'ll be\r\nyour murid.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, we\'ll go; we\'ll go some day.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka seemed quite to have quieted down and to have understood\r\nOlenin\'s attitude towards him. His calmness and the ease of his\r\nbehaviour surprised Olenin, and he did not even quite like it. They\r\ntalked long, and it was late when Lukashka, not tipsy (he never was\r\ntipsy) but having drunk a good deal, left Olenin after shaking hands.\r\n\r\nOlenin looked out of the window to see what he would do. Lukashka went\r\nout, hanging his head. Then, having led the horse out of the gate, he\r\nsuddenly shook his head, threw the reins of the halter over its head,\r\nsprang onto its back like a cat, gave a wild shout, and galloped down\r\nthe street. Olenin expected that Lukishka would go to share his joy\r\nwith Maryanka, but though he did not do so Olenin still felt his soul\r\nmore at ease than ever before in his life. He was as delighted as a\r\nboy, and could not refrain from telling Vanyusha not only that he had\r\ngiven Lukashka the horse, but also why he had done it, as well as his\r\nnew theory of happiness. Vanyusha did not approve of his theory, and\r\nannounced that \'l\'argent il n\'y a pas!\' and that therefore it was all\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\nLukashka rode home, jumped off the horse, and handed it over to his\r\nmother, telling her to let it out with the communal Cossack herd. He\r\nhimself had to return to the cordon that same night. His deaf sister\r\nundertook to take the horse, and explained by signs that when she saw\r\nthe man who had given the horse, she would bow down at his feet. The\r\nold woman only shook her head at her son\'s story, and decided in her\r\nown mind that he had stolen it. She therefore told the deaf girl to\r\ntake it to the herd before daybreak.\r\n\r\nLukashka went back alone to the cordon pondering over Olenin\'s action.\r\nThough he did not consider the horse a good one, yet it was worth at\r\nleast forty rubles and Lukashka was very glad to have the present. But\r\nwhy it had been given him he could not at all understand, and therefore\r\nhe did not experience the least feeling of gratitude. On the contrary,\r\nvague suspicions that the cadet had some evil intentions filled his\r\nmind. What those intentions were he could not decide, but neither could\r\nhe admit the idea that a stranger would give him a horse worth forty\r\nrubles for nothing, just out of kindness; it seemed impossible. Had he\r\nbeen drunk one might understand it! He might have wished to show off.\r\nBut the cadet had been sober, and therefore must have wished to bribe\r\nhim to do something wrong. \'Eh, humbug!\' thought Lukashka. \'Haven\'t I\r\ngot the horse and we\'ll see later on. I\'m not a fool myself and we\r\nshall see who\'ll get the better of the other,\' he thought, feeling the\r\nnecessity of being on his guard, and therefore arousing in himself\r\nunfriendly feelings towards Olenin. He told no one how he had got the\r\nhorse. To some he said he had bought it, to others he replied\r\nevasively. However, the truth soon got about in the village, and\r\nLukashka\'s mother and Maryanka, as well as Elias Vasilich and other\r\nCossacks, when they heard of Olenin\'s unnecessary gift, were perplexed,\r\nand began to be on their guard against the cadet. But despite their\r\nfears his action aroused in them a great respect for his simplicity and\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n\'Have you heard,\' said one, \'that the cadet quartered on Elias Vasilich\r\nhas thrown a fifty-ruble horse at Lukashka? He\'s rich! ...\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I heard of it,\' replied another profoundly, \'he must have done\r\nhim some great service. We shall see what will come of this cadet. Eh!\r\nwhat luck that Snatcher has!\'\r\n\r\n\'Those cadets are crafty, awfully crafty,\' said a third. \'See if he\r\ndon\'t go setting fire to a building, or doing something!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOlenin\'s life went on with monotonous regularity. He had little\r\nintercourse with the commanding officers or with his equals. The\r\nposition of a rich cadet in the Caucasus was peculiarly advantageous in\r\nthis respect. He was not sent out to work, or for training. As a reward\r\nfor going on an expedition he was recommended for a commission, and\r\nmeanwhile he was left in peace. The officers regarded him as an\r\naristocrat and behaved towards him with dignity. Cardplaying and the\r\nofficers\' carousals accompanied by the soldier-singers, of which he had\r\nhad experience when he was with the detachment, did not seem to him\r\nattractive, and he also avoided the society and life of the officers in\r\nthe village. The life of officers stationed in a Cossack village has\r\nlong had its own definite form. Just as every cadet or officer when in\r\na fort regularly drinks porter, plays cards, and discusses the rewards\r\ngiven for taking part in the expeditions, so in the Cossack villages he\r\nregularly drinks chikhir with his hosts, treats the girls to\r\nsweet-meats and honey, dangles after the Cossack women, and falls in\r\nlove, and occasionally marries there. Olenin always took his own path\r\nand had an unconscious objection to the beaten tracks. And here, too,\r\nhe did not follow the ruts of a Caucasian officer\'s life.\r\n\r\nIt came quite naturally to him to wake up at daybreak. After drinking\r\ntea and admiring from his porch the mountains, the morning, and\r\nMaryanka, he would put on a tattered ox-hide coat, sandals of soaked\r\nraw hide, buckle on a dagger, take a gun, put cigarettes and some lunch\r\nin a little bag, call his dog, and soon after five o\'clock would start\r\nfor the forest beyond the village. Towards seven in the evening he\r\nwould return tired and hungry with five or six pheasants hanging from\r\nhis belt (sometimes with some other animal) and with his bag of food\r\nand cigarettes untouched. If the thoughts in his head had lain like the\r\nlunch and cigarettes in the bag, one might have seen that during all\r\nthose fourteen hours not a single thought had moved in it. He returned\r\nmorally fresh, strong, and perfectly happy, and he could not tell what\r\nhe had been thinking about all the time. Were they ideas, memories, or\r\ndreams that had been flitting through his mind? They were frequently\r\nall three. He would rouse himself and ask what he had been thinking\r\nabout; and would see himself as a Cossack working in a vineyard with\r\nhis Cossack wife, or an abrek in the mountains, or a boar running away\r\nfrom himself. And all the time he kept peering and watching for a\r\npheasant, a boar, or a deer.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Daddy Eroshka would be sure to be sitting with him.\r\nVanyusha would bring a jug of chikhir, and they would converse quietly,\r\ndrink, and separate to go quite contentedly to bed. The next day he\r\nwould again go shooting, again be healthily weary, again they would sit\r\nconversing and drink their fill, and again be happy. Sometimes on a\r\nholiday or day of rest Olenin spent the whole day at home. Then his\r\nchief occupation was watching Maryanka, whose every movement, without\r\nrealizing it himself, he followed greedily from his window or his\r\nporch. He regarded Maryanka and loved her (so he thought) just as he\r\nloved the beauty of the mountains and the sky, and he had no thought of\r\nentering into any relations with her. It seemed to him that between him\r\nand her such relations as there were between her and the Cossack\r\nLukashka could not exist, and still less such as often existed between\r\nrich officers and other Cossack girls. It seemed to him that if he\r\ntried to do as his fellow officers did, he would exchange his complete\r\nenjoyment of contemplation for an abyss of suffering, disillusionment,\r\nand remorse. Besides, he had already achieved a triumph of\r\nself-sacrifice in connexion with her which had given him great\r\npleasure, and above all he was in a way afraid of Maryanka and would\r\nnot for anything have ventured to utter a word of love to her lightly.\r\n\r\nOnce during the summer, when Olenin had not gone out shooting but was\r\nsitting at home, quite unexpectedly a Moscow acquaintance, a very young\r\nman whom he had met in society, came in.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, mon cher, my dear fellow, how glad I was when I heard that you\r\nwere here!\' he began in his Moscow French, and he went on intermingling\r\nFrench words in his remarks. \'They said, "Olenin". What Olenin? and I\r\nwas so pleased.... Fancy fate bringing us together here! Well, and how\r\nare you? How? Why?\' and Prince Beletski told his whole story: how he\r\nhad temporarily entered the regiment, how the Commander-in-Chief had\r\noffered to take him as an adjutant, and how he would take up the post\r\nafter this campaign although personally he felt quite indifferent about\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\'Living here in this hole one must at least make a career--get a\r\ncross--or a rank--be transferred to the Guards. That is quite\r\nindispensable, not for myself but for the sake of my relations and\r\nfriends. The prince received me very well; he is a very decent fellow,\'\r\nsaid Beletski, and went on unceasingly. \'I have been recommended for\r\nthe St. Anna Cross for the expedition. Now I shall stay here a bit\r\nuntil we start on the campaign. It\'s capital here. What women! Well,\r\nand how are you getting on? I was told by our captain, Startsev you\r\nknow, a kind-hearted stupid creature.... Well, he said you were living\r\nlike an awful savage, seeing no one! I quite understand you don\'t want\r\nto be mixed up with the set of officers we have here. I am so glad now\r\nyou and I will be able to see something of one another. I have put up\r\nat the Cossack corporal\'s house. There is such a girl there. Ustenka! I\r\ntell you she\'s just charming.\'\r\n\r\nAnd more and more French and Russian words came pouring forth from that\r\nworld which Olenin thought he had left for ever. The general opinion\r\nabout Beletski was that he was a nice, good-natured fellow. Perhaps he\r\nreally was; but in spite of his pretty, good-natured face, Olenin\r\nthought him extremely unpleasant. He seemed just to exhale that\r\nfilthiness which Olenin had forsworn. What vexed him most was that he\r\ncould not--had not the strength--abruptly to repulse this man who came\r\nfrom that world: as if that old world he used to belong to had an\r\nirresistible claim on him. Olenin felt angry with Beletski and with\r\nhimself, yet against his wish he introduced French phrases into his own\r\nconversation, was interested in the Commander-in-Chief and in their\r\nMoscow acquaintances, and because in this Cossack village he and\r\nBeletski both spoke French, he spoke contemptuously of their fellow\r\nofficers and of the Cossacks, and was friendly with Beletski, promising\r\nto visit him and inviting him to drop in to see him. Olenin however did\r\nnot himself go to see Beletski. Vanyusha for his part approved of\r\nBeletski, remarking that he was a real gentleman.\r\n\r\nBeletski at once adopted the customary life of a rich officer in a\r\nCossack village. Before Olenin\'s eyes, in one month he came to be like\r\nan old resident of the village; he made the old men drunk, arranged\r\nevening parties, and himself went to parties arranged by the\r\ngirls--bragged of his conquests, and even got so far that, for some\r\nunknown reason, the women and girls began calling him grandad, and the\r\nCossacks, to whom a man who loved wine and women was clearly\r\nunderstandable, got used to him and even liked him better than they did\r\nOlenin, who was a puzzle to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was five in the morning. Vanyusha was in the porch heating the\r\nsamovar, and using the leg of a long boot instead of bellows. Olenin\r\nhad already ridden off to bathe in the Terek. (He had recently invented\r\na new amusement: to swim his horse in the river.) His landlady was in\r\nher outhouse, and the dense smoke of the kindling fire rose from the\r\nchimney. The girl was milking the buffalo cow in the shed. \'Can\'t keep\r\nquiet, the damned thing!\' came her impatient voice, followed by the\r\nrhythmical sound of milking.\r\n\r\nFrom the street in front of the house horses\' hoofs were heard\r\nclattering briskly, and Olenin, riding bareback on a handsome dark-grey\r\nhorse which was still wet and shining, rode up to the gate. Maryanka\'s\r\nhandsome head, tied round with a red kerchief, appeared from the shed\r\nand again disappeared. Olenin was wearing a red silk shirt, a white\r\nCircassian coat girdled with a strap which carried a dagger, and a tall\r\ncap. He sat his well-fed wet horse with a slightly conscious elegance\r\nand, holding his gun at his back, stooped to open the gate.\r\n\r\nHis hair was still wet, and his face shone with youth and health. He\r\nthought himself handsome, agile, and like a brave; but he was mistaken.\r\nTo any experienced Caucasian he was still only a soldier.\r\n\r\nWhen he noticed that the girl had put out her head he stooped with\r\nparticular smartness, threw open the gate and, tightening the reins,\r\nswished his whip and entered the yard. \'Is tea ready, Vanyusha?\' he\r\ncried gaily, not looking at the door of the shed. He felt with pleasure\r\nhow his fine horse, pressing down its flanks, pulling at the bridle\r\nand with every muscle quivering and with each foot ready to leap over\r\nthe fence, pranced on the hard clay of the yard. <i>\'C\'est pr\xeat</i>,\'\r\nanswered Vanyusha. Olenin felt as if Maryanka\'s beautiful head was\r\nstill looking out of the shed but he did not turn to look at her. As\r\nhe jumped down from his horse he made an awkward movement and caught\r\nhis gun against the porch, and turned a frightened look towards the\r\nshed, where there was no one to be seen and whence the sound of\r\nmilking could still be heard.\r\n\r\nSoon after he had entered the hut he came out again and sat down with\r\nhis pipe and a book on the side of the porch which was not yet exposed\r\nto the rays of the sun. He meant not to go anywhere before dinner that\r\nday, and to write some long-postponed letters; but somehow he felt\r\ndisinclined to leave his place in the porch, and he was as reluctant\r\nto go back into the hut as if it had been a prison. The housewife\r\nhad heated her oven, and the girl, having driven the cattle, had come\r\nback and was collecting <i>kisyak</i> and heaping it up along the\r\nfence. Olenin went on reading, but did not understand a word of what\r\nwas written in the book that lay open before him. He kept lifting his\r\neyes from it and looking at the powerful young woman who was moving\r\nabout. Whether she stepped into the moist morning shadow thrown by\r\nthe house, or went out into the middle of the yard lit up by the\r\njoyous young light, so that the whole of her stately figure in its\r\nbright coloured garment gleamed in the sunshine and cast a black\r\nshadow--he always feared to lose any one of her movements. It delighted\r\nhim to see how freely and gracefully her figure bent: into what folds\r\nher only garment, a pink smock, draped itself on her bosom and along\r\nher shapely legs; how she drew herself up and her tight-drawn smock\r\nshowed the outline of her heaving bosom, how the soles of her narrow\r\nfeet in her worn red slippers rested on the ground without altering\r\ntheir shape; how her strong arms with the sleeves rolled up, exerting\r\nthe muscles, used the spade almost as if in anger, and how her deep\r\ndark eyes sometimes glanced at him. Though the delicate brows frowned,\r\nyet her eyes expressed pleasure and a knowledge of her own beauty.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Olenin, have you been up long?\' said Beletski as he entered the\r\nyard dressed in the coat of a Caucasian officer.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, Beletski,\' replied Olenin, holding out his hand. \'How is it you\r\nare out so early?\'\r\n\r\n\'I had to. I was driven out; we are having a ball tonight. Maryanka, of\r\ncourse you\'ll come to Ustenka\'s?\' he added, turning to the girl.\r\n\r\nOlenin felt surprised that Beletski could address this woman so easily.\r\nBut Maryanka, as though she had not heard him, bent her head, and\r\nthrowing the spade across her shoulder went with her firm masculine\r\ntread towards the outhouse.\r\n\r\n\'She\'s shy, the wench is shy,\' Beletski called after her. \'Shy of you,\'\r\nhe added as, smiling gaily, he ran up the steps of the porch.\r\n\r\n\'How is it you are having a ball and have been driven out?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s at Ustenka\'s, at my landlady\'s, that the ball is, and you two are\r\ninvited. A ball consists of a pie and a gathering of girls.\'\r\n\r\n\'What should we do there?\'\r\n\r\nBeletski smiled knowingly and winked, jerking his head in the direction\r\nof the outhouse into which Maryanka had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOlenin shrugged his shoulders and blushed.\r\n\r\n\'Well, really you are a strange fellow!\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'Come now, don\'t pretend\'\r\n\r\nOlenin frowned, and Beletski noticing this smiled insinuatingly. \'Oh,\r\ncome, what do you mean?\' he said, \'living in the same house--and such a\r\nfine girl, a splendid girl, a perfect beauty.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wonderfully beautiful! I never saw such a woman before,\' replied\r\nOlenin.\r\n\r\n\'Well then?\' said Beletski, quite unable to understand the situation.\r\n\r\n\'It may be strange,\' replied Olenin, \'but why should I not say what is\r\ntrue? Since I have lived here women don\'t seem to exist for me. And it\r\nis so good, really! Now what can there be in common between us and\r\nwomen like these? Eroshka--that\'s a different matter! He and I have a\r\npassion in common--sport.\'\r\n\r\n\'There now! In common! And what have I in common with Amalia Ivanovna?\r\nIt\'s the same thing! You may say they\'re not very clean--that\'s another\r\nmatter... A la guerre, comme a la guerre! ...\'\r\n\r\n\'But I have never known any Amalia Ivanovas, and have never known how\r\nto behave with women of that sort,\' replied Olenin. \'One cannot respect\r\nthem, but these I do respect.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well go on respecting them! Who wants to prevent you?\'\r\n\r\nOlenin did not reply. He evidently wanted to complete what he had begun\r\nto say. It was very near his heart.\r\n\r\n\'I know I am an exception...\' He was visibly confused. \'But my life has\r\nso shaped itself that I not only see no necessity to renounce my rules,\r\nbut I could not live here, let alone live as happily as I am doing,\r\nwere I to live as you do. Therefore I look for something quite\r\ndifferent from what you look for.\'\r\n\r\nBeletski raised his eyebrows incredulously. \'Anyhow, come to me this\r\nevening; Maryanka will be there and I will make you acquainted. Do\r\ncome, please! If you feel dull you can go away. Will you come?\'\r\n\r\n\'I would come, but to speak frankly I am afraid of being\' seriously\r\ncarried away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, oh, oh!\' shouted Beletski. \'Only come, and I\'ll see that you\r\naren\'t. Will you? On your word?\'\r\n\r\n\'I would come, but really I don\'t understand what we shall do; what\r\npart we shall play!\'\r\n\r\n\'Please, I beg of you. You will come?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, perhaps I\'ll come,\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Really now! Charming women such as one sees nowhere else, and to live\r\nlike a monk! What an idea! Why spoil your life and not make use of what\r\nis at hand? Have you heard that our company is ordered to Vozdvizhensk?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hardly. I was told the 8th Company would be sent there,\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'No. I have had a letter from the adjutant there. He writes that the\r\nPrince himself will take part in the campaign. I am very glad I shall\r\nsee something of him. I\'m beginning to get tired of this place.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hear we shall start on a raid soon.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not heard of it; but I have heard that Krinovitsin has received\r\nthe Order of St. Anna for a raid. He expected a lieutenancy,\' said\r\nBeletski laughing. \'He was let in! He has set off for headquarters.\'\r\n\r\nIt was growing dusk and Olenin began thinking about the party. The\r\ninvitation he had received worried him. He felt inclined to go, but\r\nwhat might take place there seemed strange, absurd, and even rather\r\nalarming. He knew that neither Cossack men nor older women, nor anyone\r\nbesides the girls, were to be there. What was going to happen? How was\r\nhe to behave? What would they talk about? What connexion was there\r\nbetween him and those wild Cossack girls? Beletski had told him of such\r\ncurious, cynical, and yet rigid relations. It seemed strange to think\r\nthat he would be there in the same hut with Maryanka and perhaps might\r\nhave to talk to her. It seemed to him impossible when he remembered her\r\nmajestic bearing. But Beletski spoke of it as if it were all perfectly\r\nsimple. \'Is it possible that Beletski will treat Maryanka in the same\r\nway? That is interesting,\' thought he. \'No, better not go. It\'s all so\r\nhorrid, so vulgar, and above all--it leads to nothing!\' But again he\r\nwas worried by the question of what would take place; and besides he\r\nfelt as if bound by a promise. He went out without having made up his\r\nmind one way or the other, but he walked as far as Beletski\'s, and went\r\nin there.\r\n\r\nThe hut in which Beletski lived was like Olenin\'s. It was raised nearly\r\nfive feet from the ground on wooden piles, and had two rooms. In the\r\nfirst (which Olenin entered by the steep flight of steps) feather beds,\r\nrugs, blankets, and cushions were tastefully and handsomely arranged,\r\nCossack fashion, along the main wall. On the side wall hung brass\r\nbasins and weapons, while on the floor, under a bench, lay watermelons\r\nand pumpkins. In the second room there was a big brick oven, a table,\r\nand sectarian icons. It was here that Beletski was quartered, with his\r\ncamp-bed and his pack and trunks. His weapons hung on the wall with a\r\nlittle rug behind them, and on the table were his toilet appliances and\r\nsome portraits. A silk dressing-gown had been thrown on the bench.\r\nBeletski himself, clean and good-looking, lay on the bed in his\r\nunderclothing, reading Les Trois Mousquetaires.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up.\r\n\r\n\'There, you see how I have arranged things. Fine! Well, it\'s good that\r\nyou have come. They are working furiously. Do you know what the pie is\r\nmade of? Dough with a stuffing of pork and grapes. But that\'s not the\r\npoint. You just look at the commotion out there!\'\r\n\r\nAnd really, on looking out of the window they saw an unusual bustle\r\ngoing on in the hut. Girls ran in and out, now for one thing and now\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\n\'Will it soon be ready?\' cried Beletski.\r\n\r\n\'Very soon! Why? Is Grandad hungry?\' and from the hut came the sound of\r\nringing laughter.\r\n\r\nUstenka, plump, small, rosy, and pretty, with her sleeves turned up,\r\nran into Beletski\'s hut to fetch some plates.\r\n\r\n\'Get away or I shall smash the plates!\' she squeaked, escaping from\r\nBeletski. \'You\'d better come and help,\' she shouted to Olenin,\r\nlaughing. \'And don\'t forget to get some refreshments for the girls.\'\r\n(\'Refreshments\' meaning spicebread and sweets.)\r\n\r\n\'And has Maryanka come?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course! She brought some dough.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know,\' said Beletski, \'if one were to dress Ustenka up and\r\nclean and polish her up a bit, she\'d be better than all our beauties.\r\nHave you ever seen that Cossack woman who married a colonel; she was\r\ncharming! Borsheva? What dignity! Where do they get it...\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not seen Borsheva, but I think nothing could be better than the\r\ncostume they wear here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I\'m first-rate at fitting into any kind of life,\' said Beletski\r\nwith a sigh of pleasure. \'I\'ll go and see what they are up to.\'\r\n\r\nHe threw his dressing-gown over his shoulders and ran out, shouting,\r\n\'And you look after the "refreshments".\'\r\n\r\nOlenin sent Beletski\'s orderly to buy spice-bread and honey; but it\r\nsuddenly seemed to him so disgusting to give money (as if he were\r\nbribing someone) that he gave no definite reply to the orderly\'s\r\nquestion: \'How much spice-bread with peppermint, and how much with\r\nhoney?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just as you please.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shall I spend all the money,\' asked the old soldier impressively. \'The\r\npeppermint is dearer. It\'s sixteen kopeks.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, spend it all,\' answered Olenin and sat down by the window,\r\nsurprised that his heart was thumping as if he were preparing himself\r\nfor something serious and wicked.\r\n\r\nHe heard screaming and shrieking in the girls\' hut when Beletski went\r\nthere, and a few moments later saw how he jumped out and ran down the\r\nsteps, accompanied by shrieks, bustle, and laughter.\r\n\r\n\'Turned out,\' he said.\r\n\r\nA little later Ustenka entered and solemnly invited her visitors to\r\ncome in: announcing that all was ready.\r\n\r\nWhen they came into the room they saw that everything was really ready.\r\nUstenka was rearranging the cushions along the wall. On the table,\r\nwhich was covered by a disproportionately small cloth, was a decanter\r\nof chikhir and some dried fish. The room smelt of dough and grapes.\r\nSome half dozen girls in smart tunics, with their heads not covered as\r\nusual with kerchiefs, were huddled together in a corner behind the\r\noven, whispering, giggling, and spluttering with laughter.\r\n\r\n\'I humbly beg you to do honour to my patron saint,\' said Ustenka,\r\ninviting her guests to the table.\r\n\r\nOlenin noticed Maryanka among the group of girls, who without exception\r\nwere all handsome, and he felt vexed and hurt that he met her in such\r\nvulgar and awkward circumstances. He felt stupid and awkward, and made\r\nup his mind to do what Beletski did. Beletski stepped to the table\r\nsomewhat solemnly yet with confidence and ease, drank a glass of wine\r\nto Ustenka\'s health, and invited the others to do the same. Ustenka\r\nannounced that girls don\'t drink. \'We might with a little honey,\'\r\nexclaimed a voice from among the group of girls. The orderly, who had\r\njust returned with the honey and spice-cakes, was called in. He looked\r\naskance (whether with envy or with contempt) at the gentlemen, who in\r\nhis opinion were on the spree; and carefully and conscientiously handed\r\nover to them a piece of honeycomb and the cakes wrapped up in a piece\r\nof greyish paper, and began explaining circumstantially all about the\r\nprice and the change, but Beletski sent him away. Having mixed honey\r\nwith wine in the glasses, and having lavishly scattered the three\r\npounds of spice-cakes on the table, Beletski dragged the girls from\r\ntheir corners by force, made them sit down at the table, and began\r\ndistributing the cakes among them. Olenin involuntarily noticed how\r\nMaryanka\'s sunburnt but small hand closed on two round peppermint nuts\r\nand one brown one, and that she did not know what to do with them. The\r\nconversation was halting and constrained, in spite of Ustenka\'s and\r\nBeletski\'s free and easy manner and their wish to enliven the company.\r\nOlenin faltered, and tried to think of something to say, feeling that\r\nhe was exciting curiosity and perhaps provoking ridicule and infecting\r\nthe others with his shyness. He blushed, and it seemed to him that\r\nMaryanka in particular was feeling uncomfortable. \'Most likely they are\r\nexpecting us to give them some money,\' thought he. \'How are we to do\r\nit? And how can we manage quickest to give it and get away?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\'How is it you don\'t know your own lodger?\' said Beletski, addressing\r\nMaryanka.\r\n\r\n\'How is one to know him if he never comes to see us?\' answered\r\nMaryanka, with a look at Olenin.\r\n\r\nOlenin felt frightened, he did not know of what. He flushed and, hardly\r\nknowing what he was saying, remarked: \'I\'m afraid of your mother. She\r\ngave me such a scolding the first time I went in.\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka burst out laughing. \'And so you were frightened?\' she said,\r\nand glanced at him and turned away.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Olenin had seen the whole of her beautiful face.\r\nTill then he had seen her with her kerchief covering her to the eyes.\r\nIt was not for nothing that she was reckoned the beauty of the village.\r\nUstenka was a pretty girl, small, plump, rosy, with merry brown eyes,\r\nand red lips which were perpetually smiling and chattering. Maryanka on\r\nthe contrary was certainly not pretty but beautiful. Her features might\r\nhave been considered too masculine and almost harsh had it not been for\r\nher tall stately figure, her powerful chest and shoulders, and\r\nespecially the severe yet tender expression of her long dark eyes which\r\nwere darkly shadowed beneath their black brows, and for the gentle\r\nexpression of her mouth and smile. She rarely smiled, but her smile was\r\nalways striking. She seemed to radiate virginal strength and health.\r\nAll the girls were good-looking, but they themselves and Beletski, and\r\nthe orderly when he brought in the spice-cakes, all involuntarily gazed\r\nat Maryanka, and anyone addressing the girls was sure to address her.\r\nShe seemed a proud and happy queen among them.\r\n\r\nBeletski, trying to keep up the spirit of the party, chattered\r\nincessantly, made the girls hand round chikhir, fooled about with them,\r\nand kept making improper remarks in French about Maryanka\'s beauty to\r\nOlenin, calling her \'yours\' (la votre), and advising him to behave as\r\nhe did himself. Olenin felt more and more uncomfortable. He was\r\ndevising an excuse to get out and run away when Beletski announced that\r\nUstenka, whose saint\'s day it was, must offer chikhir to everybody with\r\na kiss. She consented on condition that they should put money on her\r\nplate, as is the custom at weddings.\r\n\r\n\'What fiend brought me to this disgusting feast?\' thought Olenin,\r\nrising to go away.\r\n\r\n\'Where are you off to?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll fetch some tobacco,\' he said, meaning to escape, but Beletski\r\nseized his hand.\r\n\r\n\'I have some money,\' he said to him in French.\r\n\r\n\'One can\'t go away, one has to pay here,\' thought Olenin bitterly,\r\nvexed at his own awkwardness. \'Can\'t I really behave like Beletski? I\r\nought not to have come, but once I am here I must not spoil their fun.\r\nI must drink like a Cossack,\' and taking the wooden bowl (holding about\r\neight tumblers) he almost filled it with chikhir and drank it almost\r\nall. The girls looked at him, surprised and almost frightened, as he\r\ndrank. It seemed to them strange and not right. Ustenka brought them\r\nanother glass each, and kissed them both. \'There girls, now we\'ll have\r\nsome fun,\' she said, clinking on the plate the four rubles the men had\r\nput there.\r\n\r\nOlenin no longer felt awkward, but became talkative.\r\n\r\n\'Now, Maryanka, it\'s your turn to offer us wine and a kiss,\' said\r\nBeletski, seizing her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I\'ll give you such a kiss!\' she said playfully, preparing to\r\nstrike at him.\r\n\r\n\'One can kiss Grandad without payment,\' said another girl.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s a sensible girl,\' said Beletski, kissing the struggling girl.\r\n\'No, you must offer it,\' he insisted, addressing Maryanka. \'Offer a\r\nglass to your lodger.\'\r\n\r\nAnd taking her by the hand he led her to the bench and sat her down\r\nbeside Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'What a beauty,\' he said, turning her head to see it in profile.\r\n\r\nMaryanka did not resist but proudly smiling turned her long eyes\r\ntowards Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'A beautiful girl,\' repeated Beletski.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, see what a beauty I am,\' Maryanka\'s look seemed to endorse.\r\nWithout considering what he was doing Olenin embraced Maryanka and was\r\ngoing to kiss her, but she suddenly extricated herself, upsetting\r\nBeletski and pushing the top off the table, and sprang away towards the\r\noven. There was much shouting and laughter. Then Beletski whispered\r\nsomething to the girls and suddenly they all ran out into the passage\r\nand locked the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\'Why did you kiss Beletski and won\'t kiss me?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, just so. I don\'t want to, that\'s all!\' she answered, pouting and\r\nfrowning. \'He\'s Grandad,\' she added with a smile. She went to the door\r\nand began to bang at it. \'Why have you locked the door, you devils?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, let them be there and us here,\' said Olenin, drawing closer to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe frowned, and sternly pushed him away with her hand. And again she\r\nappeared so majestically handsome to Olenin that he came to his senses\r\nand felt ashamed of what he was doing. He went to the door and began\r\npulling at it himself.\r\n\r\n \'Beletski! Open the door! What a stupid joke!\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka again gave a bright happy laugh. \'Ah, you\'re afraid of me?\'\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you know you\'re as cross as your mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Spend more of your time with Eroshka; that will make the girls love\r\nyou!\' And she smiled, looking straight and close into his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to reply. \'And if I were to come to see you--\' he\r\nlet fall.\r\n\r\n\'That would be a different matter,\' she replied, tossing her head.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Beletski pushed the door open, and Maryanka sprang away\r\nfrom Olenin and in doing so her thigh struck his leg.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all nonsense what I have been thinking about--love and\r\nself-sacrifice and Lukashka. Happiness is the one thing. He who is\r\nhappy is right,\' flashed through Olenin\'s mind, and with a strength\r\nunexpected to himself he seized and kissed the beautiful Maryanka on\r\nher temple and her cheek. Maryanka was not angry, but only burst into a\r\nloud laugh and ran out to the other girls.\r\n\r\nThat was the end of the party. Ustenka\'s mother, returned from her\r\nwork, gave all the girls a scolding, and turned them all out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' thought Olenin, as he walked home. \'I need only slacken the\r\nreins a bit and I might fall desperately in love with this Cossack\r\ngirl.\' He went to bed with these thoughts, but expected it all to blow\r\nover and that he would continue to live as before.\r\n\r\nBut the old life did not return. His relations to Maryanka were\r\nchanged. The wall that had separated them was broken down. Olenin now\r\ngreeted her every time they met.\r\n\r\nThe master of the house having returned to collect the rent, on hearing\r\nof Olenin\'s wealth and generosity invited him to his hut. The old woman\r\nreceived him kindly, and from the day of the party onwards Olenin often\r\nwent in of an evening and sat with them till late at night. He seemed\r\nto be living in the village just as he used to, but within him\r\neverything had changed. He spent his days in the forest, and towards\r\neight o\'clock, when it began to grow dusk, he would go to see his\r\nhosts, alone or with Daddy Eroshka. They grew so used to him that they\r\nwere surprised when he stayed away. He paid well for his wine and was a\r\nquiet fellow. Vanyusha would bring him his tea and he would sit down in\r\na corner near the oven. The old woman did not mind him but went on with\r\nher work, and over their tea or their chikhir they talked about Cossack\r\naffairs, about the neighbours, or about Russia: Olenin relating and the\r\nothers inquiring. Sometimes he brought a book and read to himself.\r\nMaryanka crouched like a wild goat with her feet drawn up under her,\r\nsometimes on the top of the oven, sometimes in a dark corner. She did\r\nnot take part in the conversations, but Olenin saw her eyes and face\r\nand heard her moving or cracking sunflower seeds, and he felt that she\r\nlistened with her whole being when he spoke, and was aware of his\r\npresence while he silently read to himself. Sometimes he thought her\r\neyes were fixed on him, and meeting their radiance he involuntarily\r\nbecame silent and gazed at her. Then she would instantly hide her face\r\nand he would pretend to be deep in conversation with the old woman,\r\nwhile he listened all the time to her breathing and to her every\r\nmovement and waited for her to look at him again. In the presence of\r\nothers she was generally bright and friendly with him, but when they\r\nwere alone together she was shy and rough. Sometimes he came in before\r\nMaryanka had returned home. Suddenly he would hear her firm footsteps\r\nand catch a glimmer of her blue cotton smock at the open door. Then she\r\nwould step into the middle of the hut, catch sight of him, and her eyes\r\nwould give a scarcely perceptible kindly smile, and he would feel happy\r\nand frightened.\r\n\r\nHe neither sought for nor wished for anything from her, but every day\r\nher presence became more and more necessary to him.\r\n\r\nOlenin had entered into the life of the Cossack village so fully that\r\nhis past seemed quite foreign to him. As to the future, especially a\r\nfuture outside the world in which he was now living, it did not\r\ninterest him at all. When he received letters from home, from relatives\r\nand friends, he was offended by the evident distress with which they\r\nregarded him as a lost man, while he in his village considered those as\r\nlost who did not live as he was living. He felt sure he would never\r\nrepent of having broken away from his former surroundings and of having\r\nsettled down in this village to such a solitary and original life. When\r\nout on expeditions, and when quartered at one of the forts, he felt\r\nhappy too; but it was here, from under Daddy Eroshka\'s wing, from the\r\nforest and from his hut at the end of the village, and especially when\r\nhe thought of Maryanka and Lukashka, that he seemed to see the\r\nfalseness of his former life. That falseness used to rouse his\r\nindignation even before, but now it seemed inexpressibly vile and\r\nridiculous. Here he felt freer and freer every day and more and more of\r\na man. The Caucasus now appeared entirely different to what his\r\nimagination had painted it. He had found nothing at all like his\r\ndreams, nor like the descriptions of the Caucasus he had heard and\r\nread. \'There are none of all those chestnut steeds, precipices, Amalet\r\nBeks, heroes or villains,\' thought he. \'The people live as nature\r\nlives: they die, are born, unite, and more are born--they fight, eat\r\nand drink, rejoice and die, without any restrictions but those that\r\nnature imposes on sun and grass, on animal and tree. They have no other\r\nlaws.\' Therefore these people, compared to himself, appeared to him\r\nbeautiful, strong, and free, and the sight of them made him feel\r\nashamed and sorry for himself. Often it seriously occurred to him to\r\nthrow up everything, to get registered as a Cossack, to buy a hut and\r\ncattle and marry a Cossack woman (only not Maryanka, whom he conceded\r\nto Lukashka), and to live with Daddy Eroshka and go shooting and\r\nfishing with him, and go with the Cossacks on their expeditions. \'Why\r\never don\'t I do it? What am I waiting for?\' he asked himself, and he\r\negged himself on and shamed himself. \'Am I afraid of doing what I hold\r\nto be reasonable and right? Is the wish to be a simple Cossack, to live\r\nclose to nature, not to injure anyone but even to do good to others,\r\nmore stupid than my former dreams, such as those of becoming a minister\r\nof state or a colonel?\' but a voice seemed to say that he should wait,\r\nand not take any decision. He was held back by a dim consciousness that\r\nhe could not live altogether like Eroshka and Lukashka because he had a\r\ndifferent idea of happiness--he was held back by the thought that\r\nhappiness lies in self-sacrifice. What he had done for Lukashka\r\ncontinued to give him joy. He kept looking for occasions to sacrifice\r\nhimself for others, but did not meet with them. Sometimes he forgot\r\nthis newly discovered recipe for happiness and considered himself\r\ncapable of identifying his life with Daddy Eroshka\'s, but then he\r\nquickly bethought himself and promptly clutched at the idea of\r\nconscious self-sacrifice, and from that basis looked calmly and proudly\r\nat all men and at their happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before the vintage Lukashka came on horseback to see Olenin. He\r\nlooked more dashing than ever. \'Well? Are you getting married?\' asked\r\nOlenin, greeting him merrily.\r\n\r\nLukashka gave no direct reply.\r\n\r\n\'There, I\'ve exchanged your horse across the river. This is a horse! A\r\nKabarda horse from the Lov stud. I know horses.\'\r\n\r\nThey examined the new horse and made him caracole about the yard. The\r\nhorse really was an exceptionally fine one, a broad and long gelding,\r\nwith glossy coat, thick silky tail, and the soft fine mane and crest of\r\na thoroughbred. He was so well fed that \'you might go to sleep on his\r\nback\' as Lukashka expressed it. His hoofs, eyes, teeth, were\r\nexquisitely shaped and sharply outlined, as one only finds them in very\r\npure-bred horses. Olenin could not help admiring the horse, he had not\r\nyet met with such a beauty in the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n\'And how it goes!\' said Lukashka, patting its neck. \'What a step! And\r\nso clever--he simply runs after his master.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you have to add much to make the exchange?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'I did not count it,\' answered Lukashka with a smile. \'I got him from a\r\nkunak.\'\r\n\r\n\'A wonderfully beautiful horse! What would you take for it?\' asked\r\nOlenin.\r\n\r\n\'I have been offered a hundred and fifty rubles for it, but I\'ll give\r\nit you for nothing,\' said Lukashka, merrily. \'Only say the word and\r\nit\'s yours. I\'ll unsaddle it and you may take it. Only give me some\r\nsort of a horse for my duties.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, on no account.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then, here is a dagger I\'ve brought you,\' said Lukashka,\r\nunfastening his girdle and taking out one of the two daggers which hung\r\nfrom it. \'I got it from across the river.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, thank you!\'\r\n\r\n\'And mother has promised to bring you some grapes herself.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s quite unnecessary. We\'ll balance up some day. You see I don\'t\r\noffer you any money for the dagger!\'\r\n\r\n\'How could you? We are kunaks. It\'s just the same as when Girey Khan\r\nacross the river took me into his home and said,\r\n\r\n"Choose what you like!" So I took this sword. It\'s our custom.\'\r\n\r\nThey went into the hut and had a drink.\r\n\r\n\'Are you staying here awhile?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'No, I have come to say good-bye. They are sending me from the cordon\r\nto a company beyond the Terek. I am going to-night with my comrade\r\nNazarka.\'\r\n\r\n\'And when is the wedding to be?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall be coming back for the betrothal, and then I shall return to\r\nthe company again,\' Lukashka replied reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\'What, and see nothing of your betrothed?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just so--what is the good of looking at her? When you go on campaign\r\nask in our company for Lukashka the Broad. But what a lot of boars\r\nthere are in our parts! I\'ve killed two. I\'ll take you.\' \'Well,\r\ngood-bye! Christ save you.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka mounted his horse, and without calling on Maryanka, rode\r\ncaracoling down the street, where Nazarka was already awaiting him.\r\n\r\n\'I say, shan\'t we call round?\' asked Nazarka, winking in the direction\r\nof Yamka\'s house.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a good one!\' said Lukashka. \'Here, take my horse to her and if\r\nI don\'t come soon give him some hay. I shall reach the company by the\r\nmorning anyway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hasn\'t the cadet given you anything more?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am thankful to have paid him back with a dagger--he was going to ask\r\nfor the horse,\' said Lukashka, dismounting and handing over the horse\r\nto Nazarka.\r\n\r\nHe darted into the yard past Olenin\'s very window, and came up to the\r\nwindow of the cornet\'s hut. It was already quite dark. Maryanka,\r\nwearing only her smock, was combing her hair preparing for bed.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s I--\' whispered the Cossack.\r\n\r\nMaryanka\'s look was severely indifferent, but her face suddenly\r\nbrightened up when she heard her name. She opened the window and leant\r\nout, frightened and joyous.\r\n\r\n\'What--what do you want?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Open!\' uttered Lukashka. \'Let me in for a minute. I am so sick of\r\nwaiting! It\'s awful!\'\r\n\r\nHe took hold of her head through the window and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\'Really, do open!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why do you talk nonsense? I\'ve told you I won\'t! Have you come for\r\nlong?\'\r\n\r\nHe did not answer but went on kissing her, and she did not ask again.\r\n\r\n\'There, through the window one can\'t even hug you properly,\' said\r\nLukashka.\r\n\r\n\'Maryanka dear!\' came the voice of her mother, \'who is that with you?\'\r\n\r\nLukashka took off his cap, which might have been seen, and crouched\r\ndown by the window.\r\n\r\n\'Go, be quick!\' whispered Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'Lukashka called round,\' she answered; \'he was asking for Daddy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then send him here!\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s gone; said he was in a hurry.\'\r\n\r\nIn fact, Lukashka, stooping, as with big strides he passed under the\r\nwindows, ran out through the yard and towards Yamka\'s house unseen by\r\nanyone but Olenin. After drinking two bowls of chikhir he and Nazarka\r\nrode away to the outpost. The night was warm, dark, and calm. They rode\r\nin silence, only the footfall of their horses was heard. Lukashka\r\nstarted a song about the Cossack, Mingal, but stopped before he had\r\nfinished the first verse, and after a pause, turning to Nazarka, said:\r\n\r\n\'I say, she wouldn\'t let me in!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh?\' rejoined Nazarka. \'I knew she wouldn\'t. D\'you know what Yamka\r\ntold me? The cadet has begun going to their house. Daddy Eroshka brags\r\nthat he got a gun from the cadet for getting him Maryanka.\'\r\n\r\n\'He lies, the old devil!\' said Lukashka, angrily. \'She\'s not such a\r\ngirl. If he does not look out I\'ll wallop that old devil\'s sides,\' and\r\nhe began his favourite song:\r\n\r\n\'From the village of Izmaylov,\r\n  From the master\'s favourite garden,\r\n  Once escaped a keen-eyed falcon.\r\n Soon after him a huntsman came a-riding,\r\n  And he beckoned to the falcon that had strayed,\r\n  But the bright-eyed bird thus answered:\r\n "In gold cage you could not keep me,\r\n On your hand you could not hold me,\r\n  So now I fly to blue seas far away.\r\n There a white swan I will kill,\r\n Of sweet swan-flesh have my fill."\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bethrothal was taking place in the cornet\'s hut. Lukashka had\r\nreturned to the village, but had not been to see Olenin, and Olenin had\r\nnot gone to the betrothal though he had been invited. He was sad as he\r\nhad never been since he settled in this Cossack village. He had seen\r\nLukashka earlier in the evening and was worried by the question why\r\nLukashka was so cold towards him. Olenin shut himself up in his hut and\r\nbegan writing in his diary as follows:\r\n\r\n\'Many things have I pondered over lately and much have I changed,\'\r\nwrote he, \'and I have come back to the copybook maxim: The one way to\r\nbe happy is to love, to love self-denyingly, to love everybody and\r\neverything; to spread a web of love on all sides and to take all who\r\ncome into it. In this way I caught Vanyusha, Daddy Eroshka, Lukashka,\r\nand Maryanka.\'\r\n\r\nAs Olenin was finishing this sentence Daddy Eroshka entered the room.\r\n\r\nEroshka was in the happiest frame of mind. A few evenings before this,\r\nOlenin had gone to see him and had found him with a proud and happy\r\nface deftly skinning the carcass of a boar with a small knife in the\r\nyard. The dogs (Lyam his pet among them) were lying close by watching\r\nwhat he was doing and gently wagging their tails. The little boys were\r\nrespectfully looking at him through the fence and not even teasing him\r\nas was their wont. His women neighbours, who were as a rule not too\r\ngracious towards him, greeted him and brought him, one a jug of\r\nchikhir, another some clotted cream, and a third a little flour. The\r\nnext day Eroshka sat in his store-room all covered with blood, and\r\ndistributed pounds of boar-flesh, taking in payment money from some and\r\nwine from others. His face clearly expressed, \'God has sent me luck. I\r\nhave killed a boar, so now I am wanted.\' Consequently, he naturally\r\nbegan to drink, and had gone on for four days never leaving the\r\nvillage. Besides which he had had something to drink at the betrothal.\r\n\r\nHe came to Olenin quite drunk: his face red, his beard tangled, but\r\nwearing a new beshmet trimmed with gold braid; and he brought with him\r\na balalayka which he had obtained beyond the river. He had long\r\npromised Olenin this treat, and felt in the mood for it, so that he was\r\nsorry to find Olenin writing.\r\n\r\n\'Write on, write on, my lad,\' he whispered, as if he thought that a\r\nspirit sat between him and the paper and must not be frightened away,\r\nand he softly and silently sat down on the floor. When Daddy Eroshka\r\nwas drunk his favourite position was on the floor. Olenin looked round,\r\nordered some wine to be brought, and continued to write. Eroshka found\r\nit dull to drink by himself and he wished to talk.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been to the betrothal at the cornet\'s. But there! They\'re\r\nshwine!--Don\'t want them!--Have come to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'And where did you get your balalayka asked Olenin, still writing.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been beyond the river and got it there, brother mine,\' he\r\nanswered, also very quietly. \'I\'m a master at it. Tartar or Cossack,\r\nsquire or soldiers\' songs, any kind you please.\'\r\n\r\nOlenin looked at him again, smiled, and went on writing.\r\n\r\nThat smile emboldened the old man.\r\n\r\n\'Come, leave off, my lad, leave off!\' he said with sudden firmness.\r\n\r\n\'Well, perhaps I will.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, people have injured you but leave them alone, spit at them!\r\nCome, what\'s the use of writing and writing, what\'s the good?\'\r\n\r\nAnd he tried to mimic Olenin by tapping the floor with his thick\r\nfingers, and then twisted his big face to express contempt.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the good of writing quibbles. Better have a spree and show\r\nyou\'re a man!\'\r\n\r\nNo other conception of writing found place in his head except that of\r\nlegal chicanery.\r\n\r\nOlenin burst out laughing and so did Eroshka. Then, jumping up from the\r\nfloor, the latter began to show off his skill on the balalayka and to\r\nsing Tartar songs.\r\n\r\n\'Why write, my good fellow! You\'d better listen to what I\'ll sing to\r\nyou. When you\'re dead you won\'t hear any more songs. Make merry now!\'\r\n\r\nFirst he sang a song of his own composing accompanied by a dance:\r\n\r\n\'Ah, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim, Say where did they last see him? In\r\na booth, at the fair, He was selling pins, there.\'\r\n\r\nThen he sang a song he had learnt from his former sergeant-major:\r\n\r\n\'Deep I fell in love on Monday, Tuesday nothing did but sigh, Wednesday\r\nI popped the question, Thursday waited her reply. Friday, late, it came\r\nat last, Then all hope for me was past! Saturday my life to take I\r\ndetermined like a man, But for my salvation\'s sake Sunday morning\r\nchanged my plan!\'\r\n\r\nThen he sang again:\r\n\r\n\'Oh dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim, Say where did they last see him?\'\r\n\r\nAnd after that, winking, twitching his shoulders, and footing it to the\r\ntune, he sang:\r\n\r\n\'I will kiss you and embrace, Ribbons red twine round you; And I\'ll\r\ncall you little Grace. Oh, you little Grace now do Tell me, do you love\r\nme true?\'\r\n\r\nAnd he became so excited that with a sudden dashing movement he started\r\ndancing around the room accompanying himself the while.\r\n\r\nSongs like \'Dee, dee, dee\'--\'gentlemen\'s songs\'--he sang for Olenin\'s\r\nbenefit, but after drinking three more tumblers of chikhir he\r\nremembered old times and began singing real Cossack and Tartar songs.\r\nIn the midst of one of his favourite songs his voice suddenly trembled\r\nand he ceased singing, and only continued strumming on the balalayka.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, my dear friend!\' he said.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar sound of his voice made Olenin look round.\r\n\r\nThe old man was weeping. Tears stood in his eyes and one tear was\r\nrunning down his cheek.\r\n\r\n\'You are gone, my young days, and will never come back!\' he said,\r\nblubbering and halting. \'Drink, why don\'t you drink!\' he suddenly\r\nshouted with a deafening roar, without wiping away his tears.\r\n\r\nThere was one Tartar song that specially moved him. It had few words,\r\nbut its charm lay in the sad refrain. \'Ay day, dalalay!\' Eroshka\r\ntranslated the words of the song: \'A youth drove his sheep from the\r\naoul to the mountains: the Russians came and burnt the aoul, they\r\nkilled all the men and took all the women into bondage. The youth\r\nreturned from the mountains. Where the aoul had stood was an empty\r\nspace; his mother not there, nor his brothers, nor his house; one tree\r\nalone was left standing. The youth sat beneath the tree and wept.\r\n"Alone like thee, alone am I left,\'" and Eroshka began singing: \'Ay\r\nday, dalalay!\' and the old man repeated several times this wailing,\r\nheart-rending refrain.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished the refrain Eroshka suddenly seized a gun that\r\nhung on the wall, rushed hurriedly out into the yard and fired off both\r\nbarrels into the air. Then again he began, more dolefully, his \'Ay day,\r\ndalalay--ah, ah,\' and ceased.\r\n\r\nOlenin followed him into the porch and looked up into the starry sky in\r\nthe direction where the shots had flashed. In the cornet\'s house there\r\nwere lights and the sound of voices. In the yard girls were crowding\r\nround the porch and the windows, and running backwards and forwards\r\nbetween the hut and the outhouse. Some Cossacks rushed out of the hut\r\nand could not refrain from shouting, re-echoing the refrain of Daddy\r\nEroshka\'s song and his shots.\r\n\r\n\'Why are you not at the betrothal?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind them! Never mind them!\' muttered the old man, who had\r\nevidently been offended by something there. \'Don\'t like them, I don\'t.\r\nOh, those people! Come back into the hut! Let them make merry by\r\nthemselves and we\'ll make merry by ourselves.\'\r\n\r\nOlenin went in.\r\n\r\n\'And Lukashka, is he happy? Won\'t he come to see me?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'What, Lukashka? They\'ve lied to him and said I am getting his girl for\r\nyou,\' whispered the old man. \'But what\'s the girl? She will be ours if\r\nwe want her. Give enough money--and she\'s ours. I\'ll fix it up for you.\r\nReally!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Daddy, money can do nothing if she does not love me. You\'d better\r\nnot talk like that!\'\r\n\r\n\'We are not loved, you and I. We are forlorn,\' said Daddy Eroshka\r\nsuddenly, and again he began to cry.\r\n\r\nListening to the old man\'s talk Olenin had drunk more than usual. \'So\r\nnow my Lukashka is happy,\' thought he; yet he felt sad. The old man had\r\ndrunk so much that evening that he fell down on the floor and Vanyusha\r\nhad to call soldiers in to help, and spat as they dragged the old man\r\nout. He was so angry with the old man for his bad behaviour that he did\r\nnot even say a single French word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was August. For days the sky had been cloudless, the sun scorched\r\nunbearably and from early morning the warm wind raised a whirl of hot\r\nsand from the sand-drifts and from the road, and bore it in the air\r\nthrough the reeds, the trees, and the village. The grass and the leaves\r\non the trees were covered with dust, the roads and dried-up salt\r\nmarshes were baked so hard that they rang when trodden on. The water\r\nhad long since subsided in the Terek and rapidly vanished and dried up\r\nin the ditches. The slimy banks of the pond near the village were\r\ntrodden bare by the cattle and all day long you could hear the\r\nsplashing of water and the shouting of girls and boys bathing. The\r\nsand-drifts and the reeds were already drying up in the steppes, and\r\nthe cattle, lowing, ran into the fields in the day-time. The boars\r\nmigrated into the distant reed-beds and to the hills beyond the Terek.\r\nMosquitoes and gnats swarmed in thick clouds over the low lands and\r\nvillages. The snow-peaks were hidden in grey mist. The air was rarefied\r\nand smoky. It was said that abreks had crossed the now shallow river\r\nand were prowling on this side of it. Every night the sun set in a\r\nglowing red blaze. It was the busiest time of the year. The villagers\r\nall swarmed in the melon-fields and the vineyards. The vineyards\r\nthickly overgrown with twining verdure lay in cool, deep shade.\r\nEverywhere between the broad translucent leaves, ripe, heavy, black\r\nclusters peeped out. Along the dusty road from the vineyards the\r\ncreaking carts moved slowly, heaped up with black grapes. Clusters of\r\nthem, crushed by the wheels, lay in the dirt. Boys and girls in smocks\r\nstained with grape-juice, with grapes in their hands and mouths, ran\r\nafter their mothers. On the road you continually came across tattered\r\nlabourers with baskets of grapes on their powerful shoulders; Cossack\r\nmaidens, veiled with kerchiefs to their eyes, drove bullocks harnessed\r\nto carts laden high with grapes. Soldiers who happened to meet these\r\ncarts asked for grapes, and the maidens, clambering up without stopping\r\ntheir carts, would take an armful of grapes and drop them into the\r\nskirts of the soldiers\' coats. In some homesteads they had already\r\nbegun pressing the grapes; and the smell of the emptied skins filled\r\nthe air. One saw the blood-red troughs in the pent-houses in the yards\r\nand Nogay labourers with their trousers rolled up and their legs\r\nstained with the juice. Grunting pigs gorged themselves with the empty\r\nskins and rolled about in them. The flat roofs of the outhouses were\r\nall spread over with the dark amber clusters drying in the sun. Daws\r\nand magpies crowded round the roofs, picking the seeds and fluttering\r\nfrom one place to another.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the year\'s labour were being merrily gathered in, and\r\nthis year the fruit was unusually fine and plentiful.\r\n\r\nIn the shady green vineyards amid a sea of vines, laughter, songs,\r\nmerriment, and the voices of women were to be heard on all sides, and\r\nglimpses of their bright-coloured garments could be seen.\r\n\r\nJust at noon Maryanka was sitting in their vineyard in the shade of a\r\npeach-tree, getting out the family dinner from under an unharnessed\r\ncart. Opposite her, on a spread-out horse-cloth, sat the cornet (who\r\nhad returned from the school) washing his hands by pouring water on\r\nthem from a little jug. Her little brother, who had just come straight\r\nout of the pond, stood wiping his face with his wide sleeves, and gazed\r\nanxiously at his sister and his mother and breathed deeply, awaiting\r\nhis dinner. The old mother, with her sleeves rolled up over her strong\r\nsunburnt arms, was arranging grapes, dried fish, and clotted cream on a\r\nlittle low, circular Tartar table. The cornet wiped his hands, took off\r\nhis cap, crossed himself, and moved nearer to the table. The boy seized\r\nthe jug and eagerly began to drink. The mother and daughter crossed\r\ntheir legs under them and sat down by the table. Even in the shade it\r\nwas intolerably hot. The air above the vineyard smelt unpleasant: the\r\nstrong warm wind passing amid the branches brought no coolness, but\r\nonly monotonously bent the tops of the pear, peach, and mulberry trees\r\nwith which the vineyard was sprinkled. The cornet, having crossed\r\nhimself once more, took a little jug of <i>chikhir</i> that stood\r\nbehind him covered with a vine-leaf, and having had a drink from the\r\nmouth of the jug passed it to the old woman. He had nothing on over\r\nhis shirt, which was unfastened at the neck and showed his shaggy\r\nmuscular chest. His fine-featured cunning face looked cheerful; neither\r\nin his attitude nor in his words was his usual wiliness to be seen; he\r\nwas cheerful and natural.\r\n\r\n\'Shall we finish the bit beyond the shed to-night?\' he asked, wiping\r\nhis wet beard.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll manage it,\' replied his wife, \'if only the weather does not\r\nhinder us. The Demkins have not half finished yet,\' she added. \'Only\r\nUstenka is at work there, wearing herself out.\'\r\n\r\n\'What can you expect of them?\' said the old man proudly.\r\n\r\n\'Here, have a drink, Maryanka dear!\' said the old woman, passing the\r\njug to the girl. \'God willing we\'ll have enough to pay for the\r\nwedding feast,\' she added.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not yet awhile,\' said the cornet with a slight frown.\r\n\r\nThe girl hung her head.\r\n\r\n\'Why shouldn\'t we mention it?\' said the old woman. \'The affair is\r\nsettled, and the time is drawing near too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t make plans beforehand,\' said the cornet. \'Now we have the\r\nharvest to get in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you seen Lukashka\'s new horse?\' asked the old woman. \'That\r\nwhich Dmitri Andreich Olenin gave him is gone -- he\'s exchanged it.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I have not; but I spoke with the servant to-day,\' said the cornet,\r\n\'and he said his master has again received a thousand rubles.\'\r\n\r\n\'Rolling in riches, in short,\' said the old woman.\r\n\r\nThe whole family felt cheerful and contented.\r\n\r\nThe work was progressing successfully. The grapes were more abundant\r\nand finer than they had expected.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Maryanka threw some grass to the oxen, folded her\r\n<i>beshmet</i> for a pillow, and lay down under the wagon on the juicy\r\ndown-trodden grass. She had on only a red kerchief over her head and a\r\nfaded blue print smock, yet\r\n\r\nshe felt unbearably hot. Her face was burning, and she did not know\r\nwhere to put her feet, her eyes were moist with sleepiness and\r\nweariness, her lips parted involuntarily, and her chest heaved heavily\r\nand deeply.\r\n\r\nThe busy time of year had begun a fortnight ago and the continuous\r\nheavy labour had filled the girl\'s life. At dawn she jumped up, washed\r\nher face with cold water, wrapped herself in a shawl, and ran out\r\nbarefoot to see to the cattle. Then she hurriedly put on her shoes and\r\nher beshmet and, taking a small bundle of bread, she harnessed the\r\nbullocks and drove away to the vineyards for the whole day. There she\r\ncut the grapes and carried the baskets with only an hour\'s interval for\r\nrest, and in the evening she returned to the village, bright and not\r\ntired, dragging the bullocks by a rope or driving them with a long\r\nstick. After attending to the cattle, she took some sunflower seeds in\r\nthe wide sleeve of her smock and went to the corner of the street to\r\ncrack them and have some fun with the other girls. But as soon as it\r\nwas dusk she returned home, and after having supper with her parents\r\nand her brother in the dark outhouse, she went into the hut, healthy\r\nand free from care, and climbed onto the oven, where half drowsing she\r\nlistened to their lodger\'s conversation. As soon as he went away she\r\nwould throw herself down on her bed and sleep soundly and quietly till\r\nmorning. And so it went on day after day. She had not seen Lukashka\r\nsince the day of their betrothal, but calmly awaited the wedding. She\r\nhad got used to their lodger and felt his intent looks with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no escape from the heat and the mosquitoes swarmed\r\nin the cool shadow of the wagons, and her little brother tossing about\r\nbeside her kept pushing her, Maryanka having drawn her kerchief over\r\nher head was just falling asleep, when suddenly their neighbour Ustenka\r\ncame running towards her and, diving under the wagon, lay down beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\'Sleep, girls, sleep!\' said Ustenka, making herself comfortable under\r\nthe wagon. \'Wait a bit,\' she exclaimed, \'this won\'t do!\'\r\n\r\nShe jumped up, plucked some green branches, and stuck them through the\r\nwheels on both sides of the wagon and hung her beshmet over them.\r\n\r\n\'Let me in,\' she shouted to the little boy as she again crept under the\r\nwagon. \'Is this the place for a Cossack--with the girls? Go away!\'\r\n\r\nWhen alone under the wagon with her friend, Ustenka suddenly put both\r\nher arms round her, and clinging close to her began kissing her cheeks\r\nand neck.\r\n\r\n\'Darling, sweetheart,\' she kept repeating, between bursts of shrill,\r\nclear laughter.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you\'ve learnt it from Grandad,\' said Maryanka, struggling. \'Stop\r\nit!\'\r\n\r\nAnd they both broke into such peals of laughter that Maryanka\'s mother\r\nshouted to them to be quiet.\r\n\r\n\'Are you jealous?\' asked Ustenka in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\'What humbug! Let me sleep. What have you come for?\'\r\n\r\nBut Ustenka kept on, \'I say! But I wanted to tell you such a thing.\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka raised herself on her elbow and arranged the kerchief which\r\nhad slipped off.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I know something about your lodger!\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s nothing to know,\' said Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you rogue of a girl!\' said Ustenka, nudging her with her elbow and\r\nlaughing. \'Won\'t tell anything. Does he come to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'He does. What of that?\' said Maryanka with a sudden blush.\r\n\r\n\'Now I\'m a simple lass. I tell everybody. Why should I pretend?\' said\r\nUstenka, and her bright rosy face suddenly became pensive. \'Whom do I\r\nhurt? I love him, that\'s all about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Grandad, do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, yes!\'\r\n\r\n\'And the sin?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, Maryanka! When is one to have a good time if not while one\'s still\r\nfree? When I marry a Cossack I shall bear children and shall have\r\ncares. There now, when you get married to Lukashka not even a thought\r\nof joy will enter your head: children will come, and work!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well? Some who are married live happily. It makes no difference!\'\r\nMaryanka replied quietly.\r\n\r\n\'Do tell me just this once what has passed between you and Lukishka?\'\r\n\r\n\'What has passed? A match was proposed. Father put it off for a year,\r\nbut now it\'s been settled and they\'ll marry us in autumn.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what did he say to you?\' Maryanka smiled.\r\n\r\n\'What should he say? He said he loved me. He kept asking me to come to\r\nthe vineyards with him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just see what pitch! But you didn\'t go, did you? And what a dare-devil\r\nhe has become: the first among the braves. He makes merry out there in\r\nthe army too! The other day our Kirka came home; he says: "What a horse\r\nLukashka\'s got in exchange!" But all the same I expect he frets after\r\nyou. And what else did he say?\'\r\n\r\n\'Must you know everything?\' said Maryanka laughing. \'One night he came\r\nto my window tipsy, and asked me to let him in.\' \'And you didn\'t let\r\nhim?\'\r\n\r\n\'Let him, indeed! Once I have said a thing I keep to it firm as a\r\nrock,\' answered Maryanka seriously.\r\n\r\n\'A fine fellow! If he wanted her, no girl would refuse him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, let him go to the others,\' replied Maryanka proudly.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t pity him?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do pity him, but I\'ll have no nonsense. It is wrong.\' Ustenka\r\nsuddenly dropped her head on her friend\'s breast, seized hold of her,\r\nand shook with smothered laughter. \'You silly fool!\' she exclaimed,\r\nquite out of breath. \'You don\'t want to be happy,\' and she began\r\ntickling Maryanka. \'Oh, leave off!\' said Maryanka, screaming and\r\nlaughing. \'You\'ve crushed Lazutka.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hark at those young devils! Quite frisky! Not tired yet!\' came the old\r\nwoman\'s sleepy voice from the wagon.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t want happiness,\' repeated Ustenka in a whisper, insistently.\r\n\'But you are lucky, that you are! How they love you! You are so crusty,\r\nand yet they love you. Ah, if I were in your place I\'d soon turn the\r\nlodger\'s head! I noticed him when you were at our house. He was ready\r\nto eat you with his eyes. What things Grandad has given me! And yours\r\nthey say is the richest of the Russians. His orderly says they have\r\nserfs of their own.\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka raised herself, and after thinking a moment, smiled.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know what he once told me: the lodger I mean?\' she said, biting\r\na bit of grass. \'He said, "I\'d like to be Lukashka the Cossack, or your\r\nbrother Lazutka--." What do you think he meant?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, just chattering what came into his head,\' answered Ustenka. \'What\r\ndoes mine not say! Just as if he was possessed!\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka dropped her hand on her folded beshmet, threw her arm over\r\nUstenka\'s shoulder, and shut her eyes.\r\n\r\n\'He wanted to come and work in the vineyard to-day: father invited\r\nhim,\' she said, and after a short silence she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun had come out from behind the pear-tree that had shaded the\r\nwagon, and even through the branches that Ustenka had fixed up it\r\nscorched the faces of the sleeping girls. Maryanka woke up and began\r\narranging the kerchief on her head. Looking about her, beyond the\r\npear-tree she noticed their lodger, who with his gun on his shoulder\r\nstood talking to her father. She nudged Ustenka and smilingly pointed\r\nhim out to her.\r\n\r\n\'I went yesterday and didn\'t find a single one,\' Olenin was saying as\r\nhe looked about uneasily, not seeing Maryanka through the branches.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, you should go out there in that direction, go right as by\r\ncompasses, there in a disused vineyard denominated as the Waste, hares\r\nare always to be found,\' said the cornet, having at once changed his\r\nmanner of speech.\r\n\r\n\'A fine thing to go looking for hares in these busy times! You had\r\nbetter come and help us, and do some work with the girls,\' the old\r\nwoman said merrily. \'Now then, girls, up with you!\' she cried.\r\n\r\nMaryanka and Ustenka under the cart were whispering and could hardly\r\nrestrain their laughter.\r\n\r\nSince it had become known that Olenin had given a horse worth fifty\r\nrubles to Lukashka, his hosts had become more amiable and the cornet in\r\nparticular saw with pleasure his daughter\'s growing intimacy with\r\nOlenin. \'But I don\'t know how to do the work,\' replied Olenin, trying\r\nnot to look through the green branches under the wagon where he had now\r\nnoticed Maryanka\'s blue smock and red kerchief.\r\n\r\n\'Come, I\'ll give you some peaches,\' said the old woman.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s only according to the ancient Cossack hospitality. It\'s her old\r\nwoman\'s silliness,\' said the cornet, explaining and apparently\r\ncorrecting his wife\'s words. \'In Russia, I expect, it\'s not so much\r\npeaches as pineapple jam and preserves you have been accustomed to eat\r\nat your pleasure.\'\r\n\r\n\'So you say hares are to be found in the disused vineyard?\' asked\r\nOlenin. \'I will go there,\' and throwing a hasty glance through the\r\ngreen branches he raised his cap and disappeared between the regular\r\nrows of green vines.\r\n\r\nThe sun had already sunk behind the fence of the vineyards, and its\r\nbroken rays glittered through the translucent leaves when Olenin\r\nreturned to his host\'s vineyard. The wind was falling and a cool\r\nfreshness was beginning to spread around. By some instinct Olenin\r\nrecognized from afar Maryanka\'s blue smock among the rows of vine, and,\r\npicking grapes on his way, he approached her. His highly excited dog\r\nalso now and then seized a low-hanging cluster of grapes in his\r\nslobbering mouth. Maryanka, her face flushed, her sleeves rolled up,\r\nand her kerchief down below her chin, was rapidly cutting the heavy\r\nclusters and laying them in a basket. Without letting go of the vine\r\nshe had hold of, she stopped to smile pleasantly at him and resumed her\r\nwork. Olenin drew near and threw his gun behind his back to have his\r\nhands free. \'Where are your people? May God aid you! Are you alone?\' he\r\nmeant to say but did not say, and only raised his cap in silence.\r\n\r\nHe was ill at ease alone with Maryanka, but as if purposely to torment\r\nhimself he went up to her.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll be shooting the women with your gun like that,\' said Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'No, I shan\'t shoot them.\'\r\n\r\nThey were both silent.\r\n\r\nThen after a pause she said: \'You should help me.\'\r\n\r\nHe took out his knife and began silently to cut off the clusters. He\r\nreached from under the leaves low down a thick bunch weighing about\r\nthree pounds, the grapes of which grew so close that they flattened\r\neach other for want of space. He showed it to Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'Must they all be cut? Isn\'t this one too green?\'\r\n\r\n\'Give it here.\'\r\n\r\nTheir hands touched. Olenin took her hand, and she looked at him\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\'Are you going to be married soon?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but turned away with a stern look.\r\n\r\n\'Do you love Lukashka?\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s that to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I envy him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Very likely!\' \'No really. You are so beautiful!\'\r\n\r\nAnd he suddenly felt terribly ashamed of having said it, so commonplace\r\ndid the words seem to him. He flushed, lost control of himself, and\r\nseized both her hands.\r\n\r\n\'Whatever I am, I\'m not for you. Why do you make fun of me?\' replied\r\nMaryanka, but her look showed how certainly she knew he was not making\r\nfun.\r\n\r\n\'Making fun? If you only knew how I--\'\r\n\r\nThe words sounded still more commonplace, they accorded still less with\r\nwhat he felt, but yet he continued, \'I don\'t know what I would not do\r\nfor you--\'\r\n\r\n\'Leave me alone, you pitch!\'\r\n\r\nBut her face, her shining eyes, her swelling bosom, her shapely legs,\r\nsaid something quite different. It seemed to him that she understood\r\nhow petty were all things he had said, but that she was superior to\r\nsuch considerations. It seemed to him she had long known all he wished\r\nand was not able to tell her, but wanted to hear how he would say it.\r\n\'And how can she help knowing,\' he thought, \'since I only want to tell\r\nher all that she herself is? But she does not wish to under-stand, does\r\nnot wish to reply.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hallo!\' suddenly came Ustenka\'s high voice from behind the vine at no\r\ngreat distance, followed by her shrill laugh. \'Come and help me, Dmitri\r\nAndreich. I am all alone,\' she cried, thrusting her round, naive little\r\nface through the vines.\r\n\r\nOlenin did not answer nor move from his place.\r\n\r\nMaryanka went on cutting and continually looked up at Olenin. He was\r\nabout to say something, but stopped, shrugged his shoulders and, having\r\njerked up his gun, walked out of the vineyard with rapid strides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stopped once or twice, listening to the ringing laughter of Maryanka\r\nand Ustenka who, having come together, were shouting something. Olenin\r\nspent the whole evening hunting in the forest and returned home at dusk\r\nwithout having killed anything. When crossing the road he noticed her\r\nopen the door of the outhouse, and her blue smock showed through it. He\r\ncalled to Vanyusha very loud so as to let her know that he was back,\r\nand then sat down in the porch in his usual place. His hosts now\r\nreturned from the vineyard; they came out of the outhouse and into\r\ntheir hut, but did not ask of the latch and knocked. The floor hardly\r\ncreaked under the bare cautious footsteps which approached the door.\r\nThe latch clicked, the door creaked, and he noticed a faint smell of\r\nmarjoram and pumpkin, and Maryanka\'s whole figure appeared in the\r\ndoorway. He saw her only for an instant in the moonlight. She slammed\r\nthe door and, muttering something, ran lightly back again. Olenin began\r\nrapping softly but nothing responded. He ran to the window and\r\nlistened. Suddenly he was startled by a shrill, squeaky man\'s voice.\r\n\r\n\'Fine!\' exclaimed a rather small young Cossack in a white cap, coming\r\nacross the yard close to Olenin. \'I saw ... fine!\'\r\n\r\nOlenin recognized Nazarka, and was silent, not knowing what to do or\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\'Fine! I\'ll go and tell them at the office, and I\'ll tell her father!\r\nThat\'s a fine cornet\'s daughter! One\'s not enough for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you want of me, what are you after?\' uttered Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing; only I\'ll tell them at the office.\'\r\n\r\nNazarka spoke very loud, and evidently did so intentionally, adding:\r\n\'Just see what a clever cadet!\'\r\n\r\nOlenin trembled and grew pale.\r\n\r\n\'Come here, here!\' He seized the Cossack firmly by the arm and drew him\r\ntowards his hut.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing happened, she did not let me in, and I too mean no harm. She\r\nis an honest girl--\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh, discuss--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but all the same I\'ll give you something now. Wait a bit!\'\r\n\r\nNazarka said nothing. Olenin ran into his hut and brought out ten\r\nrubles, which he gave to the Cossack.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing happened, but still I was to blame, so I give this!--Only for\r\nGod\'s sake don\'t let anyone know, for nothing happened...\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you joy,\' said Nazarka laughing, and went away.\r\n\r\nNazarka had come to the village that night at Lukashka\'s bidding to\r\nfind a place to hide a stolen horse, and now, passing by on his way\r\nhome, had heard the sound of footsteps. When he returned next morning\r\nto his company he bragged to his chum, and told him how cleverly he had\r\ngot ten rubles. Next morning Olenin met his hosts and they knew nothing\r\nabout the events of the night. He did not speak to Maryanka, and she\r\nonly laughed a little when she looked at him. Next night he also passed\r\nwithout sleep, vainly wandering about the yard. The day after he\r\npurposely spent shooting, and in the evening he went to see Beletski to\r\nescape from his own thoughts. He was afraid of himself, and promised\r\nhimself not to go to his hosts\' hut any more.\r\n\r\nThat night he was roused by the sergeant-major. His company was ordered\r\nto start at once on a raid. Olenin was glad this had happened, and\r\nthought he would not again return to the village.\r\n\r\nThe raid lasted four days. The commander, who was a relative of\r\nOlenin\'s, wished to see him and offered to let him remain with the\r\nstaff, but this Olenin declined. He found that he could not live away\r\nfrom the village, and asked to be allowed to return to it. For having\r\ntaken part in the raid he received a soldier\'s cross, which he had\r\nformerly greatly desired. Now he was quite indifferent about it, and\r\neven more indifferent about his promotion, the order for which had\r\nstill not arrived. Accompanied by Vanyusha he rode back to the cordon\r\nwithout any accident several hours in advance of the rest of the\r\ncompany. He spent the whole evening in his porch watching Maryanka, and\r\nhe again walked about the yard, without aim or thought, all night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late when he awoke the next day. His hosts were no longer in. He\r\ndid not go shooting, but now took up a book, and now went out into the\r\nporch, and now again re-entered the hut and lay down on the bed.\r\nVanyusha thought he was ill.\r\n\r\nTowards evening Olenin got up, resolutely began writing, and wrote on\r\ntill late at night. He wrote a letter, but did not post it because he\r\nfelt that no one would have understood what he wanted to say, and\r\nbesides it was not necessary that anyone but himself should understand\r\nit. This is what he wrote:\r\n\r\n\'I receive letters of condolence from Russia. They are afraid that I\r\nshall perish, buried in these wilds. They say about me: "He will become\r\ncoarse; he will be behind the times in everything; he will take to\r\ndrink, and who knows but that he may marry a Cossack girl." It was not\r\nfor nothing, they say, that Ermolov declared: "Anyone serving in the\r\nCaucasus for ten years either becomes a confirmed drunkard or marries a\r\nloose woman." How terrible! Indeed it won\'t do for me to ruin myself\r\nwhen I might have the great happiness of even becoming the Countess\r\nB----\'s husband, or a Court chamberlain, or a Marechal de noblesse of\r\nmy district. Oh, how repulsive and pitiable you all seem to me! You do\r\nnot know what happiness is and what life is! One must taste life once\r\nin all its natural beauty, must see and understand what I see every day\r\nbefore me--those eternally unapproachable snowy peaks, and a majestic\r\nwoman in that primitive beauty in which the first woman must have come\r\nfrom her creator\'s hands--and then it becomes clear who is ruining\r\nhimself and who is living truly or falsely--you or I. If you only knew\r\nhow despicable and pitiable you, in your delusions, seem to me! When I\r\npicture to myself--in place of my hut, my forests, and my love--those\r\ndrawing-rooms, those women with their pomatum-greased hair eked out\r\nwith false curls, those unnaturally grimacing lips, those hidden,\r\nfeeble, distorted limbs, and that chatter of obligatory drawing-room\r\nconversation which has no right to the name--I feel unendurably\r\nrevolted. I then see before me those obtuse faces, those rich eligible\r\ngirls whose looks seem to say:\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, you may come near though I am rich and eligible"--and\r\nthat arranging and rearranging of seats, that shameless match-making\r\nand that eternal tittle-tattle and pretence; those rules--with whom to\r\nshake hands, to whom only to nod, with whom to converse (and all this\r\ndone deliberately with a conviction of its inevitability), that\r\ncontinual ennui in the blood passing on from generation to generation.\r\nTry to understand or believe just this one thing: you need only see and\r\ncomprehend what truth and beauty are, and all that you now say and\r\nthink and all your wishes for me and for yourselves will fly to atoms!\r\nHappiness is being with nature, seeing her, and conversing with her.\r\n"He may even (God forbid) marry a common Cossack girl, and be quite\r\nlost socially" I can imagine them saying of me with sincere pity! Yet\r\nthe one thing I desire is to be quite "lost" in your sense of the word.\r\nI wish to marry a Cossack girl, and dare not because it would be a\r\nheight of happiness of which I am unworthy.\r\n\r\n\'Three months have passed since I first saw the Cossack girl, Maryanka.\r\nThe views and prejudices of the world I had left were still fresh in\r\nme. I did not then believe that I could love that woman. I delighted in\r\nher beauty just as I delighted in the beauty of the mountains and the\r\nsky, nor could I help delighting in her, for she is as beautiful as\r\nthey. I found that the sight of her beauty had become a necessity of my\r\nlife and I began asking myself whether I did not love her. But I could\r\nfind nothing within myself at all like love as I had imagined it to be.\r\nMine was not the restlessness of loneliness and desire for marriage,\r\nnor was it platonic, still less a carnal love such as I have\r\nexperienced. I needed only to see her, to hear her, to know that she\r\nwas near--and if I was not happy, I was at peace.\r\n\r\n\'After an evening gathering at which I met her and touched her, I felt\r\nthat between that woman and myself there existed an indissoluble though\r\nunacknowledged bond against which I could not struggle, yet I did\r\nstruggle. I asked myself: "Is it possible to love a woman who will\r\nnever understand the profoundest interests of my life? Is it possible\r\nto love a woman simply for her beauty, to love the statue of a woman?"\r\nBut I was already in love with her, though I did not yet trust to my\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\'After that evening when I first spoke to her our relations changed.\r\nBefore that she had been to me an extraneous but majestic object of\r\nexternal nature: but since then she has become a human being. I began\r\nto meet her, to talk to her, and sometimes to go to work for her father\r\nand to spend whole evenings with them, and in this intimate intercourse\r\nshe remained still in my eyes just as pure, inaccessible, and majestic.\r\nShe always responded with equal calm, pride, and cheerful equanimity.\r\nSometimes she was friendly, but generally her every look, every word,\r\nand every movement expressed equanimity--not contemptuous, but crushing\r\nand bewitching. Every day with a feigned smile on my lips I tried to\r\nplay a part, and with torments of passion and desire in my heart I\r\nspoke banteringly to her. She saw that I was dissembling, but looked\r\nstraight at me cheerfully and simply. This position became unbearable.\r\nI wished not to deceive her but to tell her all I thought and felt. I\r\nwas extremely agitated. We were in the vineyard when I began to tell\r\nher of my love, in words I am now ashamed to remember. I am ashamed\r\nbecause I ought not to have dared to speak so to her because she stood\r\nfar above such words and above the feeling they were meant to express.\r\nI said no more, but from that day my position has been intolerable. I\r\ndid not wish to demean myself by continuing our former flippant\r\nrelations, and at the same time I felt that I had not yet reached the\r\nlevel of straight and simple relations with her. I asked myself\r\ndespairingly, "What am I to do?" In foolish dreams I imagined her now\r\nas my mistress and now as my wife, but rejected both ideas with\r\ndisgust. To make her a wanton woman would be dreadful. It would be\r\nmurder. To turn her into a fine lady, the wife of Dmitri Andreich\r\nOlenin, like a Cossack woman here who is married to one of our\r\nofficers, would be still worse. Now could I turn Cossack like Lukashka,\r\nand steal horses, get drunk on chikhir, sing rollicking songs, kill\r\npeople, and when drunk climb in at her window for the night without a\r\nthought of who and what I am, it would be different: then we might\r\nunderstand one another and I might be happy.\r\n\r\n\'I tried to throw myself into that kind of life but was still more\r\nconscious of my own weakness and artificiality. I cannot forget myself\r\nand my complex, distorted past, and my future appears to me still more\r\nhopeless. Every day I have before me the distant snowy mountains and\r\nthis majestic, happy woman. But not for me is the only happiness\r\npossible in the world; I cannot have this woman! What is most terrible\r\nand yet sweetest in my condition is that I feel that I understand her\r\nbut that she will never understand me; not because she is inferior: on\r\nthe contrary she ought not to understand me. She is happy, she is like\r\nnature: consistent, calm, and self-contained; and I, a weak distorted\r\nbeing, want her to understand my deformity and my torments! I have not\r\nslept at night, but have aimlessly passed under her windows not\r\nrendering account to myself of what was happening to me. On the 18th\r\nour company started on a raid, and I spent three days away from the\r\nvillage. I was sad and apathetic, the usual songs, cards,\r\ndrinking-bouts, and talk of rewards in the regiment, were more\r\nrepulsive to me than usual. Yesterday I returned home and saw her, my\r\nhut. Daddy Eroshka, and the snowy mountains, from my porch, and was\r\nseized by such a strong, new feeling of joy that I understood it all. I\r\nlove this woman; I feel real love for the first and only time in my\r\nlife. I know what has befallen me. I do not fear to be degraded by this\r\nfeeling, I am not ashamed of my love, I am proud of it. It is not my\r\nfault that I love. It has come about against my will. I tried to escape\r\nfrom my love by self-renunciation, and tried to devise a joy in the\r\nCossack Lukashka\'s and Maryanka\'s love, but thereby only stirred up my\r\nown love and jealousy. This is not the ideal, the so-called exalted\r\nlove which I have known before; not that sort of attachment in which\r\nyou admire your own love and feel that the source of your emotion is\r\nwithin yourself and do everything yourself. I have felt that too. It is\r\nstill less a desire for enjoyment: it is something different. Perhaps\r\nin her I love nature: the personification of all that is beautiful in\r\nnature; but yet I am not acting by my own will, but some elemental\r\nforce loves through me; the whole of God\'s world, all nature, presses\r\nthis love into my soul and says, "Love her." I love her not with my\r\nmind or my imagination, but with my whole being. Loving her I feel\r\nmyself to be an integral part of all God\'s joyous world. I wrote before\r\nabout the new convictions to which my solitary life had brought me, but\r\nno one knows with what labour they shaped themselves within me and with\r\nwhat joy I realized them and saw a new way of life opening out before\r\nme; nothing was dearer to me than those convictions... Well! ... love\r\nhas come and neither they nor any regrets for them remain! It is even\r\ndifficult for me to believe that I could prize such a one-sided, cold,\r\nand abstract state of mind. Beauty came and scattered to the winds all\r\nthat laborious inward toil, and no regret remains for what has\r\nvanished! Self-renunciation is all nonsense and absurdity! That is\r\npride, a refuge from well-merited unhappiness, and salvation from the\r\nenvy of others\' happiness: "Live for others, and do good!"--Why? when\r\nin my soul there is only love for myself and the desire to love her and\r\nto live her life with her? Not for others, not for Lukashka, I now\r\ndesire happiness. I do not now love those others. Formerly I should\r\nhave told myself that this is wrong. I should have tormented myself\r\nwith the questions: What will become of her, of me, and of Lukashka?\r\nNow I don\'t care. I do not live my own life, there is something\r\nstronger than me which directs me. I suffer; but formerly I was dead\r\nand only now do I live. Today I will go to their house and tell her\r\neverything.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nLate that evening, after writing this letter, Olenin went to his hosts\'\r\nhut. The old woman was sitting on a bench behind the oven unwinding\r\ncocoons. Maryanka with her head uncovered sat sewing by the light of a\r\ncandle. On seeing Olenin she jumped up, took her kerchief and stepped\r\nto the oven. \'Maryanka dear,\' said her mother, \'won\'t you sit here with\r\nme a bit?\' \'No, I\'m bareheaded,\' she replied, and sprang up on the\r\noven. Olenin could only see a knee, and one of her shapely legs hanging\r\ndown from the oven. He treated the old woman to tea. She treated her\r\nguest to clotted cream which she sent Maryanka to fetch. But having put\r\na plateful on the table Maryanka again sprang on the oven from whence\r\nOlenin felt her eyes upon him. They talked about household matters.\r\nGranny Ulitka became animated and went into raptures of hospitality.\r\nShe brought Olenin preserved grapes and a grape tart and some of her\r\nbest wine, and pressed him to eat and drink with the rough yet proud\r\nhospitality of country folk, only found among those who produce their\r\nbread by the labour of their own hands. The old woman, who had at first\r\nstruck Olenin so much by her rudeness, now often touched him by her\r\nsimple tenderness towards her daughter.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, we need not offend the Lord by grumbling! We have enough of\r\neverything, thank God. We have pressed sufficient CHIKHIR and have\r\npreserved and shall sell three or four barrels of grapes and have\r\nenough left to drink. Don\'t be in a hurry to leave us. We will make\r\nmerry together at the wedding.\'\r\n\r\n\'And when is the wedding to be?\' asked Olenin, feeling his blood\r\nsuddenly rush to his face while his heart beat irregularly and\r\npainfully.\r\n\r\nHe heard a movement on the oven and the sound of seeds being cracked.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you know, it ought to be next week. We are quite ready,\' replied\r\nthe old woman, as simply and quietly as though Olenin did not exist. \'I\r\nhave prepared and have procured everything for Maryanka. We will give\r\nher away properly. Only there\'s one thing not quite right. Our Lukashka\r\nhas been running rather wild. He has been too much on the spree! He\'s\r\nup to tricks! The other day a Cossack came here from his company and\r\nsaid he had been to Nogay.\'\r\n\r\n\'He must mind he does not get caught,\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s what I tell him. "Mind, Lukashka, don\'t you get into\r\nmischief. Well, of course, a young fellow naturally wants to cut a\r\ndash. But there\'s a time for everything. Well, you\'ve captured or\r\nstolen something and killed an abrek! Well, you\'re a fine fellow! But\r\nnow you should live quietly for a bit, or else there\'ll be trouble."\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I saw him a time or two in the division, he was always\r\nmerry-making. He has sold another horse,\' said Olenin, and glanced\r\ntowards the oven. A pair of large, dark, and hostile eyes glittered as\r\nthey gazed severely at him.\r\n\r\nHe became ashamed of what he had said. \'What of it? He does no one any\r\nharm,\' suddenly remarked Maryanka. \'He makes merry with his own money,\'\r\nand lowering her legs she jumped down from the oven and went out\r\nbanging the door.\r\n\r\nOlenin followed her with his eyes as long as she was in the hut, and\r\nthen looked at the door and waited, understanding nothing of what\r\nGranny Ulitka was telling him.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later some visitors arrived: an old man, Granny Ulitka\'s\r\nbrother, with Daddy Eroshka, and following them came Maryanka and\r\nUstenka.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening,\' squeaked Ustenka. \'Still on holiday?\' she added,\r\nturning to Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, still on holiday,\' he replied, and felt, he did not know why,\r\nashamed and ill at ease.\r\n\r\nHe wished to go away but could not. It also seemed to him impossible to\r\nremain silent. The old man helped him by asking for a drink, and they\r\nhad a drink. Olenin drank with Eroshka, with the other Cossack, and\r\nagain with Eroshka, and the more he drank the heavier was his heart.\r\nBut the two old men grew merry. The girls climbed onto the oven, where\r\nthey sat whispering and looking at the men, who drank till it was late.\r\nOlenin did not talk, but drank more than the others. The Cossacks were\r\nshouting. The old woman would not let them have any more chikhir, and\r\nat last turned them out. The girls laughed at Daddy Eroshka, and it was\r\npast ten when they all went out into the porch. The old men invited\r\nthemselves to finish their merry-making at Olenin\'s. Ustenka ran off\r\nhome and Eroshka led the old Cossack to Vanyusha. The old woman went\r\nout to tidy up the shed. Maryanka remained alone in the hut. Olenin\r\nfelt fresh and joyous, as if he had only just woke up. He noticed\r\neverything, and having let the old men pass ahead he turned back to the\r\nhut where Maryanka was preparing for bed. He went up to her and wished\r\nto say something, but his voice broke. She moved away from him, sat\r\ndown cross-legged on her bed in the corner, and looked at him silently\r\nwith wild and frightened eyes. She was evidently afraid of him. Olenin\r\nfelt this. He felt sorry and ashamed of himself, and at the same time\r\nproud and pleased that he aroused even that feeling in her.\r\n\r\n\'Maryanka!\' he said. \'Will you never take pity on me? I can\'t tell you\r\nhow I love you.\'\r\n\r\nShe moved still farther away.\r\n\r\n\'Just hear how the wine is speaking! ... You\'ll get nothing from me!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, it is not the wine. Don\'t marry Lukashka. I will marry you.\'\r\n(\'What am I saying,\' he thought as he uttered these words. \'Shall I be\r\nable to say the same to-morrow?\' \'Yes, I shall, I am sure I shall, and\r\nI will repeat them now,\' replied an inner voice.)\r\n\r\n\'Will you marry me?\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him seriously and her fear seemed to have passed.\r\n\r\n\'Maryanka, I shall go out of my mind! I am not myself. I will do\r\nwhatever you command,\' and madly tender words came from his lips of\r\ntheir own accord.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, what are you drivelling about?\' she interrupted, suddenly\r\nseizing the arm he was stretching towards her. She did not push his arm\r\naway but pressed it firmly with her strong hard fingers. \'Do gentlemen\r\nmarry Cossack girls? Go away!\'\r\n\r\n\'But will you? Everything...\'\r\n\r\n\'And what shall we do with Lukashka?\' said she, laughing.\r\n\r\nHe snatched away the arm she was holding and firmly embraced her young\r\nbody, but she sprang away like a fawn and ran barefoot into the porch:\r\nOlenin came to his senses and was terrified at himself. He again felt\r\nhimself inexpressibly vile compared to her, yet not repenting for an\r\ninstant of what he had said he went home, and without even glancing at\r\nthe old men who were drinking in his room he lay down and fell asleep\r\nmore soundly than he had done for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was a holiday. In the evening all the villagers, their\r\nholiday clothes shining in the sunset, were out in the street. That\r\nseason more wine than usual had been produced, and the people were now\r\nfree from their labours. In a month the Cossacks were to start on a\r\ncampaign and in many families preparations were being made for weddings.\r\n\r\nMost of the people were standing in the square in front of the Cossack\r\nGovernment Office and near the two shops, in one of which cakes and\r\npumpkin seeds were sold, in the other kerchiefs and cotton prints. On\r\nthe earth-embankment of the office-building sat or stood the old men in\r\nsober grey, or black coats without gold trimmings or any kind of\r\nornament. They conversed among themselves quietly in measured tones,\r\nabout the harvest, about the young folk, about village affairs, and\r\nabout old times, looking with dignified equanimity at the younger\r\ngeneration. Passing by them, the women and girls stopped and bent their\r\nheads. The young Cossacks respectfully slackened their pace and raised\r\ntheir caps, holding them for a while over their heads. The old men then\r\nstopped speaking. Some of them watched the passers-by severely, others\r\nkindly, and in their turn slowly took off their caps and put them on\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack girls had not yet started dancing their khorovods, but\r\nhaving gathered in groups, in their bright coloured beshmets with white\r\nkerchiefs on their heads pulled down to their eyes, they sat either on\r\nthe ground or on the earth-banks about the huts sheltered from the\r\noblique rays of the sun, and laughed and chattered in their ringing\r\nvoices. Little boys and girls playing in the square sent their balls\r\nhigh up into the clear sky, and ran about squealing and shouting. The\r\nhalf-grown girls had started dancing their khorovods, and were timidly\r\nsinging in their thin shrill voices. Clerks, lads not in the service,\r\nor home for the holiday, bright-faced and wearing smart white or new\r\nred Circassian gold-trimmed coats, went about arm in arm in twos or\r\nthrees from one group of women or girls to another, and stopped to joke\r\nand chat with the Cossack girls. The Armenian shopkeeper, in a\r\ngold-trimmed coat of fine blue cloth, stood at the open door through\r\nwhich piles of folded bright-coloured kerchiefs were visible and,\r\nconscious of his own importance and with the pride of an Oriental\r\ntradesman, waited for customers. Two red-bearded, barefooted Chechens,\r\nwho had come from beyond the Terek to see the fete, sat on their heels\r\noutside the house of a friend, negligently smoking their little pipes\r\nand occasionally spitting, watching the villagers and exchanging\r\nremarks with one another in their rapid guttural speech. Occasionally a\r\nworkaday-looking soldier in an old overcoat passed across the square\r\namong the bright-clad girls. Here and there the songs of tipsy Cossacks\r\nwho were merry-making could already be heard. All the huts were closed;\r\nthe porches had been scrubbed clean the day before. Even the old women\r\nwere out in the street, which was everywhere sprinkled with pumpkin and\r\nmelon seed-shells. The air was warm and still, the sky deep and clear.\r\nBeyond the roofs the dead-white mountain range, which seemed very near,\r\nwas turning rosy in the glow of the evening sun. Now and then from the\r\nother side of the river came the distant roar of a cannon, but above\r\nthe village, mingling with one another, floated all sorts of merry\r\nholiday sounds.\r\n\r\nOlenin had been pacing the yard all that morning hoping to see\r\nMaryanka. But she, having put on holiday clothes, went to Mass at the\r\nchapel and afterwards sat with the other girls on an earth-embankment\r\ncracking seeds; sometimes again, together with her companions, she ran\r\nhome, and each time gave the lodger a bright and kindly look. Olenin\r\nfelt afraid to address her playfully or in the presence of others. He\r\nwished to finish telling her what he had begun to say the night before,\r\nand to get her to give him a definite answer. He waited for another\r\nmoment like that of yesterday evening, but the moment did not come, and\r\nhe felt that he could not remain any longer in this uncertainty. She\r\nwent out into the street again, and after waiting awhile he too went\r\nout and without knowing where he was going he followed her. He passed\r\nby the corner where she was sitting in her shining blue satin beshmet,\r\nand with an aching heart he heard behind him the girls laughing.\r\n\r\nBeletski\'s hut looked out onto the square. As Olenin was passing it he\r\nheard Beletski\'s voice calling to him, \'Come in,\' and in he went.\r\n\r\nAfter a short talk they both sat down by the window and were soon\r\njoined by Eroshka, who entered dressed in a new beshmet and sat down on\r\nthe floor beside them.\r\n\r\n\'There, that\'s the aristocratic party,\' said Beletski, pointing with\r\nhis cigarette to a brightly coloured group at the corner. \'Mine is\r\nthere too. Do you see her? in red. That\'s a new beshmet. Why don\'t you\r\nstart the khorovod?\' he shouted, leaning out of the window. \'Wait a\r\nbit, and then when it grows dark let us go too. Then we will invite\r\nthem to Ustenka\'s. We must arrange a ball for them!\'\r\n\r\n\'And I will come to Ustenka\'s,\' said Olenin in a decided tone. \'Will\r\nMaryanka be there?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, she\'ll be there. Do come!\' said Beletski, without the least\r\nsurprise. \'But isn\'t it a pretty picture?\' he added, pointing to the\r\nmotley crowds.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, very!\' Olenin assented, trying to appear indifferent.\r\n\r\n\'Holidays of this kind,\' he added, \'always make me wonder why all these\r\npeople should suddenly be contented and jolly. To-day for instance,\r\njust because it happens to be the fifteenth of the month, everything is\r\nfestive. Eyes and faces and voices and movements and garments, and the\r\nair and the sun, are all in a holiday mood. And we no longer have any\r\nholidays!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Beletski, who did not like such reflections.\r\n\r\n\'And why are you not drinking, old fellow?\' he said, turning to Eroshka.\r\n\r\nEroshka winked at Olenin, pointing to Beletski. \'Eh, he\'s a proud one\r\nthat kunak of yours,\' he said.\r\n\r\nBeletski raised his glass. ALLAH BIRDY\' he said, emptying it. (ALLAH\r\nBIRDY, \'God has given!\'--the usual greeting of Caucasians when drinking\r\ntogether.)\r\n\r\n\'Sau bul\' (\'Your health\'), answered Eroshka smiling, and emptied his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\'Speaking of holidays!\' he said, turning to Olenin as he rose and\r\nlooked out of the window, \'What sort of holiday is that! You should\r\nhave seen them make merry in the old days! The women used to come out\r\nin their gold--trimmed sarafans. Two rows of gold coins hanging round\r\ntheir necks and gold-cloth diadems on their heads, and when they passed\r\nthey made a noise, "flu, flu," with their dresses. Every woman looked\r\nlike a princess. Sometimes they\'d come out, a whole herd of them, and\r\nbegin singing songs so that the air seemed to rumble, and they went on\r\nmaking merry all night. And the Cossacks would roll out a barrel into\r\nthe yards and sit down and drink till break of day, or they would go\r\nhand-in-hand sweeping the village. Whoever they met they seized and\r\ntook along with them, and went from house to house. Sometimes they used\r\nto make merry for three days on end. Father used to come home--I still\r\nremember it--quite red and swollen, without a cap, having lost\r\neverything: he\'d come and lie down. Mother knew what to do: she would\r\nbring him some fresh caviar and a little chikhir to sober him up, and\r\nwould herself run about in the village looking for his cap. Then he\'d\r\nsleep for two days! That\'s the sort of fellows they were then! But now\r\nwhat are they?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, and the girls in the sarafans, did they make merry all by\r\nthemselves?\' asked Beletski.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, they did! Sometimes Cossacks would come on foot or on horse and\r\nsay, "Let\'s break up the khorovods," and they\'d go, but the girls would\r\ntake up cudgels. Carnival week, some young fellow would come galloping\r\nup, and they\'d cudgel his horse and cudgel him too. But he\'d break\r\nthrough, seize the one he loved, and carry her off. And his sweetheart\r\nwould love him to his heart\'s content! Yes, the girls in those days,\r\nthey were regular queens!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nJust then two men rode out of the side street into the square. One of\r\nthem was Nazarka. The other, Lukashka, sat slightly sideways on his\r\nwell-fed bay Kabarda horse which stepped lightly over the hard road\r\njerking its beautiful head with its fine glossy mane. The well-adjusted\r\ngun in its cover, the pistol at his back, and the cloak rolled up\r\nbehind his saddle showed that Lukashka had not come from a peaceful\r\nplace or from one near by. The smart way in which he sat a little\r\nsideways on his horse, the careless motion with which he touched the\r\nhorse under its belly with his whip, and especially his half-closed\r\nblack eyes, glistening as he looked proudly around him, all expressed\r\nthe conscious strength and self-confidence of youth. \'Ever seen as fine\r\na lad?\' his eyes, looking from side to side, seemed to say. The elegant\r\nhorse with its silver ornaments and trappings, the weapons, and the\r\nhandsome Cossack himself attracted the attention of everyone in the\r\nsquare. Nazarka, lean and short, was much less well dressed. As he rode\r\npast the old men, Lukashka paused and raised his curly white sheepskin\r\ncap above his closely cropped black head.\r\n\r\n\'Well, have you carried off many Nogay horses?\' asked a lean old man\r\nwith a frowning, lowering look.\r\n\r\n\'Have you counted them, Grandad, that you ask?\' replied Lukashka,\r\nturning away.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all very well, but you need not take my lad along with you,\'\r\nthe old man muttered with a still darker frown.\r\n\r\n\'Just see the old devil, he knows everything,\' muttered Lukashka to\r\nhimself, and a worried expression came over his face; but then,\r\nnoticing a corner where a number of Cossack girls were standing, he\r\nturned his horse towards them.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, girls!\' he shouted in his powerful, resonant voice,\r\nsuddenly checking his horse. \'You\'ve grown old without me, you\r\nwitches!\' and he laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, Lukashka! Good evening, laddie!\' the merry voices\r\nanswered. \'Have you brought much money? Buy some sweets for the girls!\r\n... Have you come for long? True enough, it\'s long since we saw you....\'\r\n\r\n\'Nazarka and I have just flown across to make a night of it,\' replied\r\nLukashka, raising his whip and riding straight at the girls.\r\n\r\n\'Why, Maryanka has quite forgotten you,\' said Ustenka, nudging Maryanka\r\nwith her elbow and breaking into a shrill laugh.\r\n\r\nMaryanka moved away from the horse and throwing back her head calmly\r\nlooked at the Cossack with her large sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\'True enough, you have not been home for a long time! Why are you\r\ntrampling us under your horse?\' she remarked dryly, and turned away.\r\n\r\nLukashka had appeared particularly merry. His face shone with audacity\r\nand joy. Obviously staggered by Maryanka\'s cold reply he suddenly\r\nknitted his brow.\r\n\r\n\'Step up on my stirrup and I\'ll carry you away to the mountains.\r\nMammy!\' he suddenly exclaimed, and as if to disperse his dark thoughts\r\nhe caracoled among the girls. Stooping down towards Maryanka, he said,\r\n\'I\'ll kiss, oh, how I\'ll kiss you! ...\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka\'s eyes met his and she suddenly blushed and stepped back.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, bother you! you\'ll crush my feet,\' she said, and bending her head\r\nlooked at her well-shaped feet in their tightly fitting light blue\r\nstockings with clocks and her new red slippers trimmed with narrow\r\nsilver braid.\r\n\r\nLukashka turned towards Ustenka, and Maryanka sat down next to a woman\r\nwith a baby in her arms. The baby stretched his plump little hands\r\ntowards the girl and seized a necklace string that hung down onto her\r\nblue beshmet. Maryanka bent towards the child and glanced at Lukashka\r\nfrom the corner of her eyes. Lukashka just then was getting out from\r\nunder his coat, from the pocket of his black beshmet, a bundle of\r\nsweetmeats and seeds.\r\n\r\n\'There, I give them to all of you,\' he said, handing the bundle to\r\nUstenka and smiling at Maryanka.\r\n\r\nA confused expression again appeared on the girl\'s face. It was as\r\nthough a mist gathered over her beautiful eyes. She drew her kerchief\r\ndown below her lips, and leaning her head over the fair-skinned face of\r\nthe baby that still held her by her coin necklace she suddenly began to\r\nkiss it greedily. The baby pressed his little hands against the girl\'s\r\nhigh breasts, and opening his toothless mouth screamed loudly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re smothering the boy!" said the little one\'s mother, taking him\r\naway; and she unfastened her beshmet to give him the breast. "You\'d\r\nbetter have a chat with the young fellow."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll only go and put up my horse and then Nazarka and I will come\r\nback; we\'ll make merry all night," said Lukashka, touching his horse\r\nwith his whip and riding away from the girls.\r\n\r\nTurning into a side street, he and Nazarka rode up to two huts that\r\nstood side by side.\r\n\r\n"Here we are all right, old fellow! Be quick and come soon!" called\r\nLukashka to his comrade, dismounting in front of one of the huts; then\r\nhe carefully led his horse in at the gate of the wattle fence of his\r\nown home.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you do, Stepka?" he said to his dumb sister, who, smartly\r\ndressed like the others, came in from the street to take his horse; and\r\nhe made signs to her to take the horse to the hay, but not to unsaddle\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe dumb girl made her usual humming noise, smacked her lips as she\r\npointed to the horse and kissed it on the nose, as much as to say that\r\nshe loved it and that it was a fine horse.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you do. Mother? How is it that you have not gone out yet?"\r\nshouted Lukashka, holding his gun in place as he mounted the steps of\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\nHis old mother opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! I never expected, never thought, you\'d come," said the old\r\nwoman. "Why, Kirka said you wouldn\'t be here."\r\n\r\n"Go and bring some chikhir, Mother. Nazarka is coming here and we will\r\ncelebrate the feast day."\r\n\r\n"Directly, Lukashka, directly!" answered the old woman. "Our women are\r\nmaking merry. I expect our dumb one has gone too."\r\n\r\nShe took her keys and hurriedly went to the outhouse. Nazarka, after\r\nputting up his horse and taking the gun off his shoulder, returned to\r\nLukashka\'s house and went in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Your health!\' said Lukashka, taking from his mother\'s hands a cup\r\nfilled to the brim with chikhir and carefully raising it to his bowed\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\'A bad business!\' said Nazarka. \'You heard how Daddy Burlak said, "Have\r\nyou stolen many horses?" He seems to know!\'\r\n\r\n\'A regular wizard!\' Lukashka replied shortly. \'But what of it!\' he\r\nadded, tossing his head. \'They are across the river by now. Go and find\r\nthem!\'\r\n\r\n\'Still it\'s a bad lookout.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s a bad lookout? Go and take some chikhir to him to-morrow and\r\nnothing will come of it. Now let\'s make merry. Drink!\' shouted\r\nLukashka, just in the tone in which old Eroshka uttered the word.\r\n\'We\'ll go out into the street and make merry with the girls. You go and\r\nget some honey; or no, I\'ll send our dumb wench. We\'ll make merry till\r\nmorning.\'\r\n\r\nNazarka smiled.\r\n\r\n\'Are we stopping here long?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nTill we\'ve had a bit of fun. Run and get some vodka. Here\'s the money.\'\r\n\r\nNazarka ran off obediently to get the vodka from Yamka\'s.\r\n\r\nDaddy Eroshka and Ergushov, like birds of prey, scenting where the\r\nmerry-making was going on, tumbled into the hut one after the other,\r\nboth tipsy.\r\n\r\n\'Bring us another half-pail,\' shouted Lukashka to his mother, by way of\r\nreply to their greeting.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, tell us where did you steal them, you devil?\' shouted\r\nEroshka. \'Fine fellow, I\'m fond of you!\'\r\n\r\n\'Fond indeed...\' answered Lukashka laughing, \'carrying sweets from\r\ncadets to lasses! Eh, you old...\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not true, not true! ... Oh, Mark,\' and the old man burst out\r\nlaughing. \'And how that devil begged me. "Go," he said, "and arrange\r\nit." He offered me a gun! But no. I\'d have managed it, but I feel for\r\nyou. Now tell us where have you been?\' And the old man began speaking\r\nin Tartar.\r\n\r\nLukashka answered him promptly.\r\n\r\nErgushov, who did not know much Tartar, only occasionally put in a word\r\nin Russian: \'What I say is he\'s driven away the horses. I know it for a\r\nfact,\' he chimed in.\r\n\r\n\'Girey and I went together.\' (His speaking of Girey Khan as \'Girey\'\r\nwas, to the Cossack mind, evidence of his boldness.) \'Just beyond the\r\nriver he kept bragging that he knew the whole of the steppe and would\r\nlead the way straight, but we rode on and the night was dark, and my\r\nGirey lost his way and began wandering in a circle without getting\r\nanywhere: couldn\'t find the village, and there we were. We must have\r\ngone too much to the right. I believe we wandered about well--nigh till\r\nmidnight. Then, thank goodness, we heard dogs howling.\'\r\n\r\n\'Fools!\' said Daddy Eroshka. \'There now, we too used to lose our way in\r\nthe steppe. (Who the devil can follow it?) But I used to ride up a\r\nhillock and start howling like the wolves, like this!\' He placed his\r\nhands before his mouth, and howled like a pack of wolves, all on one\r\nnote. \'The dogs would answer at once ... Well, go on--so you found\r\nthem?\'\r\n\r\n\'We soon led them away! Nazarka was nearly caught by some Nogay women,\r\nhe was!\'\r\n\r\n\'Caught indeed,\' Nazarka, who had just come back, said in an injured\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\'We rode off again, and again Girey lost his way and almost landed us\r\namong the sand-drifts. We thought we were just getting to the Terek but\r\nwe were riding away from it all the time!\'\r\n\r\n\'You should have steered by the stars,\' said Daddy Eroshka.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s what I say,\' interjected Ergushov,\r\n\r\n\'Yes, steer when all is black; I tried and tried all about... and at\r\nlast I put the bridle on one of the mares and let my own horse go\r\nfree--thinking he\'ll lead us out, and what do you think! he just gave a\r\nsnort or two with his nose to the ground, galloped ahead, and led us\r\nstraight to our village. Thank goodness! It was getting quite light. We\r\nbarely had time to hide them in the forest. Nagim came across the river\r\nand took them away.\'\r\n\r\nErgushov shook his head. \'It\'s just what I said. Smart. Did you get\r\nmuch for them?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all here,\' said Lukashka, slapping his pocket.\r\n\r\nJust then his mother came into the room, and Lukashka did not finish\r\nwhat he was saying.\r\n\r\n\'Drink!\' he shouted.\r\n\r\n\'We too, Girich and I, rode out late one night...\' began Eroshka.\r\n\r\n\'Oh bother, we\'ll never hear the end of you!\' said Lukashka. \'I am\r\ngoing.\' And having emptied his cup and tightened the strap of his belt\r\nhe went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was already dark when Lukashka went out into the street. The autumn\r\nnight was fresh and calm. The full golden moon floated up behind the\r\ntall dark poplars that grew on one side of the square. From the\r\nchimneys of the outhouses smoke rose and spread above the village,\r\nmingling with the mist. Here and there lights shone through the\r\nwindows, and the air was laden with the smell of kisyak, grape-pulp,\r\nand mist. The sounds of voices, laughter, songs, and the cracking of\r\nseeds mingled just as they had done in the daytime, but were now more\r\ndistinct. Clusters of white kerchiefs and caps gleamed through the\r\ndarkness near the houses and by the fences.\r\n\r\nIn the square, before the shop door which was lit up and open, the\r\nblack and white figures of Cossack men and maids showed through the\r\ndarkness, and one heard from afar their loud songs and laughter and\r\ntalk. The girls, hand in hand, went round and round in a circle\r\nstepping lightly in the dusty square. A skinny girl, the plainest of\r\nthem all, set the tune:\r\n\r\n   \'From beyond the wood, from the forest dark,\r\n    From the garden green and the shady park,\r\n    There came out one day two young lads so gay.\r\n    Young bachelors, hey! brave and smart were they!\r\n    And they walked and walked, then stood still, each man,\r\n    And they talked and soon to dispute began!\r\n    Then a maid came out; as she came along,\r\n    Said, "To one of you I shall soon belong!"\r\n    \'Twas the fair-faced lad got the maiden fair,\r\n    Yes, the fair-faced lad with the golden hair!\r\n    Her right hand so white in his own took he,\r\n    And he led her round for his mates to see!\r\n    And said, "Have you ever in all your life,\r\n    Met a lass as fair as my sweet little wife?"\'\r\n\r\nThe old women stood round listening to the songs. The little boys and\r\ngirls ran about chasing one another in the dark. The men stood by,\r\ncatching at the girls as the latter moved round, and sometimes breaking\r\nthe ring and entering it. On the dark side of the doorway stood\r\nBeletski and Olenin, in their Circassian coats and sheepskin caps, and\r\ntalked together in a style of speech unlike that of the Cossacks, in\r\nlow but distinct tones, conscious that they were attracting attention.\r\nNext to one another in the khorovod circle moved plump little Ustenka\r\nin her red beshmet and the stately Maryanka in her new smock and\r\nbeshmet. Olenin and Beletski were discussing how to snatch Ustenka and\r\nMaryanka out of the ring. Beletski thought that Olenin wished only to\r\namuse himself, but Olenin was expecting his fate to be decided. He\r\nwanted at any cost to see Maryanka alone that very day and to tell her\r\neverything, and ask her whether she could and would be his wife.\r\nAlthough that question had long been answered in the negative in his\r\nown mind, he hoped he would be able to tell her all he felt, and that\r\nshe would understand him.\r\n\r\n\'Why did you not tell me sooner?\' said Beletski. \'I would have got\r\nUstenka to arrange it for you. You are such a queer fellow! ...\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s to be done! ... Some day, very soon, I\'ll tell you all about\r\nit. Only now, for Heaven\'s sake, arrange so that she should come to\r\nUstenka\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, that\'s easily done! Well, Maryanka, will you belong to the\r\n"fair-faced lad", and not to Lukashka?\' said Beletski, speaking to\r\nMaryanka first for propriety\'s sake, but having received no reply he\r\nwent up to Ustenka and begged her to bring Maryanka home with her. He\r\nhad hardly time to finish what he was saying before the leader began\r\nanother song and the girls started pulling each other round in the ring\r\nby the hand.\r\n\r\nThey sang:\r\n\r\n   "Past the garden, by the garden,\r\n    A young man came strolling down,\r\n    Up the street and through the town.\r\n    And the first time as he passed\r\n    He did wave his strong right hand.\r\n    As the second time he passed\r\n    Waved his hat with silken band.\r\n    But the third time as he went\r\n    He stood still: before her bent.\r\n\r\n   "How is it that thou, my dear,\r\n    My reproaches dost not fear?\r\n    In the park don\'t come to walk\r\n    That we there might have a talk?\r\n    Come now, answer me, my dear,\r\n    Dost thou hold me in contempt?\r\n    Later on, thou knowest, dear,\r\n    Thou\'lt get sober and repent.\r\n    Soon to woo thee I will come,\r\n    And when we shall married be\r\n    Thou wilt weep because of me!"\r\n\r\n   "Though I knew what to reply,\r\n    Yet I dared not him deny,\r\n    No, I dared not him deny!\r\n    So into the park went I,\r\n    In the park my lad to meet,\r\n    There my dear one I did greet."\r\n\r\n   "Maiden dear, I bow to thee!\r\n    Take this handkerchief from me.\r\n    In thy white hand take it, see!\r\n    Say I am beloved by thee.\r\n    I don\'t know at all, I fear,\r\n    What I am to give thee, dear!\r\n    To my dear I think I will\r\n    Of a shawl a present make--\r\n    And five kisses for it take."\'\r\n\r\nLukashka and Nazarka broke into the ring and started walking about\r\namong the girls. Lukashka joined in the singing, taking seconds in his\r\nclear voice as he walked in the middle of the ring swinging his arms.\r\n\'Well, come in, one of you!\' he said. The other girls pushed Maryanka,\r\nbut she would not enter the ring. The sound of shrill laughter, slaps,\r\nkisses, and whispers mingled with the singing.\r\n\r\nAs he went past Olenin, Lukashka gave a friendly nod.\r\n\r\n\'Dmitri Andreich! Have you too come to have a look?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' answered Olenin dryly.\r\n\r\nBeletski stooped and whispered something into Ustenka\'s ear. She had\r\nnot time to reply till she came round again, when she said:\r\n\r\n\'All right, we\'ll come.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Maryanka too?\'\r\n\r\nOlenin stooped towards Maryanka. \'You\'ll come? Please do, if only for a\r\nminute. I must speak to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'If the other girls come, I will.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you answer my question?\' said he, bending towards her. \'You are\r\nin good spirits to-day.\'\r\n\r\nShe had already moved past him. He went after her.\r\n\r\n\'Will you answer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Answer what?\'\r\n\r\n\'The question I asked you the other day,\' said Olenin, stooping to her\r\near. \'Will you marry me?\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you,\' said she, \'I\'ll tell you to-night.\'\r\n\r\nAnd through the darkness her eyes gleamed brightly and kindly at the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nHe still followed her. He enjoyed stooping closer to her. But Lukashka,\r\nwithout ceasing to sing, suddenly seized her firmly by the hand and\r\npulled her from her place in the ring of girls into the middle. Olenin\r\nhad only time to say, "Come to Ustenka\'s," and stepped back to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe song came to an end. Lukashka wiped his lips, Maryanka did the\r\nsame, and they kissed. "No, no, kisses five!" said Lukashka. Chatter,\r\nlaughter, and running about, succeeded to the rhythmic movements and\r\nsound. Lukashka, who seemed to have drunk a great deal, began to\r\ndistribute sweetmeats to the girls.\r\n\r\n"I offer them to everyone!" he said with proud, comically pathetic\r\nself-admiration. "But anyone who goes after soldiers goes out of the\r\nring!" he suddenly added, with an angry glance at Olenin.\r\n\r\nThe girls grabbed his sweetmeats from him, and, laughing, struggled for\r\nthem among themselves. Beletski and Olenin stepped aside.\r\n\r\nLukashka, as if ashamed of his generosity, took off his cap and wiping\r\nhis forehead with his sleeve came up to Maryanka and Ustenka.\r\n\r\n"Answer me, my dear, dost thou hold me in contempt?" he said in the\r\nwords of the song they had just been singing, and turning to Maryanka\r\nhe angrily repeated the words: "Dost thou hold me in contempt? When we\r\nshall married be thou wilt weep because of me!" he added, embracing\r\nUstenka and Maryanka both together.\r\n\r\nUstenka tore herself away, and swinging her arm gave him such a blow on\r\nthe back that she hurt her hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, are you going to have another turn?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"The other girls may if they like," answered Ustenka, "but I am going\r\nhome and Maryanka was coming to our house too."\r\n\r\nWith his arm still round her, Lukashka led Maryanka away from the crowd\r\nto the darker corner of a house.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go, Maryanka," he said, "let\'s have some fun for the last time.\r\nGo home and I will come to you!"\r\n\r\n"What am I to do at home? Holidays are meant for merrymaking. I am\r\ngoing to Ustenka\'s," replied Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll marry you all the same, you know!\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Maryanka, \'we shall see when the time comes.\'\r\n\r\n\'So you are going,\' said Lukashka sternly, and, pressing her close, he\r\nkissed her on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\'There, leave off! Don\'t bother,\' and Maryanka, wrenching herself from\r\nhis arms, moved away.\r\n\r\n\'Ah my girl, it will turn out badly,\' said Lukashka reproachfully and\r\nstood still, shaking his head. \'Thou wilt weep because of me...\' and\r\nturning away from her he shouted to the other girls:\r\n\r\n\'Now then! Play away!\'\r\n\r\nWhat he had said seemed to have frightened and vexed Maryanka. She\r\nstopped, \'What will turn out badly?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, that!\'\r\n\r\n\'That what?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, that you keep company with a soldier-lodger and no longer care\r\nfor me!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll care just as long as I choose. You\'re not my father, nor my\r\nmother. What do you want? I\'ll care for whom I like!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, all right...\' said Lukashka, \'but remember!\' He moved towards\r\nthe shop. \'Girls!\' he shouted, \'why have you stopped? Go on dancing.\r\nNazarka, fetch some more chikhir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, will they come?\' asked Olenin, addressing Beletski.\r\n\r\n\'They\'ll come directly,\' replied Beletski. \'Come along, we must prepare\r\nthe ball.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was already late in the night when Olenin came out of Beletski\'s hut\r\nfollowing Maryanka and Ustenka. He saw in the dark street before him\r\nthe gleam of the girl\'s white kerchief. The golden moon was descending\r\ntowards the steppe. A silvery mist hung over the village. All was\r\nstill; there were no lights anywhere and one heard only the receding\r\nfootsteps of the young women. Olenin\'s heart beat fast. The fresh moist\r\natmosphere cooled his burning face. He glanced at the sky and turned to\r\nlook at the hut he had just come out of: the candle was already out.\r\nThen he again peered through the darkness at the girls\' retreating\r\nshadows. The white kerchief disappeared in the mist. He was afraid to\r\nremain alone, he was so happy. He jumped down from the porch and ran\r\nafter the girls.\r\n\r\n\'Bother you, someone may see...\' said Ustenka.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind!\'\r\n\r\nOlenin ran up to Maryanka and embraced her.\r\n\r\nMaryanka did not resist.\r\n\r\n\'Haven\'t you kissed enough yet?\' said Ustenka. \'Marry and then kiss,\r\nbut now you\'d better wait.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good-night, Maryanka. To-morrow I will come to see your father and\r\ntell him. Don\'t you say anything.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why should I!\' answered Maryanka.\r\n\r\nBoth the girls started running. Olenin went on by himself thinking over\r\nall that had happened. He had spent the whole evening alone with her in\r\na corner by the oven. Ustenka had not left the hut for a single moment,\r\nbut had romped about with the other girls and with Beletski all the\r\ntime. Olenin had talked in whispers to Maryanka.\r\n\r\n\'Will you marry me?\' he had asked.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d deceive me and not have me,\' she replied cheerfully and calmly.\r\n\r\n\'But do you love me? Tell me for God\'s sake!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why shouldn\'t I love you? You don\'t squint,\' answered Maryanka,\r\nlaughing and with her hard hands squeezing his....\r\n\r\n\'What whi-ite, whi-i-ite, soft hands you\'ve got--so like clotted\r\ncream,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I am in earnest. Tell me, will you marry me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not, if father gives me to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then remember, I shall go mad if you deceive me. To-morrow I will\r\ntell your mother and father. I shall come and propose.\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka suddenly burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'It seems so funny!\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s true! I will buy a vineyard and a house and will enroll myself as\r\na Cossack.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mind you don\'t go after other women then. I am severe about that.\'\r\n\r\nOlenin joyfully repeated all these words to himself. The memory of them\r\nnow gave him pain and now such joy that it took away his breath. The\r\npain was because she had remained as calm as usual while talking to\r\nhim. She did not seem at all agitated by these new conditions. It was\r\nas if she did not trust him and did not think of the future. It seemed\r\nto him that she only loved him for the present moment, and that in her\r\nmind there was no future with him. He was happy because her words\r\nsounded to him true, and she had consented to be his. \'Yes,\' thought he\r\nto himself, \'we shall only understand one another when she is quite\r\nmine. For such love there are no words. It needs life--the whole of\r\nlife. To-morrow everything will be cleared up. I cannot live like this\r\nany longer; to-morrow I will tell everything to her father, to\r\nBeletski, and to the whole village.\'\r\n\r\nLukashka, after two sleepless nights, had drunk so much at the fete\r\nthat for the first time in his life his feet would not carry him, and\r\nhe slept in Yamka\'s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Olenin awoke earlier than usual, and immediately\r\nremembered what lay before him, and he joyfully recalled her kisses,\r\nthe pressure of her hard hands, and her words, \'What white hands you\r\nhave!\' He jumped up and wished to go at once to his hosts\' hut to ask\r\nfor their consent to his marriage with Maryanka. The sun had not yet\r\nrisen, but it seemed that there was an unusual bustle in the street and\r\nside-street: people were moving about on foot and on horseback, and\r\ntalking. He threw on his Circassian coat and hastened out into the\r\nporch. His hosts were not yet up. Five Cossacks were riding past and\r\ntalking loudly together. In front rode Lukashka on his broad-backed\r\nKabarda horse.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks were all speaking and shouting so that it was impossible\r\nto make out exactly what they were saying.\r\n\r\n\'Ride to the Upper Post,\' shouted one.\r\n\r\n\'Saddle and catch us up, be quick,\' said another.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s nearer through the other gate!\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you talking about?\' cried Lukashka. \'We must go through the\r\nmiddle gates, of course.\'\r\n\r\n\'So we must, it\'s nearer that way,\' said one of the Cossacks who was\r\ncovered with dust and rode a perspiring horse. Lukashka\'s face was red\r\nand swollen after the drinking of the previous night and his cap was\r\npushed to the back of his head. He was calling out with authority as\r\nthough he were an officer.\r\n\r\n\'What is the matter? Where are you going?\' asked Olenin, with\r\ndifficulty attracting the Cossacks\' attention.\r\n\r\n\'We are off to catch abreks. They\'re hiding among the sand-drifts. We\r\nare just off, but there are not enough of us yet.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Cossacks continued to shout, more and more of them joining as\r\nthey rode down the street. It occurred to Olenin that it would not look\r\nwell for him to stay behind; besides he thought he could soon come\r\nback. He dressed, loaded his gun with bullets, jumped onto his horse\r\nwhich Vanyusha had saddled more or less well, and overtook the Cossacks\r\nat the village gates. The Cossacks had dismounted, and filling a wooden\r\nbowl with chikhir from a little cask which they had brought with them,\r\nthey passed the bowl round to one another and drank to the success of\r\ntheir expedition. Among them was a smartly dressed young cornet, who\r\nhappened to be in the village and who took command of the group of nine\r\nCossacks who had joined for the expedition. All these Cossacks were\r\nprivates, and although the cornet assumed the airs of a commanding\r\nofficer, they only obeyed Lukashka. Of Olenin they took no notice at\r\nall, and when they had all mounted and started, and Olenin rode up to\r\nthe cornet and began asking him what was taking place, the cornet, who\r\nwas usually quite friendly, treated him with marked condescension. It\r\nwas with great difficulty that Olenin managed to find out from him what\r\nwas happening. Scouts who had been sent out to search for abreks had\r\ncome upon several hillsmen some six miles from the village. These\r\nabreks had taken shelter in pits and had fired at the scouts, declaring\r\nthey would not surrender. A corporal who had been scouting with two\r\nCossacks had remained to watch the abreks, and had sent one Cossack\r\nback to get help.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just rising. Three miles beyond the village the steppe\r\nspread out and nothing was visible except the dry, monotonous, sandy,\r\ndismal plain covered with the footmarks of cattle, and here and there\r\nwith tufts of withered grass, with low reeds in the flats, and rare,\r\nlittle-trodden footpaths, and the camps of the nomad Nogay tribe just\r\nvisible far away. The absence of shade and the austere aspect of the\r\nplace were striking. The sun always rises and sets red in the steppe.\r\nWhen it is windy whole hills of sand are carried by the wind from place\r\nto place.\r\n\r\nWhen it is calm, as it was that morning, the silence, uninterrupted by\r\nany movement or sound, is peculiarly striking. That morning in the\r\nsteppe it was quiet and dull, though the sun had already risen. It all\r\nseemed specially soft and desolate. The air was hushed, the footfalls\r\nand the snorting of the horses were the only sounds to be heard, and\r\neven they quickly died away.\r\n\r\nThe men rode almost silently. A Cossack always carries his weapons so\r\nthat they neither jingle nor rattle. Jingling weapons are a terrible\r\ndisgrace to a Cossack. Two other Cossacks from the village caught the\r\nparty up and exchanged a few words. Lukashka\'s horse either stumbled or\r\ncaught its foot in some grass, and became restive--which is a sign of\r\nbad luck among the Cossacks, and at such a time was of special\r\nimportance. The others exchanged glances and turned away, trying not to\r\nnotice what had happened. Lukaskha pulled at the reins, frowned\r\nsternly, set his teeth, and flourished his whip above his head. His\r\ngood Kabarda horse, prancing from one foot to another not knowing with\r\nwhich to start, seemed to wish to fly upwards on wings. But Lukashka\r\nhit its well-fed sides with his whip once, then again, and a third\r\ntime, and the horse, showing its teeth and spreading out its tail,\r\nsnorted and reared and stepped on its hind legs a few paces away from\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, a good steed that!\' said the cornet.\r\n\r\nThat he said steed instead of HORSE indicated special praise.\r\n\r\n\'A lion of a horse,\' assented one of the others, an old Cossack.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks rode forward silently, now at a footpace, then at a trot,\r\nand these changes were the only incidents that interrupted for a moment\r\nthe stillness and solemnity of their movements.\r\n\r\nRiding through the steppe for about six miles, they passed nothing but\r\none Nogay tent, placed on a cart and moving slowly along at a distance\r\nof about a mile from them. A Nogay family was moving from one part of\r\nthe steppe to another. Afterwards they met two tattered Nogay women\r\nwith high cheekbones, who with baskets on their backs were gathering\r\ndung left by the cattle that wandered over the steppe. The cornet, who\r\ndid not know their language well, tried to question them, but they did\r\nnot understand him and, obviously frightened, looked at one another.\r\n\r\nLukashka rode up to them both, stopped his horse, and promptly uttered\r\nthe usual greeting. The Nogay women were evidently relieved, and began\r\nspeaking to him quite freely as to a brother.\r\n\r\n\'Ay--ay, kop abrek!\' they said plaintively, pointing in the direction\r\nin which the Cossacks were going. Olenin understood that they were\r\nsaying, \'Many abreks.\'\r\n\r\nNever having seen an engagement of that kind, and having formed an idea\r\nof them only from Daddy Eroshka\'s tales, Olenin wished not to be left\r\nbehind by the Cossacks, but wanted to see it all. He admired the\r\nCossacks, and was on the watch, looking and listening and making his\r\nown observations. Though he had brought his sword and a loaded gun with\r\nhim, when he noticed that the Cossacks avoided him he decided to take\r\nno part in the action, as in his opinion his courage had already been\r\nsufficiently proved when he was with his detachment, and also because\r\nhe was very happy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shot was heard in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe cornet became excited, and began giving orders to the Cossacks as\r\nto how they should divide and from which side they should approach. But\r\nthe Cossacks did not appear to pay any attention to these orders,\r\nlistening only to what Lukashka said and looking to him alone.\r\nLukashka\'s face and figure were expressive of calm solemnity. He put\r\nhis horse to a trot with which the others were unable to keep pace, and\r\nscrewing up his eyes kept looking ahead.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s a man on horseback,\' he said, reining in his horse and keeping\r\nin line with the others.\r\n\r\nOlenin looked intently, but could not see anything. The Cossacks soon\r\ndistinguished two riders and quietly rode straight towards them.\r\n\r\n\'Are those the ABREKS?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks did not answer his question, which appeared quite\r\nmeaningless to them. The ABREKS would have been fools to venture across\r\nthe river on horseback.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s friend Rodka waving to us, I do believe,\' said Lukashka,\r\npointing to the two mounted men who were now clearly visible. \'Look,\r\nhe\'s coming to us.\'\r\n\r\nA few minutes later it became plain that the two horsemen were the\r\nCossack scouts. The corporal rode up to Lukashka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Are they far?\' was all Lukashka said.\r\n\r\nJust then they heard a sharp shot some thirty paces off. The corporal\r\nsmiled slightly.\r\n\r\n\'Our Gurka is having shots at them,\' he said, nodding in the direction\r\nof the shot.\r\n\r\nHaving gone a few paces farther they saw Gurka sitting behind a\r\nsand-hillock and loading his gun. To while away the time he was\r\nexchanging shots with the ABREKS, who were behind another sand-heap. A\r\nbullet came whistling from their side.\r\n\r\nThe cornet was pale and grew confused. Lukashka dismounted from his\r\nhorse, threw the reins to one of the other Cossacks, and went up to\r\nGurka. Olenin also dismounted and, bending down, followed Lukashka.\r\nThey had hardly reached Gurka when two bullets whistled above them.\r\n\r\nLukashka looked around laughing at Olenin and stooped a little.\r\n\r\n\'Look out or they will kill you, Dmitri Andreich,\' he said. \'You\'d\r\nbetter go away--you have no business here.\' But Olenin wanted\r\nabsolutely to see the ABREKS.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the mound he saw caps and muskets some two hundred paces\r\noff. Suddenly a little cloud of smoke appeared from thence, and again a\r\nbullet whistled past. The ABREKS were hiding in a marsh at the foot of\r\nthe hill. Olenin was much impressed by the place in which they sat. In\r\nreality it was very much like the rest of the steppe, but because the\r\nABREKS sat there it seemed to detach itself from all the rest and to\r\nhave become distinguished. Indeed it appeared to Olenin that it was the\r\nvery spot for ABREKS to occupy. Lukashka went back to his horse and\r\nOlenin followed him.\r\n\r\n\'We must get a hay-cart,\' said Lukashka, \'or they will be killing some\r\nof us. There behind that mound is a Nogay cart with a load of hay.\'\r\n\r\nThe cornet listened to him and the corporal agreed. The cart of hay was\r\nfetched, and the Cossacks, hiding behind it, pushed it forward. Olenin\r\nrode up a hillock from whence he could see everything. The hay-cart\r\nmoved on and the Cossacks crowded together behind it. The Cossacks\r\nadvanced, but the Chechens, of whom there were nine, sat with their\r\nknees in a row and did not fire.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet. Suddenly from the Chechens arose the sound of a mournful\r\nsong, something like Daddy Eroshka\'s \'Ay day, dalalay.\' The Chechens\r\nknew that they could not escape, and to prevent themselves from being\r\ntempted to take to flight they had strapped themselves together, knee\r\nto knee, had got their guns ready, and were singing their death-song.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks with their hay-cart drew closer and closer, and Olenin\r\nexpected the firing to begin at any moment, but the silence was only\r\nbroken by the abreks\' mournful song. Suddenly the song ceased; there\r\nwas a sharp report, a bullet struck the front of the cart, and Chechen\r\ncurses and yells broke the silence and shot followed on shot and one\r\nbullet after another struck the cart. The Cossacks did not fire and\r\nwere now only five paces distant.\r\n\r\nAnother moment passed and the Cossacks with a whoop rushed out on both\r\nsides from behind the cart--Lukashka in front of them. Olenin heard\r\nonly a few shots, then shouting and moans. He thought he saw smoke and\r\nblood, and abandoning his horse and quite beside himself he ran towards\r\nthe Cossacks. Horror seemed to blind him. He could not make out\r\nanything, but understood that all was over. Lukashka, pale as death,\r\nwas holding a wounded Chechen by the arms and shouting, \'Don\'t kill\r\nhim. I\'ll take him alive!\' The Chechen was the red-haired man who had\r\nfetched his brother\'s body away after Lukashka had killed him. Lukashka\r\nwas twisting his arms. Suddenly the Chechen wrenched himself free and\r\nfired his pistol. Lukashka fell, and blood began to flow from his\r\nstomach. He jumped up, but fell again, swearing in Russian and in\r\nTartar. More and more blood appeared on his clothes and under him. Some\r\nCossacks approached him and began loosening his girdle. One of them,\r\nNazarka, before beginning to help, fumbled for some time, unable to put\r\nhis sword in its sheath: it would not go the right way. The blade of\r\nthe sword was blood-stained.\r\n\r\nThe Chechens with their red hair and clipped moustaches lay dead and\r\nhacked about. Only the one we know of, who had fired at Lukashka,\r\nthough wounded in many places was still alive. Like a wounded hawk all\r\ncovered with blood (blood was flowing from a wound under his right\r\neye), pale and gloomy, he looked about him with wide--open excited eyes\r\nand clenched teeth as he crouched, dagger in hand, still prepared to\r\ndefend himself. The cornet went up to him as if intending to pass by,\r\nand with a quick movement shot him in the ear. The Chechen started up,\r\nbut it was too late, and he fell.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks, quite out of breath, dragged the bodies aside and took\r\nthe weapons from them. Each of the red-haired Chechens had been a man,\r\nand each one had his own individual expression. Lukashka was carried to\r\nthe cart. He continued to swear in Russian and in Tartar.\r\n\r\n\'No fear, I\'ll strangle him with my hands. ANNA SENI!\' he cried,\r\nstruggling. But he soon became quiet from weakness.\r\n\r\nOlenin rode home. In the evening he was told that Lukashka was at\r\ndeath\'s door, but that a Tartar from beyond the river had undertaken to\r\ncure him with herbs.\r\n\r\nThe bodies were brought to the village office. The women and the little\r\nboys hastened to look at them.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark when Olenin returned, and he could not collect\r\nhimself after what he had seen. But towards night memories of the\r\nevening before came rushing to his mind. He looked out of the window,\r\nMaryanka was passing to and fro from the house to the cowshed, putting\r\nthings straight. Her mother had gone to the vineyard and her father to\r\nthe office. Olenin could not wait till she had quite finished her work,\r\nbut went out to meet her. She was in the hut standing with her back\r\ntowards him. Olenin thought she felt shy.\r\n\r\n\'Maryanka,\' said he, \'I say, Maryanka! May I come in?\'\r\n\r\nShe suddenly turned. There was a scarcely perceptible trace of tears in\r\nher eyes and her face was beautiful in its sadness. She looked at him\r\nin silent dignity.\r\n\r\nOlenin again said:\r\n\r\n\'Maryanka, I have come--\'\r\n\r\n\'Leave me alone!\' she said. Her face did not change but the tears ran\r\ndown her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\'What are you crying for? What is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'What?\' she repeated in a rough voice. \'Cossacks have been killed,\r\nthat\'s what for.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lukashka?\' said Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Go away! What do you want?\'\r\n\r\n\'Maryanka!\' said Olenin, approaching her.\r\n\r\n\'You will never get anything from me!\'\r\n\r\n\'Maryanka, don\'t speak like that,\' Olenin entreated.\r\n\r\n\'Get away. I\'m sick of you!\' shouted the girl, stamping her foot, and\r\nmoved threateningly towards him. And her face expressed such\r\nabhorrence, such contempt, and such anger that Olenin suddenly\r\nunderstood that there was no hope for him, and that his first\r\nimpression of this woman\'s inaccessibility had been perfectly correct.\r\n\r\nOlenin said nothing more, but ran out of the hut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two hours after returning home he lay on his bed motionless. Then\r\nhe went to his company commander and obtained leave to visit the staff.\r\nWithout taking leave of anyone, and sending Vanyusha to settle his\r\naccounts with his landlord, he prepared to leave for the fort where his\r\nregiment was stationed. Daddy Eroshka was the only one to see him off.\r\nThey had a drink, and then a second, and then yet another. Again as on\r\nthe night of his departure from Moscow, a three-horsed conveyance stood\r\nwaiting at the door. But Olenin did not confer with himself as he had\r\ndone then, and did not say to himself that all he had thought and done\r\nhere was \'not it\'. He did not promise himself a new life. He loved\r\nMaryanka more than ever, and knew that he could never be loved by her.\r\n\r\n\'Well, good-bye, my lad!\' said Daddy Eroshka. \'When you go on an\r\nexpedition, be wise and listen to my words--the words of an old man.\r\nWhen you are out on a raid or the like (you know I\'m an old wolf and\r\nhave seen things), and when they begin firing, don\'t get into a crowd\r\nwhere there are many men. When you fellows get frightened you always\r\ntry to get close together with a lot of others. You think it is merrier\r\nto be with others, but that\'s where it is worst of all! They always aim\r\nat a crowd. Now I used to keep farther away from the others and went\r\nalone, and I\'ve never been wounded. Yet what things haven\'t I seen in\r\nmy day?\'\r\n\r\n\'But you\'ve got a bullet in your back,\' remarked Vanyusha, who was\r\nclearing up the room.\r\n\r\n\'That was the Cossacks fooling about,\' answered Eroshka.\r\n\r\n\'Cossacks? How was that?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, just so. We were drinking. Vanka Sitkin, one of the Cossacks, got\r\nmerry, and puff! he gave me one from his pistol just here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and did it hurt?\' asked Olenin. \'Vanyusha, will you soon be\r\nready?\' he added.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, where\'s the hurry! Let me tell you. When he banged into me, the\r\nbullet did not break the bone but remained here. And I say: "You\'ve\r\nkilled me, brother. Eh! What have you done to me? I won\'t let you off!\r\nYou\'ll have to stand me a pailful!"\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, but did it hurt?\' Olenin asked again, scarcely listening to the\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n\'Let me finish. He stood a pailful, and we drank it, but the blood went\r\non flowing. The whole room was drenched and covered with blood. Grandad\r\nBurlak, he says, "The lad will give up the ghost. Stand a bottle of the\r\nsweet sort, or we shall have you taken up!" They bought more drink, and\r\nboozed and boozed--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but did it hurt you much?\' Olenin asked once more.\r\n\r\n\'Hurt, indeed! Don\'t interrupt: I don\'t like it. Let me finish. We\r\nboozed and boozed till morning, and I fell asleep on the top of the\r\noven, drunk. When I woke in the morning I could not unbend myself\r\nanyhow--\'\r\n\r\n\'Was it very painful?\' repeated Olenin, thinking that now he would at\r\nlast get an answer to his question.\r\n\r\n\'Did I tell you it was painful? I did not say it was painful, but I\r\ncould not bend and could not walk.\'\r\n\r\n\'And then it healed up?\' said Olenin, not even laughing, so heavy was\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\'It healed up, but the bullet is still there. Just feel it!\' And\r\nlifting his shirt he showed his powerful back, where just near the bone\r\na bullet could be felt and rolled about.\r\n\r\n\'Feel how it rolls,\' he said, evidently amusing himself with the bullet\r\nas with a toy. \'There now, it has rolled to the back.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Lukashka, will he recover?\' asked Olenin.\r\n\r\n\'Heaven only knows! There\'s no doctor. They\'ve gone for one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where will they get one? From Groznoe?\' asked Olenin. \'No, my lad.\r\nWere I the Tsar I\'d have hung all your Russian doctors long ago.\r\nCutting is all they know! There\'s our Cossack Baklashka, no longer a\r\nreal man now that they\'ve cut off his leg! That shows they\'re fools.\r\nWhat\'s Baklashka good for now? No, my lad, in the mountains there are\r\nreal doctors. There was my chum, Vorchik, he was on an expedition and\r\nwas wounded just here in the chest. Well, your doctors gave him up, but\r\none of theirs came from the mountains and cured him! They understand\r\nherbs, my lad!\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, stop talking rubbish,\' said Olenin. \'I\'d better send a doctor\r\nfrom head-quarters.\'\r\n\r\n\'Rubbish!\' the old man said mockingly. \'Fool, fool! Rubbish. You\'ll\r\nsend a doctor!--If yours cured people, Cossacks and Chechens would go\r\nto you for treatment, but as it is your officers and colonels send to\r\nthe mountains for doctors. Yours are all humbugs, all humbugs.\'\r\n\r\nOlenin did not answer. He agreed only too fully that all was humbug in\r\nthe world in which he had lived and to which he was now returning.\r\n\r\n\'How is Lukashka? You\'ve been to see him?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'He just lies as if he were dead. He does not eat nor drink. Vodka is\r\nthe only thing his soul accepts. But as long as he drinks vodka it\'s\r\nwell. I\'d be sorry to lose the lad. A fine lad--a brave, like me. I too\r\nlay dying like that once. The old women were already wailing. My head\r\nwas burning. They had already laid me out under the holy icons. So I\r\nlay there, and above me on the oven little drummers, no bigger than\r\nthis, beat the tattoo. I shout at them and they drum all the harder.\'\r\n(The old man laughed.) \'The women brought our church elder. They were\r\ngetting ready to bury me. They said, "He defiled himself with worldly\r\nunbelievers; he made merry with women; he ruined people; he did not\r\nfast, and he played the balalayka. Confess," they said. So I began to\r\nconfess. "I\'ve sinned!" I said. Whatever the priest said, I always\r\nanswered "I\'ve sinned." He began to ask me about the balalayka. "Where\r\nis the accursed thing," he says. "Show it me and smash it." But I say,\r\n"I\'ve not got it." I\'d hidden it myself in a net in the outhouse. I\r\nknew they could not find it. So they left me. Yet after all I\r\nrecovered. When I went for my BALALAYKA--What was I saying?\' he\r\ncontinued. \'Listen to me, and keep farther away from the other men or\r\nyou\'ll get killed foolishly. I feel for you, truly: you are a\r\ndrinker--I love you! And fellows like you like riding up the mounds.\r\nThere was one who lived here who had come from Russia, he always would\r\nride up the mounds (he called the mounds so funnily, "hillocks").\r\nWhenever he saw a mound, off he\'d gallop. Once he galloped off that way\r\nand rode to the top quite pleased, but a Chechen fired at him and\r\nkilled him! Ah, how well they shoot from their gun-rests, those\r\nChechens! Some of them shoot even better than I do. I don\'t like it\r\nwhen a fellow gets killed so foolishly! Sometimes I used to look at\r\nyour soldiers and wonder at them. There\'s foolishness for you! They go,\r\nthe poor fellows, all in a clump, and even sew red collars to their\r\ncoats! How can they help being hit! One gets killed, they drag him away\r\nand another takes his place! What foolishness!\' the old man repeated,\r\nshaking his head. \'Why not scatter, and go one by one? So you just go\r\nlike that and they won\'t notice you. That\'s what you must do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, thank you! Good-bye, Daddy. God willing we may meet again,\' said\r\nOlenin, getting up and moving towards the passage.\r\n\r\nThe old man, who was sitting on the floor, did not rise.\r\n\r\n\'Is that the way one says "Good-bye"? Fool, fool!\' he began. \'Oh dear,\r\nwhat has come to people? We\'ve kept company, kept company for well-nigh\r\na year, and now "Good-bye!" and off he goes! Why, I love you, and how I\r\npity you! You are so forlorn, always alone, always alone. You\'re\r\nsomehow so unsociable. At times I can\'t sleep for thinking about you. I\r\nam so sorry for you. As the song has it:\r\n\r\n"It is very hard, dear brother, In a foreign land to live."\r\n\r\nSo it is with you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, good-bye,\' said Olenin again.\r\n\r\nThe old man rose and held out his hand. Olenin pressed it and turned to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\'Give us your mug, your mug!\'\r\n\r\nAnd the old man took Olenin by the head with both hands and kissed him\r\nthree times with wet moustaches and lips, and began to cry.\r\n\r\n\'I love you, good-bye!\'\r\n\r\nOlenin got into the cart.\r\n\r\n\'Well, is that how you\'re going? You might give me something for a\r\nremembrance. Give me a gun! What do you want two for?\' said the old\r\nman, sobbing quite sincerely.\r\n\r\nOlenin got out a musket and gave it to him.\r\n\r\n\'What a lot you\'ve given the old fellow,\' murmured Vanyusha, \'he\'ll\r\nnever have enough! A regular old beggar. They are all such irregular\r\npeople,\' he remarked, as he wrapped himself in his overcoat and took\r\nhis seat on the box.\r\n\r\n\'Hold your tongue, swine!\' exclaimed the old man, laughing. \'What a\r\nstingy fellow!\'\r\n\r\nMaryanka came out of the cowshed, glanced indifferently at the cart,\r\nbowed and went towards the hut.\r\n\r\n\'LA FILLE!\' said Vanyusha, with a wink, and burst out into a silly\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\'Drive on!\' shouted Olenin, angrily.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, my lad! Good-bye. I won\'t forget you!\' shouted Eroshka.\r\n\r\nOlenin turned round. Daddy Eroshka was talking to Maryanka, evidently\r\nabout his own affairs, and neither the old man nor the girl looked at\r\nOlenin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cossacks, by Leo Tolstoy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COSSACKS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 4761.txt or 4761.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/4/7/6/4761/\r\n\r\nProduced by Steve Harris, Charles Franks and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
