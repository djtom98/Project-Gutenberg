She had come to pay one of her\r\nusual visits to her old relations. The grandson whom Hester had made\r\nacquaintance with without seeing his face, had now been nearly a week at\r\nthe Vernonry and was known to everybody about. The captain\'s precautions\r\nhad, of course, come to nothing. He had gone, as in duty bound, to pay\r\nhis respects to the great lady who was his relation too, though in a\r\nfar-off degree, and he had pleased her. Catherine thought of nothing\r\nless than of giving a great pleasure to her old friends by her praise.\r\n"He is full of news and information, which is a godsend to us country\r\nfolks, and he is very good-looking, _qui ne g\xe2te rien_."\r\n\r\nMrs. Morgan looked up from her place by the fireside with a smile of\r\npleasure. She sat folding her peaceful old hands with an air of\r\nbeatitude, which, notwithstanding her content, had not been upon her\r\ncountenance before the young man\'s arrival.\r\n\r\n"That is a great pleasure to me, Catherine--to know that you like him,"\r\nsaid the old lady. "He seems to me all that, and kind besides."\r\n\r\n"What I should have expected your grandson to be," said Catherine. "I\r\nwant him to see the people here, and make a few acquaintances. I don\'t\r\nsuppose that our little people at Redborough can be of much importance\r\nto a young man in town; still it is a pity to neglect an opportunity. He\r\nis coming to dine with me to-morrow--as I suppose he told you?"\r\n\r\nThe old lady nodded her head several times with the same soft smile of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n"You are always good," she said; "you have done everything, Catherine,\r\nfor me and my old man. But if you want to go straight to my heart you\r\nknow the way lies through the children--my poor Katie\'s boys."\r\n\r\n"I am glad that the direct route is so easy," Miss Vernon said in her\r\nfine, large, beneficent way; "at least in this case. The others I don\'t\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nCaptain Morgan came and stood between his wife and the visitor. To be\r\nsure it was to the fire he went, by which he posted himself with his\r\nback to it, as is the right of every Englishman. His countenance wore a\r\ntroubled look, very different from the happiness of his wife\'s. He stood\r\nlike a barrier between them, a non-conductor intercepting the passage of\r\ngenial sentiment.\r\n\r\n"My dear Catherine," he said, with a little formality, "I don\'t wish to\r\nbe unkind, nor to check your kindness; but you must recollect that\r\nthough he is poor Katie\'s boy, she, poor soul, had nothing to do with\r\nthe up-bringing of him, and that, in short, we know nothing about him.\r\nIt has been my principle, as you know, of late years, to insist upon\r\nliving my own life."\r\n\r\n"All that, my kind old uncle, is understood," said Catherine. "There are\r\na great many people, I believe, who are better than their principles,\r\nand you are one of them--that is all. I understand that you know nothing\r\nabout him. You are only a man, which is a great drawback, but it is not\r\nto be helped: _we_ know, though we have seen no more of him than you\r\nhave. Isn\'t it so?"\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward a little, and looked across at the old lady, who\r\nsmiled and nodded in return. Old Mrs. Morgan was not disturbed by her\r\nhusband\'s disagreement. It did not even make her angry. She took it with\r\nperfect composure, beaming over her own discovery of her grandson, and\r\nthe additional happiness it had brought.\r\n\r\n"My old man," she said, "Catherine, has his own ways of thinking, we all\r\nknow that; and sometimes he will act upon them, but most commonly not.\r\nOne thing I know, he will never shut his doors on his own flesh and\r\nblood, nor deny his old wife what is her greatest pleasure--the thing\r\nthat has been wanting to me all the time--all the time! I scarcely knew\r\nwhat it was. And if the boy had been distant or strange, or showed that\r\nhe knew nothing about us, still I should have been content. I would have\r\nsaid, \'Let him go; you were right, Rowley, and not I.\' But it is not\r\nso," the old lady went on after a pause, "there\'s love in him. I\r\nremember when the girls were married there was something I always seemed\r\nto want, I found out what it was when the first grandchild was born. It\r\nwas to feel a baby in my arms again--that was what I wanted. I don\'t\r\nknow, Catherine," she added with humility, "if you will think that\r\nfoolish?"\r\n\r\n"If I will understand--that is what you are doubtful of--for I am an old\r\nmaid, and never had, so to speak, a baby in my arms; but I do\r\nunderstand," said Catherine, with a little moisture in her eyes. "Well,\r\nand this great handsome fellow, a man of the world, is he your baby that\r\nyou wanted so much?"\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said the old captain. "The great advantage of being an old maid,\r\nas you say, is that you are above the prejudices of parentage. It is\r\npossible to get you to hear reason. Why should my life be overshadowed\r\npermanently by the action of another? That is what I ask. Why should I\r\nbe responsible for one who is not me, nor of my mind?"\r\n\r\n"Listen to him! You would think that was all he knows," said Mrs.\r\nMorgan; "there is no fathoming that old man, my dear."\r\n\r\n"What I have to say is, that we know nothing of this young man," said\r\nthe captain, shaking his shaggy head as if to shake off his wife\'s\r\ncomments. "You will exercise your own judgment--but don\'t take him on\r\nmine, for I don\'t know him. He is well enough to look at; he has plenty\r\nto say for himself; I dare say he is clever enough. Form your own\r\njudgment and act upon that, but don\'t come and say it\'s our fault if he\r\ndisappoints you--that is all I have to say. Excuse me, Catherine, if I\r\ntake a walk even while you are here, for this puts me out--I allow it\r\nputs me out," Captain Morgan said.\r\n\r\n"What has made him take this idea?" said Miss Vernon, when Captain\r\nMorgan had hobbled out.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, he has his fancies like another. We have had many things\r\nto put up with, and he thinks when it comes to the second generation--he\r\nthinks we have a right to peace and quiet in our old age."\r\n\r\n"And so you have," said Catherine gravely, "so you have."\r\n\r\nShe did not ask any questions. Neither she nor any one knew what it was\r\nwith which, in the other part of their lives, these old people had been\r\ncompelled to "put up." Nor did the old lady say. She answered softly,\r\n"Yes, I think so too. Peace is sweet, but it is not life."\r\n\r\n"Some people would say it was better."\r\n\r\n"They never knew, those people, what life was. I like to see the\r\nchildren come and go--one here, one there. One in need of your sympathy,\r\nanother of your help, another, oh Catherine, even that--of your pardon,\r\nmy dear!" This made her pause, and brought, what was so unusual, a\r\nlittle glistening moisture to the old lady\'s eyes. She was silent for a\r\nmoment, and smiled, perhaps to efface the impression she had made. "If\r\nyou can do nothing else for them you can always do that," she said.\r\n\r\nCatherine Vernon, who was sixty-five, and knew herself to be an old\r\nwoman, looked at the other, who was over eighty, as a girl looks at her\r\nmother--wondering at her strange experiences, feeling herself a child in\r\npresence of a knowledge which is not hers. She had not experience enough\r\nto understand this philosophy. She looked for a little at her companion,\r\nwondering, and then she said, soothingly--\r\n\r\n"We must not dwell upon painful subjects. This young fellow will not\r\nappeal to you so. What I like in him is his independence. He has his own\r\nopinion, and he expresses it freely. His society will be very good for\r\nmy nephew Edward. If he has a fault--and, indeed, I don\'t think that boy\r\nhas many--it is that he is diffident about his own opinion. Roland, if\r\nhe stays long enough, will help to cure him of that. And how does the\r\nother affair go on?" she added, with a perceptible pause, and in a voice\r\nwhich was a little constrained. "No doubt there is great triumph next\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Morgan shook her head.\r\n\r\n"It is curious what mistakes we all make," she said.\r\n\r\n"Mistakes? Do you mean that I am mistaken about the triumph? Well, they\r\nhave very good reason. I should triumph too, if having been turned out\r\nof a great house, like Mrs. John, I managed to get back again, and\r\nrecover all that I had lost by means of a thing so entirely my own\r\ncreation as a daughter. Even a son would have been different--I suppose.\r\nYou know I am not a judge on that point," Catherine said with a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe old lady continued to shake her head slowly.\r\n\r\n"The only one that has not made a mistake is Harry. If he could have got\r\nwhat he wanted, it would have been the best thing that could have\r\nhappened. There is no complication about that. For him it would have\r\nbeen the best."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say," said Catherine, her eyes lighting up with that\r\nfire of curiosity and interest which overcomes even the languor of age.\r\n"Do you mean to say that--he is not to get what he wishes? Oh, this is\r\ntoo much! That girl is eaten up with pride. What is she saving herself\r\nfor, I wonder? What can she expect?"\r\n\r\nAgain old Mrs. Morgan shook her head, smiling softly as at blunders upon\r\nwhich she could not be too severe.\r\n\r\n"I have said already what mistakes we make, Catherine! often in our own\r\ncareer, always about other people, my dear."\r\n\r\nUpon this Catherine laughed, not having, though she esteemed her old\r\nrelation greatly, as much respect for her judgment as probably it\r\ndeserved. Miss Vernon was too sensible a woman either to feel or express\r\nany contempt for her own sex, as clever women who were not sensible used\r\nto do in those days; but there was an undertone in her mind of\r\nindifference, to say the least, of another woman\'s opinion. She had a\r\nfeeling that it could not be any better, and most likely was not so\r\ngood, as her own, for she had held a position not usual among women, and\r\nknew that not many would have proved equal to the emergency as she did.\r\nWhat the old captain said would have impressed her more than what his\r\nwife said, and this although she was perfectly aware that the old lady\r\nin many cases was considered the most judicious of the two.\r\n\r\n"I know you are both fanatics for Hester," she said, "who is not my\r\nfavourite as she is yours. You must take care that Roland does not fall\r\na victim to her. There are few girls about, and in that case, when young\r\nmen have a mind to make fools of themselves, there is no choice. Do not\r\nshake your kind head off; you know this is a thing in which we have\r\nagreed we shall never think alike."\r\n\r\n"Never is a long day," said the old lady, tranquilly. She was well used\r\nto waiting. In her experience, so many things had come to pass which no\r\none expected. Even now, she said to herself, if any one had told her\r\nthat Roland Ashton would one day be under her roof--She added quietly,\r\n"You are too much alike to do each other justice."\r\n\r\nAt this Catherine grew red. It had been intimated to her before, and she\r\nhad scarcely been able to support the imputation. But she mastered\r\nherself with an effort. Nowhere perhaps but in this house would she have\r\ndone so; but these old people had an ascendency over her which she could\r\nnot explain.\r\n\r\n"We will say nothing on that point," she said, quickly. "Your news has\r\ntaken me so completely by surprise. Are you sure of it? Why should Mrs.\r\nJohn\'s daughter have rejected so excellent a settlement? She is looking\r\nfor something better, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I think that was a mistake too," said the old lady. "She says herself\r\nthat Harry, though he is not clever, is good and true. Ah! it is you who\r\nshake your head now. In some things even our Catherine fails; he is not\r\nthe equal of Hester; but it is not my opinion that a man need be always\r\nsuperior to his wife. Where there is love, it does not matter. I should\r\nhave been pleased to see it; but she is young; she thinks differently.\r\nShe is looking for nothing consciously; but in her heart for love, which\r\nis the visitor one is always looking for when one is young."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said Catherine; "it is the old people that are romantic, not\r\nthe young. It is the settlements that are the things to be considered;\r\nor perhaps she is thinking of a title? Her mother is capable of any\r\nnonsense," she said with a scornful laugh.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morgan made no reply. Her peaceful aspect with her folded hands,\r\nthe soft little smile on her old mouth, the slight shake of the head,\r\nwas perhaps a trial of patience for the other, who felt herself thrown\r\nback into the category of the young and superficial by this calm\r\nexpectation and quietness. Catherine Vernon was still in the region of\r\nprejudice and dislike. She had not lived into that superior sphere of\r\ntoleration and calm. Impatience filled her veins. But she mastered\r\nherself, the atmosphere subduing her. And Captain Morgan came hobbling\r\nback, having calmed himself down too.\r\n\r\n"Ellen has come back," said Miss Vernon, to change the subject, "from\r\nParis, with clothes enough for all the neighbourhood. It amuses me to\r\nthink of her among the bonnet-shops. What true enjoyment! and scarcely\r\nless now to show them to all her friends. Now there is a pleasure you\r\ncannot enjoy, uncle. A man could not call his friends together to look\r\nat his new hats."\r\n\r\n"There is no telling what a young man can do in the way of folly till he\r\nis put to it," said the captain. "I am loth to recognise any\r\ninferiority. What do you think about all these failures, Catherine? or\r\nrather, if you have withdrawn from it, what do the boys think?"\r\n\r\n"I hope I am still capable of giving an opinion," said Miss Vernon.\r\n"None of them touch us, which is the chief thing. For my part,\r\nspeculation in this wild way is my horror. If you could see the\r\nproposals that used to be put before me! Not an undertaking that was not\r\nthe safest and the surest in the world! The boys are well indoctrinated\r\nin my opinions on that subject. They know better, I hope, than to snatch\r\nat a high percentage; and love the substance, the good honest capital,\r\nwhich I love. I think," she continued, "there is a little of a miser in\r\nme, or perhaps you will say in all women. I love to see my money--to\r\ncount it over like the---- By the way, it was the king that did that while\r\nthe queen was eating her bread and honey. That goes against my theory."\r\n\r\n"A good many things go against your theory. They say that there are no\r\nsuch wild speculators as women. It seems easy to them that a sort of\r\nmiracle should happen; that something should come out of nothing."\r\n\r\n"They have not had my experience," said Catherine. "But Edward and Harry\r\nare as steady as two churches; that is," she added with a complacency\r\nwhich they all recollected afterwards, "Edward is the head; the other\r\nfortunately has the good sense not to attempt to think for himself."\r\n\r\n"Hester would have done that for him," said Mrs. Morgan, in an\r\nundertone; but Catherine caught it and went on with heightened colour,\r\nfor the idea that Hester--_that_ girl!--might have had something to say\r\nin the government of the bank, struck her as if some one had given her a\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n"Edward is the heart and soul of everything," she said. "How fortunate\r\nit was for me that my choice fell upon that boy. I should say he had an\r\nold head on young shoulders, but that I don\'t like the conjunction. He\r\nis young enough. He has always been accustomed to family life, and loves\r\nhis home."\r\n\r\n"It is, no doubt," said Captain Morgan, kindly, "that he has had the\r\nadvantage of your own experience and teaching more than the other,\r\nCatherine."\r\n\r\n"That would be a delightful thought for me," Miss Vernon said with a\r\nsuffusion of pleasure in her eyes. "Perhaps there is some truth in it. I\r\nhave done my best to share my lights, such as they are, with him; but he\r\ngoes beyond me. And to think that I hesitated between Edward and Harry!\r\nI hope I am grateful to Providence that turned me to the best. The other\r\nfamily are following out their lot quite characteristically. Ellen\'s\r\nhusband has a good deal of worldly sense, which is wanting to that bit\r\nof a butterfly. He is trying hard to get her to make up to me. She has\r\ncome to see me twice, full of pretty speeches about Algy\'s great respect\r\nfor me. Human nature," said Catherine with a laugh, "is as good, nay,\r\nfar better, than a play. How cunning it thinks it is, but in reality how\r\nvery easy to see through."\r\n\r\nHere old Mrs. Morgan began to shake her head again, smiling always, but\r\nwith an indulgent, gentle contradictoriness which was more near making\r\nMiss Vernon angry than anything she had encountered in this house\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"What does she sit there for, like a Chinese idol?" said the captain.\r\n"She has a wonderful opinion of herself, that old woman. Human nature\r\nmay be easy to see through, but it is very hard to understand,\r\nCatherine. What is that the Bible says about \'deceitful above all\r\nthings\'? When you try to get hold of yourself, did you ever find a more\r\nslippery customer? There\'s a kind of amusement in it, when you are up to\r\nall your own dodges."\r\n\r\n"Rowley, my dear!" said the old lady, surprised.\r\n\r\n"It is true I am too old for slang: but one picks it up, and sometimes\r\nit is happy enough. I say when you are up to your own dodges; but that\r\nis difficult, and takes a great deal of time. To find yourself trotting\r\nforth the same old pretences that you did at twenty, attempting to throw\r\nthe same sort of dust in your own eyes, is wonderful. There is a sort of\r\nartlessness in the artifice that is amusing, as you say; but it is only\r\namusing when you are strong enough to get the upper hand."\r\n\r\n"When which of you gets the upper hand? for there seem to be two of\r\nyou," said Catherine, not so much amused in her own person as she made a\r\npretence of being--for this was certainly not her view.\r\n\r\n"To be sure," said the old captain, "there are two of you, we all know\r\nthat; and in most cases one of you a very silly fellow, taken in on\r\nevery hand, while the other man sniggers in his sleeve. Of course I am\r\nspeaking from my own side--ladies may be different from anything I know.\r\nBut after all," he went on, "I don\'t think so; for I\'ve been a woman\r\nmyself, so to speak, through _her_, for sixty years--that is a long\r\nspell. I don\'t see much difference, though in some things she has got to\r\nthe last word sooner than I."\r\n\r\n"I think we mean different things," said Catherine, rising; "that was\r\nnot the view I was taking. Yours is better in the moral aspect, for I\r\nsuppose it is more profitable to judge ourselves than others; but one\r\ncannot always be studying one\'s self."\r\n\r\nThere was a half-apology in her tone, and at the same time a\r\nhalf-impatience. She did not desire to be turned from the comedy which\r\nshe had in her way enjoyed for years, seeing through, as she said, all\r\nthe little world of dependents that hung about her, drawing out their\r\nweaknesses, perceiving the bitter grudge that lay under their exterior\r\nof smiles, and the thousand ways in which they made up to themselves for\r\nthe humiliation of being in her debt--in order to turn to what might\r\nprove the less amusing contemplation of her own weaknesses, or recognise\r\nthe element of evil in that which was certainly not amusing. Her\r\ncarriage was standing at the gate which admitted to the garden front of\r\nthe Vernonry, and it was with a sense of comfort that she got rid of the\r\nold captain at his door, and threw a keen, half-laughing glance at the\r\nwindows on the other side. Mr. Mildmay Vernon was making himself very\r\nuncomfortable at the only angle of his room which permitted him to see\r\nthe gate, watching for her exit. He kissed his hand to her as she paused\r\nand looked round before getting into the carriage, and Catherine\r\nrealised as if she had seen it, the snarl of mockery with which this\r\nsalutation was accompanied. In the intervening space were the two\r\nsisters keeping the most vigilant watch for her reappearance, counting\r\nthe minutes which she spent on the other side of the house, and saying\r\nill-natured things to each other as they nodded and waved their hands.\r\nShe was aware of the very tone in which these speeches would be made, as\r\nwell as if she had heard them, and it gave her a great sense of\r\nenjoyment to reflect that they were all sitting in rooms well warmed and\r\ncarefully kept, and full of benevolent prevision of all their wants,\r\nwhile they thus permitted themselves to sneer and snarl at the bestower.\r\nJust as she drove away, Hester by chance opened the verandah door, and\r\ncame out to gather some of the leaves of the Virginia creeper which were\r\ndropping with every blast. Hester\'s serious eyes met hers with scarcely\r\nany greeting at all on either side. Catherine did not know very well how\r\nit was that this girl came into the comedy. Had she been Harry\'s\r\nbetrothed, Miss Vernon could have understood it, and though she could\r\nnot but have felt the triumph of her old rival, yet it would have added\r\ndelightfully to the commonplace drama in which everybody pursued their\r\nown mean ends under high-sounding pretences. She would have been able to\r\nsmile at the commonplace young fellow taken in by the delusion that he\r\nwas loved for himself, and laugh in the conviction that Harry\'s was no\r\ndeep affection to be wounded, but that he could quite well take care of\r\nhimself, and that between these two it would be diamond cutting diamond.\r\nBut the present state of affairs she did not understand. All that was\r\namusing in it was the doubtless unbounded disappointment of the scheming\r\nlittle mother, who thus must find all her fine schemes collapsing in her\r\nhands. She could not refrain from mentioning the matter at dinner that\r\nevening, though Edward had a little failed on the former occasion, in\r\nthat backing up of all her opinions and feelings which she had been\r\naccustomed to expect from him.\r\n\r\n"I find there is to be no match such as that we were speaking of," she\r\nsaid. "Harry has either drawn back or he is refused. Perhaps it may be\r\nthat he has thought better of it," she added suddenly, without\r\npremeditation, grudging, as perhaps was natural, to let her young\r\nantagonist carry off the honours of the day.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was not quite so certain as people seemed to believe."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that Harry would persevere?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that she would accept him, Aunt Catherine. She is not a girl, so\r\nfar as I can judge, of whom one could ever be so sure."\r\n\r\n"In the name of wonder," cried out Miss Vernon, "what does she expect?\r\nGood heavens! where is she to get another such chance again? To refuse\r\nHarry, for a girl in her position, is madness. Where does she think she\r\nwill get another such offer? Upon my word," said Catherine, with a\r\nlittle laugh, "I can scarcely help being sorry for her poor little\r\nmother. Such a disappointment for Mrs. John--her White House and her\r\nrecovered \'position\' that she loves so dearly, and all her comforts--I\r\ncould find it in my heart to be very sorry for her," she said, with\r\nanother little laugh.\r\n\r\nEdward gave a glance up at her from his plate, on which he had the air\r\nof being intent. The young man thought he saw through Catherine, as she\r\nthought she saw through all the other inmates of her little world. What\r\nhe did see through was the superficial badness which her position had\r\nmade, but he had not so much as a glimmering of the other Catherine, the\r\nnobler creature who stood behind; and though he smiled and assented, a\r\nsensation of disgust came into his heart. He, too, had his comedy of\r\nhuman nature, which secretly, under cover of his complacency and\r\nagreement with Catherine\'s opinion, he regarded with the bitterest and\r\nangriest scorn. What an extraordinary shock would it have been for his\r\ncompanion, who felt herself to sit in the place of the audience, seeing\r\nthe puppets play their pranks upon the stage and exhibit all their\r\nfooleries, to know that she herself was the actor, turned outside in and\r\nseen through in all her devices, to this boy whom she loved!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                             A FAMILY PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"A grandson of Captain Morgan! Well, that is not much to meet us at our\r\nwedding dinner--at least, if it is not our wedding dinner--Oh, I know\r\nthere was our state one, and we met all the old fogies whom I detest!"\r\ncried Mrs. Algernon Merridew, born Ellen Vernon; "but this is only the\r\nsecond, and the second is quite as important as the first. She should\r\nhave asked the county first, to introduce us properly--and then the\r\ntown; but Aunt Catherine is one of the people who never do what\'s\r\nexpected of them. Besides, I don\'t want to meet her relations on the\r\nother side. They\'re nobodies. She spends quantities of money upon them\r\nwhich she has no business to do, seeing it\'s the Vernons\' money and not\r\nhers at all, if you come to that."\r\n\r\n"Come, Nell," said her husband with a laugh. He was a dark young man, as\r\nwas to be expected--seeing that she was so fair a young\r\nwoman--good-looking, with whiskers, which were the fashion in those\r\ndays, of a bushy blackness, and hair which suggested pomade. "Come,\r\nNell," he said, "strike fair. Catherine Vernon does a great deal of good\r\nwith her money, and doesn\'t spare upon the Vernons--all the town knows\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, she doesn\'t spare upon the Vernons--all those useless old\r\ncreatures that she has up there in that horrid old-fashioned house! I\r\nthink if she did a little more for real relations, and left those old\r\nfogies alone, it would be more like---- Expecting one to call upon them,\r\nand take all sorts of trouble! And look at poor old Harry kept with his\r\nnose at his desk for ever."\r\n\r\n"Poor old Harry is very lucky, I think. Fair play is a jewel. If she\r\ndoesn\'t do all you want, who do you expect would?"\r\n\r\n"You, of course!" cried Ellen, as was natural: and they were so newly\r\nmarried that he thought it very pretty; "that is the good of you; and if\r\nyou go in for Aunt Catherine too, when you know I can\'t endure her----"\r\n\r\n"Of course the good of me is to do whatever you want," he said, with\r\nvarious honeymoon demonstrations; "but as for going in for Aunt\r\nCatherine--you must know this, Nelly, that I\'m very proud of being\r\nconnected with Catherine Vernon. I have heard of her all my life as a\r\nsort of goddess, you know. You must not put me off it all at once--I\r\ncouldn\'t be put off it. There now, there\'s nothing to look sulky about."\r\n\r\n"You are such an old Redborough person," Ellen said, with a little pout:\r\nwhich was very true. He was not, indeed, at all a good match for a\r\nVernon; but his whiskers--things much admired in those days--and her\r\nself-will had worsted all opposition. He was no more than the son of the\r\nperfectly respectable and very well-to-do solicitor, who was universally\r\nrespected in Redborough, and though Algernon had been in town and sown\r\nhis wild oats, he had never entirely got out of his mind the instinctive\r\nconviction that Redborough was the centre of the world; and to feel\r\nhimself within the charmed circle in which Catherine Vernon moved was a\r\npromotion which was intoxicating to the young man. Not even his devotion\r\nto his pretty wife, which was great, could bring him to disown that\r\nallegiance to Catherine Vernon which every Redborough man was born with.\r\nIt was a sort of still more intoxicating proof of the dignity he had\r\ncome to, that the pretty wife herself turned up her little nose at\r\nCatherine. That Mrs. Algernon should be so familiar with the highest\r\nexcellence known to them, as to venture to do this, was to the whole\r\nfamily of the Merridews an admiration--just as a family entirely loyal\r\nmight be flattered by having a princess among them who should permit\r\nherself to laugh at the majesty of the king; but this did not shake\r\ntheir own fidelity. And Algernon, though he ventured with bated breath\r\nto say "Aunt Catherine" when he spoke of her in his own family, had not\r\ngot over his veneration for Miss Vernon. He had taken her in to dinner\r\non the occasion of the great banquet, which Ellen described so lightly,\r\nwith a sensation bordering upon the hysterical. Rapture, and pride, and\r\npanic were in it. He did not know, according to the vulgar description,\r\nwhether he were on his head or his heels, and his voice made a buzzing\r\nin his own ears as he talked. The second time was to be in the intimacy\r\nof the domestic circle--if it had been to meet a crossing-sweeper it\r\nwould still have been a bewildering gratification; but all the more, his\r\nwife\'s criticism and her indifference, and even discontent with the\r\nnotice which to him seemed so overpowering an honour, pleased the young\r\nman. She felt herself every bit as good as Catherine, and yet she was\r\nhis--Mrs. Algernon Merridew! The thought was one adapted to make his\r\nhead swim with pride and delight.\r\n\r\nIt was entirely a family party, as Catherine had said, and a very small\r\none. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways had been invited, to make the number even,\r\nand their preparations for the unusual honour had taken up four days at\r\nleast. When they sailed into the drawing-room at the Grange, having\r\nspent ten minutes in shaking out the flounces and arranging the flowers\r\nand ribbons with which they were ornamented, it would be impossible to\r\nattempt to describe the disgust of the bride. She turned her eyes upon\r\nher husband, who for his part was in a state of beatitude not to be\r\ndisturbed by trifles, with a look of indignant rage which he did not\r\nunderstand. "To think she should ask those old things to meet _us!_ I\r\ndeclare I have a great mind to go right away," she whispered to Harry,\r\nwho was more sympathetic. Harry allowed that it was almost beyond\r\nbearing. "But I wouldn\'t make a quarrel if I were you," he said. In the\r\nmeantime the sisters went up beaming to their dear Catherine, whom they\r\nkissed with devotion. How well she was looking! how becoming her dress\r\nwas! but that lovely lace would be becoming to any one! they cried.\r\nCatherine received all these compliments with a smile, and she took\r\ngreat pleasure in Ellen\'s disgust, and the way in which she turned her\r\near instead of her cheek to the salutations of the cousins, who were\r\nrapturous in their admiration of her in all her bridal finery. The entry\r\nof the stranger, who was unknown to any of them, made a diversion.\r\nRoland Ashton, when he was visible in the full light of Miss Vernon\'s\r\ndrawing-room, turned out, in appearance at least, a very valuable\r\naddition to the society. Ellen, who was critical, and inclined by nature\r\nto a poor opinion of old Captain Morgan\'s grandson, looked at him with\r\nastonished, and indeed reluctant, approval. His whiskers were not so\r\nthick or so black as Algernon\'s; but he had a fine mass of dark hair,\r\nwavy, and rather longer than is now permitted by fashion, fine features\r\nand dark eyes, with a paleness which was considered very interesting in\r\nthose days. He was much taller and of more imposing aspect than Edward,\r\nwhose stature was not great; he was far more intellectual than Harry;\r\naltogether of the four young men present, his was no doubt the most\r\nnoticeable figure. They all appraised him mentally as he came\r\nin--Catherine first of all, with a sensation of pride that the one\r\nindividual who was her relation, without being the relation of her\r\nfamily, was a creditable novelty to introduce among them; the others,\r\nwith various degrees of quickened curiosity and grudging. The grudge was\r\nintensified in the persons of the sisters, who could not endure this\r\ninterloper. They had felt it their duty to draw the line at the Morgans\r\nlong ago, and it was all they could do to behave with propriety at\r\nCatherine\'s table when they were seated beside the descendant of the old\r\npeople on whom Catherine spent her money in what they felt to be an\r\nentirely unjustifiable way. They were the only persons present who kept\r\nup their grudge to the end. In Ellen\'s case it disappeared with the\r\nclear perception of his good looks. But when Mr. Ashton offered his arm\r\nto Miss Matilda Vernon-Ridgway, the look with which she received the\r\noffered courtesy was enough to freeze any adventurous young man into\r\nstone. It did not, however. It made him all but laugh as he glanced at\r\nCatherine, who for her part contemplated her cousins with much\r\ngratification. Miss Matilda placed the end of her finger upon the young\r\nman\'s arm. She kept at as great a distance as possible as she crossed\r\nthe hall by his side. To the little speech about the weather, which he\r\nthought it his duty to make her, she returned a sort of inarticulate\r\nreply--a monosyllable, but conveying no meaning. When she was seated at\r\ntable she flung herself, so to speak, upon her neighbour at the other\r\nside, who, as it happened, was Harry Vernon, and who was not prepared\r\nfor the honour. All this was to Catherine as good as a play.\r\n\r\n"What a climate, and what a poky old place this Redborough is," said\r\nEllen, preparing to lead the conversation, as she finished her soup. She\r\nspoke apparently to Edward, but in reality to the company, which was not\r\ntoo large for general conversation. "It is dreadful to come back here in\r\nthe beginning of winter from Abroad. I declare I quite envy you, you\r\npeople who have never been Abroad; you don\'t know the difference. Bright\r\nsunshine all day long, and bands playing, and the best of music, and all\r\nyour friends to talk to, sitting out under the trees. Compare that with\r\nRedborough, where, beyond a few tiresome little dinner parties, and\r\nperhaps three dances at Christmas----"\r\n\r\n"The White House used to be a great addition to the cheerfulness of the\r\nplace," said Edward. "Harry will have no heart to keep it up by himself\r\nnow you have left him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry shall marry," said Ellen, "I have made up my mind to that;\r\nand as soon as we have got quite settled, I mean to set things a-going.\r\nI mean to have a Thursday, Aunt Catherine. We shall be glad if you\'ll\r\ncome. It is to be a _Th\xe9 Dansante_, which is quite a novelty here. You\r\nlearn so much better about all these things Abroad."\r\n\r\n"Where is Abroad?" said Roland, in an undertone which was so\r\nconfidential and intimate, that had he been anybody else, Miss Matilda\r\nmust have yielded to its seduction. As it was, she only gave him a look\r\nof surprise at his ignorance, and cleared her throat and shook her\r\nbracelets in order to be able to strike in.\r\n\r\n"A _Th\xe9 Dansante_ is exactly the kind of entertainment that suits me,"\r\nCatherine said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, won\'t it be nice?" said Ellen, unconscious. "I learnt all the\r\nfigures of the _cotillion_, which is the most amusing thing to end up\r\nwith, and I made Algy learn it. As soon as ever our house is ready we\r\nshall start. It will be a new feature in society. As for Harry, till\r\nhe\'s married he\'ll have to be content with bachelor\'s dinners, for I\r\ncan\'t always be leaving Algy to look after him."\r\n\r\nHere Harry murmured something, stammering, and with a blush, to the\r\nintent that the bachelor\'s dinners would last a long time.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t see you so often at our place as we used to do, Mr. Harry,"\r\nsaid Miss Matilda, sweetly. "It used to be quite a pleasure to watch for\r\nyou; and the summer evenings were so tempting, weren\'t they? Oh, fie! it\r\nis very naughty to love and to ride away. We always said that was what\r\nwas likely to happen, didn\'t we?" she said to her sister, on the other\r\nside of the table.\r\n\r\nMiss Martha nodded and smiled in return, and cried--\r\n\r\n"Oh, always," in a shriller tone.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you thought likely to happen? Then it didn\'t happen if it\r\nwas Harry," cried Ellen, instinctively, ranging herself on her brother\'s\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"But about this _cotillion_?" said Edward. "What is it? I thought it had\r\nsomething to say to a lady\'s dress. I am sure it had in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. We shall have to go to school to learn what your novelty\r\nmeans."\r\n\r\n"She put me to school, I can tell you," cried Algernon, from the other\r\nend of the table. "I had to work! She is the most dreadful little\r\ntyrant, though she looks so soft."\r\n\r\n"Dancing is neglected shamefully nowadays," said Miss Matilda;\r\n"shamefully! We were taught very differently. Don\'t you remember, dear,\r\nMousheer D\'Egmont and his little violin, Martha? we were taught the\r\nminuet first on account of our curtseys----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the funny, old-fashioned thing! You _never_ curtsey nowadays; even\r\nin the Lancers it is only a bob," said Ellen, "or a bend mostly with\r\nyour head. You never see such a thing nowadays."\r\n\r\n"My dear! In the presence of your sovereign," said Miss Matilda, with\r\ndignity, "it _always_ continues necessary. There is no change in that\r\nrespect so far as I am aware, Martha, is there? You were in the habit of\r\nattending Drawing-rooms longer than I."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never any change in that!" cried Miss Martha, rising upon herself,\r\nso to speak, and erecting her head as she looked from one end of the\r\ntable to another. It was not often that they had such a triumph. They\r\nhad been Presented. They had made their curtseys to their Sovereign, as\r\nMiss Matilda said.\r\n\r\nSilence fell upon the table, only broken by the jingle of Ellen\'s\r\nbracelets, which she pushed up her arm in her mortification; and there\r\nwere so many of them that they made a considerable noise. Even she was\r\ncowed for the moment; and what was worse was, that her husband being\r\nsimple-minded, and getting a little familiar with Catherine, now turned\r\nhis looks of awe and veneration upon the Miss Vernon-Ridgways, who were\r\nso well acquainted with the court and its ways.\r\n\r\nAnd Catherine laughed.\r\n\r\n"We are all behind in that respect," she said. "I am fond of pomp and\r\nceremonial for my part. It is a pretty thing, but I like it best at a\r\ndistance. It is my fault, I have no doubt, that your wife is ignorant of\r\nDrawing-rooms, Mr. Merridew."\r\n\r\n"I always said so, Aunt Catherine," cried Ellen, who was ready to cry,\r\nin the midst of her triumph. "It is horrid for girls to have relations\r\nwith those out-of-the-way notions."\r\n\r\nCatherine only laughed; it was her habitual comment. She turned smiling\r\nto young Ashton by her side.\r\n\r\n"You ought not to dislike state," he said, in an undertone; "you who are\r\na kind of queen yourself--or, shall I say, grand duchess--in your own\r\ntown?"\r\n\r\n"A queen without any subjects," said Catherine, shaking her head. This\r\ntime she did not laugh, and there was even a little glimmer of sadness\r\nin her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Not so. I am a stranger, you know. When I go about the town, I hear of\r\nnothing but Catherine Vernon. They call you so, do you know--_tout\r\ncourt_, without miss or madam--that has a great effect upon one\'s\r\nimagination."\r\n\r\nYoung Merridew had thrust forward his head, and was listening, which\r\nperhaps was not very good manners.\r\n\r\n"It is quite true," he said eagerly. "Ellen says I am a very Redborough\r\nperson. I have been born and bred here. I can\'t remember the time when I\r\ndidn\'t look up to--her, as if she was something above the human----"\r\n\r\n"And yet you have married a Vernon!" said Catherine; but she was\r\npleased. "It is not an uncommon thing in this world," she said. "People\r\nat a distance think more kindly of one than those who are near; but this\r\nis not talk for a dinner-table. Not to interfere with Ellen\'s\r\n_cotillion_" she said, in a louder tone, "I am thinking of a party for\r\nChristmas, young people. As it is for you, you must lay your heads\r\ntogether, and decide what it is to be."\r\n\r\nThen there arose a flutter of talk, chiefly maintained by the ladies,\r\nbut in which young Merridew was appealed to by his wife; and Harry,\r\nstimulated by the same hand, and Edward, mindful of his duties, took\r\npart.\r\n\r\nCatherine and her young relative were left, as it were, alone, amid the\r\nbabble of tongues.\r\n\r\n"I cannot allow myself to look at it gravely," she said. "I laugh; it is\r\nthe best way. They all take what they can get, but their opinions, if\r\nthey were individually weighed, of Catherine Vernon, would surprise you.\r\nThey don\'t think much of me. I dare say I quite deserve it," she said,\r\nafter a pause, with another laugh. "Don\'t you think that in most cases\r\nenthusiasm is confined to those people who personally know the least of\r\nthe object of it? That\'s an awkward sentence, but never mind."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it the same thing as to say that a great man is never a hero to\r\nhis valet, or that a prophet has no honour in his own country?"\r\n\r\n"Not the last, at least," said Catherine; "for being no prophet, you\r\nyourself say I have got some honour in my country. As for the valet, I\r\ndon\'t know," she continued, "but a maid, though she appraises you at\r\nyour true value, and is convinced you are a fool in many things, still\r\nis not without a prejudice in your favour. She would like, though she\r\nmaintains her erect position, to see the rest of the world bow down\r\nbefore you. That is amusing too."\r\n\r\n"You are a philosopher," said the stranger, looking at her with a tender\r\nregard in his eyes, which made a great impression generally upon younger\r\nwomen, and moved even Catherine as with a sense of kindness--of kindness\r\ndisproportioned to their actual knowledge of each other, which is a\r\nthing which conciliates everybody, looking as if it implied a particular\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\n"Your grandfather thinks me a cynic," she said. She liked these few\r\nwords of quiet talk in the midst of the mingled voices of the others,\r\nand was grateful to the young man who looked so sympathetic. "I don\'t\r\nknow that I am a cynic, but rather than cry, I prefer to laugh. Is that\r\ncynicism?" He gave her a look which would have no doubt had a great\r\neffect upon the heart of a younger woman, and which pleased Catherine,\r\nold as she was.\r\n\r\n"I think it is true philosophy; but some of us have feelings that will\r\nnot be laughed at," said Roland. He was accustomed to make great use of\r\nhis fine eyes, and on this occasion he did so with the greatest effect.\r\nThere could not have been more tender sympathy than was in them. Could\r\nhe be really so much impressed by her character and position, and the\r\nfailure of true gratitude and kindness? Catherine Vernon would probably\r\nhave laughed at any one else of her own age who had been so easily\r\npersuaded; but it is always so much more easy to believe in the\r\nsincerity of affection which is called forth by one\'s self! Her eyes\r\nsoftened as she looked at him.\r\n\r\n"I think you and I, Roland, are going to be great friends," she said,\r\nand then turned with a slight little sigh, so small as to be almost\r\nimperceptible, to the louder voices appealing to her. "You must settle\r\nit among you," she said. "I give Edward _carte blanche_. The only thing\r\nis that it must take in everybody, all the Vernonry and our neighbours\r\nas well--a real Christmas party."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t you think, Aunt Catherine, Christmas is such a bore!" said\r\nEllen, "and family parties! Let us have strangers. Let us have people we\r\nnever set eyes on before. Christmas is so vulgar! Look at all the\r\nnewspapers with their little stories; the snow on the ground and the\r\nwanderer coming home, and so forth. I am so glad we haven\'t got a\r\nwanderer to come home."\r\n\r\n"Christmas brings a great many duties I am sure," said Miss Matilda.\r\n"Have you seen the charity flannel at Roby\'s, Catherine? It is so good,\r\nalmost good enough to wear one\'s self; and the blankets really look like\r\nblankets, not horse-cloths. Do you think that is good or bad? What you\r\ngive in charity ought to be different, don\'t you think? not to let them\r\nsuppose they have a right--"\r\n\r\n"You forget," said her sister, eager to get in a word, "that dear\r\nCatherine always gives the best."\r\n\r\n"Ah! it is well to be Catherine," said Miss Matilda, "but many people\r\nthink there should be a difference. What do you think, Mr. Harry?\r\nCatherine may consider poor people\'s feelings; but there are some who\r\nthink it is wrong to do so--for who is like Catherine? She is always\r\ngiving. She is always so considerate. Whatever she does is sure to be\r\nthe best way."\r\n\r\n"I am certain," said Algernon Merridew beaming with honest loyalty from\r\nwhere he sat by Miss Vernon\'s side, "that all Redborough is of that\r\nopinion; and Redborough ought to know."\r\n\r\n"You mean all but the people to whom I give," said Catherine, "there are\r\nnot so many of them: but they are the best judges of all, and I don\'t\r\nthink they approve."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nobody so unreasonable as the poor," said Ellen, "they are\r\nnever satisfied. You should just see them turning over the pieces from\r\nmy kitchen. Of course all the pieces are quite nice; everything is, I\r\nhope, where I am housekeeper. Oh, I know I am extravagant, I like the\r\nbest of everything; but nothing satisfies the poor. Cold potatoes now\r\nwith mayonnaise sauce are what I adore, but _they_ throw them away."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they don\'t have the mayonnaise sauce?" suggested Edward.\r\n\r\n"Oh, goodness! I hope not; that would be simply immoral," cried Miss\r\nMatilda. "But, Mr. Harry, you don\'t give your opinion, none of the\r\ngentlemen give their opinion. Perhaps that is because money is what they\r\ngive, and one shilling is just like another. You can\'t have charity\r\nshillings. Oh, but I approve of charity flannel; and some people always\r\nlike to make a difference in what they give to the poor. Poor ladies and\r\ngentlemen soon find that out, I assure you. People give you useful\r\npresents. If they want to invite you, they invite you when there\'s\r\nnobody there. They think a family dinner or high tea quite treat enough\r\nfor you. And quite right, don\'t you think, when one is in the position\r\nof a dependent? It keeps people in their proper places. Dear Catherine\r\nbuys the best flannel, better than I can afford, for her Christmas\r\ngifts. She is never like other people, always more liberal; but I should\r\nbuy the whitey-brown, that is, if I could afford any at all you know."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t attack me, Matilda," said Catherine, with a laugh, "all along the\r\nline."\r\n\r\n"Oh, attack! _you_, dear Catherine? not for the world. We all know what\r\na friend you are. What should we do without you? Whether we are in Paris\r\nfashions or our old silks, don\'t we owe it all to you?"\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause round the table which was somewhat awkward; for\r\nwhat could anybody say? The clever ones were all non-plussed, but Harry,\r\nwho was the stolid one, suddenly became audible with his round rolling\r\nbass voice. "Whoever says that, and whether it was well meant or not, I\r\nsay the same. It\'s all quite true. We owe everything to Aunt Catherine.\r\nI am always ready to say so, wherever I go."\r\n\r\n"Have we come to Christmas toasts already?" said Edward intervening. "We\r\nhad better not start that sort of thing before the time. We all know\r\nwhat we owe to Aunt Catherine."\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush," she cried, waving her hand to him as she rose. "Now we\r\nshall release your noble intellects from the necessity of coming down to\r\nour level," Catherine said as she followed carefully Miss Matilda\'s long\r\ntrain. It was very long, though it was rather flimsy, and the progress\r\nof the ladies was impeded by it. Ellen swept out lightly in advance with\r\na perfect command of hers. It was the first time she had preceded the\r\nold cousins in her dignity as a married woman, and the ring of her\r\nbracelets sounded like a little trumpet-note. As she followed them out\r\nCatherine Vernon returned to her habitual mood of amused indulgence. She\r\nhad been almost sentimental for a moment, she said to herself, beguiled\r\nby that boy\'s sympathetic eyes, which no doubt he must make great use of\r\namong the young ones. She laughed at herself not unpleasantly, to think\r\nof the confidences she had almost been beguiled into. But it pleased her\r\nto think that it was her mother\'s blood which had exercised this\r\ninfluence upon her. After all, it might be the Vernons only who were\r\nsordid and ungrateful. The old captain and his wife had always been\r\nexceptions to her sweeping judgment of human nature. And now it was\r\ntheir descendant who had touched her heart. Perhaps it was only the\r\nVernonry after all. But she was fully restored to her usual kind of\r\namusement as she watched the progress of her three companions into a\r\ntemporary but eager intimacy on the score of Ellen\'s Paris fashions\r\nwhich they were eager to examine. The bride was as eager to exhibit as\r\nthey were to see, and was so well pleased with herself as to be\r\nimpervious to the little covert blows which Miss Matilda gave under the\r\nshield of her flatteries. Catherine Vernon established herself in her\r\nown chair, and gathered her costly silken skirts about her, and took up\r\nthe newspaper, which people in the country have to read in the evening\r\ninstead of the morning; but she did not read much. She was diverted by\r\nthe talk. "Crinoline is certainly going out," said Ellen. "I heard it\r\nfrom the very best shops. Look at mine, it is quite small, hardly to be\r\ncalled crinoline at all. This is the very newest, from the Grangd\r\nMagaseens du Louvre. You see yours are twice as big," Ellen added,\r\nmaking a little pirouette to exhibit the diminished proportions of her\r\nhoops. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways looked down upon their own skirts with\r\nunquiet eyes.\r\n\r\n"The French are always so exaggerated," said Miss Matilda. "Ignorant\r\npersons have such strange ideas. They think really nice people in\r\nEngland take their fashions straight out of Paris, but that is quite a\r\nmistake. It has always to be modified by English good taste----"\r\n\r\nEllen interrupted with a little shriek. "Oh, good taste! You should just\r\nhear how they speak of that Abroad. Sometimes I could have cried. They\r\nsay no woman knows how to dress herself in England. And when I come back\r\nand see the dreadful things that are worn here---- This is pretty,"\r\nEllen continued, drawing attention to a portion of her dress. "The\r\nEmpress wore one just the same at a ball."\r\n\r\n"Dear Ellen," said Miss Matilda, "and you wear it at a little family\r\nparty! that shows the difference. I am sure it was done just to please\r\nus, to let us see what the new fashions are, in your unselfish way,\r\ndear!"\r\n\r\nAnd Catherine laughed behind the newspaper. The honours of the occasion\r\nwere to the old sisters after all.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime conversation of much more serious import, though\r\nscarcely more elevated, was going on round the table in the dining-room,\r\nwhere young Ashton had got the lead, though none of the others looked\r\nupon him with over-favourable eyes. There was no doubt that he was a\r\nvery handsome fellow, and both Harry and Edward had that instinctive\r\nsense that he was a competitor likely to put them on their mettle, which\r\nis supposed to influence the bosoms of women alone. They thought\r\n(instinctively, and each in their different ways,) that he must be a\r\ncoxcomb. They divined that he was the sort of fellow whom women admired,\r\nand scorned him for it--as women perhaps now and then indulge in a\r\nlittle sneer at a gentleman\'s beauty. But by and by he touched a chord\r\nwhich vibrated more or less in all their bosoms. He began to talk of the\r\ncity, for which country men of business have a natural reverence. He\r\nrevealed to them that he himself was on the Stock Exchange, and\r\nincidentally let fall an anecdote here and there, of the marvellous\r\nincidents, the fairy tales of commerce, that were taking place in those\r\nmagic regions every day: of men who woke in the morning with the most\r\nmoderate means at their command, and before night were millionaires.\r\nThey gathered close about him as he added anecdote to anecdote. Edward\r\nVernon was like tinder, prepared for the fire; for all his thoughts for\r\nsome time past had been directed in that way. And young Merridew was\r\nlaunching forth upon life, rather more lavishly than was consistent with\r\nhis income and prospects. Harry was the least interested of the three,\r\nbut even to him the idea of making a fortune in a few hours and being\r\nable to retire to the country to give himself up to dogs and horses,\r\ninstead of going down to the bank every morning, was a beatific\r\nsuggestion. The present writer does not pretend to be able to inform the\r\nreader exactly how it was, or in favour of which schemes, that the poet\r\nof the Stock Exchange managed to influence these rustic imaginations,\r\nbut he did so. He filled their minds with an impatience of their own\r\nslow business and its mild percentages, even when he seemed to praise\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it does feel slow work; I can\'t say. I think it is a vast deal\r\nmore wholesome. It is very hard to keep your head steady, you know, when\r\nyou feel that the chances of an hour or two may make you the richest man\r\nin England."\r\n\r\n"Or the poorest perhaps?" said Edward, more with the idea of subduing\r\nhimself than checking this flow of instruction.\r\n\r\n"Ye-es," said Ashton, indifferently, "no doubt that\'s on the cards: but\r\nit ought not to be if your broker has a head on his shoulders. About the\r\nworst that can happen, if you take proper precautions, is that you\'re no\r\nworse than you were to start with, and better luck next time. I don\'t\r\napprove the \'gain or lose it all\' system. But what will Miss Vernon say\r\nif we stay here talking shop all the evening?" he added.\r\n\r\nThere was never a more clever conclusion; it was like the exciting close\r\nof an act in the theatre, for he could not be persuaded to begin again.\r\nWhen they went reluctantly into the drawing-room, Ellen thought her\r\nAlgernon had taken too much wine; and even Edward, who never offended\r\nthe proprieties in any way, had a curious light in his eyes, and did not\r\nhear when he was spoken to. But Catherine Vernon, for her part, did not\r\nnotice anything except the filial kindness of young Roland, and the\r\nsympathy and understanding which shone in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                              CONFIDENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I would not speculate if I were you," said Ashton. "What would be the\r\ngood? You are very well off as you are. You are making your fortune\r\nsteadily, far better than if you did it by a successful _coup_. Yes,\r\nyes, I can understand that a man should desire a little more excitement,\r\nand rebel against the monotony of a quiet life, but not you, Vernon, if\r\nyou\'ll excuse my saying so. You don\'t go in for any sort of illegitimate\r\npursuit. You don\'t play or bet; you have no claim upon you that you want\r\nextraordinary means of supplying----"\r\n\r\n"How can you tell all that?" said Edward Vernon. "Do you think life\'s so\r\neasy a business that you can read it off from the surface, and make sure\r\nthat everything is as it seems?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that. Of course, I go upon appearances. I can understand\r\nthat perhaps you are tired of it----"\r\n\r\n"Tired of it!" He twirled his stick violently in his hand, hitting at\r\nthe rusty bramble branches and gorse bushes that bordered the Common as\r\nif they were his enemies. "I suppose one is apt to tire of anything that\r\nlasts and never varies," he cried with a forced laugh. "Yes, I am tired\r\nof it. Quiet life and safe business, and the hope of making a fortune,\r\nas you call it, steadily, in twenty or thirty years----Good life! Twenty\r\nor thirty years! Only think of the number of days in that, one after the\r\nother, one exactly like the other. I begin to feel as if I should\r\nwelcome anything to break the monotony--crime itself."\r\n\r\n"That means, old fellow," said Ashton, soothingly, "nerves, and nothing\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nEdward laughed out, a laugh which was not harmonious with the soft\r\ndulness of the autumnal atmosphere. "I have no nerves, nor tastes nor\r\ninclinations, nor any mind of my own," he said. "I do what it is the\r\nright thing to do. Though I am sick of it, I never show that. Nobody\r\nhere has the slightest idea that I was ever impatient or irritable or\r\nweary in my life."\r\n\r\nAshton looked at him with some curiosity, but took no further notice.\r\n"Does Miss Vernon," he said, "take any share in the business of the\r\nbank--I mean, in the work, in the regulations?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Vernon," said Edward, "takes a share in everything that is going\r\non around her, it does not matter what. She has been so long used to be\r\nat the head of everything, that she thinks it her natural place; and, as\r\nshe is old and a woman, it stands to reason----"\r\n\r\n"But she is a very intelligent woman; and she must have a great deal of\r\nexperience."\r\n\r\n"The experience of a little country town, and of steady business, as you\r\ncall it--oh, she has all that. But put your own views before her, or\r\nsuggest even the advantages of the circulation of money, quick turning\r\nover, and balance of losses and gains----"\r\n\r\n"I can understand that," said Ashton, "You don\'t appreciate the benefits\r\nof the Conservative element, Vernon. But for you and your steady-going\r\nbanks, how could we operate at all? The money must be somewhere. We\r\ncan\'t play with counters only in this game."\r\n\r\n"There was no question of counters," said Edward; "we have the money in\r\nour hands. It seems to me that you and I should change places: you to do\r\nthe steady business here, and please Aunt Catherine--who has taken a\r\ngreat fancy to you, you must know--I, to watch the tide, how it comes\r\nand how it goes."\r\n\r\n"There might be worse arrangements," Ashton said with a laugh: but he\r\nadded quickly, meeting a keen, sudden glance from Edward, "if you could\r\ntransfer to me your training, and I mine to you. I am counted rather\r\nbold sometimes, you must know," he added, after a moment, returning that\r\nlook. They talked with great apparent readiness and openness, but with a\r\ncurious dread of mutual observation going on under the current of their\r\ntalk all the time.\r\n\r\n"So much the better," said Edward, "so long as you know when to hold\r\nin."\r\n\r\nThey were going along the side of the Common between the Grange and the\r\nVernonry. It was Sunday afternoon--a dull day, the sky hanging low, the\r\ngreen parts of the Common very green, glistening with wetness, the gorse\r\nand brushwood very brown and faded. Nobody was about on this day of\r\nleisure. Even the slow country cart, the farmer\'s shandry, the\r\noccasional roll of a carriage, was absent from the silent road. There\r\nwere no nursemaids and children from Redborough picking their way along\r\nthe side path. Captain Morgan, feeling his rheumatism, had retired to\r\nhis chimney corner; the young men had it all to themselves. Ashton had\r\nbeen lunching at the Grange. He was on the eve of going back to town to\r\nbusiness, from which he declared he had been absent far too long. The\r\nobject of his visit was not very clear to any one: he had left his\r\ngrandparents for years without showing so much interest in them. But,\r\nwhatever his motive had been, his expedition had not been without fruit.\r\nHe had discovered a new and wealthy vein well worth working, and lit a\r\nfire which, no doubt, would light up still further illuminations, in\r\nsome inflammable spirits. No one had received him more warmly than\r\nEdward Vernon, but he was less easy to make out than the others. He was\r\nless simple; his life did not correspond with the betrayals of his\r\nconversation, whereas neither Harry Vernon nor his brother-in-law, had\r\nanything to betray. What was evident, at least, was that Catherine\r\nVernon smiled upon the acquaintance which had been formed so rapidly\r\nbetween her nephew and the stranger. She called Edward "your cousin" to\r\nAshton, then laughed and apologised, explaining that where there were so\r\nmany cousins it was difficult to remember that her relation was not\r\nEdward\'s too. When Ashton replied, "There is connection enough to\r\njustify the name, if it is agreeable to Vernon," there could be no doubt\r\nthat it was, at least, agreeable to her. She smiled upon them from her\r\nwindow as they went out together, waving her hand. And no foolish mother\r\ncould have been more unaware than Catherine, that the knowledge that she\r\nwas there, watching with tender looks of affection the two figures as\r\nthey went along, was to Edward irksome beyond expression. He felt no\r\ncharm of love in the look, but substituted suspicion for tenderness, and\r\nbelieved that she was watching them, keeping them in sight as far as her\r\neyes could carry, to spy out all they did, and make for herself an\r\nexplanation of every gesture. He would not even have twirled his stick\r\nand cut down the brambles but in a momentary fit of forgetfulness. When\r\nthey got beyond her range, he breathed more freely, but, even then, was\r\nnot without a recollection that she had her opera-glasses at hand, and\r\nmight, through them, be watching his demeanour still.\r\n\r\n"Let us go this way," he said, turning into the road, which slanted away\r\non the nearer side of the Vernonry, leading out into the open country\r\nand brown fields.\r\n\r\nAshton hesitated a moment. "I am not sure that I am not expected at\r\nhome. It is my last day," he said.\r\n\r\n"Home is a kind of irons," said Edward, "hand-cuffs, ankle chains. One\r\nis always like an unhappy cockatoo on a perch. Any little attempt at\r\nflight is always pulled back."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that is my experience. My old people are very indulgent;\r\nbut then, I am a mere visitor. Home does not mean much to me," said\r\nAshton. If he had been in the presence of any lady he would have sighed\r\nas he said this--being in absolute freedom with one of his own kind he\r\nsmiled, and it was Edward who sighed.\r\n\r\n"There is such a thing as having too much of it," he said. "What I\r\nsuffer from is want of air. Don\'t you perceive it? There is no\r\natmosphere; every breath has been breathed over and over again. We want\r\nventilation. We welcome every horror with delight in consequence--a\r\nmurder--or even a big bankruptcy. I suppose that is why bankruptcies are\r\nso common," he added, as if struck with the idea. "A man requires a\r\ngreat deal of original impulse before he will go the length of murder.\r\nThe other has a milder but similar attraction; you ruin other people,\r\nwhich shakes them up, and gives a change of air."\r\n\r\n"Ill-omened words," said Ashton, laughing, and throwing out the\r\nfore-finger and little finger of his right hand with a play at\r\nsuperstition. "Ugly at all times, but especially when we are talking of\r\nbusiness and the Stock Exchange."\r\n\r\n"Are you aware," said Edward, sinking his voice, "that our predecessor,\r\nbefore Aunt Catherine, did something of the kind?"\r\n\r\n"Who was he?"\r\n\r\n"A certain John Vernon. His wife lives yonder, with the rest of Aunt\r\nCatherine\'s dependents in that red house. He found it too much for him;\r\nbut it was a poor sort of a flash in the pan, and hurt nobody but\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"You would like to do more than that," said Ashton, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nBut in Edward\'s face there was no jest.\r\n\r\n"I should like," he said, "if I broke down, to carry the whole concern\r\nalong with me. I should like to pull it down about their ears as Samson\r\npulled the temple, you know, upon his persecutors."\r\n\r\n"Vernon," said Roland, "do you know that you are very rash, opening out\r\nlike this to me? Don\'t you see it is quite possible I might betray you?\r\nI have no right to preach, but surely you can\'t have any reason to be so\r\nbitter. You seem tremendously well off, I can tell you, to a friendless\r\nfellow like me."\r\n\r\n"I am very well off," said Edward, with a smile; "no man was ever\r\nbetter. I came out of a struggling family where I was to have gone to\r\nthe colonies or something. My next brother got that chance, and here I\r\nam. John Vernon, so far as I can hear, was an extravagant fool. I have\r\nnot the least sympathy with that. Money\'s a great power, but as for fine\r\nhouses, or fine furniture, or show or dash as they call it----"\r\n\r\n"I told you," said Ashton, "you have no vice."\r\n\r\nEdward gave him a dark, suspicious look.\r\n\r\n"I have even a contempt for it," he said.\r\n\r\n"There are plenty of men who have that--a horror even; and yet can\'t do\r\nwithout the excitement."\r\n\r\n"I prefer your sort of excitement. John Vernon, as I say, was a fool. He\r\nran away, poor wretch, and Catherine stepped in, and re-made everything,\r\nand covered him with contempt."\r\n\r\n"He is the father (is he dead?) of the--young lady--who is such a\r\nfavourite with my grandfather?"\r\n\r\n"Hester? Oh, you know her, do you? One of Aunt Catherine\'s pensioners in\r\nthe Vernonry, as she calls it."\r\n\r\n"It is a little hard upon them to be called dependents; my old people\r\nlive there. They have their own little income to live upon. Miss Vernon\r\ngives them their house, I believe, which is very kind, but not enough to\r\njustify the name of pensioners."\r\n\r\n"That is our way here," said Edward laughing. "We are very ready to\r\ngive, but we like to take the good of it. It is not respectful to call\r\nthe place the Vernonry, but we do it. We are delighted to be kind; the\r\nmore you will take from us, the better we will like you. We even--rather\r\nlike you to be ungrateful. It satisfies our theory."\r\n\r\n"Vernon, all that seems to me to be diabolical, you know, I wish you\r\nwouldn\'t. Miss Hester is a little of your way of thinking, I fear. She\r\nmakes it amusing though. There are parties, it appears, where she stands\r\nall night in a corner, or looks at photographs."\r\n\r\n"She says that, does she?" said Edward. His smile had not been a\r\npleasant one, but now it disappeared from his face. "And I suppose she\r\ntells you that I never go near her? I have to look after the old ladies\r\nand take them to supper. I have the honour of standing in the position\r\nof master of the house."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that she blames any one," said Ashton indifferently. "It\r\nis more fun than anger. Talk of want of air, Vernon; that poor child\r\nwants air if you please. She is as full of spirit and life as any one I\r\never saw. She would like to do something."\r\n\r\n"Something! What kind of something? Go on the stage--or what?"\r\n\r\n"I have never heard of the stage or anything of the kind. She wants\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Excitement!" Edward said, with an impatient gleam in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"She is like you then," said Ashton, trying to laugh, but not with much\r\ncordiality, for he felt himself growing angry in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nThere was excitement enough now in Edward Vernon\'s face. It grew dark\r\nwith passion and intolerance.\r\n\r\n"A woman is altogether different," he said; then subduing himself with a\r\nchange in his voice from rage to scorn, "she will soon have it in her\r\npower to change all that. Don\'t you know she is going to marry Harry\r\nVernon?--an excellent match for her--money and little brains--whereas\r\nshe has much brains and little money, the very thing in marriage," he\r\nconcluded, with a harsh laugh.\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" said Ashton.\r\n\r\nHe had been listening quite at his ease, turning his face towards his\r\ncompanion, and it was a satisfaction to Edward to see that the\r\nstranger\'s countenance clouded over. He was astonished, and Edward could\r\nnot help hoping more than astonished--for being sore and bitter himself\r\nhe liked to see another feel the sting.\r\n\r\n"That\'s well," Roland said after a moment, "if she likes it. I should\r\nnot have thought--but a week\'s acquaintance does not show you much of a\r\ncharacter. I am glad to hear it," he said, after a pause, "if she likes\r\nit," which was but a dubious sort of satisfaction after all.\r\n\r\nEdward looked at him again with an expression of gratified feeling. He\r\nwas glad to have given his new friend a little friendly stab. It pleased\r\nhim to see Roland wince. When one is very uneasy one\'s self, that is\r\nalways a little consolation. He looked at him and enjoyed it, then\r\nturned away from the subject which had given him this momentary\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"Let us return to our muttons," he said. "Tell me what you think of\r\nthese papers? I put them into my pocket to show you. Now that we are\r\nfairly out of sight"--then he turned back to glance along the still damp\r\nroad, upon which there was not a single shadow but their own--"and\r\nnobody can spy upon us--for I distrust windows--we may think of business\r\na little," the young man said.\r\n\r\nAshton looked at him as he took the papers with a glance as suspicious\r\nas his own. They had grown into a sort of sudden intimacy in a single\r\nnight. Edward had been exactly in the state of mind to which Roland\'s\r\nrevelation of chances and possibilities was as flame to tinder. To have\r\nhis impatient desires and longings made practical was everything to him,\r\nand the prudence and business instinct left in him which made him\r\nhesitate to make the plunge by himself without skilled guidance, endowed\r\nthe newcomer with an importance which nothing else could have given him.\r\nHe was at home in those regions which were so entrancing and exciting,\r\nyet strange to Edward. These communications had brought them to\r\nsomething like confidential friendship, and yet they did not know each\r\nother, and in many things were mutually antipathetic, repelling, rather\r\nthan attracting each other. This interview, though it was to seal the\r\nconnection between them, made their mutual want of sympathy more\r\napparent. Edward had showed the worst side of himself, and knew it. He\r\nfelt even that his self-betrayal had been so great as to put him almost\r\nin his companion\'s power, while at the same time Ashton had\r\nimpertinently interposed in the family affairs (a point upon which\r\nEdward was as susceptible as any one) by what he had permitted himself\r\nto say about Hester. Ashton, on the other hand, whose temper in a way\r\nwas generous and easy, regarded the fortunate but ungrateful possessor\r\nof Catherine Vernon\'s sympathies with an indignant astonishment. To have\r\nbeen so taken up by such a woman, to have her affection, her confidence,\r\nher unbounded approbation and trust, and to so repay her! It was\r\nincredible, and the fellow was---- Should he fling up all his pretence at\r\nsympathy with this cub, and go off at once, rather abandoning the\r\npossible advantage than consenting to ally himself with such a being?\r\nThis was the point at which they stood for a moment; but beside the pull\r\nof mutual interest how were they ever to explain the sudden breach,\r\nshould they follow their mutual inclinations and make one? It would be\r\nnecessary to say something, and what could be said? and then there lay\r\nbefore Edward a world of fabulous gain, of sudden wealth, of a hundred\r\nexcitements to which Roland seemed to hold the key; and before Roland\r\nthe consciousness that not only the advantage of having Edward, but a\r\nwhole population of eager country people ready to put their money into\r\nhis hands, and give him such power of immediate action as he had\r\nscarcely dreamt of, depended upon his self-restraint. Accordingly the\r\nsole evidence of their absolute distrust and dislike of each other, was\r\nthis mutual look, exchanged just before they entered upon the closest\r\nrelations of mutual aid.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious scene for such a beginning. The solitude of the country\r\nroad was complete; there was no one to interrupt them. Although they\r\nwere in the freedom of the open air, and subject to be overtaken by any\r\npasser-by, yet the Sunday stillness was so intense that they might have\r\nbeen in the most secret retirement on earth. Had they been seated\r\ntogether in Edward\'s room at home, a hundred disturbances were possible.\r\nServants can never be shut out; if it is only to mend the fire they will\r\nappear in the middle of the most private conference. And Catherine\r\nherself, all unconscious that her presence was disagreeable, might have\r\ncome to the door to summon them, or perhaps even to bring them, with her\r\nown kind hands, the cups of tea which in his heart Edward loathed as one\r\nof the signs of his slavery. They were the drink of bondage--those poor\r\ncups that never inebriate. He hated even the fragrance of them--the\r\nlittle steams ascending. Thank Heaven no one could bring him tea out\r\nupon the high road! The chill outer air, the faint scent of mossy damp\r\nand decay, the dim atmosphere without a sparkle in it, the absolute\r\nquiet, would have better suited confidences of a different description.\r\nBut if business is not sentimental it is at least so urgent and\r\nengrossing, that it becomes indifferent to circumstances. The do-nothing\r\ncalm of the Sunday closed curiously around the group; their rustling\r\npapers and eager countenances brought the strangest interruption of\r\nrestless life into the almost dead and blank quiet. The season, the\r\nweather, the hour, the brown quiescent fields in which for the only\r\nmoment of the year no mystery of growth was going on, but only a silent\r\nwaiting for the seeds and the spring; this day of leisure when\r\neverything was at rest, all the surrounding circumstances united to\r\nthrow into full relief the strange centre to the landscape--the two\r\nfigures which brought a sharp interest of life into this still-breathing\r\natmosphere, and waiting stagnation, and Sunday calm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                                 ROLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoland Ashton had been in little doubt as to his own motives when he\r\ncame after so many years\' indifference to "look up" his old\r\ngrandparents, and take up late, yet not too late, the traditions of\r\nfilial duty. These traditions, indeed, had no existence for this young\r\nman. His mother, the victim of a dissipated and hopeless spendthrift,\r\nhad died when her children were young, and her father and mother had\r\nstood aloof from all but the earliest years of the handful of boys and\r\ngirls she left behind. The children scrambled up somehow, and, as is not\r\nunusual among children, whom the squalor of a parent\'s vice has\r\ndisgusted from their earliest consciousness, succeeded in doing well;\r\nthe girls making much better marriages than could have been hoped for;\r\nthe boys, flung into the world on their own account at a very early age,\r\nfinding the means of maintaining themselves, and even pushing forward to\r\na position as good as that which their father had lost. That father had\r\nhappily died and gone out of all power to injure them, a number of years\r\nbefore, and it was only on a rare visit to the elder sister, who alone\r\nknew much about the family connections, that Roland had learned\r\nsomething of the state of affairs at Redborough.\r\n\r\nElinor was old enough to remember the time when the grandfather and\r\ngrandmother had taken charge of the little weeping band of babies in\r\ntheir far-off helpless days, and she had kept up a certain\r\ncorrespondence with them, when, half ruined by that effort, they were\r\nsaved by Catherine Vernon, the mysterious, wealthy cousin, of whose name\r\neverybody in the family had heard. Elinor remembered so many details\r\nwhen her memory was jogged, that it occurred to Roland that it would be\r\na very good thing to go down to Redborough and pay his grandfather a\r\nvisit. Catherine Vernon might turn out to be worth cultivating. She had\r\nstepped in to save old Captain Morgan and his wife from the consequences\r\nof their own liberality to their daughter\'s children. She had a little\r\ncolony of pensioners about her, Elinor was informed. She was very rich,\r\nso rich that she did not know what to do with her money. There was a\r\nswarm of Vernons round her, eating her up.\r\n\r\n"We are her nearest relations on her mother\'s side," Elinor had said. "I\r\ndo not see why we should not have our chance too. Don\'t forget us,\r\nRoland, if you make any way; and you ought to do something; for you have\r\nthe right way with women," his sister said, with some admiration and a\r\nlittle doubt. Her faith was that he was sure to succeed, her doubt\r\nwhether his success would be of use to anybody but himself; but however\r\nit might turn out, it was always better that one of the Ashtons should\r\nbenefit by Catherine Vernon\'s colossal fortune, than that it should all\r\ngo into the hands of the other people.\r\n\r\nRoland himself was well aware that he had the right way with women. This\r\nwas not the result of art and calculation, but was pure nature. The\r\nyoung man was bent upon his own ends, without much consideration, in\r\ngreat matters, of other people. But in small matters he was very\r\nconsiderate, and had a delightful way of deferring to the comfort of\r\nthose about him. And he had the power of looking interested, and even of\r\nfeeling interested in everybody he addressed. And he had fine eyes! What\r\nmore is needed to enable a young man to make his way with women? He was\r\nvery popular; he might have married well had he chosen to take that\r\nstep; indeed, the chief thing against him was, that he had wavered too\r\nlong more than once, before he could make up his mind to hurt the\r\nfeelings of a sensitive girl by not asking her to marry him. It was not,\r\nto be sure, his fault, if they thought that was his meaning. A prudent\r\ngirl will never allow herself to think so until she is asked\r\npoint-blank; and when you came to investigate each case, there really\r\nwas nothing against Roland. He had made himself agreeable, but then,\r\nthat was his way. He could not help making himself agreeable. The very\r\ntone of his voice changed when he spoke to any woman who pleased him,\r\nand he was very catholic in his tastes. Most women pleased him if they\r\nhad good looks, or even the remains of good looks; or if they were\r\nclever; or even if they were _nice_; and he was pleasant to all, old and\r\nyoung. The quality was not without its dangers; but it had great\r\nadvantages. He came to Redborough fully determined to make the conquest\r\nof Catherine Vernon, whom, save that she was rich and benevolent, he\r\nknew very little about. Very rich (according to Elinor), rather\r\nfoolishly benevolent, old--a young man who has the right way with women\r\ncould scarcely be indifferent to such a description. He determined to\r\nfind an opportunity in the dull time of the year, when business was not\r\ntoo exacting, to pay some of the long over-due respect and gratitude\r\nwhich he owed to his grandfather. Captain Morgan professed to have cut\r\nhimself clear of all his relationships, but it was true that twenty\r\nyears before, he had spent everything he had, and deprived himself of\r\nevery comfort, he and his wife, for the maintenance of his daughter\'s\r\nchildren. He had never got any return for this from the children, who\r\nknew very little about him. And it was full time that Roland should come\r\nwith his power of making himself agreeable to pay the family debt--no\r\nharm if he did something for the family fortunes by the way.\r\n\r\nAnd it has been seen that the young man fully proved, and at once, the\r\njustice of his sister\'s description of him. His grandmother, to be sure,\r\nwas vanquished by his very name, by a resemblance which she found out in\r\nhis mouth and eyelids to his mother, and by the old love which had never\r\nbeen extinguished, and could not be extinguished in her motherly old\r\nbosom. But Hester, by a mere chance encounter in the fire-light, without\r\neven seeing him, without knowing his name, had been moved to a degree of\r\ninterest such as she was not conscious of having ever felt before. And\r\nCatherine Vernon had yielded at once, and without a struggle, to his\r\ninfluence. This was delightful enough, but after all it did not come to\r\nvery much, for Roland found himself plunged into the midst of a society\r\nupon which he had not at all reckoned. The community at the Vernonry was\r\nsimple; he was prepared for that, and understood it. But when he went to\r\nthe Grange and made acquaintance with the closer circle there, the young\r\nmen to whom Catherine had made over the bank and all its interests, and\r\nespecially Edward, who was established as if he had been her son, in her\r\nhouse, a change came over Roland\'s plans and anticipations. He had a\r\nstrong desire for his own advantage, and inclination to follow that\r\nwherever it might lead him; but he was not malignant in his selfishness.\r\nHe had no wish to interfere, unless it proved to be absolutely\r\nnecessary, with another man\'s career, or to injure his fellow-creatures\r\nin promoting his own interest. And it cannot be denied that he felt a\r\nshock of disappointment which, as he found when he reasoned with himself\r\non the subject, was somewhat unreasonable. How could he expect the field\r\nto be clear for him, and the rich, childless woman of fortune left at\r\nhis mercy? As if there were not crowds of other people in the world who\r\nhad a quick eye for their own advantage, and clear sight to see who was\r\nlikely to serve it! But these discoveries put him out. They made his\r\nmission purposeless. They reduced it to the mere visit to his\r\ngrandfather, which he had called it, but which he by no means intended\r\nit solely to be.\r\n\r\nAfter this first shock of disappointment, however, Roland began to find\r\nhimself at once amused and interested by the new community, into the\r\nmidst of which he had dropped. The inmates of the Vernonry were all\r\nsimple enough. To be very poor and obliged to accept favours from a rich\r\nrelative, yet never to be able to escape the sense of humiliation, and a\r\ngrudge against those who are better off--that is indeed too general: and\r\nit is even a conventional necessity of the imagination, that there\r\nshould be bickerings and private little spites among neighbours so\r\nclosely thrown together. Ashton did not see much of the Miss\r\nVernon-Ridgways, who had refused to know him at Catherine\'s house, nor\r\nof their kindred spirit Mr. Mildmay Vernon; but he could imagine them,\r\nand did so easily. Nor was the gentle little widow, who was now on one\r\nside now on the other, according as the last speaker moved her, or the\r\nyoung heroine her daughter, difficult to realise. But Catherine, and the\r\ncloser group of her relations, puzzled him more. That she should gauge\r\nthem all so exactly, yet go on with them, pouring kindness upon their\r\nungrateful heads with a sort of amusement at their ingratitude, almost a\r\nmalicious pleasure in it, surprised him less than that among all who\r\nsurrounded her there was no one who gave to her a real and faithful\r\ndevotion. And her faith in Edward, whose impatience of her bonds was the\r\ngreatest of all, seemed to Roland in his spectatorship so pitiful, that\r\nhe could scarcely help crying out against it to earth and heaven. He was\r\nsorry for her all the more that she was so little sorry for herself, and\r\nit seemed to him that of all her surroundings he was the only one who\r\nwas sorry for Catherine. Even his old people as he called them, did not\r\nfathom that curse of her loneliness. They thought with everybody else\r\nthat Edward was a true son to her, studying her wishes, and thinking of\r\nnothing so much as how to please her. It appalled him when he thought of\r\nthe snarl on Edward\'s lips, the profound discontent in his soul. It\r\nwould be cruel above all things to warn her--she who felt herself so\r\nclear-sighted--of the deception she was the victim of; and yet what\r\ncould it come to but unhappiness? Roland felt himself overpowered and\r\nalmost overawed by this combination. Nobody but he, it seemed, had\r\ndivined it. He had walked back with Edward to the Grange after their\r\nlong talk and consultation, and had taken off his hat with a smile of\r\nkindness to the indistinct figure still seated in the window, which\r\nEdward recognised with a secret grimace. To see her seated there looking\r\nout for their return, was a pleasure to the more genial spirit. It would\r\nhave pleased him to feel that there was some one who would look out for\r\nhis coming, who would watch him like this, with tenderness as he went\r\naway. But then he had no experience of the kind in his own person, and\r\nEdward perhaps had too much of it. While the one went indoors with a\r\nbitter sense that he could go nowhere without being watched, the other\r\nturned away with a pleasant look back, waving his hand to Catherine\r\nVernon in the window. She was not likely to adopt him, but she was kind\r\nto him, a pleasant, handsome old woman, and a most creditable relative.\r\nHe was glad he had come if it were for that and no more. There were\r\nother reasons too why Roland should be glad he had come. He had found a\r\nnew client, nay, a group of new clients, by whose means he could extend\r\nhis business and his prospects--solid people with real money to risk,\r\nnot men of straw. Though he was full of aspirations they were all of a\r\npractical kind. He meant to make his fortune; he meant to do the very\r\nbest for his customers who trusted him as well as for himself, and his\r\nspirits rose when he thought what a power of extensive and successful\r\noperation would be given him by the money of all these new people who\r\nwere so eager to face the risks of speculation. They should not suffer\r\nby it; their confidence in him should be repaid, and not only his, but\r\ntheir fortunes would be made. The certainty of this went to his head a\r\nlittle, like wine. It had been well for him to come. It had been the\r\nmost important step he had ever taken in his life. It was not what he\r\nhad hoped for, and yet it was the thing above all others that he wanted,\r\na new start for him in the world, and probably the turning-point of his\r\nlife. Other matters were small in comparison with this, and approbation\r\nor disappointment has little to do with a new customer in any branch of\r\nbusiness. As for other interests he might have taken up on the way, the\r\nimportance of them was nothing. Hester was a pretty girl, and it was\r\nnatural to him to have an occupation of that sort in hand; but to\r\nsuppose that he was sufficiently interested to allow any thought of her\r\nto beguile him from matters so much more serious, would have been vain\r\nindeed. He felt just such a momentary touch of pique in hearing that she\r\nwas going to be married, as a woman-beauty does when she hears of any\r\nconquests but her own. If she had seen him (Roland) first, she would not\r\nhave been, he felt, so easily won; but he laughed at himself for the\r\nthought, as perhaps the woman-beauty would scarcely have been moved to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                                WARNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I think, if you will let me, I will send down Emma for a little fresh\r\nair and to make your acquaintance, grandmother. She is rather of the\r\nbutterfly order of girls, but there is no harm in her. And as it is\r\nlikely that I shall have a good deal to do with the Vernons----"\r\n\r\n"What do you want with the Vernons? Why should you have a good deal to\r\ndo with them?" asked Captain Morgan, hastily, and it must be added\r\nrather testily, for the old man\'s usually placid humour had been\r\ndisturbed of late.\r\n\r\n"In the most legitimate way," said Ashton. "You can\'t wish me, now that\r\nI am just launched in business, to shut my eyes to my own advantage. It\r\nwill be for their advantage too. They are going to be customers of mine.\r\nWhen you have a man\'s money to invest you have a good deal to do with\r\nhim. I shall have to come and go in all likelihood often."\r\n\r\n"Your customers--and their money to invest--what do mean by that? I hope\r\nyou haven\'t taken advantage of my relationship with Catherine Vernon to\r\ndraw in those boys of hers----"\r\n\r\n"Grandfather," said Roland, with an _air digne_ which it was impossible\r\nnot to respect, "if you think a little you will see how injurious your\r\nwords are. I cannot for a moment suppose you mean them. Catherine\r\nVernon\'s boys, as you call them, are nearly as old, and I suppose as\r\ncapable of judging what is for their advantage, as I am. If they choose\r\nto entrust me with their business, is there any reason why I should\r\nrefuse it? I am glad to get everything I can."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, there is a reason," said Captain Morgan. "I know what\r\nspeculation is. I know what happens when a hot-headed young fellow gets\r\na little bit of success, and the gambling fever gets into his veins.\r\nEdward Vernon is just the sort of fellow to fall a victim. He is a\r\nmorose, ill-tempered, bilious being----"\r\n\r\n"Stop," said Roland; "have a little consideration, sir. There is no\r\nquestion of any victim."\r\n\r\n"You are just a monomaniac, Rowley, my old man," said Mrs. Morgan.\r\n\r\n"I know everything you can say," said the old captain. "All that jargon\r\nabout watching the market, and keeping a cool head, and running no\r\nunnecessary risks--I know it all. You think you can turn over your\r\nmoney, as you call it, always to your advantage, and keep risk at arm\'s\r\nlength."\r\n\r\n"I do not say so much as that; but risk may be reduced to a minimum, and\r\nprofit be the rule, when one gives one\'s mind to it--which it is my\r\nbusiness to do."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know everything you can say," said the old man. "Give your mind\r\nto it! Give your mind to an honest trade, that\'s my advice to you. What\r\nis it at the best but making money out of the follies of your\r\nfellow-creatures? They take a panic and you buy from them, to their\r\ncertain loss, and then they take a freak of enthusiasm and you sell to\r\nthem, to their certain loss. Somebody must always lose in order that you\r\nshould gain. It is a devilish trade--I said so when I heard you had gone\r\ninto it; but for God\'s sake, Roland Ashton, keep that for the outside\r\nworld, and don\'t bring ruin and misery here."\r\n\r\n"What can I say?" said the young man. He rose up from the table where he\r\nhad been taking his last meal with the old people. He kept his temper\r\nbeautifully, Mrs. Morgan thought, with great pride in him. He grew pale\r\nand a little excited, as was natural, but never forgot his respect for\r\nhis grandfather, who, besides that venerable relationship, was an old\r\nman. "What can I say? To tell you that I consider my profession an\r\nhonourable one would be superfluous, for you can\'t imagine I should have\r\ntaken it up had I thought otherwise."\r\n\r\n"Rowley, my old man," said Mrs. Morgan, "you are just as hot-headed as\r\nwhen you were a boy. But, Roland, you must remember that we have\r\nsuffered from it; and everybody says when you begin to gamble in\r\nbusiness, it is worse than any other kind of gambling."\r\n\r\n"When you begin; but there is no need ever to begin, that I can see."\r\n\r\n"And then, my dear--I am not taking up your grandfather\'s view, but just\r\ntelling you what he means--then, my dear, Catherine Vernon has been very\r\nkind to him and me. She is fond of us, I really believe. She trusts us,\r\nwhich to her great hurt, poor thing, she does to few----"\r\n\r\n"Catherine Vernon is a noble character. She has a fine nature. She has a\r\nscorn of meanness and everything that is little----"\r\n\r\nThe old lady shook her head, "That is true," she said; "but it is her\r\nmisfortune, poor thing, that she gets her amusement out of all that, and\r\nshe believes in few. You must not, Roland," she said, laying her hand\r\nupon his arm, "you must not, my dear lad--Oh, listen to what my old man\r\nsays! You must not be the means of leading into imprudence or danger any\r\none she is fond of--she that has been so kind to him and to me!"\r\n\r\nThe old hand was heavy on his arm, bending him down towards her with an\r\nimperative clasp, and this sudden appeal was so unexpected from the\r\nplacid old woman, who seemed to have outgrown all impassioned feeling\r\nand lived only to soothe and reconcile opposing influences, that both\r\nthe young man and the old were impressed by it. Roland Ashton stooped,\r\nand kissed his grandmother\'s forehead. He had a great power in him of\r\nresponse to every call of emotion.\r\n\r\n"Dear old mother," he said, "if I were a villain and meant harm, I don\'t\r\nsee how I could carry on with it after that. But I want you to believe\r\nthat I am not a villain," he said, with a half-laugh of feeling.\r\n\r\nOld Captain Morgan was so touched by the scene that in the weakness of\r\nold age and the unexpectedness of this interposition the tears stood in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n"When you do put your shoulder to the wheel, Mary," he said, with a\r\nhalf-laugh too, and holding out a hand to Roland, with whom for the\r\nfirst time he found himself in perfect sympathy, "you do it like a hero.\r\nI\'ll add nothing to what she has said, my boy. Even at the risk of\r\nlosing a profit, or failing in a stroke of business, respect the house\r\nthat has sheltered your family. That\'s what we both say."\r\n\r\n"And I have answered, sir," said Roland, "that even if I were bent on\r\nmischief I could not persist after such an appeal--and I am not bent on\r\nmischief," he added, this time with a smile; and so fell into easy\r\nconversation about his sister, and the good it would do her to pay the\r\nold people a visit. "I am out all day, and she is left to herself. It is\r\ndull for her in a little house at Kilburn, all alone--though she says\r\nshe likes it," he went on, glad, as indeed they all were, to get down to\r\na milder level of conversation.\r\n\r\nThe old captain had not taken kindly to the idea of having Emma; but\r\nafter the moment of sympathetic emotion which they had all passed\r\nthrough, there was no rejecting so very reasonable a petition. And on\r\nthe whole, looking back upon it, now that the young man\'s portmanteau\r\nstood packed in the hall, and he himself was on the eve of departure,\r\neven the captain could not deny that there had been on the whole more\r\npleasure in Roland\'s visit than he had at all expected. However he might\r\nmodify the account of his own sensations, it had certainly been\r\nagreeable to meet a young fellow of his own blood, his descendant, a man\r\namong the many women with whom he was surrounded, and one who, even when\r\nthey disagreed, could support his opinions, and was at least\r\nintelligent, whatever else. He had received him with unfeigned\r\nreluctance, almost forgetting who his mother was in bitter and strong\r\nrealisation that he was his father\'s son and bore his father\'s name. But\r\npersonal encounter had so softened everything, that though Roland\r\nactually resembled his objectionable father, the captain parted from him\r\nwith regret. And, after all, why should not Emma come? She was a girl,\r\nwhich in itself softened everything (notwithstanding that the captain\r\nhad recognised as a distinct element in Roland\'s favour that he was a\r\nman, and so a most desirable interruption to the flood of womankind--but\r\nnobody is bound to be consistent in these matters). It was good of her\r\nbrother, as soon as he was afloat in the world, to take upon himself the\r\nresponsibility of providing for Emma, and on the whole the captain,\r\nalways ready to be kind, saw no reason for refusing to be kind to this\r\nlonely girl because she was of his own flesh and blood. He drew much\r\ncloser to his grandson during these last few hours than he had done yet.\r\nHe went out with him to make his adieux to Mrs. John and her daughter.\r\nAnd Hester came forward to give them her hand with that little\r\nenlargement about the eyes, which was a sure sign of some emotion in her\r\nmind. She had seen a great deal of Roland, and his going away gave her a\r\npang which she scarcely explained to herself. It was so much life\r\nsubtracted from the scanty circle. She too, like Edward, felt that she\r\nwanted air, and the departure of one who had brought so much that was\r\nnew into her restricted existence was a loss--that was all. She had\r\nassured herself so half-a-dozen times this morning--therefore no doubt\r\nit was true. As for Roland, it was not in him to part from such a girl\r\nwithout an attempt at least to intensify this effect. He drew her\r\ntowards the window, apart from the others, to watch, as he said, for the\r\ncoming of the slow old fly from Redborough which was to convey him away.\r\n\r\n"My sister is coming," he said, "and I hope you will be friends. I will\r\ninstruct her to bring in my name on every possible occasion, that you\r\nmay not altogether forget me."\r\n\r\n"There is no likelihood that we shall forget you; we see so few people\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"And you call that a consolatory reason! I shall see thousands of\r\npeople, but I shall not forget _you_." It was Roland\'s way to use no\r\nname. He said _you_ as if there was nobody but yourself who owned that\r\npronoun, with an inference that in thinking of the woman before him,\r\nwhoever she might be, he, in his heart, identified her from all women.\r\n\r\nHester was embarrassed by his eyes and his tone, but not displeased. He\r\nhad pleased her from the first. There is a soft and genial interest\r\nexcited in the breasts of women by such a man, at which everybody smiles\r\nand which few acknowledge, yet which is not the less dangerous for that.\r\nIt rouses a prepossession in his favour, whatever may come of it\r\nafterwards; and he had done his best to fill up all his spare moments,\r\nwhen he was not doing something else, in Hester\'s company. It would be\r\nvain to say that this homage had not been sweet, and it had been\r\nentertaining, which is so great a matter. It had opened out a new world\r\nto her, and expanded all her horizon. With his going all these new\r\noutlets into life would be closed again. She felt a certain terror of\r\nthe place without Roland. He had imported into the air an excitement, an\r\nexpectation. The prospect of seeing him was a prospect full of novelty\r\nand interest, and even when he did not come, there had always been that\r\nexpectation to brighten the dimness. Now there could be no expectation,\r\nnot even a disappointment; and Hester\'s eyes were large, and had a\r\nclearness of emotion in them. She might have cried--indeed, it seemed\r\nvery likely that she had cried at the thought of his going away, and\r\nwould cry again.\r\n\r\n"Though I don\'t know," he added, leaning against the recess of the\r\nwindow, and so shutting her in where she stood looking out, "why I\r\nshould leave so many thoughts here, for I don\'t suppose they will do me\r\nany good. They tell me that your mind will be too fully, and, alas, too\r\npleasantly occupied. Yes, I say alas! and alas again! I am not glad you\r\nwill be so pleasantly occupied. I had rather you were dull a little,\r\nthat you might have time now and then to remember me."\r\n\r\n"You are talking a great deal of nonsense, Mr. Ashton--but that is your\r\nway. And how am I to be so pleasantly occupied? I am glad to hear it,\r\nbut I certainly did not know. What is going to happen?"\r\n\r\n"Is this hypocrisy, or is it kindness to spare me? Or is it----? They\r\ntell me that I ought to--congratulate you," said Roland with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Congratulate me? On what? I suppose," said Hester, growing red, "there\r\nis only one thing upon which girls are congratulated: and that does not\r\nexist in my case."\r\n\r\n"May I believe you?" he said, putting his hands together with a\r\nsupplicating gesture, "may I put faith in you? But it seemed on such\r\ngood authority. Your cousin Edward----"\r\n\r\n"Did Edward tell you so?" Hester grew so red that the flush scorched\r\nher. She was angry and mortified and excited. Her interest changed, in a\r\nmoment, from the faint interest which she had felt in the handsome young\r\ndeceiver before her, to a feeling more strong and deeply rooted, half\r\nmade out of repulsion, half bitter, half injured, yet more powerful in\r\nattraction than any other sentiment of her mind. Roland was ill-pleased\r\nthat he was superseded by this other feeling. It was a sensation quite\r\nunusual to him, and he did not like it. "He had no right to say so,"\r\nsaid Hester; "he knew it was not true."\r\n\r\n"All is fair in love and war," said Roland; "perhaps he wished it to\r\nbe--not true."\r\n\r\n"I do not know what he wishes, and I do not care!" Hester cried, after a\r\npause, with a passion which did not carry out her words. "He has never\r\nbeen a friend to me," she said hastily. "He might have helped me, he\r\nmight have been kind--not that I want his help or any one\'s," cried the\r\ngirl, her passion growing as she went on. Then she came to a dead stop,\r\nand gave Roland a rapid look, to see how much he had divined of her real\r\nfeelings. "But he need not have said what was not true," she added in a\r\nsubdued tone.\r\n\r\n"I forgive him," said Roland, "because it is not true. If it had been\r\ntrue it would not have been so easy to forgive. I am coming back again,\r\nand I should have seen you--changed. It was too much. Now I can look\r\nforward with unmingled pleasure. It is one\'s first duty, don\'t you\r\nthink, to minister to the pleasure of one\'s grandparents? they are old;\r\none ought to come often, as often as duty will permit."\r\n\r\nHester looked up to him with a little surprise, the transition was so\r\nsudden; and, to tell the truth, the tumult in her own mind was not so\r\nentirely subdued that she could bestow her full attention upon Roland\'s\r\n_double entendre_.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. "One would think, by your look, that you did not share my\r\nfine sense of duty," he said; "but you must not frown upon it. I am\r\ncoming soon, very soon, again. A fortnight ago the place was only a name\r\nto me; but now it is a name that I shall remember for ever," he added\r\nwith fervour.\r\n\r\nHester looked at him this time with a smile upon her mouth. She had\r\nrecovered herself and come back to the diversion of his presence, the\r\namusement and novelty he had brought. A half sense of the exaggeration\r\nand sentimental nonsense of his speech was in her smile; and he was more\r\nor less conscious of it too. When their eyes met they both laughed; and\r\nyet she was not displeased, nor he untouched by some reality of feeling.\r\nThe exaggeration was humorous, and the sentiment not altogether untrue.\r\n\r\n"Do you say that always when you leave a place?" Hester said.\r\n\r\n"Very often," he acknowledged; and they both laughed again, which, to\r\nher at least, was very welcome, as she had been doubly on the verge of\r\ntears--for anger and for regret. "But seldom as I do now," he added,\r\n"you may believe me. The old people are better and kinder than I had\r\ndreamt of; it does one good to be near them; and then I have helped\r\nmyself on in the world by this visit, but that you will not care for.\r\nAnd then----"\r\n\r\nHere Roland broke off abruptly, and gazed, as his fashion was, as\r\nfeeling the impotence of words to convey all that the heart would say.\r\n\r\nIt was very shortly after this that the white horse which drew the old\r\nfly from Redborough--the horse which was supposed to have been chosen\r\nfor this quality, that it could be seen a long way off to console the\r\nsouls of those who felt it could never arrive in time--was seen upon the\r\nroad, and the last moment had visibly come. Not the less for the\r\ncommotion and tumult or other feelings through which her heart had gone,\r\ndid Hester acknowledge the emotions which belonged to this leave-taking.\r\nThe depth and sadness of Roland\'s eyes--those expressive eyes which said\r\nso many things, the pathos of his mouth, the lingering clasp in which he\r\nheld her hand, all affected her. There was a magic about him which the\r\ngirl did not resist, though she was conscious of the other side of it,\r\nthe faint mixture of the fictitious which did not impair its charm. She\r\nstood and watched him from the low window of the parlour which looked\r\nthat way, while the fly was being laden, with a blank countenance. She\r\nfelt the corners of her mouth droop, her eyes widen, her face grow\r\nlonger. It was as if all the novelty, the variety, the pleasure of life\r\nwere going away. It was a dull afternoon, which was at once congenial as\r\nsuiting the circumstances and oppressive as enhancing the gloom. She\r\nwatched the portmanteau put in as if she had been watching a funeral.\r\nWhen Roland stepped in after his grandfather, who in the softness of the\r\nmoment had offered, to the great surprise of everybody, to accompany him\r\nto the station, Hester still looked on with melancholy gravity. She was\r\nalmost on a level with them where she stood looking out; her mother all\r\nsmiles, kissing her hand beside her. "I wish you would show a little\r\ninterest, Hester," Mrs. John said. "You might at least wave your hand.\r\nIf it were only for the old captain\'s sake whom you always profess to be\r\nso fond of." Roland at this moment leant out of the window of the fly\r\nand took off his hat to her for the last time. Mrs. John thought it was\r\nbarbarous to take no notice. She redoubled her own friendly salutations;\r\nbut Hester stood like a statue, forcing a faint ghost of a smile, but\r\nnot moving a finger. She stood thus watching them long after they had\r\ndriven away, till they had almost disappeared in the smoke of\r\nRedborough. She saw the fly stop at the Grange and Miss Catherine come\r\nout to the door to take leave of him: and then the slow vehicle\r\ndisappeared altogether. The sky seemed to lean down almost touching the\r\nground; the stagnant afternoon air had not a breath to move it. Hester\r\nsaid to herself that nothing more would happen now. She knew the\r\nafternoon atmosphere, the approach of tea, the scent of it in the air,\r\nthe less ethereal bread-and-butter, and then the long dull evening. It\r\nseemed endless to look forward, as if it never would be night. And Mrs.\r\nJohn, as soon as the fly was out of sight, had drawn her chair towards\r\nthe fire and begun to talk. "I am sure I am very sorry he has gone,"\r\nMrs. John said. "I did not think I should have liked him at first, but I\r\ndeclare I like him very much now. How long is it since he came, Hester?\r\nOnly a fortnight! I should have said three weeks at least. I think it\r\nwas quite unnatural of the captain to talk of him as he did, for I am\r\nsure he is a very nice young man. Where are you going? not I hope for\r\none of your long walks: for the night closes in very early now, and it\r\nwill soon be time for tea."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think, mamma," said Hester, somewhat hypocritically, "that it\r\nwould be kind to go in and keep Mrs. Morgan company a little, as she\r\nwill be quite alone?"\r\n\r\n"That is always your way as soon as I show any inclination for a little\r\ntalk," said her mother provoked, not without reason. Then she softened,\r\nbeing at heart the most good-natured of women. "Perhaps you are right,"\r\nshe said, "the old lady will be lonely. Give her my love, and say I\r\nshould have come to see her myself, but that--" Mrs. John paused for a\r\nreason, "but that I am afraid for my neuralgia," she added triumphantly.\r\n"You know how bad it was the other day."\r\n\r\nThus sanctioned Hester threw her grey "cloud" round her, and ran round\r\nto console Mrs. Morgan, while her mother arranged herself comfortably\r\nwith a footstool, a book upon the table beside her, and her knitting,\r\nbut with a furtive inclination towards an afternoon nap, which the\r\ngreyness of the day, the early failing light in the dark wainscoted\r\nparlour, and the absence of all movement about her, naturally inclined\r\nher to. Mrs. John was at the age when we are very much ashamed of the\r\nafternoon nap, and she was well provided with semblances of occupation\r\nin case any one should come. But Mrs. Morgan was far beyond any such\r\nsimple deceit. Eighty has vast advantages in this way. When she felt\r\ndisposed to doze a little she was quite pleased, almost proud of the\r\nachievement. She had indeed a book on the table with her spectacles\r\ncarefully folded into it, but she did not require any occupation.\r\n\r\n"I had a kind of feeling that you would come, my pet," she said as\r\nHester appeared. "When I want you very much I think some kind little\r\nangel must go and tap you on the shoulder, for you always come."\r\n\r\n"The captain would say it is a brain-wave," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"The captain says a great deal of nonsense, my dear," said the old lady\r\nwith a smile, "but think of him going with Roland to the station! He has\r\nbeen vanquished, quite vanquished--which is a great pleasure to me. And\r\nEmma is coming. I hope she will not wear out the good impression----"\r\n\r\n"Is she not so--nice?" Hester asked.\r\n\r\nThe old lady looked her favourite intently in the face. She saw the too\r\ngreat clearness of Hester\'s eyes, and that her mouth was not smiling,\r\nbut drawn downward; and a vague dread filled her mind. She was full of\r\nlove and charity, but she was full of insight too; and though she loved\r\nRoland, she did not think it would be to the advantage of Hester to love\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Roland is very nice," she said. "Poor boy, perhaps that is his\r\ntemptation. It is his nature to please whomsoever he comes across. It is\r\na beautiful kind of nature; but I am not sure that it is not very\r\ndangerous both for himself--and others."\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that Hester did not divine what her friend meant.\r\n\r\n"Dangerous--to please?" she said, with a little curiosity. She liked\r\nRoland so much, that even from the lips of those who had more right to\r\nhim than she had, she did not like to hear blame.\r\n\r\n"To wish to please--everybody," said the old lady. "My poor lad! that is\r\nhis temptation. Your grandfather, if he were here--my dear, I beg your\r\npardon. I have got into the way of saying it: as if my old man was your\r\ngrandfather too."\r\n\r\n"I like it," Hester said, with the only gleam of her usual frank and\r\nradiant smile which Mrs. Morgan had yet seen. But this made the old lady\r\nonly more afraid.\r\n\r\n"There is nobody he could be more fatherly to," she said. "What I meant\r\nwas that if he were here, he would have something ready out of a book,\r\nas you and he are always going on with your poetries; but I never was a\r\npoetry woman, as you know. Life is all my learning. And I have seen\r\npeople that have had plenty of heart, Hester, if they had given it fair\r\nplay--but frittered it away on one and another, trying to give a piece\r\nto each, making each believe that she (for it is mostly upon women that\r\nthe spell works) was the one above all others. But you are so young, my\r\ndarling; you will not know what I mean."\r\n\r\nA faint, uneasy colour, came on Hester\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I think I know what you mean," she said. "I understand how you should\r\nthink so of Mr. Ashton. You don\'t see so well as you did, dear Mrs.\r\nMorgan, when you have not got your spectacles on. If you did, you would\r\nsee that when he talks like _that_, he is ready to laugh all the time."\r\n\r\n"Is that so, my love? Then I am very glad to hear you say so," cried the\r\nold lady. But she knew very well that her supposed want of sight was a\r\ndelusion, and that Hester knew it was only for reading that she ever\r\nused her spectacles. She felt, however, all the more that her warning\r\nhad been taken, and that it was unnecessary to proceed further. "You are\r\nyoung and sweet," she said, "my dear: but the best thing still is that\r\nyou have sense. Oh, what it is to have sense! it is the best blessing in\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nHester made no reply to this praise. Her heart was beating more quickly\r\nthan usual. What she had said was quite true: but all the time, though\r\nhe had been ready to laugh, and though she had been ready to laugh, she\r\nwas aware that there was something more. The tone of banter had not been\r\nall. The sense of something humorous, under those high-flown phrases,\r\nhad not exhausted them. She was intended to laugh, indeed, if they did\r\nnot secure another sentiment; but the first aim, and perhaps the last\r\naim, of the insidious Roland, had been to secure this other sentiment.\r\nHester did not enter into these distinctions, but she felt them; and\r\nwhen she thus put forward Mrs. Morgan\'s failing sight, it was with a\r\nnatural casuistry which she knew would be partially seen through, and\r\nyet would have its effect. This made her feel that there was no reply to\r\nbe made to the praise of her "sense," which the old lady had given. Was\r\nit her cunning that the old lady meant to praise? There was a little\r\nsilence, and the subject of Roland was put aside, not perhaps quite to\r\nthe satisfaction of either; but there was nothing more that could be\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the old captain came back, groaning a little over his long\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n"Why do you never remind me," he said, "what an old fool I am? To drive\r\nin that jingling affair, and to walk back--two miles if it is a\r\nyard--well, then, a mile and a half. My dear, what was half a mile when\r\nyou and I were young is two miles now, and not an inch less; but I have\r\nseen him off the premises. And now, Hester, we shall have our talks\r\nagain, and our walks again, without any interruption----"\r\n\r\n"Do not speak so fast, Rowley. There is Emma coming; and Hester will\r\nlike a girl to talk with, and to walk with, better than an old fellow\r\nlike you."\r\n\r\n"That old woman insults me," said the captain. "She thinks I am as old\r\nas she is--but Hester, you and I know better. You are looking anxious,\r\nmy child. Do you think we are a frivolous old pair talking as we ought\r\nnot--two old fools upon the brink of the grave?"\r\n\r\n"Captain Morgan! I, to have such a thought! And what should I do without\r\nyou?" cried Hester, in quick alarm. This brought the big tears to her\r\neyes, and perhaps she was glad, for various causes, to have a perfectly\r\nhonest and comprehensible cause in the midst of her agitation, for those\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"This was brought to my mind very clearly to-day," said the old captain.\r\n"When I saw that young fellow go off, a man in full career of his life,\r\nand thought of his parents swept away, the mother whom you know I loved,\r\nMary, as dearly as a man ever loves his child, and the father whom I\r\nhated, both so much younger than we are, and both gone for years; and\r\nhere are we still living, as if we had been forgotten somehow. We just\r\ngo on in our usual, from day to day, and it seems quite natural; but\r\nwhen you think of all of them--gone--and we two still here----"\r\n\r\n"We are not forgotten," said the old lady, in her easy chair, smiling\r\nupon him, folding those old hands which were now laid up from labour,\r\nhands that had worked hard in their day. "We have some purpose to serve\r\nyet, or we would not be here."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so--I suppose so," said the old man, with a sigh; and then he\r\nstruck his stick upon the floor, and cried out, "but not, God forbid it,\r\nas the instruments of evil to the house that has sheltered us, Mary! My\r\nheart misgives me. I would like at least, before anything comes of it,\r\nthat we should be out of the way, you and I."\r\n\r\n"You were always a man of little faith," his wife said. "Why should you\r\ngo out of your way to meet the evil, that by God\'s good grace will never\r\ncome? It will never come; we have not been preserved for that. You would\r\nas soon teach me Job\'s lesson as to believe that, my old man."\r\n\r\n"What was Job\'s lesson? It was, \'Though He slay me, yet will I trust in\r\nHim,\'" Captain Morgan said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Rowley!" cried the old lady, "I was wrong to say you were of\r\nlittle faith! It is you that are the faithful one, and not me. I am just\r\nnothing beside you, as I have always been."\r\n\r\nThe old captain took his wife\'s old hands in his, and gave her a kiss\r\nupon her faded cheek, and they smiled upon each other, the two who had\r\nbeen one for nearly sixty years. Meanwhile, Hester sitting by, looked on\r\nwith large eyes of wonder and almost affright. She did not know what it\r\nmeant. She could not divine what it could be that made them differ, yet\r\nmade them agree. What harm could they do to the house that sheltered\r\nthem, two old, good, peaceful people, who were kind to everybody? She\r\ngazed at them with her wondering young eyes, and did what she could to\r\nfathom the mystery: then retired from it, thinking it perhaps some\r\nlittle fad of the old people, which she had no knowledge of, nor means\r\nof understanding. The best people, Hester thought, when they grew old\r\ntake strange notions into their heads, and trouble themselves about\r\nnothing; and of course they missed Roland. She broke in upon them in\r\nthat moment of feeling, as soon as she dared speak for wonder, making an\r\neffort to amuse them, and bring them back to their usual ways; and that\r\neffort was not in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                              DANCING TEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after the departure of Roland that a new era dawned for\r\nHester in social life. Mrs. Algernon Merridew had felt from the moment\r\nof her return from Abroad that there was a work for her to do in\r\nRedborough. It was not the same as in her maiden days, when she had been\r\nat the head of Harry\'s household, wonderfully enfranchised indeed, but\r\nstill somewhat under the awe of Aunt Catherine. But now she was\r\naltogether independent, and nobody had any right to make suggestions as\r\nto who she should invite or how she should entertain, to a married lady,\r\nwith an admiring husband, not to speak of brother--and sisters-in-law,\r\neagerly anticipating social elevation by her means, at her back. Ellen\r\nwas not ill-natured. She was very willing to promote the happiness and\r\nprosperity of others, so long as she could do so without any diminution\r\nof her own--a negative goodness which the world at large is very well\r\npleased to acknowledge as satisfactory. And it is not at all probable\r\nthat the representations of Harry, or the good-humoured suggestions of\r\nAlgernon inspired by Harry, to the effect that it would be sublimely\r\ngood of her to take up and brighten the life of Hester, would have come\r\nto very much, had it not at the same time occurred to Ellen that Hester\r\nwas the best assistant she could have on her own side of the house, in\r\nthe indispensable work of making her Thursdays "go." Rather than that\r\nthey should not "go," she would have embraced her worst enemy, had she\r\npossessed one; and she did not care to rely upon the Merridew girls,\r\nfeeling as she did that she had condescended in entering their family,\r\nand that they must never be allowed to forget that they owed everything\r\nto her, and she nothing to them. But at the same time she required a\r\nfeminine auxiliary, a somebody to be her right hand, and help to make\r\neverything "go." The result of her cogitations on this subject was that\r\nshe set out for the Vernonry one afternoon in the little victoria, which\r\nAlgernon, rather tremulous about the cost, had set up for her, and\r\nwhich, with the smart coachman who for the moment condescended to be\r\ngardener too, and the boy on the box who was of quite a fashionable\r\nsize, looked a very imposing little equipage. Ellen lay back in her\r\nlittle carriage enveloped in her new sealskin, with a little hat of the\r\nsame upon her head, and a muff also of the same, and her light hair\r\nlooking all the brighter against that dark background, with bracelets\r\nenough to make a jingle wherever she went, and which she had to push up\r\nupon her arm from time to time, and a violet scent about herself and all\r\nher garments, at least the scent which is called violet at Piesse and\r\nLubin\'s, which served her purpose. When she drove up in this state, it\r\nmay be supposed what a flutter she made in the afternoon atmosphere. The\r\ninmates of the Vernonry rushed to their windows.\r\n\r\n"It is that little doll Ellen, come to show off more of her finery,"\r\nsaid one sister.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why she comes here, when you set her down so, Matilda," said\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThey kept behind the curtains, one over the other\'s shoulder, that she\r\nmight not see how curious they were. But when Ellen floated in at the\r\nverandah door, and was evidently gone to see Mrs. John, their\r\nastonishment was boundless. They shrugged their shoulders and\r\ninterchanged glances with Mr. Mildmay Vernon, who, with his newspaper in\r\nhis hand, had appeared at his window.\r\n\r\n"Did he think she was going to see _him_?" Miss Matilda said, even while\r\naddressing these satires in pantomime to him. "What interest can he take\r\nin Ellen? It is just prying and curiosity, and nothing more."\r\n\r\nThe gentleman\'s comments were not more friendly. He chuckled as he saw\r\nwhere Ellen was going.\r\n\r\n"The old cats will think it a visit to them, and they will be\r\ndisappointed," he said to himself, all the same shrugging his shoulders\r\nback again to Miss Matilda. They kept on the watch all the time the\r\nvisit lasted, and it was a long one. The sisters discussed the victoria,\r\nthe horse, the little footman, the great fur rug which Ellen threw off\r\nas she jumped lightly out of the carriage. It was somewhat hard indeed\r\nthat a little minx like Ellen should have all these things, and her\r\nseniors, her betters, who would have enjoyed them so much, none of them.\r\nBut so it always is in this unjust world.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the partition from where the sisters were sitting,\r\nEllen\'s appearance had caused an almost equal sensation. She was not\r\nlooked for, and the proposal she made was a very startling one.\r\n\r\n"I am going to begin my _Th\xe9s Dansantes_, and I want you to help me,"\r\nshe said abruptly. "I want you to be my right hand; just like my sister.\r\nYou know I can\'t do everything myself. Mrs. John, you shall come too, I\r\nnever intended to leave you out; but I want Hester to help me, for she\r\nis the only one that can help me. She is really my cousin. Clara and\r\nConnie are only my sisters-in-law, and I don\'t care to have them about\r\nme in that position. It would be nice for me, and it would be giving\r\nHester the best of chances. Now, Mrs. John, I am sure you will see it in\r\nthat light. What could be better for a girl? All that she will meet will\r\nbe the best sort of people: and she would have her chance."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean by having my chance--and I don\'t want any\r\nchance," said Hester, in a flush of shame and indignation; but Ellen put\r\nher down with a wave of her gloved hand and arm, all tinkling with\r\nbangles.\r\n\r\n"Of course you don\'t know anything about it," she said, "an unmarried\r\ngirl! We don\'t want you to know. Your mother and I will talk about that;\r\nbut you can understand that a nice dance in a nice house like ours will\r\nbe something pleasant. And you would be there not just like a visitor,\r\nbut like one of the family, and get a good deal of attention, and as\r\nmany partners as ever you liked."\r\n\r\n"Of course, Ellen, of course," cried Mrs. John. "I am sure _I_\r\nunderstand you. It would be very nice for Hester. At her age every girl\r\nlikes a little gaiety, and in my position I have never been able to give\r\nit to her. It was very different when my husband was alive, when we were\r\nin the White House. I am sure I have never grudged it to you, but it\r\nmade a great difference. I was not brought up to this sort of thing. I\r\nhad my balls, and my parties, as many as could be wished, when I was\r\nHester\'s age. If her poor papa had lived, and we had stayed in the White\r\nHouse, she would have held a very different position. It gives me a\r\nlittle prick, you will understand, to think of Hester wanting anybody to\r\nbe kind to her; but still, as it is so, and as you are her relation, I\r\nnever could object. You will find no objection from me."\r\n\r\n"No, I should think not," cried Ellen, throwing back her warm coat. It\r\nwas at the time when sealskins were rare, when they were just "coming\r\nin," and Mrs. John looked at it with admiration. She did not ask, as the\r\nMiss Vernon-Ridgways did, why this little minx should have everything;\r\nbut she remembered with a little regret the days when she too had\r\neverything that a young woman could desire, and wondered, with a little\r\nflutter at her heart, whether when Hester married she would have a\r\nsealskin and a victoria, and all the other crowns of happiness. She\r\nlooked with something of a pathetic look at her daughter. Ah! if she\r\ncould but see Hester as Ellen was!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hester was elevating her young head as was natural, in special\r\nscorn of the "chance" which her cousin meant to secure for her, and in\r\ndefiance altogether of the scheme, which nevertheless (for she was but\r\nhuman and nineteen, and the prospect of a dance every week took away her\r\nbreath) moved her in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n"When I was a child," Hester said, "when you first came to see us,\r\nCousin Ellen, you said you must see a great deal of me, that I must go\r\nto your house, that you and Harry would take me out, that I should have\r\na share in your pleasures. Perhaps my mother and you don\'t remember--but\r\nI do. How I used to look out for you every morning; how I used to watch\r\nat the window, thinking they will surely come or send, or take some\r\nnotice to-day. I was very young, you know, and believed everything, and\r\nwished so much to drive about and to go to parties. But you never came."\r\n\r\n"To think she should remember all that!" cried Ellen, a little abashed.\r\n"Of course I didn\'t. Why, you were only a child. One said so to please\r\nyou; but how can you suppose one meant anything? What could I have done\r\nwith you then--a little thing among lots of people? Why, you wouldn\'t\r\nhave been allowed to come! It would have been bad for you. You would\r\nhave heard things you oughtn\'t to hear. You wouldn\'t have let her come,\r\nwould you, Mrs. John?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, my dear," said Mrs. John, promptly. To tell the truth,\r\nit was she who had complained the most though it was Hester who had been\r\nmost indignant. She forgot this, however, in the new interest of the\r\nmoment. "It would never have done," she said, with all sincerity. "Your\r\ncousin, of course, only spoke to please you, Hester. I never could have\r\npermitted you, a little thing at your lessons, to plunge into pleasure\r\nat that age."\r\n\r\n"Then why--" cried Hester, open-mouthed; but when she had got so far she\r\npaused. What was the use of saying any more? She looked at them both\r\nwith her large brown eyes, full of light and wonder, and a little\r\nindignation and a little scorn, then stopped and laughed, and changed\r\nthe subject. "When I go to Cousin Catherine\'s," she said, "which I never\r\ndo when I can help it, we stand in a corner all the evening, my mother\r\nand I. We are thankful when any one speaks to us--the curate\'s daughters\r\nand the Miss Reynoldses and we---- There is never anybody to take us in\r\nto supper. All the Redborough people sweep past while mamma stands\r\nwaiting; and then perhaps some gentleman who has been down once before\r\ntakes pity, and says, \'Haven\'t you been down to supper, Mrs. Vernon?\r\nDear me! then let me take you.\' You will please to remember that my\r\nmother is Mrs. Vernon, Ellen, and not Mrs. John."\r\n\r\n"I only say it for--short," said Ellen, apologetically; "and how can I\r\nhelp what happens at Aunt Catherine\'s? I don\'t go in for her ways. I\r\ndon\'t mean to do as she does. Why do you talk of Aunt Catherine to me?"\r\n\r\n"It is only to let you see that I will not be treated so," the girl said\r\nwith indignation. "If you think I will go to your house like that, just\r\nbecause you are a relation, I won\'t, Ellen; and you had better\r\nunderstand this before we begin."\r\n\r\n"What a spitfire it is!" said Ellen, raising her hand with a toss of all\r\nher bracelets to brush Hester\'s downy cheek with a playful touch. "To\r\nthink she should put all these things down in her book against us! I\r\nshould never remember if it were me. I should be furious for the moment,\r\nand then I should forget all about it. Now, Hester, you look here. I am\r\nnot asking you for your own pleasure, you silly; I am asking you to help\r\n_me_. Don\'t you see that makes all the difference? You are no good to\r\nAunt Catherine. She doesn\'t need you. She asks you only for civility.\r\nBut it stands to reason, you know, that I can\'t look after all the\r\npeople myself if I am to have any of the fun. I must have some one to\r\nhelp me. Of course you will have every attention paid you; for, don\'t\r\nyou see, you are wanted. I can\'t get on without you. Oh, _of course_,\r\nthat makes all the difference! I am sure your mamma understands very\r\nwell, even if you are too young and too silly to understand!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Hester, your cousin is quite right," said Mrs. John, eagerly. The\r\npoor lady was so anxious to secure her child\'s assent to what she felt\r\nwould be so manifestly for her advantage that she was ready to back up\r\neverything that Ellen said. A spark of animation and new life had\r\nlighted up in Mrs. John\'s eyes. It was not a very elevated kind of hope\r\nperhaps, yet no hope that is centred in the successes of another is\r\naltogether ignoble. She wanted to see her child happy; she wanted Hester\r\nto have her chance, as Ellen said. That she should be seen and admired\r\nand made much of, was, Mrs. John felt, the first object in her life. It\r\nwould not be without some cost to herself, but she did not shrink from\r\nthe idea of the lonely evenings she would have to spend, or the\r\nseparation that might ensue. Her mind, which was not a great mind,\r\njumped forward into an instant calculation of how the evening dresses\r\ncould be got, at what sacrifice of ease or comfort. She did not shrink\r\nfrom this, whatever it might be. Neither did she let any visionary pride\r\nstand in her way as Hester did. She was ready to forgive, to forget, to\r\ncondone all offences--and in the long discussion and argument that\r\nfollowed, Mrs. John was almost more eloquent than Ellen on the mutual\r\nadvantages of the contract. She saw them all the instant they were set\r\nbefore her. She was quite tremulous with interest and expectation. She\r\nran over with approval and beaming admiration as Ellen unfolded her\r\nplans. "Oh, yes, I can quite understand; you want to strike out\r\nsomething original," cried Mrs. John. "You must not think I agree with\r\nHester about Catherine\'s parties. I think Catherine\'s parties are very\r\nnice; and relations, you know, must expect to give way to strangers,\r\nespecially when there are not enough of gentlemen; but it will be much\r\npleasanter for you to strike out something original. I should have liked\r\nit when I was in your circumstances, but I don\'t think I had the energy.\r\nAnd I am sure if Hester can be of any use---- Oh, my darling! of course you\r\nwill like it very much. You always are ready to help, and you have\r\nplenty of energy--far more than I ever had--and so fond of dancing too;\r\nand there are so few dances in Redborough. Oh, yes, I think it is a\r\ncapital plan, Ellen! and Hester will be delighted to help you. It will\r\nbe such an opening for her," Mrs. John said, with tears of pleasure in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nHester did not say much while the talk ran on. She was understood to\r\nfall into the scheme, and that was all that was necessary. But when\r\nEllen, after a prolonged visit and a detailed explanation to Mrs. John,\r\nwhich she received with the greatest excitement and interest, of all her\r\narrangements as to the music, the suppers, and every other particular\r\nthey could think of between them, rose to take her leave, she put her\r\nhand within Hester\'s arm, and drew her aside for a few confidential\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think of coming to the door," she said to Mrs. John; "it is so\r\ncold you must not stir. Hester will see me out. There is one thing I\r\nmust say to you, dear," she added, raising herself to Hester\'s ear when\r\nthey were out of the mother\'s hearing, "and you are not to take it\r\namiss. It must be a condition beforehand--now please, Hester, mind, and\r\ndon\'t be offended. You must promise me that you will have nothing to say\r\nto either of the boys."\r\n\r\nThe quick flush of offence sprang to Hester\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean. You mean something you have no right to\r\nsay, Ellen!"\r\n\r\n"I have a very good right to say it--for I\'m a married lady, and you are\r\nonly a girl, and of course I must know best. You are not to have\r\nanything to say to the boys. Any one else you like. I am sure I don\'t\r\nmind, but will do anything I can to help--but not the boys. Oh, I know\r\nsomething about Harry. I know you have had the sense to---- Well, I don\'t\r\nunderstand how far it went, but I suppose it must have gone as far as it\r\ncould go, for he\'s not clever enough to be put off with anything less\r\nthan a real No. But you may have changed your mind, or a hundred things\r\nmight happen. And then there\'s Edward; Aunt Catherine would be wild if\r\nanything got up between you and Edward. Oh, I think it\'s always best to\r\nspeak plain, and then one has nothing to reproach one\'s self with after.\r\nShe would just be _wild_, you know. She thinks there is nobody good\r\nenough for him; and you and she have never got on. Oh, I don\'t suppose\r\nthere\'s anything between you and Edward. I never said so; the only thing\r\nis you must promise me to have nothing to say to _them_. There are\r\nplenty of others--much better matches, and more eligible: and it\'s\r\nalways a pity to have anything to say to a cousin in that way. You\'re\r\nsure to set the family by the ears; and then it narrows the connection,\r\nand you keep always the same name; and there are ever so many drawbacks.\r\nSo just you promise me, Hester, there\'s a dear--never," said Ellen,\r\nseizing her with both hands, and giving her a sudden perfumy kiss,\r\n"never!" and the salute was repeated on the other cheek, "to have\r\n_anything_ to say to the boys----"\r\n\r\n"The boys! if you think I care anything for the boys! I shall have\r\nnothing to say to anybody," cried Hester, with indignation, drawing\r\nherself out of this too urgent embrace. Ellen tossed back all her\r\nbracelets, and shook her golden locks and her sealskin hat, and made an\r\nagitation in the air of scent and sound and movement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s being a great deal too good," she cried.\r\n\r\nHester stood at the door, and looked on while Mrs. Algernon got into her\r\nvictoria and drew the fur rug over her, and was driven away, waving the\r\nhand and the bracelets in a parting jingle. The girl was not envious,\r\nbut half-contemptuous, feeling herself in her poverty as much superior\r\nto this butterfly in furs and feathers, as pride could desire. Hester\r\ndid little credit to the social gifts, or the popularity or reputed\r\ncleverness in her own way, of her gay cousin who had been the\r\ninspiration of Harry, and now was the guide of Algernon Merridew. She\r\nsaid to herself with the downrightness of youth, that Ellen was a little\r\nfool. But her own cheeks were blazing with this parting dart which had\r\nbeen thrown at her. The boys! She had a softened feeling of amity\r\ntowards Harry, who had done all a stupid young man could do to overcome\r\nthe sentence of disapproval under which Hester was aware she lay. It had\r\nbeen embarrassing and uncomfortable, and had made her anything but\r\ngrateful at the moment; but now she began to feel that Harry had indeed\r\nbehaved like a man, and done all that a man could to remedy her false\r\nposition, and give her a substantial foundation for the native\r\nindomitable pride which none of them could crush, though they did their\r\nbest. No; she would have nothing to say to Harry. She shook her head to\r\nherself, and laughed at the thought, all in the silence of the verandah,\r\nwhere she stood hazily gazing out through the dim greenish glass at\r\nEllen, long after Ellen had disappeared. But Edward! that was a\r\ndifferent matter altogether. She would give no word so far as he was\r\nconcerned. Edward was altogether different from Harry. He piqued and\r\nexcited her curiosity; he kept her mind in a tremor of interest. She\r\ncould not cease thinking of him when she was in his neighbourhood,\r\nwondering what he would do, what he would say. And if it did make\r\nCatherine _wild_, as Ellen said, that was but an inducement the more in\r\nHester\'s indignant soul. She had no wish to please Catherine Vernon.\r\nThere had not been any love lost between them from the first, and Hester\r\nwas glad to think she was not one of those who had in any way pretended\r\nto her kinswoman\'s favour. She had never sought Catherine, never bowed\r\nthe knee before her. When she went to the Grange it had been against her\r\nwill, as a matter of obedience to her mother, not to Catherine. If it\r\nmade Catherine wild to think that there was a friendship, or any other\r\nsentiment between Edward and the girl whom she had so slighted, then let\r\nCatherine be wild. That was no motive to restrain Hester\'s freedom of\r\naction. All this passed through her mind as she stood in the verandah in\r\nthe cold, gazing after Ellen, long after Ellen was out of sight. There\r\nwere many things which gave her a sort of attraction of repulsion to\r\nEdward. He had tried to deceive Roland Ashton about her, telling him she\r\nwas about to marry Harry, when he knew very well she had refused to\r\nmarry Harry. Why had he done it? And in his manner to herself Edward was\r\ntwo men. When they were alone he was more than friendly; he was tender,\r\ninsinuating, anxious for her approval, eager to unfold himself to her.\r\nBut when he saw her in the Grange drawing-room he never went near her.\r\nIn early times she had asked why, and he had answered with deceiving\r\nwords, asking how she thought he could bear to approach her with\r\ncommonplace civilities when she was the only creature in the place for\r\nwhom he cared at all, a speech which had pleased Hester at first as\r\nsomething high-flown and splendid, but which had not preserved its\r\neffect as time went on: for she could not see why he should not be\r\ncivil, and show some regard for her presence, even if he could not\r\ndevote himself to her. And why could he not devote himself to her?\r\nBecause it would displease Catherine. When Catherine was not present,\r\nthere was nobody for him but Hester. When Catherine was there, he was\r\nunconscious of her existence. This, of course, should have shown clearly\r\nto Hester that he was not worthy of her regard, and to some degree did\r\nso. But the conviction was mingled with so lively a curiosity in respect\r\nto him, so strong an opposition as regarded her, that Hester\'s moral\r\njudgment was confused altogether. She was anxious, eager to overcome her\r\nadversary, excited to know what Edward\'s meaning was. He would not stand\r\nup for her like a true friend, but at the same time he would never let\r\nher alone, he would still let her see that she was in his mind. She\r\ndisliked him, yet---- She almost loved him, but still---- Nothing could\r\nbe more tantalising, more entirely unlike indifference. To think of\r\nmeeting Edward in society, yet not under Catherine\'s eye, made her\r\nheart beat loudly. She had never done this hitherto. She had met him by\r\nchance on the Common or in the country roads about, and his voice had\r\nbeen almost that of a lover. She had met him before the world, and he\r\nhad scarcely seemed to know her. But how could these meetings test what\r\nhe meant? This it was that made Ellen\'s proposal exciting, even while\r\nshe herself half scorned it. Harry? no! Poor Harry! she would not\r\ndisturb his peace, nor say a word, nor even look a look which should\r\nput him in jeopardy. But Edward?--ah! that was a different matter. It\r\nwas with all the vehemence of a quarrel that she snatched at the chance\r\nput into her hands, even when she had seemed to scorn it. To know what\r\nhe meant--to know what was his real state of mind. If he would be afraid\r\nof what the world would say, as well as of what Catherine would say--in\r\nthat case there was no scorn which Hester did not feel herself capable\r\nof pouring out upon her unworthy admirer; but if things proved\r\ndifferent? Ah! then she did not know what softening, what yielding, she\r\nmight not be capable of. The very thought melted her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd yet she had thought herself more "interested" (this was what she\r\ncalled it) in Roland Ashton than in any man whom she had ever heard of\r\nbefore. The world had seemed all blank to her when he went away. His\r\nstep at the door had made her heart thrill: the commonplace day had\r\nbrightened up into something smiling and sweet when he came in. But then\r\nshe had not been fighting a duel with him half her life as she had been\r\ndoing with Edward. She was not curious, _intrigu\xe9e_, to know what Roland\r\nmeant. She thought (with a blush) that she did know--more or less--what\r\nhe meant. But Edward was a sort of sphinx; he was an enemy to be beaten,\r\na riddle to be read. She said to herself, what would please her best\r\nwould be to force him into self-abandonment, to carry him so out of\r\nhimself that he should give up all pretences and own himself at her\r\ndisposal, and then to turn her back upon him and scorn him. Would she\r\nhave done so? she thought she would, and that in this lay the secret of\r\nher interest in Edward and his crooked ways. And now, here was the trial\r\napproaching. She would see what was his true mettle, she would be able\r\nindeed to judge of him now.\r\n\r\n"Hester," said Mrs. John appearing at the open door, "what do you mean\r\nby lingering in the cold, to get your death? You will be chilled to your\r\nvery bones. You have not even a shawl on, and in this cold place. What\r\nare you doing? I have called you three times, and you never paid any\r\nattention. Even to stand here for five minutes freezes me."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t stand here, mamma," said Hester, taking hold of her mother\'s\r\narm and thus leading her back in the old way. They did not walk about\r\nvery much together now. Hester preferred her own thoughts to her\r\nmother\'s society, and Mrs. John was not sorry to be left quietly by\r\nherself at the fireside. How long it seemed since the time when she held\r\nher mother\'s arm clasped in hers whenever she moved, and used it as a\r\nhelm to guide that timid and trustful woman wherever she would! A little\r\ncompunction came over her as she made use of that well-known expedient\r\nagain, and steered her mother (all the more gently for that thought)\r\nback to her own chair.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, dear, this is very comfortable," said Mrs. John, "but I wish\r\nyou had come at once, when I called you, for we must not lose any time\r\nin thinking about your dresses. You must do Ellen credit, that is one\r\nthing clear. I can\'t have you dowdy, Hester. The Merridew girls shall\r\nnot have a word to say about the Vernons on your account. Oh, I know\r\nthey will if they can; they will whisper and say how proud we all are,\r\nand give ourselves airs, and just look at Hester in a washed muslin! I\r\nwould rather go without my dinner," said Mrs. John with vehemence, "for\r\na whole year."\r\n\r\n"But I shall not let you do that, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hester, just hold your tongue. What do you know about it? I would\r\nrather sell my Indian shawl, or my pearls--Dear me, what a good thing I\r\ndid not part with my pearls! that is something nobody can turn up their\r\nnoses at. And you can say you got them from your mother, and your\r\ngrandmother before her--which is more than they ever had. But there are\r\nthe dresses to be thought of," said the tender mother, looking in\r\nHester\'s face, half awed, half appealing: for even in the pride of\r\ndescent she was forced to remember that you cannot send your child to a\r\n_Th\xe9 Dansante_ with nothing but a string of pearls round her neck,\r\nhowever fine, and however long in the family it may have been.\r\n\r\n"Dresses! one will do," said Hester, with a little flush of pleasure,\r\nyet determination to repress her mother\'s unnecessary liberality. "You\r\nforget what you are talking of, mother dear. One dress is as much\r\nas----"\r\n\r\n"And to whom do you suppose you are speaking," said Mrs. John with\r\ndignity; "there are a great many things which you think you know better\r\nthan I. Perhaps you are wrong there too; but I am not going to bandy\r\nwords with you. One thing I must say, than when we talk of ball dresses\r\nI know a great deal better than you. Oh, but I do--I had to get\r\neverything for myself in old days. Your father delighted in seeing me\r\nfine, but he never pretended to have any taste. All the responsibility\r\nwas on me. Considering that we are poor, and that you are so young, I\r\nshould think tulle would do: or even tarlatan. Hester, I should like you\r\nto have silk slips, that gives a character to a thing at once. A white\r\none, a pink one, and a blue one----"\r\n\r\n"Dear mamma, a white frock, that is all I want. I am sure that is all I\r\nwant; we can\'t afford any more. And as for silk slips----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hold your tongue, Hester, what do you know about it?" cried Mrs.\r\nJohn, exasperated. "You have never been at a ball in your life. You\r\ncan\'t know what\'s wanted, like me. There are quantities of other things\r\nbesides. Shoes--you must have satin shoes and silk stockings, and\r\ngloves, and something to wear in your hair. I don\'t even know what\'s\r\nworn now. We used to have wreaths in my day, but perhaps that\'s not the\r\nfashion at present. When I had not a maid--and of course, poor child,\r\nyou have no maid--I used to have a hair-dresser to do my hair when I was\r\ngoing out. We wore it quite high on the top of our heads, and now you\r\nwear it down in the nape of your neck. What a thing fashion is! We had\r\ngigot sleeves all puffed out with feather cushions, and I used to wear a\r\nlace scarf which was very becoming. We had muslins in my time, nice\r\nclear book-muslins, and when you had worn it two or three times for\r\nballs you just wore it out in the evenings at home. Tarlatan is not half\r\nso profitable," said Mrs. John, with a very serious face, "but you must\r\nhave it, I suppose, all the same."\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Hester, when her mother paused for breath, "I feel quite\r\nhorrified at all this. Why should I dress up so fine for Ellen\'s\r\nparties? I shall only be a sort of poor relation. My washed muslin will\r\ndo very well. Nobody will expect anything better from me."\r\n\r\n"Then that is just why you shall have something better," said the poor\r\nlady, her pale countenance brightening with a pretty pink flush. "You\r\nsha\'n\'t go at all if you can\'t go as my daughter should. You shall have\r\na white first, and then a--no, not a pink; pink used to be my colour,\r\nfor you know I was pale, and my hair was plain brown, not like yours.\r\nYours is a little too--auburn--for pink. You must have a blue for your\r\nsecond, with silk slips made very simply, and tarlatan over that. White\r\nshoes, and white gloves, and my pearls. Oh, how glad I am I kept my\r\npearls! It will be such a pleasure, dear, to see you dressed, it will be\r\nlike old times again. And you must ask Ellen what to wear in your hair,\r\na wreath, or just one flower at the side, with a spray hanging down over\r\nyour neck. Mr. Ashton, I am sure, would get it for me in town. For\r\nflowers and those sort of things one should always send to London. And\r\nyou must have a fan. I wonder if my ivory fan would be old-fashioned? I\r\nmust ask Ellen. And, dear child, don\'t stand there doing nothing when\r\nthere is not a moment to lose, but ring for the tea. We must have tea\r\nfirst. I always feel better after, and then we must put everything down\r\nupon paper, and calculate what it will cost, and how we are to do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want all that," said Hester again: but the sound of it\r\nflattered her youthful ears; for she was only a girl, when all was said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk any nonsense, child, but ring for the tea," said Mrs. John,\r\nfeeling herself for once mistress of the occasion. "But Hester," she\r\nadded, in so solemn a tone that Hester came back half frightened to hear\r\nwhat it was, "if you ever have children, as I hope you will, be sure you\r\nhave one of your girls taught how to cut out, and to look after the\r\ndressmaking. If we only could have them made at home, what a saving it\r\nwould be!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                           THE FIRST OF THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Mrs. Merridew\'s _Th\xe9s Dansantes_ made a great commotion in\r\nRedborough. Dancing teas--what did it mean? It meant some nonsense or\r\nanother. You might be sure it meant nonsense of some kind, as it was\r\nEllen Vernon that was at the bottom of it, the elder people said; but\r\nthe younger ones were of a different opinion. It did not matter to them\r\nso much that Ellen Vernon was silly; indeed the greater part of them\r\nwere so dazzled by the furs and the bracelets, and the victoria, if not\r\nby the brilliant fairness and beaming smiles and prettiness of the\r\nbride, that they did not remember Ellen Vernon had been silly, and\r\nthought Mrs. Algernon Merridew not only the leader of fashion, but the\r\nmost amiable and good-natured of all queens of society, the most "easy\r\nto get on with" and most full of "go." Nothing like her and her dresses,\r\nand her house and her company, had ever been seen in the quiet,\r\nsteady-going country town. She made it known graciously, that she was\r\nalways at home at lunch, and there was scarcely a day that a merry party\r\ndid not assemble at her house, filling the newly-furnished pretty room\r\nwith chatter and laughter, and all the distracting devices of careless\r\nyouth to get rid of a few of its golden hours. And already there had\r\nbeen half a dozen dinners, far too soon and quite unnecessary, as all\r\nthe elders said. She ought to have waited until everybody had given her\r\nand her husband a dinner before she began to return their hospitalities.\r\nBut Ellen had no idea either of waiting or returning the heavy dinners\r\nto which she, as a daughter of one of the reigning houses of the town,\r\nand her husband as belonging, if not to that rank, at least to the\r\nforemost respectability, were invited by all the principal people. The\r\nentertainments she gave were reckless young dinners, where there was no\r\nsolemnity at all, and perhaps not much wit, but where laughter abounded\r\nand all sorts of wild schemes of pleasure were invented. And just as the\r\nsolid people who had made a point of having a dinner for the Algernon\r\nMerridews began to feel a little offended at the goings-on of the young\r\nhousehold which paid no attention to ordinary rules of civility, the\r\nyounger portion of the population was thrown into the wildest excitement\r\nby the announcement of the _Th\xe9s Dansantes_, and frowning mothers were\r\ncourted to smiles again, by the anticipated pleasure of their children.\r\nThe old Merridews, the father and mother, looked on with pride but\r\nmisgiving, the brothers and sisters with pride and delight, as they felt\r\nthemselves already rising high upon the topmost wave of society by means\r\nof their brilliant sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Only mind what you are about and keep hold on the reins, my boy," old\r\nMerridew said to his son, which Algernon promised with a laughing "Trust\r\nme for that."\r\n\r\n"Trust Algy, indeed!" his mother said, shaking her head. "I would not\r\ntrust him a step further that I saw him with that crazy little thing by\r\nthe side of him; all my hope is that being a Vernon her people will step\r\nin." They were all sure that no great harm could happen to a Vernon in\r\nRedborough. Harry, her brother, was always at her side, as faithful as\r\nher husband, backing her up. And Catherine herself could not disapprove,\r\nfor she went to the house now and then, and laughed when she was spoken\r\nto on the subject. "Ellen was always like that," she said, "wild for\r\npleasure and amusement. She has asked me to her dancing teas, as an\r\nentertainment quite suited to my years and habits." All which things\r\nreassured the Merridews and the other anxious persons about.\r\n\r\n"And you are going to this dancing tea?" Catherine Vernon said.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said Edward, indifferently. "They would think it strange\r\nif I did not go. And they expect you--Merridew told me so. He said it\r\nwould add such dignity to their little party!"\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone with which Edward said this which\r\nCatherine did not like. It was true that she herself had always\r\nrepresented the invitation as ludicrous, yet it was quite true that her\r\npresence would have added dignity to the party, and there was nothing\r\nridiculous in the idea that Algernon Merridew thought so. This annoyed\r\nher a little, but it was the annoyance of a moment. She said, "I hope\r\nyou will enjoy yourself," with a laugh, which Edward on his side found\r\nas offensive: but he did not betray this, and smiled in reply, as he\r\nknew she meant him to smile, with a sort of apologetic indulgent air.\r\n\r\n"I shall do the best I can," he said, and they both laughed. She\r\ntenderly, thinking how good he was to take this trouble in order to\r\ngratify the frivolous young pair and keep up the Vernon traditions; he\r\nwith a fierce question to herself, why shouldn\'t he enjoy it? at least\r\nit would be an evening to himself, with nobody to keep watch over him\r\nand make a note of every girl he danced with. Alas for Catherine! if she\r\nnoticed the girls he danced with it was in order to invite them\r\nafterwards (if she approved of them), for she had no jealous desire to\r\nkeep him to herself, but wanted him to marry. But then there was one at\r\nleast whom she could never have tolerated. And the chief point in\r\nEdward\'s anticipations, as in Hester\'s, was the freedom of intercourse\r\npermitted under Ellen\'s easy young wing, and the opportunity he would\r\nhave of seeing how the eager, large-eyed girl would look among other\r\ngirls, when he could approach her freely. This gave him something of the\r\nsame sense of curiosity which was so warm in Hester\'s mind. How would\r\nshe look among other girls--how would she receive him? It did not occur\r\nto him as probable that she would resent that avoidance of her when\r\nunder Catherine\'s eye which he had so often assured her made him\r\nwretched. He felt that the little secret between them, the stolen glance\r\nhe would give her at the Grange parties, the little shrug with which he\r\npointed her attention to his bondage, would have an attraction even\r\ngreater than had he been always at her side; and in some sense this was\r\ntrue. But he did not think of Hester\'s judgment and of the natural\r\nindignation of her high spirit; neither did he think of the comparison\r\nshe made between him and Harry, who had never hesitated to show his\r\ndevotion. To compare himself and Harry, seemed to Edward impossible. A\r\nbig idiot--a nonentity. She had more sense than that.\r\n\r\nNever was there such a spectacle seen in Redborough as the first of the\r\n_Th\xe9s Dansantes_. The Merridews\' house was near the White House, and\r\nconsequently on a little eminence, which answered all the purposes of a\r\ngreat eminence in that flat country. It stood in the midst of a little\r\nshrubbery above which it rose on white steps, to make the position still\r\nmore commanding. There was a long domed conservatory at one side, the\r\nwindows were all plate glass, and when you consider that within and\r\nwithout the place was lighted up--like the Crystal Palace, people\r\nsaid--you may imagine something of the imposing effect. The conservatory\r\nwas all hung with Chinese lanterns, and was fairy land to the young\r\nguests inexperienced in such glorious effects; the two drawing-rooms\r\nwere both thrown open for dancing. There were very few chaperons; only\r\nhere and there a middle-aged mother, too devoted to her charge, yawned\r\nbehind her fan with nobody to speak to, not a lady of her own age to\r\nexchange experiences with, no elderly gallant to get her a cup of tea.\r\nAll was youth, rampant, insolent, careless--feeling that the world was\r\nmade for it, and rejoicing to shake itself free of every trammel. Mrs.\r\nEllen set them the example in the most daring way.\r\n\r\n"What do we want with the old things here?" she said; "they would much\r\nrather be in bed, and the best place for them. I don\'t suppose you mean\r\nto do anything wrong, any of you girls, and if you did they wouldn\'t\r\nstop you. If you can\'t take care of yourselves, if you want a chaperon,\r\nthere\'s me. And there\'s Fanny Willoughby, and Lilian Melville, and Maud\r\nSeton; they\'ve all been married as long as I have. Where could you find\r\nsteadier married women? and ain\'t we enough to chaperon a couple of\r\ndozen girls? I never pretend to ask old people, unless it was just to\r\nlet them see how everything looks, poor old things, once in a way."\r\n\r\nThis being the creed of the mistress of the feast, it is not to be\r\nsupposed that her disciples were more catholic. And there was no limit\r\nto the fun which the young people promised themselves. To do them\r\njustice, it was very innocent fun. The greatest sin on the conscience of\r\nthe wildest romp in the place was that of having danced ten times with a\r\nfavourite partner, besides sitting out all the square dances (of which\r\nthere were only two) in his company. Algernon himself had insisted upon\r\ntwo. He said it was respectable: and he danced both with the least\r\npopular of the young ladies, that they might not feel themselves\r\nslighted, for he was a very good fellow.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see such a muff?" his wife said, who never condescended to\r\nthe Lancers. "I do believe he likes to hop about with the ugliest thing\r\nhe can pick up. I thought I had kept out all the ugly girls, but I\r\nhaven\'t succeeded. If there is one, Algy is sure to find her out."\r\n\r\n"To show you that you have no need to be jealous," some one said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _jealous_!" cried Ellen, with supreme disdain.\r\n\r\nThe young Merridews, brothers and sisters, thought her the most\r\nwonderful creature that had ever been born. Her light hair was in curls\r\nand frizzes (newly come in and extremely captivating) all over her head.\r\nHer dress was a sort of purple, a colour nobody but herself ventured to\r\nwear, but which threw up her fairness with the most brilliant effect.\r\nShe had all her jewellery on, from the diamonds Harry had spent all his\r\navailable money (under her own directions) in buying for her, to the\r\nlittle bracelet contributed by the clerks at the bank. Her arm was\r\ncovered nearly up to the elbow, and the sound she made when they fell\r\nover her hands and she had to push them back again was wonderful. It was\r\nlike a whole concert of fairy music, the bangles representing the higher\r\nnotes, the big golden manacles furnishing a bass. She liked to hold up\r\nher hands and shake them back with a pretty cry of "Tiresome! Why is one\r\nforced to wear all this upon one?" Ellen said.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. John had accomplished her wish. She had got, if not three, at\r\nleast two new dresses for Hester, one upon her shoulders at this moment,\r\nthe other, the blue one, laid up all ready in the box. White of course\r\nwas the first. It had the silk slip upon which Mrs. John had set her\r\nheart, which was so much more thrifty than anything else, which could be\r\ncovered over again and again, as she pointed out to her daughter, and\r\nwhich at the present moment was veiled in floods and billows of\r\ntarlatan. Tarlatan was the fashion of those days: anything that was\r\nlimp, that took--as people now love to say, "nice folds," being\r\nconsidered utterly dowdy. And when Hester appeared in those crisp\r\npuffings, with her pearls round her throat, and white flowers in the\r\nhair which her mother called auburn, even young Mrs. Merridew herself\r\nheld her breath. She turned her cousin round and round to examine her.\r\n\r\n"Well, I call that a _beautiful_ dress," she said. "Who put it into your\r\nhead to get a dress like that? Why, it is the height of the fashion!\r\nThose _bouillon\xe9es_ are just the right thing to wear. And do you mean to\r\nsay these are real pearls? Oh, go away, or I shall kill you! Why have I\r\nnot pearls? They are far more _distingu\xe9s_--oh, far more!--than my\r\npaltry bits of diamonds. Oh, take her away, or I shall not be able to\r\nkeep my hands off her. And such flowers! they must have come from\r\nForster\'s. I am certain they came from Forster\'s. Mine are French, but\r\nthey are not so pretty," Ellen said.\r\n\r\nHester stood and smiled while these comments were made, though with a\r\nhalf sense of shame. She thought it annoyed her very much to be\r\nsubjected to such a survey, and so no doubt it would have done had not\r\nthe result been so satisfactory; but it is hard to be really displeased\r\nby approbation.\r\n\r\nAs for Ellen, she whispered behind her hand to Harry, "The old lady must\r\nhave a great deal more than we think for. She must have been saving up.\r\nYou don\'t get a dress like that for nothing."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the dress--she always looks nice, whatever she puts on," said\r\nfaithful Harry.\r\n\r\nHis sister contemplated him with eyes full of contempt. "What is the use\r\nof talking to such a silly?" she said. "Not the dress! She never looked\r\none ten-thousandth part so well all her life, and that you know just as\r\nwell as me."\r\n\r\nNo, she had never looked so well all her nineteen years. Her dress was\r\nsimple indeed, but it was perfect in all its details, for Mrs. John had\r\nremembered everything. The flowers were artificial, which also was the\r\nfashion then, but they were from Forster\'s, procured by Roland Ashton\r\nand brought down by his sister Emma, who had arrived that same\r\nafternoon. The pearls were beautiful, more beautiful than any other\r\nornament in the room. Hester stood beside her cousin to receive the\r\nguests with a sense that there were no imperfections about her. In the\r\ndays of the washed muslin there was always a fear that the flounces were\r\nnot quite even, the bows were not quite firmly sewed on, or something\r\nelse which at any moment might come to pieces and betray the\r\nhomemadeness of the garment. But she stood up in her virgin robes with a\r\nsense of delightful security--a knowledge that all was complete, which\r\nwas exhilarating to her spirits. She was not the one white swan in this\r\nlittle provincial party: there were faces quite as lovely as Hester\'s,\r\nwhich, as a matter of fact, was not so perfect as her dress; but there\r\nwas no one to whom the anticipated pleasure was so entirely ideal. Her\r\nmind did not come down to practical delights at all. She was going to be\r\nhappy--was she going to be happy? How does it feel to be happy? These\r\nwere the questions in her mind. She had been so, she was aware, as\r\nchildren are, without knowing it; but this would be conscious, whatever\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nThe dancing began. It was a very pretty scene, and Hester, not in\r\nherself perhaps so overwhelmingly gay as the others about her, was\r\ncaught upon that stream of careless youth and carried with it in spite\r\nof herself. An atmosphere of pleasure was about her; eyes looked upon\r\nher admiring, almost caressing, every glance was pleasant; the rougher\r\npart of the world had disappeared altogether. It was as if there was\r\nnothing but merry dancers, laughing engagements, an interchange of\r\nenjoyment, all about. Happy! Well, she could not say that this was not\r\nhappiness. It might be so, for anything she could tell. There was not\r\nmuch that was ideal about it, but yet--. Just as she was thinking this,\r\nshe felt in a moment of repose her hand suddenly taken, drawn into some\r\none else\'s hand: and, looking round suddenly, saw Edward close to her,\r\nlooking at her with a subdued glow in his eyes, a look of admiration and\r\nwonder. It was quite a steady, straightforward gaze--not furtive, not\r\nflying. She started at the touch and look, and attempted to draw away\r\nher hand, but it was held fast. But he had not lifted her hand, he had\r\ntaken it where it hung half-veiled by her furbelows, and he had turned\r\nhis back towards the company isolating her in a corner, while he\r\ninspected her. He drew a long breath apparently of satisfaction and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"I am late," he said, "but this was worth waiting for. Cinderella, where\r\nhave you left your pumpkin coach?"\r\n\r\nHester\'s brow grew dark, her heart seemed to swoon away in her bosom\r\naltogether, then came to itself again with a rush of heat and\r\nindignation. She wrenched her hand out of that hold, a flood of colour\r\ncame to her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean to insult me," she said; "but this is not a place to\r\ninsult me--I am among friends here."\r\n\r\n"Why do you say so, Hester? Insult you! What an ungenerous thing to say!\r\nas if I was in the habit of doing so, and must not here because you have\r\nfriends. What a cruel thing to say!"\r\n\r\n"Would you rather have it in your power to insult me always?" said\r\nHester. Her lip began to quiver a little. What an odious thing it is to\r\nbe a woman, to be always ready, when you would rather not, when you want\r\nto show yourself most strong and angry, to cry! She clenched her hands\r\ntightly to keep herself down. "I am no cinder-wench, Mr. Edward Vernon,"\r\nshe said. "I have given you no reason to call me so. It is a pitiful\r\nthing for a man to notice a girl\'s dress. If I am dressed poorly, I am\r\nnot ashamed of it. It is not a sin to be poor."\r\n\r\n"Hester! a girl of your sense to be so foolish! How could I mean that?\r\nWhat I meant was, that you have come out glorious, like the moon from\r\nthe clouds. Nothing could be sweeter than that little house-frock you\r\nused to wear out on the Common. I liked it better than all the finery.\r\nBut to-night you are like a young princess. Why did I say Cinderella?\r\nHeaven knows; just because I was dazzled and bewildered, and because you\r\nare a princess; and the pleasure of seeing you made my head go round.\r\nHave I made my peace? Well then, there\'s a darling, turn round and let\r\nme see you, that I may see all the finery, and everything that makes you\r\nso lovely, in detail."\r\n\r\n"You may have made it a little better," said Hester; "but why do you go\r\non talking like that? I am neither lovely nor a darling; and you shall\r\nnot say so--you! that would not see me if this, instead of being Ellen\'s\r\nhouse, were the Grange."\r\n\r\n"You have me at your mercy there," said Edward. "I confess you have me\r\nat your mercy, there."\r\n\r\nUpon which Hester melted a little, and, perceiving the abashed look\r\nwhich he had put on, began to falter, and presently found herself guilty\r\nof the commonplace expedient of asking if he did not think it a pretty\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very pretty," said Edward; "that is to say, I don\'t know anything\r\nabout it. I looked for one individual when I came in, and as, as soon as\r\nI found her, she began to bully me violently, I feel a little muddled,\r\nand I don\'t know what to think. Give me a little time."\r\n\r\nBy this time, as was natural, Hester began to think herself a monster of\r\nfolly and unkindness, and to feel that she was ready to sink through the\r\nfloor with shame.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to be cross," she said. "I thought--that is, I had been\r\nlooking--that is----"\r\n\r\nHere she stopped, feeling herself get deeper and deeper into difficulty.\r\nHer countenance changed from the girlish freshness of complexion, which\r\neverybody admired, into a burning red; her eyelids unable to keep up,\r\nher heart beating as if it would burst through silk slip, and tarlatan\r\n_bouillon\xe9e_, and all----\r\n\r\n"Come, let us have this dance. I like the music," said Edward, drawing\r\nher hand suddenly through his arm.\r\n\r\n"But I am engaged."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind, if you are engaged. You were engaged to me before ever\r\nyou came," he said, lightly, and drew her into the whirl. Hester was at\r\nthe age (in society), when, to throw over a partner, looks like the\r\nguiltiest treachery. She could not take any pleasure in the dance, for\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\n"I must go and ask his pardon. I am sure I am very sorry. I did not\r\nintend to be so false; and there he is, poor man, not dancing."\r\n\r\nThese words Hester said breathless over the shoulder of the enterprising\r\nintruder, who had carried her off under the victim\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Poor man!" Edward echoed, with a laugh. "I am glad he has nobody to\r\ndance with. What right had he to engage you? and you regret him; and you\r\ndon\'t want me."\r\n\r\nHere Hester rebuked her cousin.\r\n\r\n"You have no right to say so. I might want--I mean I might like very\r\nwell to dance with you when you condescended to ask me; but not to be\r\nrun away with, without a word, and made to do a false thing. False\r\nthings are what I hate."\r\n\r\n"You say that with such meaning. You must be thinking of more than a\r\ndance. Am I one of the false things you hate?"\r\n\r\n"I do not hate you," said Hester, as they came to a pause, looking\r\ndoubtfully into his face; "but I do not think you are very true."\r\n\r\n"You mean I don\'t blurt out everything I mean, and am capable now and\r\nthen of keeping something to myself. I can keep my own counsel--not like\r\nthat fellow there," Edward permitted himself to say: which was a\r\nmistake; for Hester looked up and saw the gaze of honest Harry dwelling\r\nupon her with some regret, and much tenderness, and was touched at once\r\nwith sympathy and indignation.\r\n\r\n"If you mean Harry, no one could ever doubt _him_," said Hester, in the\r\nwarmth of her compunction. "If he is your friend, he is always your\r\nfriend. He is not afraid of what any one says."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Hester, you are always harping on that string," said Edward. "I\r\nknow what you mean; but can\'t you understand the position I am in, and\r\nunderstand _me_? Don\'t you know I am in bondage? I cannot say my soul is\r\nmy own. I dare not think nor feel but as I am told. If I were to follow\r\nmy own heart without disguise, I think it would be my ruin. We will not\r\nname any names, but you know. And I know what you think about that big\r\nstupid there, but you are mistaken. It is not that his heart is more\r\ntrue. It is that he has not brains enough to see what is liked and what\r\nis not liked. He is not even sympathetic enough. He does what he likes,\r\nand never considers if it is good for him or not."\r\n\r\n"Sympathetic!" cried Hester. "He is sympathetic with me. When he sees me\r\nlonely and neglected he comes and stands beside me. If he cannot do\r\nmore, he does do that. I don\'t pretend to say that he is very amusing,"\r\nshe continued, with a laugh, "but he does what he can. He stands by me.\r\nOh! failing other things that are better, I like that. Rather than being\r\nsympathetic with Catherine, I like him to sympathise with me."\r\n\r\n"There is no question of names," said Edward, "We must not get personal.\r\nBut I am glad you find Harry amusing. I never heard that he was so\r\nbefore. He is standing by Ellen now; that\'s what he\'s here for. They\r\nwill come to grief, these young people. They are beginning a great deal\r\ntoo fast. You know young Merridew, or old Merridew either, can never\r\nkeep up this. Ellen ought to know better. But Harry will have scope for\r\nthis great accomplishment that you appreciate so highly. He will have to\r\nstand by his sister."\r\n\r\n"And he will," Hester said.\r\n\r\nShe scarcely thought of the dancing, so much did this conversation--so\r\nunlike a conversation to be carried on in the whirl of a waltz--occupy\r\nher. It occurred to her now, as breath failed her, to remember how in\r\nall the accounts of a first ball she had ever read, the heroine had felt\r\nall other sentiments melt away in the rapturous pleasure of dancing with\r\nthe man of her heart. Novels were all Hester\'s experience. She\r\nremembered this, and it gave her a half comic, half miserable sensation\r\nto realise that she was not thinking about the dancing at all. She was\r\ncarrying on her duel with Edward. There was always a warm sense of\r\ngratification in that--a stirring up of all her faculties. She liked to\r\ngo on carrying it a step further, defying and puzzling him, and\r\nwondering on his side how much he meant, how much that he left to be\r\ninferred, was true. The heroine in a novel is generally the point of\r\neverybody\'s admiration in the ball-room, and to look at the perfection\r\nof the waltz which she and her lover enjoy so deeply, the whole\r\nassemblage stands still. But nothing of this kind occurred in Hester\'s\r\ncase. As she had so little experience, the chances are that she was by\r\nno means the best dancer in the room, and certainly Edward was not the\r\nother best. Their waltz was the means of carrying on the discussion\r\nwhich to both was the most attractive possibility. When she realised\r\nthis, Hester was a little amused, but likewise a good deal disappointed.\r\nShe felt a disagreeable limit thus placed to her power to enjoy.\r\n\r\n"Come into the conservatory," Edward said. "Don\'t you think you have had\r\nenough? Oh, it is your first ball. I suppose you like it; but I am\r\nbeginning to lose my relish for those sort of affairs."\r\n\r\n"You are not so old that you should give up dancing, Cousin Edward."\r\n\r\n"Old! No, I hope I am not old yet, and I don\'t intend to give up\r\ndancing; but I like to walk here better--with you. I like to talk\r\nbetter--with you. I like to see your face, Hester, and see how it\r\nchanges from kindness to wrath, from friendship to indignation, from a\r\npatient sense that I am endurable, to a violent consciousness---- Come\r\nand sit here."\r\n\r\n"You seem to think I never do anything but think of you: and that is the\r\ngreatest mistake," Hester said.\r\n\r\nUpon which he laughed. The place he had led her to was only partially\r\nlighted. There were many other groups scattered about among the plants\r\nand stands of flowers. Flirtation was openly recognised in this youthful\r\nhouse as one of the portions of the evening\'s entertainment, and large\r\nprovision made for it. There was nobody to notice with whom it was that\r\nEdward was amusing himself, and he felt fully disposed to take advantage\r\nof his opportunities. He laughed at Hester\'s indignant disclosures. "If\r\nyou did not think a little about me, dear, you would not notice so\r\ndistinctly my course of conduct in other places, you could not be sure\r\nthat it was much more agreeable to me, instead of standing by your side\r\nand trying to be as amusing as Harry, to lead down Mrs. Houseman and old\r\nLady Kearney to supper or to tea."\r\n\r\n"My mother should go out of the room before either of them," cried\r\nHester. "Do you know who she is? Sir John Westwood is her cousin: a\r\nduke\'s daughter once married into her family----"\r\n\r\n"I quite understand you and agree with you, Hester. It is nothing that\r\nshe is a perfect little gentlewoman, and has far better manners than any\r\nof us; but because she is a cousin to a heavy baronet, who is not good\r\nenough to tie her shoe----"\r\n\r\n"Edward!" The girl was so startled she could not believe her ears.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know very well what I am saying. You don\'t know me, that is all.\r\nYou think I am a natural snob, when I am only a snob by circumstances.\r\nYou yourself, Hester, do you really think your mother should stand upon\r\nher cousin and upon Lady Ethelinda (or whatever was her name), her\r\ngreat-grandmother, and not upon herself far better than either? I can\'t\r\nimagine you think that."\r\n\r\nHester was surprised and silenced for the moment. She had been so often\r\nreminded of the noble grandmother and the baronet cousin, and so hard\r\nput to it to find a ground of superiority on which her pride could take\r\nrefuge, that this sudden appeal to her better judgment bewildered her.\r\nShe was startled to find those advantages which were indisputable, and\r\nto which everybody deferred in theory, so boldly under-valued; but yet\r\nthe manner of doing it made her heart beat with pleasure. Yes; people\r\nthought her dear little mother silly, and Hester was aware that she was\r\nnot clever. Sometimes, in the depths of her own soul, she had chafed, as\r\nchildren will, at the poor lady\'s dulness and slowness of comprehension;\r\nbut she _was_ a perfect little gentlewoman. And he saw it! He felt in\r\nhis heart that she was above them all--not because of Lady Ethelinda\r\n(she was Lady Sarah in reality) and Sir John, but herself.\r\n\r\n"I did not know you were a Radical," she said. She knew nothing about\r\nRadicals, though instinctively in her heart she agreed with them. "I\r\nthought you cared for family and that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\nHester paused. She flung higher her young head, which was proud with\r\nlife and a sense of power unknown. "I should like to be a king\'s\r\ndaughter," she said, "or a great soldier\'s or a great statesman\'s. I\r\nshould like my name to mean something. I should like people to say, when\r\nthey hear it, that is----"\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t care much about Sir John?--that is what I thought. I am\r\nno Radical; I am all for decorum and established order and church and\r\nstate. How could you doubt that? But, by the way, there is a person whom\r\nneither of us like, who certainly has the kind of rank you prize. Don\'t\r\nyou know who I mean, Hester? When a stranger comes to Redborough, there\r\nis one name he is sure to hear. If she were a duchess she could not be\r\nbetter known. To be her relation carries a certain weight. We were\r\nalways a leading family in the place, I suppose. But why are we, for\r\ninstance, so much better than the Merridews and all the rest of the\r\nrespectable people? She has something to do with it, I can\'t deny,\r\nthough I don\'t like her any more than you."\r\n\r\n"Edward," cried Hester breathlessly, "about that we ought to understand\r\neach other. I have no reason to like Catherine. Yes, I will say her\r\nname; why shouldn\'t I? She has not liked me. I was only a child, and if\r\nI was saucy she might have forgiven me, all these years. But she has\r\ntaken the trouble on the contrary to humiliate me, to make me feel that\r\nI am nobody, which was unworthy. But you: she has been kind to you. She\r\nhas been more than kind--she has loved you. I have seen it in her eyes.\r\nShe thinks that nobody is worth thinking of in comparison with you.\r\nIf--if--who shall I say?--if Sir Walter Scott came here, or Mr.\r\nTennyson, she would rather have you. And yet, you that ought to be so\r\ngrateful, that ought to love her back, that ought to be proud--oh, I\r\nshould if I were you. If she were fond of me I should be proud. I hate\r\nall those wretched people who take from her hand, and then sneer and\r\nsnarl at her, like dogs--no, not like dogs: dogs are far nobler--like\r\ncats; that is better."\r\n\r\nHester\'s eyes were shining with eloquence and ardour; the little\r\nmovement of her head so proud, so animated, so full of visionary\r\npassion, threw back and gave a certain freedom to the hair which her\r\nmother called auburn. Her whole figure was full of that force and\r\nmeaning which is above beauty. Edward looked at her with smiling\r\nadmiration. If his conscience was touched, or his temper at least, he\r\ndid not show it.\r\n\r\n"Do you call me a cat?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am not in fun. I am as earnest as ever I can be. It is wicked, it\r\nis miserable, and I cannot understand you. All the others are as nothing\r\nin comparison with you."\r\n\r\nHe grew a little pale under this accusation; he would not meet it\r\ndirectly. "But you know," he said, "why she hates you. It is for your\r\nmother\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"My mother!" cried Hester astonished. "But no one could hate my mother."\r\nThe suggestion took away her breath.\r\n\r\n"It is true, all the same. I thought you did not know. She was to have\r\nmarried John Vernon, your father, and he preferred----that is the whole\r\naccount of it; then he got into trouble, and she had her revenge."\r\n\r\n"Did she ruin my father?" said Hester in a low whisper of horror.\r\n\r\n"I--don\'t know if it went so far as that," Edward said.\r\n\r\nA hesitation was in his speech. It was scarcely compunction, but doubt,\r\nlest a statement of this kind, so easily to be contradicted, might be\r\ninjudicious on his part--but then, who would speak to Hester on such a\r\nsubject? And her mother was a little fool, and, most likely, did not\r\nknow, or would be sure to mistake, the circumstances.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let us talk of that: it is so long past," he said; "and here is a\r\nwretch, a scoundrel, coming up with his eye fixed upon you as if he was\r\na partner. How I loathe all your partners, Hester! ind, the rest of the\r\ndances are for me. I shall watch for you as soon as you have shaken that\r\nfellow off."\r\n\r\nBut Hester did not care for the dances that followed. She went through\r\nthem indifferently, faithful to the partners who had presented\r\nthemselves before he came on the scene; and, indeed, the conversation in\r\nthe conservatory had not drawn her nearer to Edward. It had given her a\r\ngreat deal to think of. She had not time in the whirl and fluster of\r\nthis gaiety to think it all out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                            A NEW COMPETITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma Ashton had brought Hester\'s flowers, and though she was tired with\r\nher journey, had taken a great deal of interest in Hester\'s dress. When\r\nshe came in to show herself to the old people in her white robes before\r\nher ball, the stranger had surveyed her with much attention. She had\r\nkissed her slowly and deliberately when introduced to her.\r\n\r\n"Roland told me a great deal about you," she said. "I suppose we are\r\ncousins too. You look very nice. I hope you will enjoy yourself." She\r\nwas a very deliberate, measured talker, doing everything steadily. When\r\nHester was gone, she resumed her seat beside her grandmother.\r\n\r\n"Roland admires her very much. She is pretty, but I should think she had\r\na great deal of temper," Emma said.\r\n\r\n"Temper is scarcely the word. She is a great favourite with your\r\ngrandfather--and with me too--with me too."\r\n\r\n"Roland told me," said Emma. "When I say temper I don\'t mean any harm.\r\nShe would do much better for Roland if she had a good deal of temper.\r\nThat is what he wants to keep him straight; for a man ought not to flirt\r\nafter he is married, and he will, unless she keeps him in order."\r\n\r\n"Married! but is he likely to marry? I did not hear anything of it."\r\n\r\n"When a man can keep a sister he can keep a wife," said Emma, announcing\r\nthis fact as if it were an oracle. "He has a house, and everything that\r\nis necessary. And of course I shall not stand in his way. I can go back\r\nto Elinor, where I am a sort of head nurse, and cheap enough at the\r\nmoney; or I can be a governess. That touches his pride--he does not like\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nHere the old captain came back, who had been putting his favourite\r\ncarefully into the fly.\r\n\r\n"Why has she not her mother with her?" he said. "I like a girl to have\r\nher mother with her. It is pretty, it is natural. I do not like those\r\nnew-fashioned, independent ways."\r\n\r\n"But they are much more convenient, grandpapa," said Emma. "Think how I\r\nshould have been situated had a girl always wanted her mother with her.\r\nElinor, with her family, cannot always be going out; and when she goes\r\nshe likes to amuse herself, she does not go for me. A girl going out\r\nwith her mother means a devoted sort of old lady like the mothers in\r\nbooks. Such nonsense, you know--for a girl\'s mother, when she is\r\neighteen or so, is rarely more than forty, and people of forty like\r\namusement just as much as we do. It is better, on the whole, I think,\r\nwhen every one is for herself."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is not my opinion," said the old captain, shortly.\r\n\r\nHe was accustomed to do most of the talking himself, and it startled him\r\nto have it thus taken out of his hand.\r\n\r\n"I suppose an invitation will come for me," said Emma calmly, "as soon\r\nas they know I am here; and then Hester and I can go together. Roland\r\nsaid there was no dancing, but I think it always safest to bring a\r\nball-dress. It is not heavy, though it takes up a good deal of room; but\r\nthen you can always take one box into the carriage, and the railway only\r\ncharges by weight."\r\n\r\n"Roland is very busy, I suppose, my dear. You only see him in the\r\nevening?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t always see him in the evening. He has his own friends, and I am\r\ngetting a few acquaintances too. If he gives me my living and very\r\nlittle to do I ought to be grateful to him, but I would not let him give\r\nup his own amusements for me. That wouldn\'t be fair. Oh yes, he is very\r\nbusy. He has found so many new people to do business for down here."\r\n\r\n"I hope to goodness he won\'t speculate with their money and ruin them,"\r\nCaptain Morgan said.\r\n\r\n"Ruin! oh, I hope not. But Roland says there is nothing so exciting as\r\nto be on the verge of ruin. He says it is better than a play: for\r\ninstead of looking on at the acting, the acting is going on inside of\r\nyou. But it is his trade to speculate, isn\'t it, grandpapa? That is what\r\nhe is there for, and he is very good at it they say. I suppose this girl\r\nhas not any money? When they are pretty and nice they seldom have."\r\n\r\n"What girl?" said Captain Morgan, almost haughtily--as haughtily and\r\nharshly as the old gentleman could persuade himself to speak.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t he know, grandmamma?" said Emma, "the girl Roland admired so\r\nmuch: and she would just do for him, if she had some money: but so nice\r\nlooking as he is, and so well established in business, I don\'t think,\r\nunless there is money, he should throw himself away."\r\n\r\n"Is it Hester Vernon that you mean?" asked the captain in an angry\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"She does not mean any harm, Rowley. Don\'t you see Hester is just to her\r\nan abstract person, not the dear girl she is to you and me. And Emma,"\r\nsaid the old lady almost with timidity, "I fear your ball-dress will not\r\nbe of much use. Mrs. Merridew will not think of inviting you--she will\r\nnot perhaps know you are here."\r\n\r\n"Roland met her, grandmamma," said Emma calmly. "He told me; we are all\r\ncousins, I believe. She will be sure to invite me, or if not, you will\r\nbe able to get me an invitation. People always exert themselves to get\r\ninvitations for girls. It is like helping young men on in business. We\r\ncannot go and make acquaintances for ourselves as young men go and set\r\nup offices, but we must have our chance, you know, as well. Of course,"\r\nsaid Emma in her deliberate way, "it is for everybody\'s advantage that\r\nwe should have our chance as well as the men."\r\n\r\n"And what do you call your chance?" said Captain Morgan. He planted\r\nhimself in the front of the fireplace with his legs very wide apart,\r\nwhich, as his wife well understood, meant war.\r\n\r\n"My old man," she said, "what do you know about the talk of girls? They\r\nhave one way of thinking, and we have another. They are young, and we\r\nare old."\r\n\r\n"Hester is younger than she is," said the captain, "let her alone. She\r\nis as ready to talk as there is any need to be."\r\n\r\n"My chance, grandpapa?" said Emma with a slow little laugh. "It is not\r\nnecessary, is it, to explain? a girl\'s chance is in making--friends. If\r\none goes for a governess one\'s family does not like it. They would\r\nrather you were your sister\'s head nurse with all the trouble, and\r\nwithout any pay. Roland has taken me now--and I do not require to work\r\nfor my living; but it is not so very cheerful with Roland that I should\r\nnot wish--if I could--to make a change. We must all think of ourselves\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the old lady in her soft voice, "in one way that is very\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\n"It is very true, I think, in every way. It might be cheerful for me if\r\nRoland were to spend his evenings at home as Tom Pinch in Dickens did\r\nwith his sister. But then Roland is not a bit like Tom Pinch, and I said\r\nto him when I came, \'You are not to change your life for me.\' So that\r\nsometimes, you know, I am in the house all alone all day, and then if he\r\nis out to dinner, or if he has any evening engagement, I am alone all\r\nthe night. And if he were to marry, why there would be an end of me\r\naltogether. So you see, grandmamma, wherever I am, it is very natural\r\nthat I should wish to have my chance."\r\n\r\n"How old are you?" said the captain abruptly.\r\n\r\n"I shall be twenty-three at Christmas," said Emma, raising her eyes to\r\nhis face. She was curious to know why he asked--whether he thought her\r\nolder, or younger than her age, whether he thought it was strange she\r\nshould still be unmarried. "I was kept very much out of sight when I was\r\nwith Elinor," she said half apologetically. She had not had her "chance"\r\nas she had always wished to have. She had not been very well treated she\r\nfelt in this life, the youngest of seven. She had been passed on from\r\none to another of her married sisters to make herself useful. All of\r\nthem had said that Emma must "come out," but no one had taken any\r\ntrouble about it. She had to scramble for a dress, a very cheap one, and\r\nto coax Elinor into taking her to some little local merrymaking, and so\r\nopening, as it were, the gates of society. As soon as she could say that\r\nshe was "out" Emma had kept the idea of having "her chance" of making\r\nfriends and getting invitations always before her. But her opportunities\r\nhad not been great, and Elinor had not devoted herself to her younger\r\nsister. She was still young enough to amuse herself, and it had not\r\noccurred to her to put so unimportant a person as Emma in the\r\nforeground. So that she had never been allowed to have much of a\r\n"chance." Emma had not much experience of the world. Of the many novels\r\nshe had read, and which were her guides to life, a great many devoted\r\nthemselves to the history and description of young ladies at whose\r\nentrance into a ball-room every man present fell metaphorically on his\r\nknees. She was acquainted with many evening parties in fiction at which\r\nthe fate of countless young men and women was decided. The smallest\r\ndance would be represented there as bringing people together who were\r\nnever more to be sundered. Emma herself had not produced any such\r\nsensation at the small parties she had hitherto gone to, but she felt\r\nthat this glory must be awaiting her, and especially that in a new place\r\nlike this Redborough, in some waltz or other, among some unknown\r\nassembly she should meet her fate.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it is not to be wondered at that she should lose no\r\ntime in announcing her certainty of an invitation to anything so likely\r\nto conduce to such an object as Ellen Merridew\'s dancing teas. She had\r\ncome down to Redborough prepared to be cousin to all the world. Roland,\r\nindeed, had taken pains to explain that Catherine Vernon\'s cousins were\r\nnot actually _her_ cousins, but she had thought it better in many ways\r\nto ignore this, and to descend upon the new scene with the most amiable\r\ndisposition to embrace as a near relative every Vernon presented to her.\r\nAmong them all, what could be more likely than that her fate should be\r\nfound? She meant no harm to anybody. It would be doing no harm,\r\ncertainly, if any young man fell in love with her, to make him happy by\r\nmarrying him. She felt most strongly the supreme necessity of marrying\r\nfor her own part. She had no disguise with herself on this subject, and\r\nwith her grandparents she did not think it necessary to have any\r\ndisguise. Everything was involved in it. Roland had taken the\r\nresponsibility of her upon himself and given her a home, with very\r\nlittle to do, and enough to make her sufficiently comfortable. Emma had\r\nalways been brought up to consider everything from a strictly practical\r\npoint of view. She had been taught to believe that she had no right to\r\nanything, that it was out of their bounty and charity that her brothers\r\nand sisters, now one, now another, afforded her a temporary home. And\r\nshe was very comfortable with Roland--but if he were to marry, what\r\nthen? The comfort of having a home of her own, a husband of her own with\r\na settled income, was to Emma in prospect the crown of all good things.\r\nShe would not have been ashamed to say so if necessary; and it was in\r\nballs and parties and picnics and social meetings generally, that a\r\nyoung woman had her chance of suddenly obtaining, by looking pretty, by\r\nmaking herself agreeable, all these good things at a stroke. She made up\r\nher mind at once that heaven and earth must be moved to get her an\r\ninvitation to Mrs. Algernon Merridew\'s _Th\xe9s Dansantes_. She would not\r\ntake, she said to herself, any denial. She would see all the Redborough\r\npeople there, among whom there must certainly be some individuals of the\r\nclass upon which depended Emma\'s fate. As she sat unfolding so much of\r\nthis as was needful with a calm confidence in being understood, her\r\ngrandparents, with a sort of stupefaction, listened and looked on. Emma\r\nwas knitting all the time in the German way, with a very slight swift\r\nmovement of her fingers and without looking at her work. She spoke\r\nslowly, with an air of such undoubted fact and practical commonplace\r\nabout her, that those two old people, who each in their several ways\r\nindulged in fancy and sentiment, were daunted and silenced. Emma spoke\r\nin a sort of saintly simplicity, as not knowing that anything beyond\r\nthose solid primitive foundations, anything like sentiment or fancy, was\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nShe was not handsome like her brother, and yet there was something\r\nremarkable about her appearance which some people admired. Her hair was\r\ndark, her features sufficiently good. The strange thing in her was her\r\neyes, which were very light in colour--so light, that sometimes there\r\nseemed no colour at all in them. This was not beautiful, but it was\r\n_bizarre_ and unusual, and as such Emma had her admirers. But it was\r\nonly in this particular, not in mind or thoughts, that there was\r\nanything in her out of the way.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the old captain to his wife, when, after having yawned\r\nsoftly over her work as a signal and preparation for bed-going, Emma\r\nrose with a smile at half-past ten, and kissed them both, and asked if\r\nshe might have her candle. "I must not keep you out of bed," she said,\r\nwith that look of complacent consideration which, notwithstanding, was\r\nquite innocent and referred to her own circumscribed horizon, in which\r\neverything connected with herself was well in the foreground. Mrs.\r\nMorgan did not meet her husband\'s eye as she had met it when Roland was\r\nthe visitor.\r\n\r\n"She has not been well brought up, poor thing!" the old lady said. "She\r\nhas had no one to care for her--and, Rowley, she is our own flesh and\r\nblood."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the wonderful thing," the captain said, "Katie\'s child! My dear,\r\nI give it up; there seems no reason and no sense in it. I cannot think\r\nwhat the Lord can mean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, Rowley--nothing, nothing that is not good."\r\n\r\n"One would say--that there must be just a crowd of souls ready to put\r\ninto the new little bodies, and that one must slip down before the other\r\nthat ought to come;--like that vile cad, you know, that slipped into the\r\npool of Siloam before the poor fellow that had no servant could shuffle\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"And that was all the better for your poor fellow as it turned out,\r\nRowley, for he got his healing more sweetly out of the very hand----\r\nAnd, poor little spirit, if it was not intended for this body, I can\'t\r\nthink it has got very much by its deceit," Mrs. Morgan said, with a\r\nlittle laugh.\r\n\r\nBut the captain did not laugh. There was consternation in his soul.\r\n\r\n"A girl," he said, "with her eyes open to all chances, looking out for a\r\nhusband, and seriously thinking that is the right thing to do--to come\r\nfrom you and me, Mary--to come from you and me!"\r\n\r\nThe old lady gave him her hands that he might help her out of her chair,\r\nand when she stood upright, tottering a little--for she was not strong\r\nupon her legs--she gave him a little playful tap with her finger upon\r\nhis old cheek.\r\n\r\n"You are just a high-flown old sentimentalist," she said. "There is no\r\nharm in her. She is only prose to your poetry--which I\'ve always been\r\nall our lives, and you\'ve said so many a day."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t blaspheme, old woman, don\'t blaspheme," the captain said.\r\n\r\nBut next day, when Hester came in to give them the account--which she\r\nknew the old people would expect--of all that had happened, Emma lost no\r\ntime in making her desires known.\r\n\r\n"It must have been a very pretty party," she said; "a conservatory\r\nlighted like that is always so nice. It is cool to sit in after you have\r\ngot heated with dancing. I wish I could have seen you all enjoying\r\nyourselves. I am so fond of dancing, and I don\'t get much; for Roland\r\ndoes not care for dancing parties, and at Waltham Elinor never had time.\r\nI suppose you had an invitation, grandmamma, though you are too old to\r\ngo?"\r\n\r\nHere Hester explained, wondering, that there were very few chaperons,\r\nand nobody asked but people who were known to dance.\r\n\r\n"Ellen says it only tires the others, and what is the use?" Hester said.\r\n\r\n"That is very true; she must be judicious--she must have right notions.\r\nWhen do you think my invitation will come, grandmamma? I suppose people\r\nwill call when they know I am here?"\r\n\r\nHere there was a little pause, for even Mrs. Morgan was taken aback by\r\nthis question, and did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said Hester blushing, after a minute\'s silence, "that if\r\nMiss Ashton would--like it so very much----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I should, of course, _very_ much. I want to know the Redborough\r\npeople. I like to know the people wherever I go. It is so dull knowing\r\nno one," Emma said. "And then it would be so convenient, you know, for I\r\ncould go with--you----"\r\n\r\nTo this Hester did not know what to reply; but it was well in one way\r\nthat the new comer took it all for granted and gave no trouble. Emma\r\nmade no account of embarrassed looks and hesitating replies. She did not\r\neven notice them, but pursued her own way deliberately, impervious to\r\nany discouragement, which was more equivocal than a flat "No." She had\r\nbeen used to "noes" very flat and uncompromising, and everything less\r\nseemed to her to mean assent. When she had disposed, as she thought, of\r\nthis question, she went on to another which was of still greater\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n"But I cannot expect Cousin Catherine to call upon me," she said\r\ncomposedly. "She is too old, and she is always treated as a kind of\r\nprincess, Roland says. And you are too old to take me, grandmamma.\r\nPerhaps I could go with Hester. Would that be the right thing? For they\r\nall say I must not neglect Cousin Catherine."\r\n\r\nHester looked aghast upon the young woman, who contemplated them so\r\ncalmly over her knitting, and talked of neglecting Catherine, and being\r\ncalled upon by the sovereign of society, who left even the Redborough\r\nmagnates out, and called only upon those who pleased her. Emma went on\r\nquite placidly, knitting with the ends of her fingers in that phlegmatic\r\nGerman way, which is an offence to English knitters. The stocking went\r\non dropping in longer and longer lengths from her hands, as if twirling\r\nupon a leisurely wheel. She had explained that they were knickerbocker\r\nstockings, for Elinor\'s boys, which she was always busy with.\r\n\r\n"She gives me so much for them, for every dozen pairs--and the wool; I\r\nmake a little by it, and it is much cheaper for her than the shops."\r\n\r\n"Your grandfather will take you--some day," said Mrs. Morgan hastily.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that will do very well, but it ought to be soon," Emma said. She\r\nreturned to the subject after Hester had given a further account of the\r\nmerrymaking of the previous night.\r\n\r\n"Are you all great friends?" said Emma, "or are there little factions as\r\nthere generally are in families? Elinor and William\'s wife used always\r\nto be having tiffs, and then the rest of us had to take sides. I never\r\nwould. I thought it was wisest not. I was nobody, you know, only the\r\nyoungest. And when one has to stay a few months here and a few months\r\nthere, without any home of one\'s own, it is best to keep out of all\r\nthese quarrels, don\'t you think, grandmamma? Roland said there were some\r\nold things living here, some old maids that were spiteful."\r\n\r\nNow it is curious enough that though the Miss Vernon-Ridgways were not\r\nat all approved by their neighbours, it gave these ladies a shock to\r\nhear an outsider describe them thus.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that," said Mrs. Morgan, almost impatiently. "Are you going\r\nfurther, Hester? If you want my old man, tell him not to stay out too\r\nlong, for the wind is cold to-day."\r\n\r\n"I am going to Redborough," Hester said. "I have some things to do for\r\nmamma."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must take me with you," said Emma--"just one moment till I have\r\nturned this heel. I never like to leave a heel midway. I want to see\r\nRedborough of all things. Grandmamma, you will not mind me leaving\r\nyou--I want to see all I can, as I don\'t know how long I may stay."\r\n\r\n"Do you mind, Hester?" the old lady said in a little alarm, as having\r\nfinished the heel, and put her knitting carefully away in a long basket\r\nmade to hold the length of her needles, Emma went up stairs to get her\r\nhat. Hester laughed a little and hesitated, for though she was not moved\r\nto enthusiasm by Emma, she was young enough to like the novelty of a new\r\ncompanion, whoever that might be.\r\n\r\n"I hope she will not make me take her to see Catherine. Catherine would\r\nnot be very gracious to any one whom I brought her. Dear Mrs. Morgan, I\r\nwanted to ask you--Was Catherine----Did Catherine----"\r\n\r\n"What, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing--I can\'t tell you before any one. It was something I heard\r\nfrom----last night. Yes, I am quite ready, Miss Ashton," Hester said.\r\n\r\n"It is grand to be called Miss Ashton, but I wish you would say Emma. It\r\nmakes me feel as if I were some one\'s governess when you say Miss\r\nAshton. I nearly was," said Emma. "You know we are a large family, eight\r\nof us, and we had no money. I am sure I can\'t tell how we managed to\r\ngrow up. It was thanks to Elinor I believe; she was the only one who\r\ncould manage papa. And now they are all provided for, but only me.\r\nElinor and Bee made very good marriages, and Kate didn\'t do so badly\r\neither, but she\'s gone to India. The others were to help me between\r\nthem, but that is not very nice. They are always scheming to have as\r\nlittle of you as they can, and to make the others have too much. I never\r\nwould give in to that. I always kept to my day. I used to say \'No, Bee,\r\nmy time is up. I don\'t mind where you put me (for I never made any fuss\r\nin that sort of way, it turns the servants against you), I can sleep\r\nanywhere, but you must keep your turn. Elinor sha\'n\'t be put upon if I\r\ncan help it,\' and the short and the long of it was that I had as nearly\r\nas possible taken a governess\'s place."\r\n\r\n"That would have been better surely--to be independent," Hester said.\r\n\r\n"In some ways. To have a paid salary would be very nice--but it hurts a\r\ngirl\'s chance. Oh, yes, it does," said Emma, "there is no doubt of it:\r\npeople say not when they want to coax you into it, but it does--and as\r\nall the others have married so well, of course I was very unwilling to\r\ndo anything to damage my chance."\r\n\r\n"What was your chance?" said Hester with a set countenance: partly she\r\ndid not know, and partly from the context she divined, and meant to\r\ncrush her companion with lofty indignation: but Emma was not quick\r\nenough to perceive the moral disapproval. She was not even conscious\r\nthat it was possible to disapprove of such an elemental necessity.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know very well," she said with a little laugh. "I have never\r\nbeen a flirt. I haven\'t got any inclination that way. Of course in my\r\nposition I would think it my duty to consider any offer. But I was very\r\nnearly driven to the governessing," she continued calmly. "Elinor had\r\nvisitors coming, and Bee was so ill-natured as to start painting and\r\npapering just as I was due there. Can you imagine anything more nasty?\r\njust to be able to say she could not take me in! I just said I must take\r\na situation, and they were in a way. But I do really believe I should\r\nhave done it had it not been for Roland. He said it would suit him very\r\nwell to have me. He had just got a house of his own, you know, and I\r\ncould be of use to him. So he took me, which was very kind. It is a\r\nlittle dull after being used to children, but I have scarcely anything\r\nto do, and he gives me a little allowance for my clothes. Don\'t you\r\nthink it is very kind?"\r\n\r\n"I would much rather be a governess," Hester said with a glow of\r\nindignant pride. This matter-of-fact description of the state of\r\ndependence, which was made without any sense of injury at all, with the\r\ncomposure of an individual fully capable of holding her own and looking\r\nfor nothing else, had an effect upon her sensitive mind which it is\r\nimpossible to describe. She shrank from the revelation as if it had been\r\nsomething terrible; and yet it was not terrible at all, but the most\r\ncalm historic account of a state of affairs which seemed perfectly\r\nnatural to every one concerned. Emma knew that she would herself have\r\nemployed any possible expedient to get rid of an unnecessary member of\r\nher household, especially such a detrimental as "the youngest"--and she\r\nwas not angry with Bee.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you don\'t know children," said Emma serenely. "I have been used to\r\nthem all my life, and I know what demons they are; and then it does so\r\nspoil your chances in life. Being with Roland is very nice you know, he\r\nnever orders me about, and he gives me an allowance for my clothes, as I\r\ntold you. But it is much duller. At Elinor\'s and Bee\'s, and even at\r\nWilliam\'s, there\'s a little life going on. Now and then you can\'t help\r\nseeing people. Even when your sisters don\'t wish it, people will ask you\r\nout when they know you\'re there. And I must say that for Elinor, that\r\nwhen she\'s not worried she does take a little trouble about you, and\r\nalways likes to see you look nice. To be sure with five boys and a\r\nhusband in business, she is worried," Emma added with impartiality,\r\n"most of the time. What is that big house, that red one, so near the\r\nroad? Nice people ought to live there."\r\n\r\n"That is the Grange," said Hester, with a sudden flush, "that is\r\nCatherine Vernon\'s house."\r\n\r\n"Oh--h! But then why should I lose any time? It would look better that I\r\nshould go at once, the very first day. I suppose you run in whenever you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nHester\'s countenance flamed more than ever. "I never go--except when I\r\ngo with my mother. Catherine would not care to see you with me. She is\r\nvery fond of your grandfather and grandmother--but not so fond of us.\r\nAnd she is quite right, we don\'t deserve it so much," Hester said,\r\nflinging back her young head with that movement of natural pride which\r\nbelonged to her. Just then, to make the situation more complicated,\r\nEdward came out from the gate, and seeing the two figures on the road,\r\nhesitated for a moment, conscious of Catherine\'s eye behind him, and\r\nHester\'s keen consciousness before.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Emma again, "then there _are_ factions? I am sure I am very\r\nglad grandpapa is on Catherine\'s side; for Elinor said, and then Roland\r\ntold me---- Who is that? Oh, then, there are _men_ there? I thought she\r\nlived alone. He looks rather nice, though I like men to be taller than\r\nthat. Mind you introduce me, and walk a little faster please, before he\r\ngets away."\r\n\r\nHester\'s response to this was naturally the indignant one of walking\r\nmore slowly, so as to give the hesitating figure at the gate full time\r\nto get away. But Edward had thought better of it. On the whole, he found\r\nit more undesirable to encounter Hester\'s disdain than anything\r\nCatherine would be likely to say. And just at that hour after luncheon\r\nCatherine generally abandoned her seat in the window. It was true that\r\nhe very seldom came back to lunch. He advanced accordingly a few steps\r\nfrom the door, and held out his hand. "I am glad to see you are none the\r\nworse of our dissipations last night," he said.\r\n\r\n"Introduce me," said Emma, keeping her place close to Hester\'s side, "we\r\nare all cousins together, though we don\'t know each other. I wanted to\r\ngo in at once to see Cousin Catherine, whom I have heard of all my life;\r\nbut she will not let me. Perhaps you will mention it to Cousin\r\nCatherine. I will come as soon as I can get grandpapa to bring me. It is\r\nso much more formal than I thought. Among relations generally one runs\r\nout and in, and never thinks twice, but that does not seem to be your\r\nway here."\r\n\r\n"No, it is not our way here. We hold each other at arm\'s length. We are\r\nnot even civil if we can help it," said Edward, with a laugh and a\r\nglance at Hester, who stood, the impersonation of unwilling politeness,\r\nholding herself back, in an attitude which said as plainly as words,\r\nthat though their way was the same she did not choose to be accompanied,\r\nby him, along even that common way.\r\n\r\n"I see," said Emma. "I am sure I am very sorry I made you stand and\r\ntalk, Hester, when you dislike it so much. Of course, among relations\r\none understands all that. Do you live here? I remember now Roland told\r\nme there were some gentlemen-cousins, but I am quite a stranger, and I\r\ndon\'t know anything. Hester is going to take me to see the little town."\r\n\r\n"You must not say \'little town\' to any of the Redborough people, Miss\r\nAshton."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mustn\'t I? At Waltham nobody minds. I should like to see the Bank\r\nwhere all the Vernon money comes from. The Vernon money has never done\r\nus any good I believe, but still when one is connected with money one\r\nlikes to see all about it at least. Do you think, Hester, this gentleman\r\nwould be so good as to see about my invitation? I don\'t know if Mrs.\r\n----, I forget her name, who gives the dances--is your sister, Mr.\r\nVernon."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Merridew is my cousin," said Edward.\r\n\r\n"Oh, cousin, is it? I suppose we are all cousins. Naturally I should\r\nlike an invitation: but I suppose it is because of the splits in the\r\nfamily, grandmamma doesn\'t seem to wish to do anything about it, and\r\nHester hesitated, you know, just as you hesitated, Mr. Vernon, before\r\nyou came to speak to us. What a pity that there should be such to-does:\r\nbut where there are a large number of people in a family, of course it\r\ncan\'t always be helped. I have always found gentlemen were more\r\ngood-natured than ladies about getting one invitations. If you were to\r\ntell Mrs. Merridew I am here, even if she didn\'t think it right to call\r\nas most people would, at least she might send me a ticket. I can\'t have\r\nanything to do with either side, seeing I only arrived yesterday, and\r\ndon\'t know a word about it: but I do like to make acquaintance with a\r\nplace wherever I go."\r\n\r\n"I will see that my cousin sends you an invitation, Miss Ashton, at\r\nleast if she will do what I ask her. I have got my work waiting me.\r\nPardon me if I go on."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we are going the same way. I suppose we are going the same way?"\r\nsaid Emma, looking at her companion.\r\n\r\n"You walk quicker than we do, and I dare say you are in a hurry," said\r\nHester ungraciously. She did not respond to the look of mingled reproach\r\nand relief which he gave her. The very vicinity of Catherine Vernon\'s\r\nhouse stiffened Hester into marble, and Edward was very anxious to go\r\non. He stood still for one moment with his hat in his hand, then\r\nhastened on, at a rate very little like his usual mode of progression.\r\nHester on her part followed with studious lingering, pausing to point\r\nout to her companion the view over the Common, the roofs of the\r\nRedborough houses, the White House on the opposite slope. Emma naturally\r\nconceived her own suspicions from this curious piece of pantomime. They\r\nhad been walking smartly before, they walked slowly now--and hers was\r\nwhat she thought a romantic imagination. She felt confident that these\r\ntwo were true lovers separated by some family squabble, and that they\r\ndid not venture to be seen walking together. "I know we were going the\r\nsame way," she said, "because there are not two ways, and you can see\r\nthe town before you. I can\'t see why we might not have walked together.\r\nIt is sinful to carry family tiffs so far," Emma said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                             A DOUBLE MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward had drawn his bow at a venture when he made that statement about\r\nCatherine to Hester, and he was full of doubt as to how it would\r\ninfluence her. This was the first time almost that he had disregarded\r\nopinion and withdrawn the bolts and bars and let himself go. There was\r\nsomething in the atmosphere of the young house, all breathing of life\r\nand freedom, and daring disregard of all trammels, which got into his\r\nhead in spite of himself. He had abandoned altogether the decorous\r\nhabits of his life, the necessity which bound him as surely in a dance\r\nas at his office. On ordinary occasions, wherever a ball occurred in\r\nRedborough, Edward was aware beforehand which young ladies he would have\r\nto dance with, and knew that he must apportion his attentions rightly,\r\nand neglect nobody whose father or mother had been civil to him. He knew\r\nthat he must not dance too often with one, nor sit out in corners, nor\r\ndo anything unbecoming a young man upon whom the eyes of many were\r\nfixed. But the very air in the house of the Merridews was different from\r\nthat of other places. There was a licence in it which existed nowhere\r\nelse. He, the staid and grave, carried off Hester from her partners,\r\nappropriated her for a good part of the evening, sat with her hidden\r\naway among the ferns in the conservatory, and only resigned her when he\r\nwas compelled to do so. Even then, by way of emphasising his choice of\r\nHester, he scarcely danced at all after, but stood among the other\r\ndisengaged men in the doorways, watching her and seizing every\r\nopportunity to gain her attention. He was startled at himself when he\r\nthought of it. He walked home in the middle of the night, in the faint\r\nwintry moonlight, following the old fly he heard lumbering off in the\r\ndistance carrying her home, his mind filled with a curious excitement\r\nand sense of self-abandonment. He had always admired her--her\r\nindependence, her courage, her eager intelligence, had furnished him\r\nsince she was a child with a sort of ideal. He had kept wondering what\r\nkind of woman she would grow up; and lo! here she was, a woman grown,\r\ndrawing other eyes than his, the object of admiring glances and\r\ncomplimentary remarks. When he had seen her in her washed muslin at\r\nCatherine Vernon\'s parties, she had still appeared to him a child, or\r\nlittle more than a child. He had still felt the superiority of his own\r\nposition, and that the passing glance and shrug of familiar confidential\r\nhalf-apology would probably please her more than the ordinary attentions\r\nwhich he had to show among so many. But Hester, by Ellen Merridew\'s\r\nside, a taller and grander woman, well-dressed, with her mother\'s pearls\r\nabout her white throat, which was as white as they, was a different\r\ncreature altogether. To risk everything for a mere school-girl was one\r\nthing, but a stately young creature like this, at whom everybody looked,\r\nof whom everybody said, "_That_ Hester Vernon? Dear me, I never thought\r\nshe had grown up like that!" was a different matter. The sight of her\r\nhad intoxicated Edward. Perhaps poor Mrs. John\'s pearls and the careful\r\nperfection of her dress had something to do with it. And the place\r\nintoxicated him. There every one was doing what seemed good in his own\r\nsight. There were few or none of those stern reminders which he had read\r\nelsewhere in the eyes of parents whose daughters were waiting to be\r\ndanced with, the "Was-it-for-this-I-asked-you-to-dinner?" look, to which\r\nhe had so often succumbed. For once he had lost his head; he was even\r\nvaguely conscious that he had come there with a sort of intention of\r\nlosing his head, and for once thinking of his own pleasure, and nothing\r\nmore. No doubt this had been in his mind: and the sudden sight of that\r\nwhite figure, all graceful and stately, and of Mrs. John\'s pearls, had\r\ndone the rest. But he was a little nervous next morning as he thought\r\nover what he had been doing; he did not bear Catherine\'s questioning\r\nwell at breakfast. When she asked him whom he had danced with, he made\r\nanswer that he had danced very little. But yet he had enjoyed himself,\r\noh yes. It had been so pretty a party that it had been pleasure enough\r\nto look on. He described the conservatory and its Chinese lanterns with\r\nenthusiasm. "It must, indeed, have been like fairyland--or the fireworks\r\nat the Crystal Palace," Catherine had said. And he had felt a bitter\r\npang of offence, as she laughed. He did not feel, indeed, that he could\r\nbear any remarks of the kind, or depreciation of Ellen, for whom he felt\r\na special kindness just now. When Catherine said, "But all this must\r\nhave come to a great deal of money: Algernon Merridew has only a share\r\nin his father\'s business, he has no private money, has he?--but, of\r\ncourse I know he has no private means: and Ellen\'s little money will\r\nsoon go at that rate."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose Chinese lanterns cost very much," said Edward.\r\n\r\n"Your temper is doubtful this morning," said Catherine, with a smile.\r\n"It is \'on the go,\' which is usual enough after late hours and the\r\nexcitement of a dance; but I don\'t think you are often so much excited\r\nby a dance. Did you see some one whom you admired, Edward? I am sure, if\r\nshe is a nice girl, I shall be very glad."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it would be as well not to try, Aunt Catherine; we might not\r\nagree about what a nice girl is."\r\n\r\n"No?" said Catherine rather wistfully.\r\n\r\nShe looked into his doubtful eyes across the breakfast table, and,\r\nperhaps for the first time, began to feel that she was not so very\r\ncertain as she had once been as to what her boy meant. Was it possible\r\nafter all, that perhaps the words upon which they agreed had different\r\nmeanings to each? But this was only a passing cloud.\r\n\r\n"Who was the belle?" she said smiling; "you can tell me that, at least,\r\nif you can\'t tell who you admired most."\r\n\r\nEdward paused; and then an impulse of audacity seized him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know if you will like it," he said, "but if I must tell the\r\ntruth, I think that girl at the Vernonry--Hester, you know, who is grown\r\nup, it appears, and _out_--"\r\n\r\nCatherine bore the little shock with great self-possession, but she felt\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Hester. Why should you suppose I would not like it? She must be\r\nnineteen, and, of course, she is _out_. And what of her?" Catherine\r\nsaid, with a grave smile.\r\n\r\nShe was vexed that Edward should be the one to tell her of the girl\'s\r\nsuccess, and she was vexed, too, that he should think it would displease\r\nher. Why should it displease her? He ought to have kept silence on the\r\nsubject, and he ought not to have seemed to know that she had any\r\nfeeling upon it: the suggestion hurt her pride.\r\n\r\n"Ellen seems to have taken her up. She has grown up much handsomer than\r\nI should have expected, and she was very well dressed, with beautiful\r\npearls----"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Catherine, with a long breath; "then her mother kept her\r\npearls!" She laughed a moment after, and added, "Of course, she would;\r\nwhat could I have expected? She kept her settlement. Poor little thing!\r\nI suppose she did not understand what it meant, and that she was\r\ncheating her husband\'s creditors."\r\n\r\n"I never quite understood," said Edward, "why you should have brought\r\nher here, and given her a house, when she is still in possession of that\r\nincome."\r\n\r\n"She has only a scrap of it. Poor little thing! She neither knew it was\r\nwrong to take it, nor that if she did keep it, it ought not to have been\r\nallowed to go for his after debts. She got muddled altogether among\r\nthem. The greater part of it she mortgaged for him, so that there was\r\nonly a pittance left. Whatever you may think, you young men, it is a\r\ndrawback for a man when he marries a fool. And so she kept her pearls!"\r\nCatherine added, with a laugh of contempt.\r\n\r\n"Marrying a fool, however, must have its advantages," said Edward,\r\n"since a woman with brains would probably have given up the settlement\r\naltogether."\r\n\r\n"Advantages--if you think them advantages!" Catherine said, with a flash\r\nof her eyes such as Edward had seldom seen. "And certainly would not\r\nhave kept the pearls--which are worth a good deal of money," she added,\r\nhowever, with her habitual laugh. "I think they must have dazzled you,\r\nmy boy, these pearls."\r\n\r\n"I am sure they did," said Edward composedly; "they took away my breath.\r\nI have seen her here often, a dowdy little girl" (he scorned himself for\r\nsaying these words, yet he said them, though even his cheek reddened\r\nwith the sense of self-contempt) "with no ornaments at all."\r\n\r\n"No," said Catherine; "to do Mrs. John justice, she had as much sense as\r\nthat. She would not have put those pearls on a girl\'s neck, unless she\r\nwas dressed conformably. Oh, she has sense enough for that. I suppose\r\nshe had a pretty dress--white? But of course it would be white; at the\r\nfirst ball--and looked well, you say?"\r\n\r\n"Very handsome," said Edward, gravely. He did not look up to meet the\r\nlook of awakened alarm, wonder, doubt, and rousing up of her faculties\r\nto meet a new danger, which was in Catherine\'s eyes. He kept his on his\r\nplate and ate his breakfast with great apparent calm, though he knew\r\nvery well, and had pleasure in thinking, that he had planted an arrow in\r\nher. "By the way," he said, after an interval, "where did John Vernon\r\npick his wife up? I hear she is of good family--and was it her\r\nextravagance that brought about his ruin? These are details I have never\r\nheard."\r\n\r\n"It is not necessary to enter into such old stories," said Catherine,\r\nsomewhat stiffly. "He met her, I suppose, as young men meet unsuitable\r\npeople everywhere; but we must do justice. I don\'t think she had any\r\nshare in the ruin, any more at least than a woman\'s legitimate share,"\r\nshe added, with a laugh that was somewhat grim. "He was fond of every\r\nkind of indulgence, and then speculated to mend matters. Beware of\r\nspeculation, Edward. Extravagance is bad, but speculation is ruin. In\r\nthe one case you may have to buy your pleasures very dear, but in the\r\nother there is no pleasure, nothing but destruction and misery."\r\n\r\n"Is not that a little hard, Aunt Catherine? there is another side to it.\r\nSometimes a colossal fortune instead of destruction, as you say; and in\r\nthe meantime a great deal of excitement and interest, which are\r\npleasures in their way."\r\n\r\n"The pleasure of balancing on the point of a needle over the bottomless\r\npit," she said. "If I were not very sure that you have too much sense to\r\nbe drawn into anything of the kind, I should take fright, to hear you\r\nsay even as much as that. The very name of speculation is a horror to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Yet there must always be a little of it in business," he said, with a\r\nsmile creeping about the corners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n"You think me old-fashioned in my notions, and with a woman\'s incapacity\r\nto understand business; but in my day we managed to do very well without\r\nit," Catherine said.\r\n\r\n"To think of a woman\'s incapacity for business in your presence would be\r\nsilly indeed. I hope I am not such an ass as that," said Edward, looking\r\nup at her with a smile. And she thought his look so kind and true, so\r\nfull of affectionate filial admiration and trust, that Catherine\'s keen\r\nperceptions were of no more use to her than the foolishness of any\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nHe returned to luncheon that day as if for the purpose of obliterating\r\nall disagreeable impressions, and it was on leaving the Grange to return\r\nto the bank that he met Hester and Emma. This confused and annoyed him\r\nfor the moment. It was not so that he would have liked to meet the\r\nheroine of last night; and her unknown companion, and the highly\r\ninappropriate place of meeting, made the encounter still less to his\r\ntaste. But when he had hurried on in advance he began to ask himself\r\nwhat was the meaning of Hester\'s reluctance to walk with him, or even to\r\nspeak to him, her attitude--drawing back even from his greeting, and the\r\nclouded look in her eyes. It was natural that he should not wish to\r\nspeak to her at the door of the Grange, but why she should wish to avoid\r\nhim he could not tell. It would have been a triumph over Catherine to\r\nhave thus demonstrated her acquaintance with him at Catherine\'s very\r\ndoor. So Edward thought, having only the vulgar conception of feminine\r\nenmity. On the whole, seeing that he had sowed the seeds of suspicion in\r\nCatherine\'s bosom, it was better that Hester should hold him at arm\'s\r\nlength. Yet he was piqued by it. When he reached the bank, however, news\r\nawaited him, which turned his thoughts in a different channel. He found\r\nHarry Vernon and Algernon Merridew in great excitement in the room which\r\nwas sacred to the former. Ashton had made the first _coup_ on their\r\nbehalf. He had bought in for them, at a fabulously low price, certain\r\nstock by which in a few weeks he was confident they might almost double\r\ntheir ventures. To furnish the details of this operation is beyond the\r\nwriter\'s power, but the three young men understood it, or thought they\r\nunderstood it. Of course a skilful buyer prowling about a crowded market\r\nwith real money in his pocket, knowing what he wants, and what is\r\nprofitable, will be likely to get his money\'s worth, whether he is\r\nbuying potatoes or stock.\r\n\r\n"I saw it was very low," said Merridew, "and wondered at the time if\r\nAshton would be down upon it. I thought of writing to him, but on the\r\nwhole I suppose it\'s best not to cramp them in their operations. They\r\nought to know their own business best."\r\n\r\n"They shell it out when there\'s a good thing going, these fellows do,"\r\nsaid Harry, out of his moustache.\r\n\r\n"And nobody has any money apparently," Algernon said, with a laugh of\r\npleasure, meaning to imply _save you and me_. "When money\'s tight, that\r\nis the time to place a little with advantage," he said with a profound\r\nair. "I think you should go in for it on a larger scale, you two fellows\r\nthat have the command of the bank."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t risk too much at once," Harry said.\r\n\r\nEdward listened to their prattle with a contempt which almost reached\r\nthe length of passion. To hear them talk as if they understood, or as if\r\nit mattered what they thought! His own brains were swelling with\r\nexcitement. He knew that he could go a great deal further if he pleased,\r\nand that Harry\'s share in the decision would be small. Dancing on the\r\npoint of a needle over the bottomless pit! It was like an old woman\'s\r\ninsane objection to anything daring--anything out of the common way.\r\nAshton\'s letter to him was far longer and more detailed than his\r\ncommunications with the others. He said plainly that here was an\r\nopportunity for an operation really upon a grand scale, and that there\r\ncould be no doubt of a dazzling success. "You will communicate just as\r\nmuch or as little of this as you think proper to the others," Roland\r\nwrote, and it was all that Edward could do to keep up an appearance of\r\nreplying to them, of joining in their gratification as he pondered this\r\nmuch more important proposal. "It is not once in a dozen years that such\r\na chance arises," Roland said.\r\n\r\nNow Edward had nothing of his own to speak of, far less than the others,\r\nwho each had a trifle of independent fortune. All that he could risk was\r\nthe money of the bank. The profit, if profit there was, would be to the\r\nbank, and even that large increase of profit would have its drawbacks,\r\nfor Catherine, who liked to know everything, would inquire into it, and\r\nin her opinion, success would be scarcely less dangerous than failure.\r\nHe could not stop in the drab-coloured calm of the office where these\r\ntwo young idiots were congratulating each other, and trying to talk as\r\nif they knew all about it. His scorn of them was unspeakable. If they\r\ngained a hundred pounds their elation would be boundless. They were like\r\nboys sending out a little toy frigate and enchanted when it reached in\r\nsafety the opposite side of the puddle. But Ashton meant business. It\r\nwas not for this sort of trifling work that he had set himself to watch\r\nthose fluctuations, which are more delicate than anything in nature they\r\ncould be compared to. The blowing of the winds and their changes were\r\nprose compared to the headlong poetry of the money-market. Edward felt\r\nso many new pulses waking in him, such a hurrying fever in his veins,\r\nthat he could not control himself.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be here, I suppose, Harry, till closing time? I\'m going out," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"You going out--you that never have anything to do out of doors! I had\r\nto umpire in a match on the other side of the Common," said Harry, "but\r\nif you\'ll just tell Cordwainer as you pass to get some one else in my\r\nplace, I don\'t mind staying. I\'m sure you\'ve done it often, Ned, for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I am not in request, like you; but I have something I want to see to,\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Harry. "Don\'t you go and overdo it, whatever it is."\r\n\r\n"You are seedy with staying up, dancing and flirting," said young\r\nMerridew, with his imbecile laugh. "Nelly says she could not believe her\r\neyes."\r\n\r\n"I wish Ellen, and you too, would understand that dancing and flirting\r\nare entirely out of my way," said Edward, with a flush of anger, as he\r\ntook his hat and went out.\r\n\r\nPoor Algernon\'s innocent joke was doubly unsuccessful, for Harry stood\r\nperfectly glum, not moving a muscle. He had not been at all amused by\r\nthe proceedings of the previous night.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t report it, if I were you, when Ellen says silly things,"\r\nsaid her brother, as black as a thunder-cloud.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" said poor Merridew, falling from his eminence of satisfaction\r\ninto the ludicrous dismay of undeserved depreciation. He told his wife\r\nafter, "They both set upon me tooth and nail, when I meant nothing but\r\nto be pleasant."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would learn, Algernon, that it\'s always wise to hold your\r\ntongue when I\'m not there," Ellen said. "Of course I understand my own\r\nfamily. And not much wonder they were vexed! Edward that doesn\'t look at\r\na girl because of Aunt Catherine, and Harry that she has snubbed so! You\r\ncould not have chosen a worse subject to be pleasant upon," Mrs. Ellen\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut it was not this subject that was in Edward\'s mind as he sallied\r\nforth with the step and the air of that correct and blameless man of\r\nbusiness which already all Redborough believed him to be. He had taken\r\nthat aspect upon him in the most marvellous way--the air of a man whose\r\nmind was balanced like his books, as regularly, and without the\r\nvariation of a farthing. He was one of those who are born punctual, and\r\nalready his morning appearance was as a clock to many people on the\r\noutskirts of Redborough. His hat, his gloves, his very umbrella, were\r\nenough to give people confidence. There was nobody who would have\r\nhesitated to entrust their money to his hands. But if Redborough could\r\nhave known, as he passed along the streets, causing a little wonder to\r\nvarious people--for already it had become a surprising fact that Mr.\r\nEdward should leave business at so much earlier an hour than usual--what\r\na wild excitement was passing through Edward\'s veins, the town would\r\nhave been soared out of its composure altogether. He scarcely felt the\r\npavement under his feet; he scarcely knew which way he was turning. The\r\nmessage for Cordwainer went out of his head, though he went that way on\r\npurpose. Several important questions had come before him to be settled\r\nsince he had taken his place at the head of the bank. He had been called\r\nupon to decide whether here and there an old customer who had not\r\nthriven in the world should be allowed to borrow, or a new one permitted\r\nto overdraw; and in such cases he had stood upon the security of the\r\nbank with a firmness which was invulnerable, and listened to no weak\r\nvoices of pity. But this was far more important than such questions as\r\nthese. As his ideas disentangled themselves, there seemed to be two\r\npossibilities before him. If he threw himself into Ashton\'s scheme at\r\nall, to do it as a partner in the business, not indeed with the sanction\r\nof his other partners, but, if there was risk to the firm in his\r\nproceedings at large, to make them profitable to it in case of success.\r\nIn case of success! Of course there would be success. It was inevitable\r\nthat they must succeed. On the other side, the expedient was to use the\r\nmoney and the securities of the bank, not for the aggrandisement of\r\nVernon\'s, but for his own. This would leave the responsibility of the\r\naction entirely upon his own shoulders if anything went wrong. And he\r\ndid not refuse to give a rapid glance at that contingency. What could it\r\nmean to the bank? Not ruin--he half-smiled as he thought. It would mean\r\ncoming down perhaps in the world, descending from the _prestige_ and\r\nimportance of its present rank. And to himself it would mean going to\r\nthe dogs--anyhow, there could be no doubt on that point. But on the\r\nother side! that was better worth looking at, more worthy of\r\nconsideration. It would be like pouring in new blood to stagnant veins;\r\nit would be new life coming in, new energy, something that would stir\r\nthe old fabric through and through, and stimulate its steady-going,\r\nold-fashioned existence. It would be the something he had longed\r\nfor--the liberating influence, new possibilities, more extended work. He\r\nthought, with an excitement that gradually overmastered him, of the rush\r\nof gain coming in like a river, and the exhilaration and new force it\r\nwould bring. This idea caught him up as a strong wind might have caught\r\nhim, and carried him beyond his own control. He walked faster and\r\nfaster, skimming along the road that led into the country, into the\r\nquiet, where no one could note his altered aspect or the excitement that\r\ndevoured him, taking off his hat as he got out of sight of the houses,\r\nto let the air blow upon his forehead and clear his senses. And by and\r\nby things began to become more clear. He read Ashton\'s letter over\r\nagain, and with every word the way seemed to grow plainer, the risks\r\nless. It was as near a dead certainty as anything could be in business.\r\n"Of course there is always a possibility that something unforeseen may\r\nhappen," Ashton wrote, "and it is for you to weigh this. I think myself\r\nthat the chance is so infinitesimal as not to be worth taking into\r\nconsideration; but I would not wish to bias your judgment; the only\r\nthing is, that the decision must be immediate." Now that the first shock\r\nof novelty was over, he felt it in his power to "weigh this," as Ashton\r\nsaid. Getting familiarised with the subject made him more impartial, he\r\nsaid to himself. The first mention of it had raised a cowardly host of\r\napprehensions and doubts, but now that the throbbing of excitement began\r\nto die away, he saw the matter as it was--a question of calculation, a\r\ndelicate operation, a good _coup_, but all within the legitimate limits\r\nof business. He had recovered, he felt, the use of his reason, which the\r\nnovelty, the necessity for immediate determination, the certainty that\r\nhe must take no counsel on the subject, that Harry would be dumbly\r\nobstinate, and Catherine anxiously, hortatively, immovably against it,\r\nhad taken away. Harry was an ass, he said to himself, recovering his\r\ncalm, and Aunt Catherine an old woman. What was the use of the faculties\r\nhe possessed, and the position he had gained, if in such a crisis he\r\ncould not act boldly and for himself!\r\n\r\nThus it was with a very different aspect that Edward walked back. He put\r\non his hat, feeling himself cooled and subdued; his pulses returned to\r\ntheir usual rate of beating, which was essentially a moderate one. And\r\nso rapidly had he skimmed over the ground, and so quick had been the\r\nprogress both of his steps and his thoughts, that when he got back, with\r\nhis mind made up, to the skirts of the Common, he saw the football party\r\njust beginning to assemble, and recollected that he had never given\r\nHarry\'s message to Cordwainer, and that accordingly no new umpire could\r\nhave been found in Harry\'s place. But what did that matter? He reflected\r\nbenevolently, with a contemptuous good nature, that he could get back to\r\nthe bank in time still to liberate his cousin, so that everybody would\r\nbe satisfied. This he did, stopping at the telegraph office on the way.\r\nHis despatch was as follows:--"Proceed, but with caution. Needful will\r\nbe forthcoming." He drew a long breath when he thus decided his fate;\r\nthen he returned with all the ease and relief which naturally comes with\r\na decision. The thing was done, whether for good or evil--and there\r\ncould be very little doubt that it was for good. His countenance was\r\ncheerful and easy as he returned to the bank.\r\n\r\n"I did not give your message, for my business did not keep me so long as\r\nI expected. Your football fellows are just collecting. You can get\r\nthere, if you make haste, before they begin."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thanks, awfully!" said Harry. "I hope you did not hurry, though I\'m\r\nglad to go. I hope you understand I\'m always ready to stay, Ned, when\r\nyou want the time. Of course, you\'re worth two of me here, I know that;\r\nbut I can\'t stand anything that\'s not fair, and if you want to get\r\naway----"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t, old fellow; I\'ve done my business. It did not take so long as\r\nI thought. You had better be off if you want to get there in time."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Harry. And he went off to his match in a softened\r\nstate of mind, which, had he been able to divine it, would have\r\nastonished Edward greatly. Harry had seen Hester and her companion pass,\r\nand he felt a sad conviction that Edward\'s sudden business had something\r\nto do with that apparition. Well! he had said to himself, and what then?\r\nHadn\'t he a right to try, the same as another? If she liked one better\r\nthan the other, should the fellow she wouldn\'t have be such a cad as to\r\nstand in her way? This was what had made Harry "fly out," as Algy said,\r\nupon his brother-in-law; it had made him pass a very sombre hour alone\r\nin the bank. But in the revulsion of feeling at Edward\'s rapid return,\r\nand the likelihood either that he had not seen Hester, or that she would\r\nhave nothing to say to him, Harry\'s heart was moved within him. Either\r\nhis cousin was "in the same box" as himself and rejected, or else he was\r\ninnocent altogether of evil intention--and in either case Harry\'s heart\r\nwas soft to him: at once as one whom he had wronged, and as one who\r\nmight be suffering with him under a common calamity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                            STRAIGHTFORWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I hope, Cousin Catherine," said Emma, "that you will not think it is\r\nany want of civility on my part. I wished very much to come the first\r\nday. I went out with Hester Vernon, who is constantly at\r\ngrandpapa\'s--and I was quite distressed, when I found we had to pass\r\nhere, that she would not bring me in to call. But she seemed to think\r\nyou would rather not. Of course I know that there are often tiffs in\r\nfamilies, so I wouldn\'t say anything. There are times when Elinor\r\nwouldn\'t call on William\'s wife not if life and death depended on it; so\r\nI understand quite well, and of course a stranger mustn\'t interfere.\r\nOnly I wish you to know that I had no wish to take sides, and didn\'t\r\nmean to be rude. That was the last thing in the world I intended. Elinor\r\nhas always told us younger ones so much about you."\r\n\r\n"It is very kind of Elinor, I am sure; and you have behaved most\r\njudiciously," said Catherine, with a twinkle in her eye. "It is\r\nunnecessary to say to a person of your judgment that in the best\r\nregulated family----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you needn\'t tell me," said Emma, shaking her head. "Nobody can know\r\nbetter than I do. It is very awkward when you are the youngest, and when\r\nyou are expected by everybody to take their part. Of course they have\r\nall been very kind to me. I live part of my time with one, and part with\r\nanother, and that is why every one thinks I should be on their side. But\r\nnow I am very independent," Emma said, "for Roland has taken me. I dare\r\nsay he would tell you, Cousin Catherine, when he was here."\r\n\r\n"That must be a very pleasant arrangement," said Catherine, with a\r\nsmile. "I suppose when you were with Elinor you had a good deal to do."\r\n\r\n"I do Roland\'s housekeeping now. I don\'t wish to be idle," said Emma.\r\n"But to be sure when there are children to be seen after you are never\r\ndone, and especially boys. Elinor has five boys!--it is something\r\ndreadful! The stockings and the mending you can\'t think! It is very nice\r\nbeing with Roland; he is most kind. He gives me a regular allowance for\r\nmy clothes, which I never got before, and I am sure it is very good of\r\nhim; but you can\'t have everything, you know, and it is a little dull.\r\nHe is out all day, and often in the evenings, for of course I shouldn\'t\r\nwish him to give up his gentlemen-engagements for me. I don\'t think\r\npeople should ever do that sort of thing. Tom Pinch is all very well in\r\nDickens, but it would be inconvenient in actual life; for suppose you\r\nmarried?--and of course that is what every girl expects to do."\r\n\r\n"To be sure," said Catherine. "Is there anything of that sort in\r\nprospect, if I may be permitted to ask?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, I am quite pleased that you should ask," said Emma. "It\r\nwould be such a comfort to have somebody like you to come and talk it\r\nover with, Cousin Catherine, if there was anything--for I should feel\r\nsure you could tell me about my trousseau and all that. But there is\r\nnothing, I am sorry to say. You see I have had so little chance. Elinor\r\ntook me out sometimes, but not much, and she was far more disposed to\r\namuse herself than to introduce me. I don\'t think that is nice in a\r\nmarried sister, do you? and speaking of that, Cousin Catherine, I am\r\nsure you will be kind enough to help me here. Grandpapa will not take\r\nany trouble about it. I asked the gentleman whom we met coming out of\r\nhere, Hester and I--Mr. Edward I think is his name."\r\n\r\n"What of Edward?" said Catherine quickly, with a touch of alarm.\r\n\r\n"But nothing seems to have come of it," said the persistent Emma. "He\r\nsaid he would try, and Hester made a sort of promise; but there has been\r\none since and I have never been asked. It is your niece\'s dance--Mrs.\r\nMerridew, I think, is her name. She gives one every week, and both for a\r\nlittle amusement, and that I mayn\'t lose any chance that may be going, I\r\nshould like very much to go. I don\'t doubt that you could get me an\r\ninvitation in a moment if you would just say you would like it."\r\n\r\nCatherine\'s consternation was ludicrous to behold. She was herself so\r\nmuch amused by the situation that she laughed till the tears stood in\r\nher eyes. But this matter-of-fact young woman who sat by and gazed upon\r\nher with such a stolid incapacity to see the joke, was of the side of\r\nthe house to which Catherine could pardon anything--the old captain\'s\r\ngrandchild, Roland\'s sister. What would have been vulgar assurance in\r\nanother, was amusing _na\xefvet\xe9_ in Emma. When she had got over her laugh\r\nshe said, with amused remonstrance as if she had been speaking to a\r\nchild--\r\n\r\n"But you must know, Emma, that these family tiffs you are so well\r\naccustomed to, come in to prevent this too. Ellen would not care for my\r\nrecommendation. She is a very self-willed little person, and indeed the\r\nchief rebel of the family."\r\n\r\n"That is all very well, Cousin Catherine," said Emma with the\r\ndownrightness of fact and certainty; "but you know you are the head of\r\nthe family. You have got the money. If they were in trouble they would\r\nall have to come to you: and if you said "I wish this," of course nobody\r\nwould venture to refuse you. The most stupid person must be sure of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nThere was a commanding commonsense in this view that silenced Catherine.\r\nShe looked at the young philosopher almost with awe.\r\n\r\n"Your arguments are unanswerable," she said; "there is nothing to be\r\nsaid against such admirable logic."\r\n\r\n"Then you will ask for an invitation for me?" said Emma. "I am sure I am\r\nmuch obliged to you, Cousin Catherine. It is always best to come to the\r\nfountain-head. And it isn\'t as if I were going to cause any expense or\r\ntrouble, for I have my ball-dress all ready. I have wore it only once,\r\nand it is quite fresh. It is my second ball-dress; the first I wore\r\nabout a dozen times. Elinor gave it me, which was very kind of her. It\r\nwas only muslin, but really it was very nice, and got up quite\r\nrespectably. But this one I bought myself out of the allowance Roland\r\ngives me. Don\'t you think it is very thoughtful of him? for of course\r\nwhat a sister buys for you, however kind she is, is never just the same\r\nas what you would choose for yourself."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not--I never had any experience," said Catherine, gravely. "I\r\nam afraid, however, that you will not meet anybody who will much advance\r\nyour views at Redborough. It is an old-fashioned, backward place. London\r\nwould afford a much larger scope for any social operations. Indeed it is\r\nvery condescending in a young lady from town to give any attention to us\r\nand our little parties down here."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Emma, eager to correct a mistake, "that just shows how little\r\npeople in the country know. You think London means the London you read\r\nof in books, where you meet all the great people and have half-a-dozen\r\nparties every night. But when London means Kilburn!" said Emma shaking\r\nher head, "where all the gentlemen go to the city every morning, and\r\nthere is perhaps one dance given in a whole season, and only the people\r\nasked that you know! and we know scarcely one. You see the people there\r\ndon\'t think of calling because they are your neighbours. There are so\r\nmany: and unless you get introductions, or work in the parish, or\r\nsomething-- Working in the parish is a very good way," Emma added, with a\r\nsudden recollection; "you get invited to a great many evening parties\r\nwhere you just stand about and talk, or people sing: and not many\r\ndances. Unfortunately I never was much used to parish work. In Elinor\'s\r\nthere was too much to do, and Bee was too worldly, and as for William\'s\r\nwife, though we should not like it to be known, Cousin Catherine, she\r\nis--a Dissenter."\r\n\r\nEmma made this admission with the reluctance it merited.\r\n\r\n"I have not told grandpapa," she said, with bated breath.\r\n\r\n"I think he could bear it," said Catherine. "I think you might venture\r\non the communication. In some things he is very strong-minded."\r\n\r\n"It was a very bitter pill to us," Emma said.\r\n\r\nHere they were interrupted by the entrance of the captain himself, who\r\nhad left his grandchild in a cowardly way to make Catherine\'s\r\nacquaintance by herself. But Emma had not minded. She had not even\r\ndivined that his pretence of business was hypocritical. She had not been\r\nalarmed by Catherine, and now she was comfortably confident of having\r\nmade a good impression, and secured a friend.\r\n\r\n"I am quite ready, grandpapa," she said. "Cousin Catherine has been so\r\nkind. She says she will speak to Mrs. Merridew about my invitation, so\r\nyou may make yourself quite easy on that subject. And grandmamma will be\r\nvery pleased. Of course I could not expect such an old lady as she is to\r\nexert herself. But Cousin Catherine understands how important that sort\r\nof thing is to a girl," Emma said, with an air of great gravity.\r\n\r\nThe captain gave Catherine a piteous glance. He did not understand the\r\nnew specimen of womankind of whom he had the responsibility, and\r\nCatherine, whose powers of self-restraint had been called forth to an\r\nunusual degree, responded with an outburst of laughter.\r\n\r\n"We have got on admirably," she said. "I like a straightforward mind,\r\nwith such a power of applying reason to practical uses. You must come to\r\nsee me often, Emma. Never mind grandpapa. He will tell you I am busy,\r\nbut when I am so, I shall tell you so. You are far too sensible to take\r\noffence."\r\n\r\n"Oh, offence, Cousin Catherine? between you and me!" said Emma, "that\r\nwould be too ridiculous. I hope I know my place. When you are the\r\nyoungest you soon learn that. Your first lesson is that nobody wants\r\nyou, and that you must just do the best you can for yourself. There is\r\nonly just one thing I should like to mention, and that is, that the\r\nfirst time it would be a great advantage to me if you would take me. It\r\nis such a fine thing for a girl when she is known to belong to the best\r\npeople in a place. It is not even as if my name were Vernon. But people\r\nwill say \'Miss Ashton! who is Miss Ashton? I never heard of her!\'\r\nWhereas if I were with you, the best partners in the place would ask to\r\nget introduced to me, and that would give me a start. Afterwards I could\r\nget on by myself, as I hear Mrs. Merridew does not care for chaperons,"\r\nEmma said.\r\n\r\nOnce more Catherine was struck dumb. She pushed her chair back a little\r\nand regarded this dauntless young woman with a mixture of dismay,\r\nadmiration, and amusement.\r\n\r\n"But I assure you I have never gone to any of Ellen\'s junketings," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"That will not matter," said the persistent Emma, "Of course she will be\r\npleased to have you. It will be a great honour. And then to me it would\r\nbe such an advantage. I should feel that I really was having my chance."\r\n\r\nWhen she left the gate of the Grange, walking by the side of the\r\nbewildered captain, Emma felt that she was tolerably sure of getting all\r\nshe wanted, and her triumph, though quite moderate and serious, was\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad you left me to make acquaintance with Cousin Catherine\r\nby myself," she said, "grandpapa; I was a little frightened, but she was\r\nso nice. She was very nice to Roland too; and it will be such an\r\nadvantage to go into society for the first time with such a well-known\r\nperson. It makes all the difference. People see at once who you are, and\r\nthere is no difficulty afterwards."\r\n\r\n"And you think Catherine Vernon will depart from all her habits and take\r\nyou to that butterfly\'s ball?" the captain said.\r\n\r\n"Of course, grandpapa," said Emma, in the calm of simple conviction. It\r\nwas not a matter which admitted of any doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd the wonderful thing was, that she proved right. To her own great\r\namazement, and to the consternation of everybody concerned, Catherine\r\nVernon assumed her grey gown, the gayest of her evening garments, and\r\nmost befitting a dance, and took Emma Ashton in her own carriage to Mrs.\r\nMerridew\'s house on the hill. Catherine was too genial a person in\r\nordinary society to exercise any discouraging influence upon the young\r\nparty in general; but upon the members of her own family there was no\r\ndoubt that she did have a subduing effect. Ellen\'s face of consternation\r\nwas the subject of remark in the family for years after; indeed, they\r\nspoke of "the night when Aunt Catherine came to the dance," dating\r\nthings from it, as people speak of a great national event. Harry was the\r\none who showed himself most equal to the occasion. He established\r\nhimself by Catherine\'s side as a sort of guard of honour, relieving the\r\nfrightened Algernon, who, what with pride and pleasure on his own part,\r\nand a wondering sympathy with Ellen\'s dismay, did not know how to\r\nconduct himself in such an emergency. Edward did not appear at all. He\r\nhad said he was very busy, and did not think it was possible he could\r\ngo, as soon as he heard of Emma\'s extraordinary request. And though\r\nCatherine was almost displeased by his defection, there was nothing to\r\nbe said against so evident a necessity as that the most active partner\r\nin the bank should attend to his work. Her chief point of curiosity in\r\nthe scene which she surveyed with amused disapproval and astonishment to\r\nfind herself there, was Hester, to whom her eyes turned with the lively\r\nsense of opposition which existed always between the two.\r\n\r\nCatherine\'s eyes, in spite of herself, turned from Emma\'s insignificance\r\nto the fine indignant figure of the girl whom (she said to herself) she\r\ncould not endure, with the most curious mixture of curiosity, and\r\ninterest, and rivalship. She, Catherine Vernon, the rival of a trifling\r\ncreature of nineteen! Such a sentiment sometimes embitters the feelings\r\nof a mother towards the girl of whom her son makes choice. But\r\nCatherine\'s mood had nothing to do with Edward. It was more like the\r\n"taking sides," which Emma was so anxious to demonstrate was impossible\r\nto her as a stranger. Hester had no separate standing ground, no might\r\nor authority, and yet it was no exaggeration to say that Catherine, with\r\nall of these advantages, instinctively looked upon her as a rival power.\r\n\r\nHester was in the blue dress, which was the alternative of her white\r\none. In those days there were no yellows or sage greens; and even before\r\nCatherine remarked the girl\'s young freshness and beauty, or the\r\nhigh-thrown head, and indignant bearing, which denoted on Hester\'s side\r\na sense of Catherine\'s inspection, her eyes had caught the glistening\r\npearls on the young neck--her mother\'s pearls. Catherine looked at them\r\nwith a mingled sense of pity and disdain. If that mother had been such a\r\nwoman as Catherine, neither these pearls nor anything else of value\r\nwould have remained in her hands. They were Catherine\'s, they were the\r\ncreditors\' by rights. Mrs. John was not wise enough to understand all\r\nthat; but Hester, if she knew, would understand. Catherine could not\r\nkeep her mind from dwelling upon these ornaments. If Hester knew, what\r\nwould the girl do? Pocket the shame and continue to wear them as became\r\nMrs. John\'s daughter, or tear them from her neck and trample them under\r\nfoot? One or the other she would have to do--but then, Hester did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAs she walked about through the rooms, stopping to give a gracious word\r\nthere, a nod here, a question about father or mother, Catherine\'s mind\r\nwas not occupied either with the house or the company, but with this\r\ngirl. Hester had been in the background till now. A glimpse of her in\r\nthe corner of her own drawing-room, standing by her mother\'s side in her\r\nwashed muslin, did not--though Hester\'s look was always one of\r\nindignation--impress her relation\'s mind. But here she stood like an\r\nequal, sending glances of defiance out of her brown eyes. Hester had\r\ncome in the old fly with the white horse, while Emma was fetched from\r\nher grandfather\'s by Catherine\'s carriage. The contrast was striking\r\nenough; but Catherine, though she would not own it to herself, was more\r\naware than any one else, that no one would look twice at Emma while\r\nHester was by.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening was about half over, Emma came to her patroness and\r\nkindly gave her her dismissal.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t wait longer on my account, Cousin Catherine," she said. "I am\r\nquite nicely started; thank you so much. I have got my card filled;\r\nquite the nicest people in the room have asked me. I\'m sure I am very\r\ngrateful to you, for it is all your doing; but don\'t think of waiting\r\nfor me. Chaperons are not at all wanted, and I can go home in Hester\'s\r\nfly. I am so much obliged to you, but of course you want to get to bed.\r\nDon\'t stay a moment longer than you wish, for me."\r\n\r\nCatherine smiled, but did not take any further notice. She walked about\r\nthe rooms for some time after on the arm of Harry, who was always\r\ndutiful.\r\n\r\n"And who do you think is the prettiest person in the room, Harry? I\r\nexcuse you from telling me it is my young lady, whom for my own part I\r\ndon\'t admire."\r\n\r\n"I cannot see there is any doubt about it, Aunt Catherine," said Harry,\r\nin his sturdy way. "It is my cousin Hester. There is an air about her--I\r\ncannot explain it: I found it out long ago; but now everybody sees it."\r\n\r\n"Thanks to her mother\'s pearls," said Catherine, with her laugh.\r\n\r\nHarry looked at her with startled eyes.\r\n\r\n"The pearls are very pretty on her; but they are nothing, to me at\r\nleast," he said.\r\n\r\n"You should not let her wear them. She should not have them; knowing her\r\nfather\'s story, as I suppose you do.--Don\'t you see," cried Catherine,\r\nwith sudden energy, "that she ought not to appear in Redborough in those\r\npearls?"\r\n\r\nEmma had been standing near when this conversation began, and she drew\r\ncloser to listen, not with any clandestine intention, but only with a\r\nnatural curiosity. She caught up the words in a disjointed way. What\r\nreason could there be for not wearing your mother\'s pearls? She would\r\nhave gone and asked the question direct of Catherine, but that just then\r\nher partner came for her; and for the rest of the evening she had no\r\ntime to consider any such question; nor was it till she found herself in\r\nthe fly in the middle of the night rumbling and jolting along the dark\r\nroad that skirted the Common, by Hester\'s side, that this mysterious\r\nspeech occurred to her mind. She had been talking of the advantage of\r\nbeing introduced by a well-known person and thus put at once "on a right\r\nfooting."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want that. You know everybody; you have been here all your\r\nlife," she said. "And I am sure you got plenty of partners, and looked\r\nvery nice. And what a pretty necklace that is," said Emma, artlessly\r\nentering upon her subject. "Are they real? Oh, you must not be offended\r\nwith me, for I never had any nice ornaments. The youngest never has any\r\nchance. If they are real, I suppose they are worth a great deal of\r\nmoney; and you must be quite rich, or you would not be able to afford\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"We are not rich; indeed we are very poor," said Hester, "but the pearls\r\nare my mother\'s. She got them when she was young, from her mother. They\r\nhave belonged to us for numbers of years."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what Cousin Catherine could mean!" said Emma innocently.\r\n\r\n"About my pearls?" cried Hester, pricking up her ears, and all her\r\nspirit awakening, though she was so sleepy and tired of the long night.\r\n\r\n"She said you oughtn\'t to wear them. She said you shouldn\'t have them. I\r\nwonder what she meant! And Mr. Harry Vernon, that tall gentleman, he\r\nseemed to understand, for he got quite red and angry."\r\n\r\n"I oughtn\'t to wear them--I shouldn\'t have them!" Hester repeated, in a\r\nblaze of wrath. She sat bolt upright, though she had been lying back in\r\nher corner indisposed for talk.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I dare say she didn\'t mean anything," said Emma, "only spite, as\r\nyou are on the other side."\r\n\r\nHester did not reply, but she was roused out of all her sleepiness in a\r\nmoment. She let Emma prattle on by her side without response. As they\r\ndrove past the Grange a window was opened softly, and some one seemed to\r\nlook out.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wonder if that was Mr. Edward," said Emma. "I wonder why he\r\nstayed away. Is he after some girl, and doesn\'t want Cousin Catherine to\r\nknow? If it were not that you would scarcely speak to each other when\r\nyou met, I should say it was you, Hester."\r\n\r\n"I wish," said Hester severely, "that you would go to sleep; at three in\r\nthe morning I never want to talk."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, it may be that," said Emma somewhat inconsequently,\r\n"but I never want to sleep when I have been enjoying myself. I want to\r\nhave some one in the same room and to talk it all over--everything that\r\nhas happened. Who was that man, do you know who----"\r\n\r\nAnd here she went into details which Hester, roused and angry, paid no\r\nattention to. But Emma was not dependent on replies. She went on asking\r\nquestions, of which her companion took no notice, till the fly suddenly\r\nstopped with a great jarring and rattling, and the opening of two doors,\r\nand glimmers of two small lights in the profound dark, gave note of\r\nwatchers in the two houses, warned by the slow rumbling of the ancient\r\nvehicle, and glad to be released from their respective vigils. In\r\nHester\'s case it was her mother, wrapped in a warm dressing-gown, with a\r\nshawl over her head, and two anxious eyes shining out with warm\r\nreflections over her little candle, who received the girl in her finery\r\nwith eager questions if she were very cold, if she were tired, if all\r\nhad gone off well.\r\n\r\n"Run up stairs, my darling, while I fasten the door," Mrs. John said.\r\n"There is a nice fire and you can warm yourself--and some tea."\r\n\r\nIn those days people, especially women, were not afraid of being kept\r\nawake because of a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said Hester when her mother followed her up stairs into the\r\nold-fashioned, low-roofed room, which the fire filled with rosy light,\r\n"it appears that Catherine Vernon says I ought not to wear your pearls.\r\nHas she anything to do with your pearls? Has she any right to\r\ninterfere?"\r\n\r\n"My pearls!" cried Mrs. John almost with a scream. "What could Catherine\r\nVernon have to do with them? I think, dear, you must have fallen asleep\r\nand been dreaming. Where have you seen Catherine Vernon, Hester? She\r\ngives us our house, dear; you know we are so far indebted to her: but\r\nthat is the only right she can have to interfere."\r\n\r\n"Had she anything to do with my father?" Hester asked.\r\n\r\nShe was relieved from she did not know what indefinable terrors by the\r\ngenuine astonishment in her mother\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Anything to do with him? Of course; she had a great deal to do with\r\nhim. She was his first cousin. Her father had brought him up. It was\r\nintended----but then he met me," said the gentle little woman, not without\r\na tone of satisfaction in the incoherent tale. "And she was a kind of\r\npartner, and had a great deal to do with the bank. I never understood\r\nthe rights of it, Hester. I never had any head for business. Wait,\r\ndarling, till I undo these buttons. And now, my love, if you have got\r\nwarm, go to bed. My pearls! She must mean, I suppose, that they are too\r\ngood for you to wear because we are poor. They were my mother\'s, and her\r\nmother\'s before that. I would like to know what Catherine Vernon could\r\nhave to say to them," Mrs. John said, taking the pearls from her child\'s\r\nthroat and holding them up, all warm and shining, to the light, before\r\nshe deposited them in their carefully padded bed.\r\n\r\nIf there was anything in the world that was her individual property, and\r\nin which no one else had any share, it was her pearls: they had always\r\nbeen one of her household gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                            A CENTRE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are periods in life, and especially in the early part of it, when\r\nall existence gets, as it were, out of focus, and instead of some great\r\nand worthy centre, takes to circling round some point of outwardly\r\nfrivolous meaning, some little axis of society entirely unfit to be the\r\nturning-point of even the smallest world of human concerns. This had\r\ncome to be the case with the Vernons in those lingering weeks of winter\r\njust before Christmas. That the young, gay, foolish--nay, absurd--house\r\non the hill inhabited by Algernon Merridew and his wife should become to\r\nall of this important family the chief place, not only in Redborough,\r\nbut for a time, in the world, was the most curious fact imaginable; but\r\nyet it was so. To Edward it was the one place in the world where he was,\r\nas he hoped, free from observation and able to do as he pleased; which\r\nmeant--where he was entirely free from Catherine, and need have no fear\r\nof any interruption from her to his amusement, or his pleasure, or, if\r\nyou like it better, his love: to Hester it was the place where she had\r\nbeen recognised as part possessor in her own person, like the others, of\r\nthe honours due to her family, and where the homage, to which a young\r\nwoman sufficiently endowed has a right, was first given to her; if it\r\nhad a more close attraction still as the place where she met Edward,\r\nthat was a dream as yet unacknowledged to her own heart. Harry, on the\r\nother hand, had a double interest--neither of them of a very cheerful\r\nkind--one of which was the necessity of standing by his sister, who his\r\ngood sense told him was embarked in a very perilous way, and whose\r\nhusband was quite incapable of controlling or guiding her erratic\r\ncourse; and the other was the painful fascination of watching Edward and\r\nHester through all the vicissitudes of their quarrellings and makings\r\nup--the hours they would spend together, followed by other hours in\r\nwhich they would mutually scowl at each other and did not speak. Harry\r\nknew, poor fellow, by a sort of instinct common to the rejected, that\r\nthe quarrels were as ominous, or more so, than the intimacy. Hester had\r\nnever quarrelled with himself, they had been on the best terms, alas, as\r\nthey were now! But Edward she would pass with flushed cheek and shining\r\neye: she would address him with haughty reluctance when it was necessary\r\nto speak to him, and mark her reluctance with a decision which was never\r\nemployed towards those for whom she cared nothing. Harry\'s eyes were\r\nopened, and he understood the duel between them. The only mistake he\r\nmade was in the belief that it had gone further than the preliminary\r\nstage. He could not believe it possible that no explanation had taken\r\nplace between them.\r\n\r\nAnd of all people to be interested in Ellen\'s silly parties, who should\r\nbe seized with an intense desire to know all about them but Catherine\r\nVernon herself? She did know more about them than any one else who was\r\nnot present, and than a great many who were present. Her suspicions had\r\nbeen roused by various indications of something occult in Edward\'s mind.\r\nHe was no longer on his guard to the incredible extent which had been\r\ncommon with him; his mind was agitated with new hopes and fears--the\r\nchance of being able to be altogether independent of Catherine had made\r\nhim relax in his caution, and there had been moments when, in all the\r\nstir and elation of his new life, he had been on the eve of disclosing\r\neverything. Habitual prudence had saved him, but yet there had been\r\nsomething in his aspect which had roused Catherine\'s suspicions. They\r\nhad been, as she thought, in such entire sympathy before, that she was\r\ndeeply affected by this feeling, which she could not explain to\r\nherself--this sense of being in sympathy no longer. And it was all since\r\nEllen\'s absurd parties began, and he began to meet at them, _that_ girl,\r\nborn for the confusion of all her plans, Catherine thought. There were\r\nevenings when the strongest temptation to order her carriage instead of\r\ngoing to bed, and to go suddenly--unexpected--to Ellen\'s party, and see\r\nwith her own eyes what was going on, would come over her mind. But there\r\nwas in Catherine\'s mind, along with her suspicions, that terror to have\r\nthem confirmed, which so often goes with love when it begins to tremble\r\nin this way. Had she gone, Edward would have declared contemptuously\r\n(within himself) that it was all of a piece with her usual watchfulness,\r\nand the perfection of her system--not being able to divine that\r\nCatherine would have given the world to find herself in the wrong, and\r\nshrank from proving herself to be in the right. In the meantime she was\r\nkept informed of what was going on more or less by various people, and\r\nabove all by Emma Ashton, whose information, though largely leavened by\r\na great deal about herself which did not much interest her hearer, also\r\nafforded revelations about other people, especially Hester. Emma had\r\nbecome a constant visitor at the Grange. She was allowed to prattle for\r\nhours, and Catherine was always kind to her. Her insignificance, her\r\nlittle egotisms, her straightforward aim at her own advancement, did not\r\ncall forth the amused contempt of that observer of the human comedy as\r\nthey would have done in any other specimen. Catherine\'s tradition in\r\nfavour of her mother\'s kindred covered this little person with a shield.\r\nBut those who were not aware of this fond superstition wondered and\r\nscorned. And the feeling of the Redborough community was not in Emma\'s\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n"She is just a horrid little spy," Ellen cried. "I know she goes and\r\ntells Aunt Catherine everything. I shouldn\'t have her if I could help\r\nit; but everybody knows now that she is Aunt Catherine\'s relation, and\r\nthey are all civil to her."\r\n\r\n"She cannot do us any harm, Nelly," said her husband, "we are not afraid\r\nof any spy, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t talk so much nonsense, Algy," cried Ellen. "Of course she\r\ncan\'t do us any harm; but I hate spies for all that."\r\n\r\nThey were wrong so far that Emma was not at all a spy. Of all the\r\ninterminable discourses she poured out upon Catherine, the far greater\r\npart was about herself; only unfortunately the part that interested her\r\nauditor was not that about herself, but the much smaller portion in\r\nwhich, quite unconscious and without any evil motive, she dropped here\r\nand there a chance hint as to the others.\r\n\r\n"And whom did you say Edward was dancing with?" Catherine would say.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I was not talking of Mr. Edward, but of young Mr. Merridew, who is\r\nalways very attentive. That was our third dance together, and I did feel\r\nit was a great pity there were no chaperons, because I should have asked\r\nher, if I had been with any one, whether it wasn\'t rather, you know--for\r\nI wouldn\'t for the world do anything to get myself talked about."\r\n\r\n"I thought you had been talking about Edward," Catherine said.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no. It was whether three dances together wasn\'t perhaps a\r\nlittle---- for I always feel the responsibility of belonging to the\r\nfamily, Cousin Catherine, and I wouldn\'t for the world do anything----it\r\nis quite different with gentlemen. Mr. Edward was just carrying on as\r\nusual."\r\n\r\n"But, Emma, you must tell me what you mean by \'carrying on.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mean any harm," Emma would say. "I wonder what young Mr.\r\nMerridew is--if he is well off, and all that? Hester has cousins all\r\nround to tell her what\'s best, and of course she does not need to be on\r\nher p\'s and q\'s, like me."\r\n\r\nCatherine had to follow a mazy, vague, and wandering clue thus, through\r\nacres of indifferent matter, and to piece together broken scraps of\r\ninformation which were never intended to affect her at all. But they did\r\naffect her sometimes so powerfully that she had her hand actually on the\r\nbell, not only that evening but on several other occasions, to intimate\r\nthat she should want the carriage at ten o\'clock--a proceeding which\r\nwould have convulsed the household at home, and carried consternation to\r\nthe recipients of the unlooked-for honour. But, on further\r\nconsideration, Catherine always succeeded in subduing herself, often\r\nsadly enough saying to herself that it would be time enough when he told\r\nher--Why should she go out to meet trouble? Her heart so took her\r\nstrength from her, and changed her natural temperament, that Catherine\r\nrestrained herself, with a shrinking, which nobody who knew her would\r\nhave believed in, from any contact with irresistible fact, and decided\r\nthat rather than find out the vanity of her confidence it was better to\r\nbe deceived.\r\n\r\nThus the house on the hill which flaunted forth every Thursday evening\r\nthe great lamps of its lighted windows and the lines of Chinese lanterns\r\nin the conservatory, became the centre for the moment of a great deal of\r\nlife and many anxious thoughts. It turned Ellen\'s head with pride and\r\ndelight when she received indications of this, which indeed came to her\r\non all sides. When a shade of alarm crossed Algernon\'s face at the\r\namount of the bills, she took a lofty position which no man pretending\r\nto any spirit could have gone against. "Goodness, Algy, how can you look\r\nso glum about a pound or two, when you see we are doing a great work?"\r\nEllen said. "Well! if it is not more important than mothers\' meetings, I\r\ndon\'t know what words mean: and Mr. Ransom says the mothers\' meetings\r\nare a great work." Algernon laughed, but he, too, felt a thrill of\r\npride. To have made the house, which though it was Ellen\'s was a\r\nMerridew house, and his own, into a centre for the great Vernon family,\r\nwas, if not a great work, at least an extraordinary local success, such\r\nas old Merridew\'s son could never have hoped to attain to. And indeed\r\nAlgernon\'s remonstrances about the bills were of the feeblest\r\ndescription. He was too much devoted to his wife to have interfered with\r\nher, even had not the balance of moral force been on her side; and he\r\nwas proud of the extravagance and the commotion and the way in which the\r\nelders shook their heads. It is pleasant to make a sensation, and\r\nAlgernon was comforted by the knowledge that he had already made a\r\nlittle money by his stockbroking transactions, and hoped to make a great\r\ndeal more.\r\n\r\nThe young men had carried on their transactions with considerable\r\nvigour, though with little risk so far as Algernon and Harry were\r\nconcerned. But Edward\'s was a different case. The venture upon which he\r\nhad pondered with so much anxiety had turned out favourably, and he had\r\ngone on without telling his secret to any one, with a general amount of\r\nsuccess which had made the operation of risking other people\'s money\r\nseem quite natural to him--a process without any practical consequences\r\nat all, except the accumulation of a good deal of money under his own\r\nname, which is one of the happiest of sensations. To his temperament\r\nindeed it is by no means certain that the vicissitudes of the career in\r\nwhich he had embarked, the tragic suspense in which he was occasionally\r\nheld, and the transport of deliverance that followed, were not in\r\nthemselves the highest pleasures of which he was capable. And even so\r\nearly in his career as this, such crises would come. He had self-command\r\nenough not to betray himself when these moments arrived, and though\r\nthere were eyes keen enough to see that something had produced a change\r\nin him, they were, as has been seen in Catherine\'s case, deceived as to\r\nthe cause of his perturbation. Hester did not have so many opportunities\r\nof studying him, and she had no clue to the business complications in\r\nwhich he was involved; but she had many thoughts on her own mind as to\r\nthe reason of all the commotion which she saw vaguely, without\r\nunderstanding it. Some of the members of the general society, strangers\r\nwho sometimes perceive a departure from habit which does not strike the\r\nmost intimate, had said of Edward on more than one occasion, that he\r\nmust be in love. Was he in love? Hester had felt that a look was\r\ndirected to herself when this was said, and that a suppressed laugh had\r\nrun round the little group. She was herself agitated by tumults which\r\nshe could not understand, commotions in which Edward was certainly\r\ninvolved, and his name thus mentioned brought the blood to her cheek.\r\nWas he in love? She did not want to turn the question upon herself, to\r\nbring the matter to any conclusion, one way or another. He was very pale\r\nthat evening, yet would flush, as she herself did, growing red in a\r\nmoment and then pale again; and there was a watchful air about him as of\r\na man who expected to hear something or see some one whom nobody else\r\nlooked for. A man who was in love did not behave so. He was absorbed in\r\nthe being whom he loved. He is not absorbed in me, the girl said to\r\nherself involuntarily, then blushed, as if her thought had been found\r\nout. Edward came up to her at this moment, which made her confusion the\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n"Why do you change colour so? What is the matter?" he said to her.\r\n\r\n"It is you who are changing colour," said Hester, not knowing how else\r\nto defend herself.\r\n\r\nInstead of contradicting her, or throwing off the accusation, he\r\nsuddenly took her hand and drew it through his arm.\r\n\r\n"It is true," he said. "I have something on my mind. You were going to\r\ndance this waltz with me. Come into the hall, it is cool there, and let\r\nus talk instead?"\r\n\r\nEvery inch of available space in the house was given up to the\r\naccommodation of the guests, and the hall was filled, like the\r\nconservatory, with plants, among which little groups of two could find\r\ncorners. Edward established Hester in one of these, and placed a chair\r\nfor himself, so as to cut her off from everybody.\r\n\r\n"You are the only one that can understand," he said. "I can speak to\r\nyou. Don\'t mind me if I look like a fool. I am too anxious to talk."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she said, with a tremour of sympathetic anxiety.\r\n\r\n"It is only business," he said, "but it is business so unexpected that\r\neven beside you I am obliged to think of it. Can a man say more than\r\nthat?" he asked with something in his eyes which Hester had never seen\r\nthere so distinctly before, and which silenced her. One great emotion\r\nclears the way for another. Edward in the commotion of his being was\r\nalmost ready to rush into words that, being said, would have turned his\r\nlife upside down, and shattered all his present foundations. He was\r\nsaved by an incident which was of the most ordinary commonplace kind.\r\nThere came a violent ring at the door which was within half a dozen\r\nsteps of the spot where they sat. Half a dozen heads immediately\r\nprotruded from among the little banks of foliage to see what this odd\r\ninterruption could mean, for all the guests had arrived, and it was not\r\nlate enough for any one to go away. Hester saw that all the colour ebbed\r\nimmediately out of Edward\'s face. He did not even attempt to say a word\r\nto her, but sat perfectly still, slightly turned towards the door, but\r\nnot looking out, awaiting whatever might come. It seemed to Hester that\r\nnever in her life had she so understood the power of fate, the moment\r\nwhen Nature and life seem to stand still before some event. A minute\r\nafter, the footman came up and handed a telegram to Edward. He tore it\r\nopen with trembling hands. The next moment he jumped up from his seat\r\nwith a suppressed cry of triumph. "Hurrah!" he said, and then with a\r\nlaugh which was very unsteady held out the despatch to her. All that it\r\ncontained were the words "All right." But somehow it was not to these\r\nwords that Hester\'s eyes confined themselves. "From Ashton, London----"\r\nshe said without knowing that she did so, before he thrust the pink\r\npaper into his pocket. "Come along," he said, "the waltz is not half\r\nover. We shall be in time yet." And for the rest of the evening Edward\r\nwas in wild spirits, dancing every dance. He even asked the girls to\r\ntake him with them in their fly as far as the Grange in his reckless\r\nexhilaration, and as he got out in the darkness, Hester felt a kiss upon\r\nher hand. This startled her still more than the telegram. "Till\r\nto-morrow," he said as they rumbled away.\r\n\r\n"What does he mean by till to-morrow? He must be coming to make you an\r\noffer to-morrow--that is how they do. It often happens after a\r\ndance--when it is going to happen," Emma said in the darkness, with a\r\nlittle sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                              WAS IT LOVE?\r\n\r\n\r\nWas he in love? That this was a question very interesting to Hester\r\nthere can be no reason to conceal. She did not even conceal it from\r\nherself, nor did she trifle with herself by pretending to suppose that\r\nif he were in love it could be with any one else. There was no one else\r\nwho had ever appeared to attract him. To nobody had he so much as given\r\nhis passing attention. When he had neglected her at the Grange it had\r\nbeen truly, as he said, for no higher reason than that he might hand\r\ndown the old ladies to supper or tea. No young one had ever been\r\nsuggested as having any attraction for him. Hester did her best to enter\r\ncalmly into this question. It is one which it is sometimes very\r\ndifficult for a young woman to decide upon. What is conspicuous and\r\napparent to others will often remain to her a question full of doubt and\r\nuncertainty; and it is to be feared that when this is the case it is all\r\nthe more likely that her own sentiments will be capable of very little\r\nquestion. This, however, was not exactly the case with Hester. Her mind\r\nwas very much interested, and indeed excited. She wanted to know what\r\nEdward meant. From the first morning when he had met her, a child\r\nwandering on the Common, his manner had been different to her from the\r\nmanner of other people, or from his own manner to others. His eyes had\r\nlingered upon her with pleasure even when his look had been stealthy;\r\neven when it had been but a glance in passing, they had said things to\r\nher which no other eyes said. His interest in her had never failed. It\r\nhad not leaped like Harry\'s, after a good deal of indifference, into a\r\nsudden outburst. The very charm and attraction of it had lain in the\r\nrestraint which Hester had often considered to be dishonest, and against\r\nwhich she had chafed. She had known all through, even in those evenings\r\nwhen he had neglected her, that he was always conscious what she was\r\ndoing, and knew without looking when any one went to talk to her, when\r\nshe left the room and when she came back. This had kept her own interest\r\nin him unvarying. But Hester was not any more sure of her own sentiments\r\nthan of his. She remembered with some shame that Roland Ashton\'s\r\npresence had made a great difference in the state of her mind as\r\nregarded Edward. She had felt but little curiosity about him when that\r\nstranger was at the Vernonry. All the foreground of her mind had been so\r\npleasantly occupied by that new figure which was in itself much more\r\nattractive than Edward, that he had slid almost completely out of her\r\nthoughts. And this fact, which was only quite apparent to her after\r\nRoland was gone, had greatly discomfited Hester, and given her a very\r\nsmall opinion of herself. Was it possible that any new object that might\r\nappear would have the same effect upon her? The effect had passed away\r\nand Edward had come slowly back to his original position as the person\r\nwho in all Redborough interested her most. But the incident had been of\r\na very disturbing character, and had altogether confused her ideas.\r\nTherefore the question was one of a very special interest. To know\r\nexactly how he regarded her would much help her in deciding the other\r\nquestion, not less important, which was, how she regarded him?\r\nEverything thus depended, Hester felt, on Edward\'s sentiments. If it\r\nshould turn out that he loved her--strange thought which made her heart\r\nbeat!--it could not be but that in great and tender gratitude for such a\r\ngift she should love him. She did feel offended by his efforts to\r\ndisguise his feelings, or even to get the better of them--never at least\r\nwhen she was cool and in command of her judgment; but there could be no\r\ndoubt that she was very curious and anxious to know.\r\n\r\nWas he in love? The appearances which had made the lookers-on say so\r\nwere not altogether to be attributed to this, Hester knew. His paleness,\r\nhis excitement, his absence of mind, had all been from another cause.\r\nThe discovery had startled her much, and given her an uneasy sense that\r\nshe might at other times have referred to some cause connected with\r\nherself manifestations of feeling which had nothing to do with her,\r\nwhich belonged to an entirely different order of sentiments--a thought\r\nwhich made her blush red with shame, since there is nothing that hurts a\r\ngirl\'s pride so much as the suggestion, that she has been vain, and\r\nimagined, like the foolish women, a man to love her who perhaps has\r\nnever thought of her at all. But the question altogether was one which\r\nwas too profound for Hester. She could not tell what to make of it.\r\nAmong the heads of the young party at the Merridews, she was aware that\r\nno doubt was entertained on the matter. Edward was allotted to her by a\r\nsort of unspoken right, and in Ellen\'s jibes and Harry\'s gloom she read\r\nalike the same distinct understanding. Ellen in her chatter,\r\nnotwithstanding the warning to her cousin at the beginning, accepted it\r\nentirely as a matter of course: and in a hundred things that Edward had\r\nsaid as well as in his looks, which were still more eloquent, there had\r\nbeen strong confirmation of the general belief. But yet--Hester could\r\nnot make up her mind that it was beyond doubt. She watched him, not with\r\nanxiety so much as with a great curiosity. If it was not so, would she\r\nbe deeply disappointed? she asked herself without being able even to\r\nanswer that question. And as to her own sentiments, they were quite as\r\nperplexing. She was half ashamed to feel that they depended upon his.\r\nWas this a confession of feminine inferiority? she sometimes wondered\r\nwith a hot blush--the position here being very perplexing indeed and\r\nprofoundly difficult to elucidate; for it neither consisted with the\r\ngirl\'s dignity to give her love unsought, nor thus to wait as if ready\r\nto deliver up her affections to the first bidder.\r\n\r\nSuch a matter of thought, involving the greatest interests of life, is\r\ncuriously mixed up with its most frivolous events. They met in the midst\r\nof the dancing with a constant crash and accompaniment of dance-music,\r\namid chatterings and laughter, and all the inane nothings of a\r\nball-room, and yet in the midst of this were to consider and decide the\r\nmost important question of their lives. It was only thus, except by\r\nconcerted meetings which would have solved the question, that they could\r\nmeet at all, and the grotesque incongruity of such surroundings with the\r\nmatter in the foreground, sometimes affected Hester with a sort of moral\r\nsickness and disgust. The scene seemed to throw a certain unworthiness,\r\nlevity, unelevated aspect upon the question altogether--as if this thing\r\nwhich was to affect two lives was no more than an engagement for a\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nAnd though it is a strange thing to say, it is doubtful whether Edward\r\nwas much more decided in his sentiments than Hester was. In such a case\r\nthe man at least generally knows more or less what he wants; but partly\r\nbecause Edward\'s mind was in a high state of excitement on other\r\nsubjects, he too was for a moment entirely uncertain as to what his\r\nwishes were. He knew with sufficient distinctness that he could not\r\ntolerate the idea of her appropriation by any one else, and it was his\r\nfull intention that some time or other Hester should be his, and no one\r\nelse\'s, which gave a foundation of certainty to his thoughts which was\r\nwanting to hers. But further than this, he too was in a chaos somewhat\r\nsimilar to that of Hester. Sometimes there was in his mind the strongest\r\nimpulse to tell her that he loved her, and to settle the matter by an\r\nengagement, which must, however, he felt, be a secret one, giving\r\nsatisfaction to themselves but no one else. And here it may be remarked\r\nthat whereas Hester was apt to be seized by sudden fits of shame at the\r\nidea that perhaps, after all her thoughts on the subject, he was not\r\nthinking of her at all, Edward on the other hand felt no such alarm, and\r\nnever thought it even presumptuous on his part to assume the certainty\r\nof her love for him, which, as the reader knows, was a certainty to\r\nwhich she had not herself attained. He believed with simplicity that\r\nwhen, if ever (nay, certainly it was to happen some time), he declared\r\nhimself, Hester would respond at once. He acknowledged to himself that\r\nit was possible that in pique, or impatience, or weariness, if he did\r\nnot keep a vigilant watch over the situation, it might happen that\r\nHester would accept some one else. Her mother might drive her to it, or\r\nthe impossibility of going on longer might drive her to it; but he had\r\nso much confidence in the simplicity of her nature that he did not\r\nbelieve that the complications which held him in on every side could\r\naffect her, and was sure that in her heart the question was solved in\r\nthe most primitive way.\r\n\r\nThis was and generally is the great difference between the man and woman\r\nin such a controversy; until he had spoken, it was a shame to her that\r\nshe should ask herself did he intend to speak; but Edward felt no shame\r\nif ever the idea crossed his mind that he might be mistaken in supposing\r\nshe loved him; such a discovery would have made him furious. He would\r\nhave aimed all sorts of ill names, such as coquette and jilt, at her;\r\nbut he had no fear of any such mistake. He felt sure that he had her in\r\nhis power, and when he did declare himself would be received with\r\nenthusiasm; and he always meant to declare himself some time, to reward\r\nher long suspense, and to make her the happiest of women. In words, this\r\npart is generally allotted to the lady, as it was in the days of\r\nchivalry. But the nineteenth century has modified many things, and if\r\never (out of America) it was really the woman who occupied the more\r\ncommanding position, it is no longer so in the apprehension of the\r\nworld. Only in this particular case, as has been seen, Edward was wrong.\r\nIt is possible enough that in the curious position of affairs between\r\nthem she would have followed his lead whatever it might be; but even\r\nthis was by no means certain, and as a matter of fact, though her\r\ncuriosity about him drew her mind after him, she had not even gone so\r\nfar as he had, nor come to any ultimate certainty on the case at all.\r\n\r\nEmma Ashton, who by means of propinquity--that quick knitter of\r\nbonds--had become Hester\'s frequent companion, had very different ideas\r\non a similar subject. There was no sort of indefiniteness in her views.\r\nShe was perfectly clear as to what she was likely to do in a given case,\r\nand the case in question occupied probably almost as great a share in\r\nher thoughts as the different yet similar question which agitated the\r\nmind of Hester. It was indeed to outward view, though with so many and\r\nsubtle differences, a very similar question. Emma\'s wonder was whether\r\nReginald Merridew would "speak" before she went away. She had no doubt\r\nthat all the requisite sentiments were existing, and she had satisfied\r\nherself that when he did "speak" there was no reason why she should not\r\nreply favourably. The family was "quite respectable," it might almost be\r\nsaid also that it was "quite well off," but that there were rumours that\r\nAlgernon was to be "made an eldest son of," which were somewhat\r\ndisquieting. The suggestion was one which made Emma indignant,\r\nnotwithstanding the gratitude she owed Algernon and his wife for giving\r\nher "her chance" in Redborough.\r\n\r\n"When there is an estate I suppose it is all right," Emma said; "anyhow\r\nit can\'t be helped when that\'s the case; and there must be an eldest\r\nson. But when your property is in money it does seem such a mistake to\r\nmake a difference between your children. Don\'t you think so? Oh, but I\r\ndo; they are just one as good as another, and why should one be rich and\r\nanother poor? If old Mr. Merridew does anything of this sort I am sure I\r\nshall always think it is very unfair."\r\n\r\n"I suppose Mr. Merridew has a right to do what he pleases?" said Hester;\r\n"and as it does not matter to us----"\r\n\r\n"You speak a great deal too fast," said Emma, offended. "Say it doesn\'t\r\nmatter to you: but it may to me a great deal, and therefore I take a\r\ngreat interest in it. Do you think parents have a right to do what they\r\nplease? If they make us come into the world, whether we wish it or not,\r\nof course they are bound to do their best for us. I am the youngest\r\nmyself, and I hope I know my place; but then there was no money at all\r\namong us. Papa spent it all himself; so certainly we had share and share\r\nalike, for there was nothing. When that\'s the case nobody can have a\r\nword to say. But the Merridews have a good deal, and every one ought to\r\nhave his just share. Not but what I like Algernon Merridew very much. He\r\nis always very agreeable, and I think it very nice both of Ellen and him\r\nthat they should have been so kind to me and given me my chance, though\r\nyou say we\'re no relations. I am sure I always thought we were\r\nrelations, for my part."\r\n\r\n"Did you think Reginald was your relation too?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not perhaps quite so far as that--a connection I should have\r\nsaid; but it does not matter very much now," Emma said, with a little\r\nsimper of satisfaction. "What a good thing Roland found out about\r\ngrandpapa and grandmamma, Hester--and how fortunate that they should\r\nhave asked _me_! If everything goes right I shall feel that I owe the\r\nhappiness of my life to it. When a girl goes out upon a visit, she never\r\nknows what may happen before she gets home--or even she may never need\r\nto go home at all. I don\'t know if I shall, I am sure. To talk about\r\nanything taking place from Roland\'s house would be absurd. Why, we don\'t\r\neven know the clergyman! and nobody cares a bit about us. If there was\r\nany meaning in home it should be from Elinor\'s, you know--for everybody\r\nknows us there."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean about \'anything taking place\'?--and from--from what?"\r\nHester asked, who never paid too much attention to Emma\'s monologues,\r\nand had altogether lost the thread of her discoursings now.\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried Emma, clasping Hester\'s arm close, "how you do make one\r\nblush! Of course you know very well what I mean. If he speaks before I\r\ngo away--and I am sure I hope he will, for it would be such a nuisance\r\nto have him following me up to Kilburn!--I don\'t suppose there would be\r\nany occasion for waiting long. Why should people wait when they are well\r\noff enough, and nothing to be gained by it? When the man has not got\r\nsettled in a proper situation, or when there is not enough to live upon,\r\nthen of course they must put it off; but in such a case as ours--I mean\r\nthis, you know--it might as well be here as anywhere," Emma said,\r\nreflectively. "Cousin Catherine has always been very kind to me. Rather\r\nthan let grandpapa and grandmamma be disturbed at their age, I shouldn\'t\r\nwonder if she would give the breakfast--especially considering the\r\ndouble connection, and that it is such a very good thing to get me\r\nsettled. You needn\'t laugh, Hester. It is not a thing to laugh at.\r\nUnless I had settled, what should I have done? You are an only daughter,\r\nyou don\'t know what it is to be the youngest and have no proper home."\r\n\r\nThese words mollified Hester, who had been in lofty opposition, half\r\ndisgusted, half indignant. She was brought down by this appeal to her\r\nsympathy. "But you are happy with your brother?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--happy enough; Roland is very kind. And though it\'s a small\r\nhouse, it is tolerably nice, and two maids with nothing particular to\r\ndo. But it is very dull, you know, and I don\'t know many people. And you\r\nmust always take into consideration that at any moment Roland might\r\nmarry, and then where should I be? Why, he admires you very much. He\r\nmight just as likely as not, next time he comes, make you an offer; and\r\nthen where should I be?"\r\n\r\n"You think, I suppose," said Hester, loftily, "that when a man makes an\r\noffer, as you say, that is all about it; there is no opposition to be\r\nlooked for on the girl\'s side?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know," said Emma, "I call you one of the high-flown ones.\r\nThere are always some like that. But in an ordinary way what do girls\r\nwant but their chance? And when they\'ve got it, what folly to refuse--at\r\nleast in my position, Hester. If I don\'t get settled, what have I to\r\nlook forward to? Roland will marry sooner or later. He\'s an awful flirt,\r\nand though he admires you very much, I shouldn\'t advise you to have\r\nanything to do with him unless you just marry him out and out. I should\r\nthink he\'d make a good husband. But don\'t be engaged to him, Hester;\r\nmind my words. Be married in three weeks, or have nothing to say to\r\nhim--that is my advice. Oh, you need not be huffy. I am sure I don\'t\r\nwant you or any one to marry him, at least till I am settled. But if I\r\ndon\'t settle now, he is sure, of course, to marry some time; and then\r\nwhere shall I be? This is what makes me wish that if--_he_, you know, is\r\ngoing to speak, he would do it, and not shilly-shally. It is astonishing\r\nhow men shilly-shally. I think they take a pleasure in it. They would\r\nknow better if they had to wait as we have, and wonder, and feel that we\r\ncan\'t make any arrangements or settle anything till we know what\'s\r\ncoming. If I have to go away and he never says anything, I don\'t know\r\nwhat I shall do."\r\n\r\n"Is this because you--care so much for Reginald Merridew?" Hester could\r\nnot so form her lips as to say love.\r\n\r\nEmma made a sort of reflective pause. "I like him well enough," she\r\nsaid. "I am not one to go on about love and so forth. Besides, that sort\r\nof thing is not becoming in a girl. You can\'t, till you are quite\r\ncertain what _they_ mean, don\'t you know? It is dreadful to go caring\r\nfor them, and all that, and then to find out that they don\'t care for\r\nyou. A girl has to wait till they speak."\r\n\r\nHester listened not with her usual mixture of amusement and indignation,\r\nbut with a curious feeling of shame and alarm growing in her. Was not\r\nthis what she herself was doing? Emma\'s desire that her supposed lover\r\nshould speak and settle the question, was it not much the same thing as\r\nher own curiosity and self-questioning in respect to Edward? Emma was\r\nalways more practical. She was so in sentimental matters as well as in\r\neverything else. Things that other people leave indistinct, in a half\r\nlight, she put clearly, without any pretences at obscurity. Her grieved\r\nsense of the shilly-shallying of men, her consciousness of all the\r\ninconveniences that arose from their way of putting off their\r\nexplanations, her prudential conviction that a girl should not commit\r\nherself by "caring for" _them_, before they made it apparent that they\r\ncared for her--were these not so many vulgar, straightforward statements\r\nof the dilemma in which Hester too found herself? But this grotesque\r\nresemblance of sentiment and situation made Hester, as may be supposed,\r\npassionately angry and indignant, not with Emma, who was guiltless, and\r\nwho pursued the subject endlessly, never tiring of it, nor of going over\r\nthe matter again and again from the beginning as they walked, but with\r\nherself and Edward, and fate, which had placed her in such\r\ncircumstances. It was something like a caricature of herself that was\r\nthus presented to her, and she could scarcely help laughing at it, even\r\nwhile she resented it warmly as an insult offered to her by--whom? not\r\nEmma--by circumstances and evil fortune, and the spite of a position\r\nwhich was intolerable, and Catherine Vernon. All these persons were\r\nconspiring against her, but none of them were so hard upon Hester as\r\nthis little purring deliberate Emma, holding up her little distorted\r\nmirror that Hester in her pride might see how like was the image in it\r\nto her own troubled face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                               CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile all these agitations were going on, it came to be Christmas, with\r\nthe usual stir and commotion always produced in a large family and\r\nconnections, by that often troublesome festival. The amount of reality\r\nin the rejoicings may be very doubtful, but yet there must be a family\r\ngathering, and the different branches of the race must seem to take\r\nkindly to it whatever may be their private sentiments. Dickens did\r\nwisely in finding his types of Christmas felicity among people to whom\r\nan accidental turkey is a benediction from heaven, and the mystery of\r\nthe pudding has not lost its freshness. In such a family as the Vernons,\r\nthe turkey and the pudding are unsatisfactory symbols--a return to the\r\nrude elements of plenty which were employed by a more primitive age; and\r\nthough it certainly was an excitement for the Miss Vernon-Ridgways, and\r\nMr. Mildmay Vernon and Mrs. John, to be invited to dinner, it was by no\r\nmeans invariable that their feast improved the harmony of these much\r\nseparated divisions of the family. It was a very big dinner, and there\r\nwas no absolute breach of the peace. Catherine sat at the head of the\r\ntable in a dress which, though very handsome, was by no means one of her\r\nbest, and without the diamonds in which she appeared on very great\r\noccasions. This was kindly intended, in order that she might not make\r\ntoo evident the contrast between her own toilette and that of some of\r\nher visitors; but the kindness of the intention was not appreciated.\r\n\r\n"We are not considered worth dressing for," Miss Matilda said, in her\r\nsister\'s ear, after they had respectively kissed their relative, and,\r\nwith effusion, wished her a merry Christmas.\r\n\r\n"She thinks it better taste to be as shabby as we are," said the other,\r\nwhich indeed was very true, though no offence was meant.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs. John, though she was quite willing to enjoy herself, her\r\nmind was kept in a state of nervous anxiety about Hester, who was in the\r\ndefiant mood with which she always met her cousin. It had been her\r\nmother\'s desire to dress her plainly in one of the simple dresses made\r\nup on the foundation of the "silk slip," which by this time had been\r\nworn out as a ball-dress. These economies were very necessary, and\r\nindeed it ought to be said that the ball-dresses could not have been\r\nkept up as they were, but for the sacrifice of Mrs. John\'s Indian shawl,\r\nwhich, after Hester and the pearls, was the thing in the world which the\r\npoor lady held most dear.\r\n\r\nHester had not resisted the substitution of the simpler dress for those\r\ncarefully preserved clouds of tarlatan which were sacred to the Dancing\r\nTeas. But she stood firm to the pearls, and insisted on wearing them.\r\n"Unless you will put them on yourself, mamma," she said.\r\n\r\n"I wear them, Hester! Oh, no! They have been in their box all these\r\nyears, and I have never put them on, you know. I kept them for you. But\r\ndon\'t you think, dear, that just for a family dinner--no one is expected\r\nto be fine at a family dinner----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want Catherine Vernon to see them, mother? If it is so, tell\r\nme at once."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I want Catherine Vernon--to see them?" cried Mrs. John, stupefied\r\nwith astonishment. "I wonder," she added, regretfully, "what there is\r\nbetween you that makes you lose your good sense, Hester--for you are\r\nvery sensible in most things, and far cleverer than I ever was--the\r\nmoment Catherine Vernon\'s name is mentioned? I cannot think what it can\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother! You are too good--if that is what not being clever means.\r\nWhen I think how you have been allowed to stand in the corner of that\r\nroom, and nobody taking any notice of you."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Mrs. John, mildly, "I did not require to go unless I\r\nliked."\r\n\r\n"And now this dinner--a sort of Christmas dole for her relations--like\r\nthe flannel petticoats to the poor women."\r\n\r\n"We do not require to go unless we like," said Mrs. John; "but if you\r\nwill reflect a little, Hester, that is not how a lady should talk."\r\n\r\nIt was seldom that the mild little woman said so much. When Hester came\r\nup to Catherine, following her mother\'s little figure, clothed in a\r\nblack silk gown which had seen a great deal of service, she read, with\r\nan excitement that made her glow, that Catherine\'s first glance was upon\r\nthe pearls.\r\n\r\n"You are quite fine," she said as she went through the Christmas\r\nformula, and dropped a formal kiss upon Hester\'s reluctant cheek; "you\r\nhave put on your lovely pearls to do us honour."\r\n\r\n"She is fond of the pearls," said Mrs. John, who was very watchful to\r\nprevent any collision; "they were her grandmother\'s, and her\r\ngreat-grandmother\'s, Catherine. It is not only for their value that one\r\nis fond of things like these."\r\n\r\n"Their value is sometimes the worst thing about them," said Catherine,\r\nfeeling that there was a sternness of virtue in what she said which\r\njustified her dislike. But Mrs. John stood her ground.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so," she said simply. "I like them to be worth a great\r\ndeal, for they are all she will have."\r\n\r\nHester, thus talked over, stood drawing back, in all her flush of\r\nyouthful indignation, kept down by the necessities of the occasion. She\r\ngave a glance round at the little audience which was enjoying the\r\nencounter, the Miss Vernon-Ridgways in the foreground. She caught their\r\nkeen inquisitive stare, and the mantling of delight upon their faces as\r\nthey witnessed the little passage of arms; and Mr. Vernon Mildmay\r\ncraning over their shoulders with his sharp face projected to see what\r\nit was, and Mrs. Reginald\'s countenance half sympathetic,\r\nhalf-preoccupied (for to-day for the first time her eldest boy had\r\naccompanied her, and she was very anxious lest he should do or say\r\nanything that might injure him with Catherine). But the one thing Hester\r\ndid not catch was Edward\'s eyes, which surely, if he had cared for her,\r\nought now to have been raised in kindness. He was outside of the circle,\r\nhis head turned away, taking no notice. When Mrs. John fell back to give\r\nway to Ellen Merridew, who came up rustling and jingling with all her\r\nbracelets, Edward still kept apart. He was talking to Harry, to\r\nAlgernon, to everybody except the two who, Hester felt, wanted the\r\nsuccour of a chivalrous sympathy. But Mrs. John had no feeling of this\r\nkind. She felt that she had held her own. She looked with a mild pride\r\nupon the group of her neighbours all so eagerly watching for mischief.\r\nIt was natural, when you think of it, that she should treat the\r\nill-nature of the Miss Vernon-Ridgways with gentle disdain. Poor things!\r\nthey had neither a daughter nor a necklace of pearls. And as she had not\r\nbeen at the _Th\xe9s dansantes_, nor seen Edward in any aspect but that he\r\nhad always borne at the Grange, she felt no anxiety as to his present\r\nbehaviour. Harry\'s was the eye which she sought. She beamed with smiles\r\nwhen he came and stood beside her. Harry was always faithful, whoever\r\nmight be careless. She looked at him and at Hester with a little sigh;\r\nbut who could tell what might happen with patience and time?\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one moment during the evening in which Edward had\r\nthe opportunity of setting himself right. It was while the departures\r\nwere going on, while the ladies were being shawled and cloaked.\r\nCatherine had not come down stairs, and in the darkness of the further\r\ncorner of the hall, under cover of the chatter of Ellen and Emma Ashton,\r\nthe young man ventured upon a hurried whisper--\r\n\r\n"Do you despise me or detest me most?" he said in Hester\'s ear. She\r\nstarted--what with the sudden proximity, what with the unexpected\r\ncharacter of the question.\r\n\r\n"I wonder?" she answered coldly. He took the opportunity of wrapping her\r\ncloak round her to grasp both her hands in a sudden, almost fierce\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n"You could do nothing less: but I cannot be different here. Suspicion\r\nproduces treachery, don\'t you know?" he said, with his face close to her\r\near. "I cannot be true here. No, don\'t say anything. I ought, but I\r\ncannot. It is in the air. All of us, every one except you, we are making\r\nbelieve and finding each other out, yet going on all the same. But it is\r\nonly for a time," Edward cried, grasping her hands once more till the\r\npressure was painful, "only for a time!"\r\n\r\nNext moment he was standing at the door, impassible, saying good-night\r\nto every one, paying no more heed to Hester than if she had been, as\r\nindeed she was, the least important of all the Christmas visitors.\r\nEllen, as a married woman and a social power, commanded his attention,\r\nand to Emma, as the stranger among so many who knew each other, he was\r\nvery polite. But Hester got from him the coolest good-night. The very\r\nservants who stood about, felt a passing wonder that the prettiest\r\nperson in the company should meet with such scant observation, but\r\nexplained it by saying to each other that "Mr. Edward, he was the one as\r\nkep\' hold of the main chance."\r\n\r\nAnd Hester went home, angry, yet somewhat soothed. It did not make her\r\nless indignant, less wrathful; but it gave an excuse which at least had\r\nto be taken into consideration. Before she got home, indeed, she taught\r\nherself to lay that offence too to the score of Catherine. She went home\r\npacked into the fly with her mother and Emma and the Miss\r\nVernon-Ridgways, all together. Mr. Mildmay Vernon was mounted on the\r\nbox, and the old white horse had the six people, besides his driver, to\r\ndrag behind him. He took a great deal of time over the short bit of\r\nroad, thinking probably that it was as well to take his time over one\r\nfare as to put it in the power of his oppressors to send him out with\r\nanother, or perhaps compel him to kick his heels at the railway station\r\nwaiting for the last train. The ladies were packed very close inside,\r\nbut not too close to talk. The sisters immediately plunged into that\r\n"criticism of life" which could scarcely be called poetry, in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"What a blessing it is," said one, "that we can\'t be called upon to eat\r\nanother Christmas dinner with Catherine for another year."\r\n\r\n"Dear Catherine!" said the other, "she always means so well. It is our\r\nown fault if we don\'t carry out her intentions."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said Mrs. John, "she gave us a very nice dinner, and\r\neverything was very comfortable."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. John! you are always so charitable," said Miss Matilda, "as\r\nwe all ought to be, I am sure. Did you ever see anything so insufferable\r\nas that little Ellen--like a picture out of a fashion-book--giving\r\nherself as many airs as if she were at the head of society? I never\r\nheard she had any society, except the vulgar young people on the\r\nThursdays. I wonder she doesn\'t ask her shop people."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, hush!" cried Mrs. John, alarmed.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she does ask the shop people," said Miss Matilda, "it would be\r\nwise of her, for I should not think they\'d ever see the colour of their\r\nmoney. The old Merridews can never keep up all that extravagance, and\r\nAlgy is nothing more than a clerk in his father\'s office. It is dreadful\r\nto see a young man dragged on to destruction like that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope it is not so bad!" cried Mrs. John. "I am sure if I thought\r\nso, I should never let----"\r\n\r\n"It is the talk of the town," said Miss Matilda. "A thing must be very\r\nbad before it comes to us, who never hear any gossip."\r\n\r\n"Oh, everybody knows," said Miss Martha.\r\n\r\nIt was happy that Hester\'s mind was so fully occupied, and that the\r\nconversation passed harmlessly over her head. When they reached the\r\nVernonry, Mr. Mildmay Vernon got down from the box where he had been\r\nseated wrapped up from head to foot, but which he protested against with\r\na continuous volley of short coughs as he helped the ladies out one\r\nafter another. He thought in his heart that if one of these strong young\r\nwomen had been put up on the box, who had no rheumatism, it would have\r\nbeen more appropriate.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have enjoyed your evening, including your dinner," he said.\r\n"I have made up my mind to rheumatism to-morrow; but what does that\r\nmatter in comparison with such a delightful entertainment?"\r\n\r\n"It was very nice," said Mrs. John, dubious as to his meaning, as she\r\nalways was.\r\n\r\n"Nice!" he said, with a grimace, "a sort of little heaven on earth!"\r\n\r\n"It is wicked to be so satirical," said one sister, with a laugh; and\r\n"Dear Catherine! I am sure she meant everything that was kind," said the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a little flutter of good-nights, the respective doors\r\nopening, and lights flashing out into the dark.\r\n\r\nThis entertainment was followed very shortly after by the larger\r\ngathering which Catherine had announced her intention of giving some\r\ntime before, and to which all Redborough was convoked besides the\r\nimmediate family. The period between these two parties was the climax of\r\nHester\'s hostility to Catherine Vernon. She had never been so actively\r\nindignant, so angry, nor so impotent against her old and wealthy cousin\r\nas in these wintry days. Catherine was a kind of impersonation of\r\ninjustice and unkindness to Hester. She felt not only that she herself\r\nwas oppressed and injured, but that the persecution of which she was the\r\nobject was of a kind which was most petty and miserable, degrading to\r\nthe author of it as well as to its victim. The attempt at interference\r\nwith her movements was not only a kind of meddling most irritating to a\r\nhigh-spirited girl, but it was also the kind of assault which her very\r\npride prevented her from resisting openly. Hester felt that she would\r\nhave lowered her own pride, and wounded her own self-respect, had she\r\nuttered a word of reply or taken any notice of the small and petty\r\nattack upon her. The incident of the pearls, though so trifling, excited\r\nher almost as much as the other and more important grievance she had\r\nagainst Catherine. That Edward should be so cowed by this woman that he\r\nhad to conceal his real sentiments, to offend the girl whom he loved, to\r\ncompromise his own honour and dignity all because of Catherine\'s watch\r\nupon him, and the subjection in which it held him, was such a miserable\r\nthought to Hester, that it was all she could do to restrain herself at\r\nall. It is terrible to be compelled to endure one who has harmed those\r\nwho are dear to you; but to enter her house and preserve a show of peace\r\nand good-feeling, though you are aware she is causing the\r\nself-debasement of those you love, that is the hardest of all. What\r\nshould it matter to Edward that Catherine\'s eye was upon him? An\r\nhonourable and fine spirit would not have been influenced by any such\r\noppression. It made Hester\'s heart sick to think that he did this\r\nconsciously, deceived his benefactress, and pretended to obey her when\r\nin his heart he loathed his bondage; and to think that she herself\r\nshould be called upon to sustain this humiliation filled her with shame\r\nand rage. But though her heart was bitter against Edward, there was yet\r\na softening in it, an involuntary indulgence, which made her glad to\r\nelude the question so far as he was concerned, and to fix upon\r\nCatherine, who was the cause of it, with all her force of indignation.\r\n\r\nFrom Hester\'s point of view there was indeed little to be said for this\r\nwoman, who, to so many in the place, was the very impersonation of\r\nactive benevolence and goodness--a tyrant who seized upon the very soul\r\nof the young man whom she favoured most, and whose prying and vigilant\r\nobservation forced him to deception, and made him true to himself only\r\nwhen he was out of her sight--a woman, who while she gave with one hand\r\nclosed a grasp of iron upon the people obliged to her with the other,\r\nand would prescribe their very dress if she could. Oh, how true it must\r\nbe after all, the picture of the tyrannical, narrow despot, exacting,\r\nremorseless, descending to the lowest details, which a woman, when\r\nendued with irresponsible power, was understood to make! Hester had\r\nrebelled as a girl does against every such injurious picture of women;\r\nbut it occurred to her now that it must all be true. No doubt it was\r\nunsafe to trust such a creature with any kind of authority. She would\r\nnot be content with less than absolute sway. She would let no charity\r\nnor ruth, nor the hearts of others, nor their wishes, stand in her way.\r\nShe would crush a young life with no more compunction than a savage.\r\nThus Hester took refuge from questions more trying--from the aspect of\r\nEdward which within these last few days had become more and more\r\nimportant to her. Her whole being seemed to be flowing towards him with\r\na current which she felt herself unable to restrain. She did not any\r\nlonger ask herself questions about his love. She tried not to ask any\r\nquestions about him at all. In her secret consciousness there was a\r\ndistrust of him, and disapproval and fear, which had never been breathed\r\ninto any ear--scarcely even into her own. Indeed, Hester was her own\r\nonly confidant. All the things which occupied her were uncommunicable.\r\nShe had grown a woman, everything that happened was now more important\r\nto her than in earlier days. And now there had come a crisis in her\r\nfate, and it was not she who held the key of the problem, nor her lover,\r\nnor any legitimate authority--but Catherine! Catherine controlled her\r\nfuture and all its issues through him. Catherine could have stopped all\r\nfurther development for both, she could have checked their love\r\nruthlessly, and made an end of their happiness. The girl began to feel\r\nthat there was something in the presence of this woman, in her\r\ninfluence, in her very name, that was insupportable. That impulse of\r\nflight which always presents itself to the impatient spirit came upon\r\nher strongly. Why should not she and her mother shake themselves free\r\nfrom the imbroglio--go away anywhere, it did not matter where, and get\r\npeace, at least, and a life free of agitations and complications? Away\r\nfrom the Vernons she would be free to work as she pleased, and so make\r\nup for the aid that Catherine gave--away from them there would be no\r\nmore question of love and hate, love afraid to declare itself, hate\r\nveiled beneath the aspect of benevolence.\r\n\r\nHester had very little to do at home. She had not even books to read.\r\nShe had unbounded time to think; even her visits to her old friends, the\r\ncaptain and his wife, had grown less frequent since Emma came, for\r\nEmma\'s monologues were not amusing to Hester\'s excited mind, and the\r\ncaptain and Mrs. Morgan had both yielded to their granddaughter\'s\r\nirrepressible talent of speech. Hester was more at home in consequence,\r\nmore alone, less subject to wholesome distractions and interruptions.\r\nShe would think and think the whole evening through. The _Th\xe9s\r\ndansantes_ began to fill her with a sort of sickening, of weariness, and\r\ndisgust. She felt as if she too, like Emma, had gone to get her "chance"\r\nthere, and was, like Emma, hung up in degrading suspense until he should\r\nspeak. The rage with her position, the scorn of herself with which this\r\nfilled her, is indescribable. She would burst forth into wild laughter\r\nafter one of Emma\'s calculations, often repeated, about Reginald\r\nMerridew; then hide her face in her hands to conceal the burning\r\nblush--the bitter consciousness that her own circumstances were not much\r\ndifferent. The self-ridicule was more painful still than the\r\nself-disgust. She shed no tears over the question, but the laughter was\r\na great deal more bitter than any tears.\r\n\r\nMrs. John was as unconscious of this struggle as if it had gone on in\r\nKamschatka and not under her own eye, in her own parlour, and the\r\nbedroom that opened into hers. She was not one of the women who divine.\r\nShe understood what was told her, and not always that--never anything\r\nmore than was told her. She thought her child was not looking well, but\r\nthen, she had a cold; and there is nothing more oppressive than a cold.\r\nThe first thing that really startled her was Hester\'s determination not\r\nto go to Mrs. Merridew\'s party on the first Thursday that occurred after\r\nChristmas, which was to be a particularly brilliant one. This struck her\r\nmother with consternation.\r\n\r\n"Do you think your cold is so bad as that? I would not wish you to do\r\nanything imprudent, but I have often heard girls say that a ball was the\r\nvery best thing for a cold. If you were to nurse up this evening, and\r\nhave your breakfast in bed, I can\'t help thinking you would feel quite\r\nyourself to-morrow, my darling," Mrs. John said.\r\n\r\n"It is not my cold," said Hester; and then she reflected that it was a\r\npity to throw aside so excellent a plea. "At least it is not altogether\r\nmy cold."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know how oppressed one feels, just good for nothing; but, my\r\nlove, you would feel sorry after. It is a pity to give in. You shall\r\nhave a foot-bath to-night with some mustard in it, and a hot drink. And\r\nyou must not get up till mid-day. You\'ll feel a great deal better after\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go--I am tired of them," Hester said, her impatience\r\ngetting the better of her, "once a week is a great deal too often. I am\r\nsick of the very name of dancing."\r\n\r\n"My love!" cried her mother in consternation. Then she came behind her\r\nand gave her a soft little kiss. "I think I shall give you quinine, for\r\nI am sure you\'re low," she said, "and you must be bright and well, and\r\nlooking your best for Catherine\'s great party, which is next week."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t----" cried Hester, then stopped short, for she had not the\r\nheart to give her mother a double wound by declaring she would not go to\r\nCatherine\'s party. One such blow was enough at a time.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment with which her non-appearance at Mrs. Merridew\'s was\r\nregarded by all the connection was unbounded. The discovery that Hester\r\n_was not going_, filled the Miss Ridgways with excitement. What could be\r\nthe cause?\r\n\r\n"I suppose there has been a quarrel," the sisters said. "Ellen is a\r\nlittle minx; but still she is a true Vernon, and won\'t stand any such\r\nairs as that girl gives herself. Her mother and she are insupportable,\r\nwith their pearls and their pretences."\r\n\r\n"Roman pearls," said Mr. Mildmay Vernon, "and Brummagem pretences."\r\n\r\nSo they discussed the question. When Hester went in next day to Captain\r\nMorgan\'s, not without a little curiosity to hear from Emma what had been\r\nsaid of her absence: "I am glad you have recovered," Mrs. Morgan said,\r\nkissing her, and looking into her face with an air of reproach and a\r\nshake of the head.\r\n\r\n"It is not like you to give in for a cold," the old captain added; but\r\nfortunately for Hester all explanation on her part, and all remonstrance\r\non theirs, was cut short by the persevering deliberate voice which now\r\nwas the principal circumstance in the old people\'s house.\r\n\r\n"I assure you Ellen was very much astonished, Hester. She looked at me\r\nas if she could not believe her eyes. And they all looked at me as if it\r\nwas my fault. How could it be my fault? I didn\'t give you your cold. I\r\nthink there were more people than usual. We had Sir Roger de Coverley,\r\nyou know, because it was Christmas. I danced it with young Mr. Norris,\r\nwho has just come into his fortune, you know. He is very nice. He asked\r\nme for four dances, but I only gave him three. Don\'t you think I was\r\nright, grandmamma? That is the worst of Ellen\'s parties, that there are\r\nno old chaperons with experience, that could advise you on a point like\r\nthat. Two waltzes and then the Sir Roger, which is a sort of extra you\r\nknow, and doesn\'t count. I don\'t think there could be anything wrong in\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"You should not give in, Hester," said the old captain. "That is not\r\nlike you. What is a cold at your age! You should always stand to your\r\ncolours, and hold your----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I said to everybody, Hester had such a bad cold," said Emma. "I\r\nsaid that her nose was red and that it quite affected her voice. So it\r\ndoes. You don\'t notice it so much when she flames up like that. I wonder\r\nhow you can blush in that way, Hester. It is the difference of\r\ncomplexion, I suppose. I always keep the same. It is nice in some ways,\r\nfor however hot it is you can be sure you are not a figure; but in other\r\nrespects I should like to change colour like that. It makes you look\r\ninteresting. People think you are so sensitive, and that sort of thing,\r\nwhen it\'s only just complexion. Harry Vernon was more grumphy than ever\r\nbecause you were not there, always standing about beside Ellen and\r\nlooking after her, which, considering she\'s married, is a great deal\r\nmore than any brother ought to take upon him. I am sure if Roland did, I\r\nshould not know what to think. But then Ellen is an only sister, which\r\nmakes a great difference, and I am the youngest. Reginald Merridew was\r\nin such a way! I was engaged for almost every dance before he came. I\r\nquite enjoyed it. I filled up my card as soon as I could, just to give\r\nhim a lesson. Men should be kept in their proper places. I never thought\r\nyou showed half a spirit letting Edward Vernon carry you off just as he\r\npleased."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said old Mrs. Morgan, making an endeavour to strike in, we\r\nhave not seen half so much of you lately as we like to do. My old man\r\nmisses you on his walk. Do go and take a walk with him, as your cold is\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t send her away when I just want to talk over everything," said\r\nEmma. "You never think what young people like. I am sure you are very\r\nkind and nice, grandmamma, I always say so. Whatever any one may think,\r\nI always maintain that you have been very nice and kind to me: and kept\r\nme such a time--when I dare say you are tired of me. But you don\'t\r\nremember what young people like. Of course Hester wants to hear who was\r\nthere, and how every one was looking, and who danced with who, and all\r\nthat. There are always a hundred things that we have to say to each\r\nother. Come up with me to my room, Hester, and then we sha\'n\'t bore\r\ngrandmamma and grandpapa. I have such a lot to tell you. Ellen had such\r\na lovely new dress, old gold and black. It sounds much too old for her,\r\nbut it wasn\'t a bit. It was quite a change among all the whites and\r\npinks. I just went in my grenadine. I don\'t pretend to cope with the\r\nrich girls, you know. If the men want to dance with rich dresses they\r\nmust just leave me alone. I am always straightforward. I say, \'Don\'t ask\r\nme unless you are sure you don\'t mind.\' But I suppose they like my\r\ndancing or something, for I always have my card full. Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley was really fun. We were all dancing, it seemed about a mile\r\ngoing down the middle. It is such a pity you weren\'t there. Edward\r\nVernon danced it with--I really forget who he danced it with--one of the\r\nMiss Bradleys or Mary Wargrave, or one of that set. Are you really going\r\nout with grandpapa? That is awfully self-denying of you, to please the\r\nold gentleman. And it is so cold. Grandmamma, I do think you shouldn\'t\r\nlet her go."\r\n\r\n"She can hear your report another time--indeed she has heard a great\r\ndeal of it already," said old Mrs. Morgan. "You don\'t lose any time,\r\nEmma. But, Hester, if you are afraid----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shouldn\'t go on any account," cried Emma, "with a bad cold. But\r\nthen I have such dreadful colds when I do have them. I am obliged to go\r\nto bed. I never get my nose red like Hester\'s, nor lose my voice--but I\r\nget such a cough. I am so thankful I have not had one here. It gives\r\neverybody so much trouble when you get ill on a visit, and you lose all\r\nthe good of the visit, and might just as well be at home. There is\r\ngrandpapa calling. I should just let him call if it was me. Well,\r\nHester, if you will go, I can\'t help it. Come in again if you are not\r\nafraid of the evening air, and you shall hear all the rest; or if you\'ll\r\nhave me at tea time, perhaps that will be best. I\'ll go to you----"\r\n\r\nThe old captain sighed as he went out. Emma was, as it were, left\r\nspeaking, standing on the step of the door addressing Hester, as she\r\nfollowed her old friend out into the dusky afternoon of one of those\r\nblack days that conclude the year. Very black days they were on this\r\noccasion, not so cold as December often is, without snow or any of the\r\nharsher signs of winter, but also without sun or any of the exhilarating\r\nsharpness of the frost. Everything was dry, but dark, the skies leaden,\r\nthe very Common showing less green. The captain went on before with a\r\nwoollen comforter wrapped in many folds about his throat, and woollen\r\nmittens on the hands which grasped his stick with so much energy. He\r\nstruck it against the ground as if he had been striking some one as he\r\nhurried away.\r\n\r\n"I think that girl will be the death of us," he said: then repented of\r\nhis sharp utterance. "I told you I thought you were a spiritual\r\ngrandchild, Hester. What the child of our child whom we lost, who never\r\nhad a child, would have been. And you have spoiled us for the other\r\nthing--the grandchild of common life."\r\n\r\n"It is a long time since we have been out together," said Hester, as the\r\nold man put his other hand in its large mitten within her slender arm.\r\n\r\n"And you have been in the meantime getting into some of the muddles," he\r\nsaid. "It was kind of my old wife to hand you over to me, Hester. We all\r\nthink our own experience the best. She would like to have had you to\r\nherself, to find out all about it, and give you the help of her old\r\nlights; but instead of that she was self-denying, and handed you over to\r\nme. And now let me hear what it is, and see if the old ship\'s lantern\r\nwill do you any good."\r\n\r\n"Am I in any muddles?" said Hester. "I don\'t know--perhaps there is\r\nnothing to tell. It is so hard to divide one thing from another."\r\n\r\n"So it is; but when it is divided it is easier to manage," said the old\r\ncaptain. He paused a little to give her time to speak: but as she did\r\nnot do so he resumed on an indifferent subject, that the girl\'s\r\nconfidence might not be forced. "I am always glad when the old year is\r\nover. You will say I am an old fool for that, as my days are so few. But\r\nthe first of January is a great deal gayer than the first of December,\r\nthough they may be exactly like each other. When you can say there will\r\nbe spring this year----"\r\n\r\n"Captain Morgan," said Hester, who had been taking advantage of the\r\npause without paying any attention to what he said, "Catherine Vernon is\r\nangry because I wear my mother\'s pearls. How should that be?"\r\n\r\n"You must be mistaken, my dear," said the old captain promptly. "She has\r\nher faults, but Catherine is never paltry, Hester. That cannot be."\r\n\r\n"Either you are very much mistaken about her, or I am much mistaken\r\nabout her," Hester said.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked at her with a smile on his face.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say anything against that. And which of us is most likely to be\r\nright?" he asked. "I knew her before you were born."\r\n\r\n"Oh, before I was born! Does that tell you anything about her conduct to\r\n_me_? Once I was not, but now I am; and somebody quite distinct from\r\nother people."\r\n\r\n"Very distinct!" Captain Morgan said.\r\n\r\n"Then what does she mean by it?" cried Hester. "She cannot endure the\r\nsight of me. Oh, I know she is not paltry in one way. She does not care\r\nabout money, as some people do; but she is in another. Why should she\r\ncare about what I wear? Did you ever hear anything about my father?" the\r\ngirl said, raising her eyes suddenly, and looking him full in the face.\r\nThe old captain was so taken by surprise that he fell back a step and\r\nalmost dropped her arm in his dismay.\r\n\r\n"About your father!"\r\n\r\n"About him and Catherine Vernon--and how it was he went away? He had as\r\ngood a right to the bank as she had, had he not? I have not thought much\r\nabout it; but I should like to know," said Hester with more composure,\r\n"how it was that she had it and not papa?"\r\n\r\n"That was all before my time," said Captain Morgan, who had recovered\r\nhimself in the interval. "I did not come here, you know, till after. And\r\nthen it is not as if I had been a Vernon to understand all the\r\ncircumstances. I was not of the family, you know."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Hester thoughtfully, and she suffered herself to be\r\nled into safer subjects without any serious attempt to return to a\r\nquestion so unanswerable; while Captain Morgan on his side was too much\r\nalarmed by the possibility of having to explain to her the steps which\r\nhad led to her father\'s expatriation to inquire any more into the\r\n"muddles" which he had read in her countenance. And thus they made their\r\nway home together without any mutual satisfaction. The captain was\r\nobliged to own to his wife afterwards that he had given Hester no aid or\r\ngood advice.\r\n\r\n"She asked me about her father: and was I going to be so brutal as to\r\ntell the poor child what has always been concealed from her?"\r\n\r\n"Concealments are never good," Mrs. Morgan said, shaking her head. "It\r\nwould be better for her to know." But the captain had an easy victory\r\nwhen he said "Should you like to be the one to tell her?" with defiance\r\nin his voice.\r\n\r\nThus the time went on for Catherine Vernon\'s great Christmas party, to\r\nwhich all Redborough was asked. It was not till the day before that\r\nHester was bold enough to declare her intention not to go. "You must not\r\nbe angry, mamma. What should I go for? It is no pleasure. The moment I\r\nam in Catherine Vernon\'s house I am all wrong. I feel like a beggar, a\r\npoor relation, a dependent upon her charity; and she has no charity for\r\nme. Don\'t make me go."\r\n\r\n"Oh Hester, my darling," said Mrs. John. "It would never, never do to\r\nstay away, when everybody is there! And you her relation, that ought to\r\nwish to do her what honour you can."\r\n\r\n"Why should I wish to do her honour? She has never been kind to us. She\r\nhas never treated you as she ought to have done. She has never behaved\r\nto us as a relation should, or even as a gentlewoman should."\r\n\r\n"Oh hush! Hester, hush!" said Mrs. John. "You don\'t know what you are\r\nspeaking of. If you knew all, you would know that Catherine has behaved\r\nto us--better than we had any right to expect."\r\n\r\n"Then let me know all, mother," said Hester, sitting upright, her eyes\r\nshining, her whole face full of inquiry. "I have felt lately that there\r\nmust be something which was concealed from me. Let me know all."\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. John faltered and explained. "There is nothing for you to\r\nknow. Dear, dear, you are so literal. You take everything one says to\r\nyou, Hester, as if one meant it. There are just things that one\r\nsays----When I said if you knew all, I meant--if you were to consider\r\nproperly, if you saw things in a just light----"\r\n\r\n"I think you mean something more than that," Hester said.\r\n\r\n"What should I mean more? We had no claims upon her. Your poor father\r\nhad got his share. He had not perhaps been very prudent with it, but I\r\nnever understand anything about business. He got his share, all that he\r\nhad any right to expect. Catherine might have said that, when we came\r\nback so poor; but she did not. Hester, you have forgotten what she has\r\ndone for us. Oh, my dear, if you knew all! No, I don\'t mean that there\r\nis anything to know--but just if you would think--Hester, you must not\r\ninsult Catherine in the sight of all Redborough by refusing to go to her\r\nparty. You must not, indeed you must not. If you do, you will break my\r\nheart."\r\n\r\n"What I do is of no importance to Catherine Vernon. Oh, mother, do not\r\nmake me go. It is more than I can bear."\r\n\r\n"But you are of importance, and she would feel it deeply. Oh, Hester,\r\nfor my sake!" Mrs. John cried with tears in her eyes. She would not be\r\nturned away from the subject or postpone it. Her daughter had never seen\r\nher so deeply in earnest, so intent upon having her way, before. On\r\nprevious occasions it had been Hester that had won the day. But this\r\ntime the girl had to give way to the impassioned earnestness of her\r\nmother, which in so mild a woman was strange to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                        THE PARTY AT THE GRANGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatherine\'s Christmas party called forth all Redborough. It was an\r\nassembly to which the best people in the place considered themselves\r\nbound to go, notwithstanding that many of the small people were there\r\nalso. Everybody indeed was supposed to come, and all classes were\r\nrepresented. The respectable old clerks, who had spent their lives in\r\nthe bank, talked upon equal terms, according to the fiction of society,\r\nwith the magnates of the town, and Edward and Harry Vernon, and others\r\nof the golden youth, asked their daughters to dance. The great ladies in\r\ntheir jewels sat about upon the sofas, and so did Mrs. Halifax, the\r\ncashier\'s wife, and Mrs. Brown, the head clerk\'s, in their ribbons. All\r\nwas supposed to be equality and happiness; if it were not so, then the\r\nfault was upon the shoulders of the guests, and not of the hostess, who\r\nwalked about from one to another, and was so civil to Mrs. Brown--so\r\nvery civil--that Lady Freemantle could not help whispering to Mrs.\r\nMerridew that, after all, when a woman had once been engaged in\r\nbusiness, it always left a mark upon her.\r\n\r\n"She is more at home with those sort of persons than she is with the\r\ncounty," Lady Freemantle said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merridew was deeply flattered with the confidence, and gave a most\r\ncordial assent. "It does give a sort of an unfeminine turn of mind,\r\nthough dear Miss Vernon is so universally respected," she said.\r\n\r\nThis little dialogue would have given Catherine sincere enjoyment if she\r\nhad heard it. She divined it from the conjunction of Lady Freemantle\'s\r\ndiamonds with Mrs. Merridew\'s lace, as they leant towards each other,\r\nand from the expression and direction of their eyes.\r\n\r\nOn her side Mrs. Brown drew conclusions quite as fallacious. "Miss\r\nVernon is well aware how much the young gentlemen owe to Brown," that\r\nlady said afterwards, "and how devoted he is. She knows his value to the\r\nbusiness, and I am sure she sees that a share in the bank is what he has\r\na right to look to."\r\n\r\nThis delusion, however, Catherine did not divine.\r\n\r\nIt was with a reluctance and repugnance indescribable that Hester had\r\ncome: but she was there, by the side of her mother, who, a little\r\nalarmed by the crowd, did not know what to do with herself, until Harry\r\nVernon interposed and led her to the corner of a sofa, in the very midst\r\nof the fine people, which poor Mrs. John, divided between the pride\r\nwhich was too proud to take a chief place and the consciousness that\r\nthis place was her right, hesitated greatly upon.\r\n\r\n"I think I should like to be farther off," she said, faltering; "down\r\nthere somewhere," and she pointed in the direction of the Mrs.\r\nBrowns--"or anywhere," she added, getting confused.\r\n\r\n"This is your proper place," said Harry out of his moustache, with\r\npersistence.\r\n\r\nThe poor lady sat down in a nervous flutter in her black silk gown,\r\nwhich looked very nice, but had lasted a long time, and though it had\r\nbeen kept, so to speak, within sight of the fashion by frequent\r\nalterations, was very different from the elegant mixture of velvet and\r\nsatin, fresh from the hands of a court milliner, which swept over the\r\ngreater part of the space. Mrs. John had a little cap made of a piece of\r\nfine Mechlin upon her hair, which was still very pretty, and of the dark\r\nbrown satin kind. Her ornaments were of the most modest description,\r\nwhereas the other lady had a set of emeralds which were the admiration\r\nof the county. Hester stood behind her mother very erect and proud, in\r\nher white muslin, with her pearls, looking like a maid of honour to a\r\nmild, discrowned queen. A maid of honour in such circumstances would\r\nstand a great deal more upon her dignity than her mistress would be\r\nlikely to do. This was the aspect they presented to the lookers-on who\r\nsaw them in that unusual eminence. When Catherine perceived where her\r\npoor pensioners were placed, she gave way to a momentary impatience.\r\n\r\n"Who put Mrs. John there?" she said to Edward, almost with anger. "Don\'t\r\nyou see how thoroughly out of place she looks? You may think it shows a\r\nfine regard for the fallen, but she would have been much more\r\ncomfortable at the other end among the people she knows."\r\n\r\n"I had nothing to do with it. I have not spoken to them," said Edward\r\nwith a certain sullenness. He was glad to be able to exculpate himself,\r\nand yet he despised himself all the more fiercely.\r\n\r\nCatherine was vexed in a way which she herself felt to be unworthy, but\r\nwhich she said to herself was entirely justified by the awkwardness of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is Harry that has done it," she said, her voice softened\r\nby the discovery that Edward at least was not to blame. "It must be said\r\nfor him, at least, that he is very faithful to his family."\r\n\r\nDid she mean that _he_ was not faithful? Edward asked himself. Did even\r\nshe despise him? But he could not now change his course, or stoop to\r\nfollow Harry\'s example, that oaf who was inaccessible to the\r\nfluctuations of sentiment around him, and could do nothing but cling to\r\nhis one idea. It cannot be said, however, that either Mrs. John or\r\nHester were at their ease in their present position. It was true, as\r\nCatherine had said, that with the curate\'s wife Mrs. John would have\r\nbeen much more comfortable, and this consciousness wounded the poor\r\nlady, who felt now she was out of place among the people to whom she was\r\nallied by nature. She was accustomed to the slight of being put in a\r\nlower place, but to feel herself so completely out of her old position,\r\nwent to her heart. She looked timidly, poor soul, at the great lady with\r\nthe emeralds, remembering when she, too, used to be in the order of\r\ngreat ladies, and wondering if in those days she had ever despised the\r\nlowly. But when she thus raised her eyes she found that the lady of the\r\nemeralds was looking very fixedly at her.\r\n\r\n"Surely," she said, after a little hesitation, "this must be Lucy\r\nWestwood."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. John wistfully, investigating the stranger with her\r\ntimid eyes.\r\n\r\n"Then have you forgotten \'Bridget--Fidget\'?" said the other.\r\n\r\nIt was a school name, and it brought a glow upon Mrs. John\'s pale face.\r\nAn old school-fellow! She forgot all the painful past and her present\r\nembarrassment, and even her daughter. Hester stood for some time in her\r\nmaid-of-honour attitude and contemplated the conversation. She heard her\r\nmother say, "This is my girl--the only one I have," and felt herself\r\ncrimsoning and curtseying vaguely to some one she scarcely saw; then the\r\nstranger added--\r\n\r\n"I have three here; but I think they are all dancing."\r\n\r\nYes, no doubt there was dancing going on, but Hester had no part in it.\r\nShe became tired, after a while, of her post of maid of honour. Her\r\nwonderful indignant carriage, the poise of her young head, the proud air\r\nof independence which was evident in her, called forth the admiration of\r\nmany of the spectators. "Who is that girl?" said the elder people, who\r\nonly came once a year, and were unacquainted with the gossip of\r\nRedborough. "John Vernon\'s daughter? Oh, that was the man who ought to\r\nhave married Catherine--he who nearly ruined the bank. And that is her\r\nmother? How good of Catherine to have them here." If Hester had heard\r\nthese remarks she would have had few questions to ask about her father.\r\nBut she was unaware of the notice she was attracting, placed thus at the\r\nhead of the great drawing-room. The folding doors had been removed and\r\nthe two rooms made into one. The girl was in the most conspicuous\r\nposition without knowing; her white figure stood out against the wall,\r\nwith her little mother in the foreground. She stood for a long time\r\nlooking out with large eyes, full of light, upon the crowd, her varying\r\nemotions very legible in her face. When a creature so young and full of\r\nlife feels herself neglected and disdained, and sees others about her\r\nwhom her keen eyes cannot help but see are inferior to herself, promoted\r\nfar above her, enjoying what is forbidden to her, finding pleasure where\r\nshe has none--yet is bound to the spot and cannot escape, it is natural\r\nthat indignation should light fires in her eyes, and that her breast\r\nshould swell and her young countenance glow with a visionary scorn of\r\nall who seem to scorn her. This sentiment is neither amiable nor\r\ndesirable, but it gave a sort of inspiration to Hester--her head so\r\nerect, slightly thrown back, her nostrils a little dilated, her mouth\r\nshut close, her eyes large and open, regarding in full face the world of\r\nenemies against whom, wholly or singly, she felt herself ready to stand.\r\nAll this gave a character and individuality to her such as nothing in\r\nthe room could equal. But by and by she tired of standing, shut out from\r\neverybody, holding up her banner. She stole away from her mother\'s side,\r\nbehind the chairs, to get to somebody she knew and could talk to. Flesh\r\nand blood cannot bear this sort of martyrdom of pride for ever.\r\n\r\nAn old man was standing in her way, who made a little movement to stop\r\nHester as she passed. "You will excuse an old friend, Miss Hester," he\r\nsaid; "but I must tell you how glad I am to see you and your mother. I\r\nhave been looking at you both ever since you came. She is very much\r\nchanged since I used to see her, but her sweet expression is the same.\r\nThat is a thing that will never change."\r\n\r\n"I think I know you," said Hester, with the shy frankness which was so\r\nunlike her hostile attitude. "Did not I see you at Captain Morgan\'s? and\r\nyou said something to me about my mother?"\r\n\r\n"I had not much time to tell you then. I should just like to describe it\r\nto you," said the old clerk. "I have never forgotten that day. I was in\r\na dreadful state of anxiety, fearing that everything was coming to an\r\nend; and the only place I could think of going to was the White House.\r\nThat was where your parents were staying at the time. No, no, they were\r\nnot your parents then; I think there was a little baby that died----"\r\n\r\n"I was born abroad," said Hester, eager to catch every word.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, to be sure; and she was quite young, not much older than you\r\nare now. It was in that long room at the White House, with a window at\r\neach end, which is the dining-room now. You will excuse me for being a\r\nlittle long-winded, Miss Hester. It was beautifully furnished, as we\r\nthought then; and there was a harp and a piano. Does your mamma ever\r\nplay the harp now? No, no, I ought to remember, that has quite gone out\r\nof fashion. She had her hair high up on her head like this," said Mr.\r\nRule, trying to give a pantomimic description on the top of his own grey\r\nhead of the high bows which had once adorned Mrs. John\'s. "She had a\r\nwhite dress on, far shorter than you wear them now; and little slippers\r\nwith crossed bands, sandals they used to call them. Oh, I remember\r\neverything like a picture! Ladies used to wear little short sleeves in\r\nthose days, and low dresses. She had a little scarf round her over one\r\nshoulder. What a pretty creature she was, to be sure! I had been so\r\nwretched and anxious that the sight of her as I came rushing in, had the\r\nstrangest effect upon me. All bank business and our troubles about\r\nmoney, and the terror of a run, which was what I was frightened for,\r\nseemed nothing but ugly dreams, without any reality in them. I dare say\r\nyou don\'t know, Miss Hester, what I mean by a run?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Hester, a little impatient; "but I should like to\r\nknow what happened after."\r\n\r\n"A run on the bank," said the old clerk, "is the most terrible thing in\r\nall creation. A battle is nothing to it--for in a battle you can at\r\nleast fight for your life. It happens when the partners or the company,\r\nor whatever they may be, have had losses, or are reported to have had\r\nlosses, and a rumour gets up against the bank. Sometimes it may be a\r\nlong time threatening, sometimes it may get up in a single day--but as\r\nsoon as the rumour gets the length of a panic, everybody that has money\r\ndeposited comes to draw it out, and everybody that has a note of the\r\nbank comes for his money. In those days Vernon\'s issued notes, like all\r\nthe other great country banks. I was in mortal terror for a run: I never\r\nwas in such a state in my life. And it was then, as I told you, Miss\r\nHester, that I went to your mother. Of course we had not money enough to\r\nmeet it--the most solvent could scarcely hope to have that at a moment\'s\r\nnotice. Next day was the market day, and I knew that, as sure as\r\nlife----! I have passed through many a troublesome moment, but never one\r\nlike that."\r\n\r\nAnd, as if even the thinking of it was more than he could bear, the old\r\nclerk took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead. Hester had\r\nlistened with great interest, but still with a little impatience: for\r\nthough the run upon the bank would have interested her at another time,\r\nit was more than her attention was equal to now.\r\n\r\n"But was not my father here as well as my mother?" said Hester, in her\r\nclear voice, unconscious of any need to subdue it.\r\n\r\nMr. Rule looked at her with a startled air and a half-involuntary\r\n"Hush!"\r\n\r\n"Your father!" he said, with a tone of consternation. "Oh; the fact was\r\nthat your father--did not happen to be there at the time."\r\n\r\nHester waved her hand slightly as a token for him to go on. She had a\r\nfeeling that these words were of more importance than they seemed to be,\r\nbut they confused her, and she did not as yet see what this importance\r\nwas. She remembered that she had thought so when he told her this\r\nincident before.\r\n\r\n"Where was I?" said Mr. Rule. "Oh, yes, I remember; just going into the\r\nWhite House with my mind full of trouble, not knowing what to do. Well,\r\nMiss Hester, when I found that your--I mean when I discovered that\r\nyour--mother was alone, I told her the dreadful condition I was\r\nin--Nobody to say what to do, no chief authority to direct, and\r\nmarket-day to-morrow, and a run as sure as fate. Now, you know, we could\r\nhave telegraphed all over the country, but there was no such thing as a\r\ntelegraph then. I had to explain it to her just as I have to you, and I\r\nfeel sure she didn\'t understand me in the very least. She only knew\r\nthere was money wanted. She stepped across the room in her pretty\r\nsandals, with her scarf hanging from her shoulders, as if she had been\r\ngoing to play her harp, and opened a little bit of a desk, one of those\r\ngimcrack things, all rosewood and velvet, which were the fashion then,\r\nand took out all her money and brought it to me. It was in our own\r\nnotes, poor dear," said old Rule, with a little laugh; "and it came to\r\njust twenty pounds. She would have made me take it--forced it upon me.\r\nShe did not understand a bit. She was full of trouble and sympathy, and\r\nready to give up everything. Ah, I have often told Miss Vernon since. It\r\nwas not want of will; it was only that she did not understand."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you mean to speak kindly of mamma," said Hester, with a quick\r\nblush of alarmed pride; "but I don\'t think it is so difficult to make\r\nher understand. And what did you do after that? Was there a run--and how\r\ndid you provide--?"\r\n\r\nShe did not know what to say, the questions seemed to get into her\r\nthroat and choke her. There was something else which she could not\r\nunderstand which must soon be made clear. She gave furtive glances at\r\nthe old clerk, but did not look him in the face.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I went to Miss Vernon. She was but a young lady then. Oh, I don\'t\r\nmean to say young like you. It is thirty years ago. She was older than\r\nyour pretty young mamma, and though she had a great share in the\r\nbusiness she never had taken any part in it. But she was come of a\r\nfamily that have all had fine heads for business. Look at Mr. Edward\r\nnow: what a clear understanding he has, and sees exactly the right thing\r\nto do, whatever happens. She was a little shocked and startled just at\r\nfirst, but she took it up in a moment, no man could have done it better.\r\nShe signed away all her money in the twinkling of an eye, and saved the\r\nbank. When all the crowd of the country folk came rushing to draw out\r\ntheir money, she stepped in--well, like a kind of goddess to us, Miss\r\nHester--and paid in almost her whole fortune, all her mother\'s money,\r\nevery penny she had out of the business, and pulled us through. I can\r\nremember her too, as if it had been yesterday, the way she stepped\r\nin--with her head held high, and a kind of a triumph about her;\r\nsomething like what I have seen in yourself, my dear young lady."\r\n\r\n"Seen in me! You have never seen me with any triumph about me," cried\r\nHester, bitterly. "And where have you seen me? I scarcely know you. Ah,\r\nthat was because of the money she had. My mother, with her twenty\r\npounds, what could she do? But Catherine was rich. It was because of her\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"Her money was a great deal: but it was not the money alone. It was the\r\nheart and the courage she had. We had nobody to tell us what to do--but\r\nafter she came, all went well. She had such a head for business."\r\n\r\nHester could not stand and listen to Catherine\'s praises; but she was\r\nentirely absorbed in the narrative. It seemed terrible to her that she\r\nhad not been there to be able to step in as Catherine had done. But\r\nthere was another question pressing upon her which she had asked\r\nalready, and to which she had got no reply. She shrank from repeating it\r\nyet felt a force upon her to do so. She fixed her large widely-opened\r\neyes upon the speaker, so as to lose none of the indications of his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me," she said, "how it was that you had, as you say,\r\nnobody to tell you anything--no one at the head--nobody to say what was\r\nto be done?"\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Rule did not immediately reply. He made a little pause, and\r\nshuffled with his feet, looking down at them, not meeting her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hester," said Ellen Merridew, who was passing, and paused on her\r\npartner\'s arm to interfere, "why don\'t you dance? What do you mean by\r\nnot dancing? What are you doing here behind backs? I have been looking\r\nfor you everywhere."\r\n\r\n"I prefer to be here," Hester answered, shortly; "never mind me, please.\r\nMr. Rule, will you answer me? I want to know."\r\n\r\n"You asked how it was that we---- What was it you asked, Miss Hester? I\r\nam very glad to see you so interested: but you ought to be dancing, not\r\ntalking to an old man, as Mrs. Merridew says."\r\n\r\n"I think you are all in a plot against me," said Hester, impatiently;\r\n"why was it you were left without a head? What had happened? Mr. Rule,"\r\ncried the girl, "you know what I asked, and you know why I am so\r\nanxious. You are trying to put me off. What does it all mean?"\r\n\r\n"It is an old story," he said; "I cannot tell what tempted me to begin\r\nabout it. It was seeing you and your mother for the first time. You were\r\nnot at Miss Vernon\'s party last year?"\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it?" cried Hester. "If you will not tell me,\r\nsay so. I shall find out some other way."\r\n\r\n"My dear young lady, ask me anything. Don\'t find out any other way. I\r\nwill come and see you, if your mamma will permit me, and tell you\r\neverything about the old days. But I can\'t keep you longer now. And,\r\nbesides, it would need a great deal of explanation. I was foolish to\r\nbegin about it here, keeping you out of your natural amusement. But I\'ll\r\ncome and tell you, Miss Hester, with pleasure," said the old man,\r\nputting on a show of easy cordiality, "any day you will name."\r\n\r\n"Hester," said another voice over her head, "Ellen says I am not to let\r\nyou stay here. Come and see the supper-room. And the hall is very\r\npretty. I am not to go without you, Ellen says."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what do I care for Ellen!" cried Hester, exasperated. "Go away,\r\nHarry; go and dance and amuse yourself. I don\'t want you or any one. Mr.\r\nRule----"\r\n\r\nBut the old clerk had seized his opportunity. He had made a dart at some\r\none else on the other side while Hester turned to reply to Harry\'s\r\ndemand. The girl found herself abandoned when she turned to him again.\r\nThere had been a gradual shifting in the groups about while she stood\r\nabsorbed listening to his story. She was standing now among people who\r\nwere strange to her, and who looked at her curiously, knowing her to be\r\n"one of the family." As she met their curious eyes, Hester, though she\r\nhad a high courage, felt her heart fail her. She was glad to fall back\r\nupon her cousin\'s support.\r\n\r\n"I think you are all in a conspiracy against me," she said; but she took\r\nHarry\'s arm. He never abandoned her in any circumstances. Edward had not\r\nspoken to her, nor noticed her presence; but Harry never failed. In her\r\nexcitement and disappointment she turned to him with a sense that here\r\nshe could not go wrong. As for Harry, to whom she was seldom so\r\ncomplacent, he drew her arm within his own with a flush of pleasure.\r\n\r\n"I know you don\'t think much of me," he said, "but surely I am as good\r\nas that old fellow!" a speech at which Hester could not but laugh. "I\r\nshould like to know what he was saying to you," Harry said.\r\n\r\n"He was telling me about the run on the bank and how Catherine saved it.\r\nDo you know--I wonder---- Had my father never anything to do with it?"\r\nHester said.\r\n\r\nThey were making their way through the crowd at the end of the room. And\r\nHarry\'s countenance was not expressive. Hester thought the stare in his\r\neyes was directed to somebody behind who had pushed against her. She was\r\nnot suspicious that Harry could hide from her any knowledge he\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\n"That was ages before my time," he said very steadily. "You might as\r\nwell ask me about the flood;" and so led her on through the many groups\r\nabout the door, entirely unsuspicious that he, too, for whom she had an\r\naffectionate contempt, had baulked her. She allowed him to take her over\r\nall the lighted rooms which opened into each other: the hall, the\r\nlibrary, the room blazing with lights and decorations, which was\r\nprepared for supper. Hester had never been before at one of these great\r\nassemblies. And she could not keep herself entirely unmoved by the\r\ndazzling of the lights, the warmth and largeness of the entertainment. A\r\nsort of pride came upon her, surprising her in spite of herself: though\r\nshe was so humble a member of the family, and subject under this roof to\r\nslights and scorns, yet she was a Vernon, and could not escape some\r\nreflection of the family glory which centred in Catherine. And as she\r\nwent into the hall a still more strange sensation suddenly came over\r\nHester. She caught sight, in a large mirror, of herself stepping\r\nforward, her head held high in its habitual poise of half indignant\r\nenergy, and a certain swiftness in her air and movement, a sentiment of\r\nforward motion and progress, very familiar to everybody who knew her,\r\nbut which brought suddenly to her mind old Rule\'s description, "stepping\r\nin with a kind of triumph about her, as I have seen yourself."\r\n"Triumph!" Hester said secretly within herself, and coloured high, with\r\na sensation of mingled pain and pleasure, which no words could have\r\ndescribed. She did not know what it meant; but it stirred her strangely.\r\nIf she had been in these circumstances she would have acted like\r\nCatherine. The story of her mother in her gentle ignorance, which the\r\nold clerk thought so much of, did not affect the high-spirited girl as\r\ndid the picture of the other putting herself in the breach, taking upon\r\nher own shoulders the weight of the falling house. Hester felt that she,\r\ntoo, could have done this. Her breast swelled, her breath came short\r\nwith an impulse of impatience and longing to have such an opportunity,\r\nto show the mettle that was in her. But how could she do it? Catherine\r\nwas rich, but Hester was poor. In this way she was diverted for the\r\nmoment from her anxiety. The question as to how the bank came into that\r\nperil, the suspicion that her father must have been somehow connected\r\nwith it, the heat of her research after the key of the mystery, faded\r\naway for the moment in a vague, general excitement and eager yet vain\r\ndesire to have it in her power to do something, she also----a desire which\r\nmany a young mind has felt as well as Hester; to have that golden\r\nopportunity--the occasion to do a heroic deed, to save some one, to\r\nventure your own life, to escape the bonds of every day, and once have a\r\nchance of showing what was in you! This was not the "chance" which Emma\r\nAshton desired, but it appealed to every sentiment in Hester. The strong\r\nlonging for it seemed almost to promise a possibility, as she walked\r\nalong in a dream, without noticing Harry by her side. And he did not\r\ndisturb her by conversation. It was enough for Harry to feel her hand on\r\nhis arm. He had never very much to say, and he did not insist upon\r\nsaying it. He was content to lead her about, to show her everything; and\r\nthe sensation of taking care of her was pleasant to his heart.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the hall, however, they became aware of a late\r\narrival, which had a certain effect upon both. Standing near the great\r\ndoor, which had been opened a minute before to admit him, sending a\r\nthrill of cold night air through the whole warm succession of rooms,\r\nstood Roland Ashton. Hester was aware that he was expected, but not that\r\nhe was coming here. A servant was helping him off with his coat, and\r\nEdward stood beside him in eager conversation. Edward\'s countenance,\r\ngenerally toned down to the air of decorum and self-command which he\r\nthought necessary, was excited and glowing. And Harry, too, lighted up\r\nwhen he saw the new comer. "Ah, there\'s Ashton!" he said; while from one\r\nof the other doors Catherine Vernon herself, with a white shawl over her\r\nshoulders, came out from amidst her other guests to welcome her kinsman.\r\nIt was a wonderful reception for a young man who was not distinguished\r\neither by rank or wealth. Hester had to hang back, keeping persistently\r\nin the shade, to prevent her companion from hurrying forward into the\r\ncircle of welcoming faces.\r\n\r\n"I felt the cold air from the door at the very end of the drawing-room,"\r\nCatherine said; "but though it made me shiver it was not unwelcome,\r\nRoland. I knew that it meant that you had come."\r\n\r\n"I wish my coming had not cost you a shiver," Roland cried.\r\n\r\n"One moment; I must say how d\'ye do to him," said Harry in Hester\'s ear;\r\nand even he, the faithfulest one, left her for a moment to hold out his\r\nhand to the new comer.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood apart, sheltering herself under the shade of the plants\r\nwith which the hall was filled, and looked on at this scene. There was\r\nin the whole group a curious connection with herself. Even to Catherine\r\nshe, perhaps, poor girl as she was, was the guest among all the others\r\nwho roused the keenest feeling. Edward, who did not venture to look at\r\nher here, had given her every reason to believe that his mind was full\r\nof her. Harry had put his life at her disposal. Roland--Roland had taken\r\npossession of her mind and thoughts for a few weeks with a completeness\r\nof influence which probably he never intended, which, perhaps, was\r\nnothing at all to him, which it made Hester blush to remember. They all\r\nstood together, their faces lighted up with interest while she looked\r\non. Hester stood under a great myrtle bush, which shaded her face, and\r\nlooked at them in the thrill of the excitement which the previous events\r\nof the evening had called forth. A sort of prophetic sense that the\r\nlives of all were linked with her own, a presentiment that between them\r\nand among them it would be hers to work either for weal or woe, came\r\nover her like a sudden revelation. It was altogether fanciful and absurd\r\nshe felt; but the impression was so strong that she turned and fled,\r\nwith a sudden impulse to avoid the fate that seemed almost to overshadow\r\nher as she stood and looked at them. She, who a moment before had been\r\nlonging for the heroic opportunity, the power of interposing as\r\nCatherine had interposed, felt all the panic of a child come over her as\r\nshe stood and gazed at the four people, not one of whom was indifferent\r\nto her. She hurried out of the comparative quiet of the hall into the\r\ncrowd, and made her way with a trembling of nervous excitement to where\r\nher mother sat. Mrs. John was still seated serenely on her sofa talking\r\nof old school-days and comrades with the lady of the emeralds. She was\r\nserene, yet there was a little gentle excitement about her too, a little\r\nadditional colour upon her soft cheek. Hester, with her heart beating\r\nloudly and a strange tumult in her veins, took refuge behind her mother\r\nwith a sense of protection which she had never felt before. The soft\r\nnature which was ready to be touched by any gentle emotion, which\r\nunderstood none of life\'s problems, yet, by patience and simplicity,\r\nsailed over them all, is often a shield to those that see more and feel\r\nmore. Behind her unconscious mother Hester seemed to herself to take\r\nrefuge from her fate.\r\n\r\nIt was a great elevation to Mrs. John to sit there at the upper part of\r\nthe room, among the great ladies, out of the crowd of less distinguished\r\npersons. Her feeling of embarrassed shyness and sense of being out of\r\nplace had all vanished when she discovered her old friend; and from that\r\ntime she had begun to enjoy herself with a soothing consciousness that\r\nall proper respect was paid to her, and that at last, without any doing\r\nof hers, all, as she said to herself, had come right. She assented with\r\ngentle cordiality to all that was said to her about the beauty of the\r\nhouse, and the perfection of the arrangements.\r\n\r\n"Catherine is wonderful," she said; "she has such a head; she\r\nunderstands everything," and not a feeling in her heart contradicted her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nThat evening was, in its way, a gentle triumph to the gentle little\r\nwoman. Hester had disappeared from her for a time, and had been, she had\r\nno doubt, enjoying herself; and then she had come back and stood\r\ndutifully by her mother, such a maid of honour as any queen might have\r\nbeen proud of. She had a thousand things to say of the assembly; of dear\r\nBridget Wilton, who recollected her so well, and who was now quite a\r\ngreat person; of the prettiness of the party, and the girls\' dresses,\r\nand all the light and brilliancy of the scene--when at last it was all\r\nover and they had reached home.\r\n\r\n"Now I am sure you are glad you went," she said, with innocent\r\nconfidence. "It is a long, long time since I have spent so pleasant an\r\nevening. You see Catherine would not allow me to be overlooked when it\r\nwas really a great party. She knows very well what is due. She did not\r\nmind at those little evenings, which are of no importance; but to-night\r\nyou could see how different it was. Bridget insisted that Sir John\r\nhimself should take me to supper. No, dear, it was nothing more than was\r\nright, but it shows, what I always thought, that no neglect was ever\r\nintended. And Catherine was very kind. I am sure now you are glad you\r\nwent."\r\n\r\nWas she glad she had gone? Hester could not tell. She closed the door\r\nbetween her and her mother as if she were afraid that Mrs. John in her\r\nunusual exhilaration might read her thoughts. These thoughts were almost\r\ntoo great to be confined within her own spirit. As she lay down in the\r\ndark she seemed to see the light shining all about her, the groups in\r\nthe ball-room--the old man garrulous, deep in the revelations of the\r\npast, and the cluster of figures all standing together under the light\r\nof the lamps, exchanging questions which meant, though she could\r\nscarcely tell how, the future to Hester. Perhaps, on the whole, it was\r\ntrue, and she was glad she had gone.\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOL.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
