The afternoon was like spring, the air was soft and\r\ndamp, and the buds of the willows had been beguiled into swelling a\r\nlittle, so that there was a bloom over them, and the grass looked as\r\nif it had been growing green of late instead of fading steadily. It\r\nseemed like a reprieve from the doom of winter, or from even November\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe dense and early darkness which usually follows such unseasonable\r\nmildness had already begun to cut short the pleasures of this\r\nspring-like day, when a young woman, who carried a child in her arms,\r\nturned from a main road of Oldfields into a foot-path which led\r\nsouthward across the fields and pastures. She seemed sure of her way,\r\nand kept the path without difficulty, though a stranger might easily\r\nhave lost it here and there, where it led among the patches of\r\nsweet-fern or bayberry bushes, or through shadowy tracts of small\r\nwhite-pines. She stopped sometimes to rest, and walked more and more\r\nwearily, with increasing effort; but she kept on her way desperately,\r\nas if it would not do to arrive much later at the place which she was\r\nseeking. The child seemed to be asleep; it looked too heavy for so\r\nslight a woman to carry.\r\n\r\nThe path led after a while to a more open country, there was a low\r\nhill to be climbed, and at its top the slender figure stopped and\r\nseemed to be panting for breath. A follower might have noticed that it\r\nbent its head over the child\'s for a moment as it stood, dark against\r\nthe darkening sky. There had formerly been a defense against the\r\nIndians on this hill, which in the daytime commanded a fine view of\r\nthe surrounding country, and the low earthworks or foundations of the\r\ngarrison were still plainly to be seen. The woman seated herself on\r\nthe sunken wall in spite of the dampness and increasing chill, still\r\nholding the child, and rocking to and fro like one in despair. The\r\nchild waked and began to whine and cry a little in that strange,\r\nlonely place, and after a few minutes, perhaps to quiet it, they went\r\non their way. Near the foot of the hill was a brook, swollen by the\r\nautumn rains; it made a loud noise in the quiet pasture, as if it were\r\ncrying out against a wrong or some sad memory. The woman went toward\r\nit at first, following a slight ridge which was all that remained of a\r\ncovered path which had led down from the garrison to the spring below\r\nat the brookside. If she had meant to quench her thirst here, she\r\nchanged her mind, and suddenly turned to the right, following the\r\nbrook a short distance, and then going straight toward the river\r\nitself and the high uplands, which by daylight were smooth pastures\r\nwith here and there a tangled apple-tree or the grassy cellar of a\r\nlong vanished farm-house.\r\n\r\nIt was night now; it was too late in the year for the chirp of any\r\ninsects; the moving air, which could hardly be called wind, swept over\r\nin slow waves, and a few dry leaves rustled on an old hawthorn tree\r\nwhich grew beside the hollow where a house had been, and a low sound\r\ncame from the river. The whole country side seemed asleep in the\r\ndarkness, but the lonely woman felt no lack of companionship; it was\r\nwell suited to her own mood that the world slept and said nothing to\r\nher,--it seemed as if she were the only creature alive.\r\n\r\nA little this side of the river shore there was an old burial place, a\r\nprimitive spot enough, where the graves were only marked by rough\r\nstones, and the short, sheep-cropped grass was spread over departed\r\ngenerations of the farmers and their wives and children. By day it was\r\nin sight of the pine woods and the moving water, and nothing hid it\r\nfrom the great sky overhead, but now it was like a prison walled about\r\nby the barriers of night. However eagerly the woman had hurried to\r\nthis place, and with what purpose she may have sought the river bank,\r\nwhen she recognized her surroundings she stopped for a moment, swaying\r\nand irresolute. "No, no!" sighed the child plaintively, and she\r\nshuddered, and started forward; then, as her feet stumbled among the\r\ngraves, she turned and fled. It no longer seemed solitary, but as if a\r\nlegion of ghosts which had been wandering under cover of the dark had\r\ndiscovered this intruder, and were chasing her and flocking around her\r\nand oppressing her from every side. And as she caught sight of a light\r\nin a far-away farmhouse window, a light which had been shining after\r\nher all the way down to the river, she tried to hurry toward it. The\r\nunnatural strength of terror urged her on; she retraced her steps like\r\nsome pursued animal; she remembered, one after another, the fearful\r\nstories she had known of that ancient neighborhood; the child cried,\r\nbut she could not answer it. She fell again and again, and at last all\r\nher strength seemed to fail her, her feet refused to carry her farther\r\nand she crept painfully, a few yards at a time, slowly along the\r\nground. The fear of her superhuman enemies had forsaken her, and her\r\nonly desire was to reach the light that shone from the looming shadow\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nAt last she was close to it; at last she gave one great sigh, and the\r\nchild fell from her grasp; at last she clutched the edge of the worn\r\ndoorstep with both hands, and lay still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE FARM-HOUSE KITCHEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIndoors there was a cheerful company; the mildness of the evening had\r\nenticed two neighbors of Mrs. Thacher, the mistress of the house, into\r\ntaking their walks abroad, and so, with their heads well protected by\r\nlarge gingham handkerchiefs, they had stepped along the road and up\r\nthe lane to spend a social hour or two. John Thacher, their old\r\nneighbor\'s son, was known to be away serving on a jury in the county\r\ntown, and they thought it likely that his mother would enjoy company.\r\nTheir own houses stood side by side. Mrs. Jacob Dyer and Mrs. Martin\r\nDyer were their names, and excellent women they were. Their husbands\r\nwere twin-brothers, curiously alike and amazingly fond of each other,\r\nthough either would have scorned to make any special outward\r\ndemonstration of it. They were spending the evening together in\r\nbrother Martin\'s house, and were talking over the purchase of a bit\r\nof woodland, and the profit of clearing it, when their wives had left\r\nthem without any apology to visit Mrs. Thacher, as we have already\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThis was the nearest house and only a quarter of a mile away, and when\r\nthey opened the door they had found Mrs. Thacher spinning.\r\n\r\n"I must own up, I am glad to see you more\'n common," she said. "I\r\ndon\'t feel scary at being left sole alone; it ain\'t that, but I have\r\nbeen getting through with a lonesome spell of another kind. John, he\r\ndoes as well as a man can, but here I be,--here I be,"--and the good\r\nwoman could say no more, while her guests understood readily enough\r\nthe sorrow that had found no words.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you haven\'t got no news from Ad\'line?" asked Mrs. Martin\r\nbluntly. "We was speaking of her as we come along, and saying it\r\nseemed to be a pity she should\'nt feel it was best to come back this\r\nwinter and help you through; only one daughter, and left alone as you\r\nbe, with the bad spells you are liable to in winter time--but there,\r\nit ain\'t her way--her ambitions ain\'t what they should be, that\'s all\r\nI can say."\r\n\r\n"If she\'d got a gift for anything special, now," continued Mrs. Jake,\r\n"we should feel it was different and want her to have a chance, but\r\nshe\'s just like other folks for all she felt so much above farming. I\r\ndon\'t see as she can do better than come back to the old place, or\r\nleastways to the village, and fetch up the little gal to be some use.\r\nShe might dressmake or do millinery work; she always had a pretty\r\ntaste, and \'t would be better than roving. I \'spose \'t would hurt her\r\npride,"--but Mrs. Thacher flushed at this, and Mrs. Martin came to the\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll think we\'re reg\'lar Job\'s comforters," cried the good soul\r\nhastily, "but there, Mis\' Thacher, you know we feel as if she was our\r\nown. There ain\'t nothing I wouldn\'t do for Ad\'line, sick or well, and\r\nI declare I believe she\'ll pull through yet and make a piece of luck\r\nthat\'ll set us all to work praising of her. She\'s like to marry again\r\nfor all I can see, with her good looks. Folks always has their joys\r\nand calamities as they go through the world."\r\n\r\nMrs. Thacher shook her head two or three times with a dismal\r\nexpression, and made no answer. She had pushed back the droning\r\nwool-wheel which she had been using, and had taken her knitting from\r\nthe shelf by the clock and seated herself contentedly, while Mrs. Jake\r\nand Mrs. Martin had each produced a blue yarn stocking from a\r\ncapacious pocket, and the shining steel needles were presently all\r\nclicking together. One knitter after another would sheathe the spare\r\nneedle under her apron strings, while they asked each other\'s advice\r\nfrom time to time about the propriety of "narrerin\'" or whether it\r\nwere not best to "widden" according to the progress their respective\r\nstockings had made. Mrs. Thacher had lighted an extra candle, and\r\nreplenished the fire, for the air was chillier since the sun went\r\ndown. They were all sure of a coming change of weather, and counted\r\nvarious signs, Mrs. Thacher\'s lowness of spirits among the number,\r\nwhile all three described various minor maladies from which they had\r\nsuffered during the day, and of which the unseasonable weather was\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get over the feeling that we are watchin\' with somebody,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Martin after a while, moved by some strange impulse and\r\nlooking over her shoulder, at which remark Mrs. Thacher glanced up\r\nanxiously. "Something has been hanging over me all day," said she\r\nsimply, and at this the needles clicked faster than ever.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been taking rather a low range," suggested Mrs. Jake. "We\r\nshall get to telling over ghost stories if we don\'t look out, and I\r\nfor one shall be sca\'t to go home. By the way, I suppose you have\r\nheard about old Billy Dow\'s experience night afore last, Mis\'\r\nThacher?"\r\n\r\n"John being away, I ain\'t had nobody to fetch me the news these few\r\ndays past," said the hostess. "Why what\'s happened to Billy now?"\r\n\r\nThe two women looked at each other: "He was getting himself home as\r\nbest he could,--he owned up to having made a lively evenin\' of\r\nit,--and I expect he was wandering all over the road and didn\'t know\r\nnothin\' except that he was p\'inted towards home, an\' he stepped off\r\nfrom the high bank this side o\' Dunnell\'s, and rolled down, over and\r\nover; and when he come to there was a great white creatur\' a-standin\'\r\nover him, and he thought \'t was a ghost. \'T was higher up on the bank\r\nthan him, and it kind of moved along down\'s if \'t was coming right on\r\nto him, and he got on to his knees and begun to say his Ten\r\nCommandments fast\'s he could rattle \'em out. He got \'em mixed up, and\r\nwhen the boys heard his teeth a-chattering, they began to laugh and he\r\nup an\' cleared. Dunnell\'s boys had been down the road a piece and was\r\njust coming home, an\' \'t was their old white hoss that had got out of\r\nthe barn, it bein\' such a mild night, an\' was wandering off. They said\r\nto Billy that\'t wa\'n\'t everybody could lay a ghost so quick as he\r\ncould, and they didn\'t \'spose he had the means so handy."\r\n\r\nThe three friends laughed, but Mrs. Thacher\'s face quickly lost its\r\nsmile and took back its worried look. She evidently was in no mood for\r\njoking. "Poor Billy!" said she, "he was called the smartest boy in\r\nschool; I rec\'lect that one of the teachers urged his folks to let him\r\ngo to college; but \'t wa\'n\'t no use; they hadn\'t the money and\r\ncouldn\'t get it, and \'t wa\'n\'t in him to work his way as some do. He\'s\r\ngot a master head for figur\'s. Folks used to get him to post books\r\nyou know,--but he\'s past that now. Good-natured creatur\' as ever\r\nstept; but he always was afeard of the dark,--\'seems \'s if I could see\r\nhim there a-repentin\' and the old white hoss shakin\' his head,"--and\r\nshe laughed again, but quickly stopped herself and looked over her\r\nshoulder at the window.\r\n\r\n"Would ye like the curtain drawed?" asked Mrs. Jake. But Mrs. Thacher\r\nshook her head silently, while the gray cat climbed up into her lap\r\nand laid down in a round ball to sleep.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a proper cosset, ain\'t she?" inquired Mrs. Martin approvingly,\r\nwhile Mrs. Jake asked about the candles, which gave a clear light. "Be\r\nthey the last you run?" she inquired, but was answered to the\r\ncontrary, and a brisk conversation followed upon the proper\r\nproportions of tallow and bayberry wax, and the dangers of the\r\nnew-fangled oils which the village shop-keepers were attempting to\r\nintroduce. Sperm oil was growing more and more dear in price and\r\nworthless in quality, and the old-fashioned lamps were reported to be\r\npast their usefulness.\r\n\r\n"I must own I set most by good candle light," said Mrs. Martin. "\'T is\r\nno expense to speak of where you raise the taller, and it\'s cheerful\r\nand bright in winter time. In old times when the houses were draftier\r\nthey was troublesome about flickering, candles was; but land! think\r\nhow comfortable we live now to what we used to! Stoves is such a\r\nconvenience; the fire\'s so much handier. Housekeepin\' don\'t begin to\r\nbe the trial it was once."\r\n\r\n"I must say I like old-fashioned cookin\' better than oven cookin\',"\r\nobserved Mrs. Jake. "Seems to me\'s if the taste of things was all\r\ndrawed up chimbly. Be you going to do much for Thanksgivin\', Mis\'\r\nThacher? I \'spose not;" and moved by a sudden kind impulse, she added,\r\n"Why can\'t you and John jine with our folks? \'t wouldn\'t put us out,\r\nand \'twill be lonesome for ye."\r\n\r\n"\'T won\'t be no lonesomer than last year was, nor the year before,"\r\nand Mrs. Thacher\'s face quivered a little as she rose and took one of\r\nthe candles, and opened the trap door that covered the cellar stairs.\r\n"Now don\'t ye go to makin\' yourself work," cried the guests. "No,\r\ndon\'t! we ain\'t needin\' nothin\'; we was late about supper." But their\r\nhostess stepped carefully down and disappeared for a few minutes,\r\nwhile the cat hovered anxiously at the edge of the black pit.\r\n\r\n"I forgot to ask ye if ye\'d have some cider?" a sepulchral voice asked\r\npresently; "but I don\'t know now\'s I can get at it. I told John I\r\nshouldn\'t want any whilst he was away, and so he ain\'t got the spiggit\r\nin yet," to which Mrs. Jake and Mrs. Martin both replied that they\r\nwere no hands for that drink, unless \'t was a drop right from the\r\npress, or a taste o\' good hard cider towards the spring of the year;\r\nand Mrs. Thacher soon returned with some slices of cake in a plate and\r\nsome apples held in her apron. One of her neighbors took the candle as\r\nshe reached up to put it on the floor, and when the trap door was\r\nclosed again all three drew up to the table and had a little feast.\r\nThe cake was of a kind peculiar to its maker, who prided herself upon\r\nnever being without it; and there was some trick of her hand or a\r\nsecret ingredient which was withheld when she responded with apparent\r\ncheerfulness to requests for its recipe. As for the apples, they were\r\ngrown upon an old tree, one of whose limbs had been grafted with some\r\nunknown variety of fruit so long ago that the history was forgotten;\r\nonly that an English gardener, many years before, had brought some\r\ncuttings from the old country, and one of them had somehow come into\r\nthe possession of John Thacher\'s grandfather when grafted fruit was a\r\nthing to be treasured and jealously guarded. It had been told that\r\nwhen the elder Thacher had given away cuttings he had always stolen to\r\nthe orchards in the night afterward and ruined them. However, when the\r\nfamily had grown more generous in later years it had seemed to be\r\nwithout avail, for, on their neighbors\' trees or their own, the\r\nEnglish apples had proved worthless. Whether it were some favoring\r\nquality in that spot of soil or in the sturdy old native tree itself,\r\nthe rich golden apples had grown there, year after year, in\r\nperfection, but nowhere else.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no such apples as these, to my mind," said Mrs. Martin,\r\nas she polished a large one with her apron and held it up to the\r\nlight, and Mrs. Jake murmured assent, having already taken a\r\nsufficient first bite.\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one little bough that bears any great," said Mrs.\r\nThacher, "but it\'s come to that once before, and another branch has\r\nshot up and been likely as if it was a young tree."\r\n\r\nThe good souls sat comfortably in their splint-bottomed,\r\nstraight-backed chairs, and enjoyed this mild attempt at a festival.\r\nMrs. Thacher even grew cheerful and responsive, for her guests seemed\r\nso light-hearted and free from care that the sunshine of their\r\npresence warmed her own chilled and fearful heart. They embarked upon\r\na wide sea of neighborhood gossip and parish opinions, and at last\r\nsome one happened to speak again of Thanksgiving, which at once turned\r\nthe tide of conversation, and it seemed to ebb suddenly, while the\r\ngray, dreary look once more overspread Mrs. Thacher\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why you won\'t keep with our folks this year; you and\r\nJohn," once more suggested Mrs. Martin. "\'T ain\'t wuth while to be\r\nmaking yourselves dismal here to home; the day\'ll be lonesome for you\r\nat best, and you shall have whatever we\'ve got and welcome."\r\n\r\n"\'T won\'t be lonesomer this year than it was last, nor the year\r\nbefore that, and we\'ve stood it somehow or \'nother," answered Mrs.\r\nThacher for the second time, while she rose to put more wood in the\r\nstove. "Seems to me \'t is growing cold; I felt a draught acrost my\r\nshoulders. These nights is dreadful chill; you feel the damp right\r\nthrough your bones. I never saw it darker than \'t was last evenin\'. I\r\nthought it seemed kind o\' stived up here in the kitchen, and I opened\r\nthe door and looked out, and I declare I couldn\'t see my hand before\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"It always kind of scares me these black nights," said Mrs. Jake Dyer.\r\n"I expect something to clutch at me every minute, and I feel as if\r\nsome sort of a creatur\' was travelin\' right behind me when I am out\r\ndoor in the dark. It makes it bad havin\' a wanin\' moon just now when\r\nthe fogs hangs so low. It al\'ays seems to me as if \'t was darker when\r\nshe rises late towards mornin\' than when she\'s gone altogether. I do\'\r\nknow why\'t is."\r\n\r\n"I rec\'lect once," Mrs. Thacher resumed, "when Ad\'line was a baby and\r\nJohn was just turned four year old, their father had gone down river\r\nin the packet, and I was expectin\' on him home at supper time, but he\r\ndidn\'t come; \'t was late in the fall, and a black night as I ever see.\r\nAd\'line was taken with something like croup, and I had an end o\'\r\ncandle in the candlestick that I lighted, and \'t wa\'n\'t long afore it\r\nwas burnt down, and I went down cellar to the box where I kep\' \'em,\r\nand if you will believe it, the rats had got to it, and there wasn\'t a\r\nweek o\' one left. I was near out anyway. We didn\'t have this\r\ncook-stove then, and I cal\'lated I could make up a good lively blaze,\r\nso I come up full o\' scold as I could be, and then I found I\'d burnt\r\nup all my dry wood. You see, I thought certain he\'d be home and I was\r\ntendin\' to the child\'n, but I started to go out o\' the door and found\r\nit had come on to rain hard, and I said to myself I wouldn\'t go out to\r\nthe woodpile and get my clothes all damp, \'count o\' Ad\'line, and the\r\ncandle end would last a spell longer, and he\'d be home by that time. I\r\nhadn\'t a least o\' suspicion but what he was dallying round up to the\r\nCorners, \'long o\' the rest o\' the men, bein\' \'t was Saturday night,\r\nand I was some put out about it, for he knew the baby was sick, and I\r\nhadn\'t nobody with me. I set down and waited, but he never come, and\r\nit rained hard as I ever see it, and I left his supper standin\' right\r\nin the floor, and then I begun to be distressed for fear somethin\' had\r\nhappened to Dan\'l, and I set to work and cried, and the candle end\r\ngive a flare and went out, and by \'n\' by the fire begun to get low and\r\nI took the child\'n and went to bed to keep warm; \'t was an awful cold\r\nnight, considerin\' \'t was such a heavy rain, and there I laid awake\r\nand thought I heard things steppin\' about the room, and it seemed to\r\nme as if \'t was a week long before mornin\' come, and as if I\'d got to\r\nbe an old woman. I did go through with everything that night. \'T was\r\nthat time Dan\'l broke his leg, you know; they was takin\' a deck load\r\nof oak knees down by the packet, and one on \'em rolled down from the\r\ntop of the pile and struck him just below the knee. He was poling, for\r\nthere wan\'t a breath o\' wind, and he always felt certain there was\r\nsomethin\' mysterious about it. He\'d had a good deal worse knocks than\r\nthat seemed to be, as only left a black and blue spot, and he said he\r\nnever see a deck load o\' timber piled securer. He had some queer\r\nnotions about the doin\'s o\' sperits, Dan\'l had; his old Aunt Parser\r\nwas to blame for it. She lived with his father\'s folks, and used to\r\nfill him and the rest o\' the child\'n with all sorts o\' ghost stories\r\nand stuff. I used to tell him she\'d a\' be\'n hung for a witch if she\'d\r\nlived in them old Salem days. He always used to be tellin\' what\r\neverything was the sign of, when we was first married, till I laughed\r\nhim out of it. It made me kind of notional. There\'s too much now we\r\ncan\'t make sense of without addin\' to it out o\' our own heads."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jake and Mrs. Martin were quite familiar with the story of the\r\nnight when there were no candles and Mr. Thacher had broken his leg,\r\nhaving been present themselves early in the morning afterward, but\r\nthey had listened with none the less interest. These country neighbors\r\nknew their friends\' affairs as well as they did their own, but such an\r\naudience is never impatient. The repetitions of the best stories are\r\nsignal events, for ordinary circumstances do not inspire them. Affairs\r\nmust rise to a certain level before a narration of some great crisis\r\nis suggested, and exactly as a city audience is well contented with\r\nhearing the plays of Shakespeare over and over again, so each man and\r\nwoman of experience is permitted to deploy their well-known but always\r\ninteresting stories upon the rustic stage.\r\n\r\n"I must say I can\'t a-bear to hear anything about ghosts after\r\nsundown," observed Mrs. Jake, who was at times somewhat troubled by\r\nwhat she and her friends designated as "narves." "Day-times I don\'t\r\nbelieve in \'em \'less it\'s something creepy more\'n common, but after\r\ndark it scares me to pieces. I do\' know but I shall be afeared to go\r\nhome," and she laughed uneasily. "There! when I get through with this\r\nneedle I believe I won\'t knit no more. The back o\' my neck is all\r\nnumb."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk o\' goin\' home yet awhile," said the hostess, looking up\r\nquickly as if she hated the thought of being left alone again. "\'T is\r\njust on the edge of the evenin\'; the nights is so long now we think\r\nit\'s bedtime half an hour after we\'ve got lit up. \'T was a good lift\r\nhavin\' you step over to-night. I was really a-dreadin\' to set here by\r\nmyself," and for some minutes nobody spoke and the needles clicked\r\nfaster than ever. Suddenly there was a strange sound outside the door,\r\nand they stared at each other in terror and held their breath, but\r\nnobody stirred. This was no familiar footstep; presently they heard a\r\nstrange little cry, and still they feared to look, or to know what was\r\nwaiting outside. Then Mrs. Thacher took a candle in her hand, and,\r\nstill hesitating, asked once, "Who is there?" and, hearing no answer,\r\nslowly opened the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAT JAKE AND MARTIN\'S\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the evening had been much enjoyed by the brothers\r\nwho were spending it together in Martin Dyer\'s kitchen. The houses\r\nstood side by side, but Mr. Jacob Dyer\'s youngest daughter, the only\r\none now left at home, was receiving a visit from her lover, or, as the\r\nfamily expressed it, the young man who was keeping company with her,\r\nand her father, mindful of his own youth, had kindly withdrawn.\r\nMartin\'s children were already established in homes of their own, with\r\nthe exception of one daughter who was at work in one of the cotton\r\nfactories at Lowell in company with several of her acquaintances. It\r\nhas already been said that Jake and Martin liked nobody\'s company so\r\nwell as their own. Their wives had a time-honored joke about being\r\ncomparatively unnecessary to their respective partners, and indeed the\r\ntwo men had a curiously dependent feeling toward each other. It was\r\nthe close sympathy which twins sometimes have each to each, and had\r\nbecome a byword among all their acquaintances. They were seldom\r\nindividualized in any way, and neither was able to distinguish\r\nhimself, apparently, for one always heard of the family as Jake and\r\nMartin\'s folks, and of their possessions, from least to greatest, as\r\nbelonging to both brothers. The only time they had ever been separated\r\nwas once in their early youth, when Jake had been fired with a desire\r\nto go to sea; but he deserted the coastwise schooner in the first port\r\nand came home, because he could not bear it any longer without his\r\nbrother. Martin had no turn for seafaring, so Jake remained ashore and\r\npatiently made a farmer of himself for love\'s sake, and in spite of a\r\ngreat thirst for adventure that had never ceased to fever his blood.\r\nIt was astonishing how much they found to say to each other when one\r\nconsiders that their experiences were almost constantly the same; but\r\nnothing contented them better than an uninterrupted evening spent in\r\neach other\'s society, and as they hoed corn or dug potatoes, or mowed,\r\nor as they drove to the Corners, sitting stiffly upright in the\r\nold-fashioned thorough-braced wagon, they were always to be seen\r\ntalking as if it were the first meeting after a long separation. But,\r\nhaving taken these quiet times for the discussion of all possible and\r\nimpossible problems, they were men of fixed opinions, and were ready\r\nat a moment\'s warning to render exact decisions. They were not fond of\r\nsociety as a rule; they found little occasion for much talk with their\r\nneighbors, but used as few words as possible. Nobody was more\r\nrespected than the brothers. It was often said of them that their word\r\nwas their bond, and as they passed from youth to middle age, and in\r\nthese days were growing to look like elderly men, they were free from\r\nshame or reproach, though not from much good-natured joking and\r\nfriendly fun. Their farm had been owned in the family since the\r\nsettlement of the country, and the house which Martin occupied was\r\nvery old. Jake\'s had been built for him when he was married, from\r\ntimber cut in their own woodlands, and after thirty years of wear it\r\nlooked scarcely newer than its companion. And when it is explained\r\nthat they had married sisters, because, as people said, they even went\r\ncourting together, it will be easy to see that they had found life\r\nmore harmonious than most people do. Sometimes the wife of one brother\r\nwould complain that her sister enjoyed undue advantages and profits\r\nfrom the estate, but there was rarely any disagreement, and Mrs. Jake\r\nwas mistress of the turkeys and Mrs. Martin held sway over the hens,\r\nwhile they divided the spoils amiably at Thanksgiving time when the\r\ngeese were sold. If it were a bad year for turkeys, and the tender\r\nyoung were chilled in the wet grass, while the hens flourished\r\nsteadily the season through, Mrs. Jake\'s spirits drooped and she\r\nbecame envious of the good fortune which flaunted itself before her\r\neyes, but on the whole, they suffered and enjoyed together, and found\r\nno fault with their destinies. The two wives, though the affection\r\nbetween them was of an ordinary sort, were apt to form a league\r\nagainst the brothers, and this prevented a more troublesome rivalry\r\nwhich might have existed between the households.\r\n\r\n\r\nJake and Martin were particularly enjoying the evening. Some accident\r\nhad befallen the cooking-stove, which the brothers had never more than\r\nhalf approved, it being one of the early patterns, and a poor exchange\r\nfor the ancient methods of cookery in the wide fireplace. "The women"\r\nhad had a natural desire to be equal with their neighbors, and knew\r\nbetter than their husbands did the difference this useful invention\r\nhad made in their every-day work. However, this one night the\r\nconservative brothers could take a mild revenge; and when their wives\r\nwere well on their way to Mrs. Thacher\'s they had assured each other\r\nthat, if the plaguey thing were to be carried to the Corners in the\r\nmorning to be exchanged or repaired, it would be as well to have it in\r\nreadiness, and had quickly taken down its pipes and lifted it as if it\r\nwere a feather to the neighboring woodshed. Then they hastily pried\r\naway a fireboard which closed the great fireplace, and looked\r\nsmilingly upon the crane and its pothooks and the familiar iron dogs\r\nwhich had been imprisoned there in darkness for many months. They\r\nbrought in the materials for an old-fashioned fire, backlog,\r\nforestick, and crowsticks, and presently seated themselves before a\r\ncrackling blaze. Martin brought a tall, brown pitcher of cider from\r\nthe cellar and set two mugs beside it on the small table, and for some\r\nlittle time they enjoyed themselves in silence, after which Jake\r\nremarked that he didn\'t know but they\'d got full enough of a fire for\r\nsuch a mild night, but he wished his own stove and the new one too\r\ncould be dropped into the river for good and all.\r\n\r\nThey put the jug of cider between the andirons, and then, moved by a\r\ncommon impulse, drew their chairs a little farther from the mounting\r\nflames, before they quenched their thirst from the mugs.\r\n\r\n"I call that pretty cider," said Martin; "\'tis young yet, but it has\r\ngot some weight a\'ready, and \'tis smooth. There\'s a sight o\'\r\ndifference between good upland fruit and the sposhy apples that grows\r\nin wet ground. An\' I take it that the bar\'l has an influence: some\r\nbar\'ls kind of wilt cider and some smarten it up, and keep it hearty.\r\nLord! what stuff some folks are willin\' to set before ye! \'tain\'t wuth\r\nthe name o\' cider, nor no better than the rensin\'s of a vinegar cask."\r\n\r\n"And then there\'s weather too," agreed Mr. Jacob Dyer, "had ought to\r\nbe took into consideration. Git your apples just in the right\r\ntime--not too early to taste o\' the tree, nor too late to taste o\' the\r\nground, and just in the snap o\' time as to ripeness\', on a good sharp\r\nday with the sun a-shining; have \'em into the press and what comes out\r\nis _cider_. I think if we\'ve had any fault in years past, \'t was\r\nputtin\' off makin\' a little too late. But I don\'t see as this could be\r\nbeat. I don\'t know\'s you feel like a pipe, but I believe I\'ll light\r\nup," and thereupon a good portion of black-looking tobacco was cut and\r\nmade fine in each of the hard left hands, and presently the clay pipes\r\nwere touched off with a live coal, and great clouds of smoke might\r\nhave been seen to disappear under the edge of the fire-place, drawn\r\nquickly up the chimney by the draft of the blazing fire.\r\n\r\nJacob pushed back his chair another foot or two, and Martin soon\r\nfollowed, mentioning that it was getting hot, but it was well to keep\r\nout the damp.\r\n\r\n"What set the women out to go traipsin\' up to Thacher\'s folks?"\r\ninquired Jacob, holding his cider mug with one hand and drumming it\r\nwith the finger ends of the other.\r\n\r\n"I had an idee that they wanted to find out if anything had been heard\r\nabout Ad\'line\'s getting home for Thanksgiving," answered Martin,\r\nturning to look shrewdly at his brother. "Women folks does suffer if\r\nthere\'s anything goin\' on they can\'t find out about. \'Liza said she\r\nwas going to invite Mis\' Thacher and John to eat a piece o\' our big\r\nturkey, but she didn\'t s\'pose they\'d want to leave. Curi\'s about\r\nAd\'line, ain\'t it? I expected when her husband died she\'d be right\r\nback here with what she\'d got; at any rate, till she\'d raised the\r\nchild to some size. There\'d be no expense here to what she\'d have\r\nelsewhere, and here\'s her ma\'am beginnin\' to age. She can\'t do what\r\nshe used to, John was tellin\' of me; and I don\'t doubt \'t \'as worn\r\nupon her more\'n folks thinks."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t lay no great belief that John\'ll get home from court," said\r\nJacob Dyer. "They say that court\'s goin\' to set till Christmas maybe;\r\nthere\'s an awful string o\' cases on the docket. Oh, \'t was you told\r\nme, wa\'n\'t it? Most like they\'ll let up for a couple o\' days for\r\nThanksgivin\', but John mightn\'t think\'t was wuth his while to travel\r\nhere and back again \'less he had something to do before winter shets\r\ndown. Perhaps they\'ll prevail upon the old lady, I wish they would,\r\nI\'m sure; but an only daughter forsakin\' her so, \'twas most too bad of\r\nAd\'line. She al\'ays had dreadful high notions when she wa\'n\'t no\r\nmore\'n a baby; and, good conscience, how she liked to rig up when she\r\nfirst used to come back from Lowell! Better ha\' put her money out to\r\ninterest."\r\n\r\n"I believe in young folks makin\' all they can o\' theirselves,"\r\nannounced Martin, puffing hard at his pipe and drawing a little\r\nfarther still from the fireplace, because the scorching red coals had\r\nbegun to drop beneath the forestick. "I\'ve give my child\'n the best\r\npush forrard I could, an\' you\'ve done the same. Ad\'line had a dreadful\r\ncravin\' to be somethin\' more\'n common; but it don\'t look as if she was\r\ngoin\' to make out any great. \'Twas unfortunate her losin\' of her\r\nhusband, but I s\'pose you\'ve heard hints that they wa\'n\'t none too\r\nequal-minded. She\'d a done better to have worked on a while to Lowell\r\nand got forehanded, and then married some likely young fellow and\r\nsettled down here, or to the Corners if she didn\'t want to farm it.\r\nThere was Jim Hall used to be hanging round, and she\'d been full as\r\nwell off to-day if she\'d took him, too. \'T ain\'t no use for folks to\r\nmarry one that\'s of another kind and belongs different. It\'s like two\r\nfiddles that plays different tunes,--you can\'t make nothin\' on\'t, no\r\nmatter if both on em\'s trying their best, \'less one on \'em beats the\r\nother down entirely and has all the say, and ginerally \'t is the worst\r\none does it. Ad\'line\'s husband wa\'n\'t nothin\' to boast of from all we\r\ncan gather, but they didn\'t think alike about nothin\'. She could \'a\'\r\ndone well with him if there\'d been more of _her_. I don\'t marvel his\r\nfolks felt bad: Ad\'line didn\'t act right by \'em."\r\n\r\n"Nor they by her," said the twin brother. "I tell ye Ad\'line would\r\nhave done \'em credit if she\'d been let. I seem to think how\'t was with\r\nher; when she was there to work in the shop she thought \'t would be\r\nsmart to marry him and then she\'d be a lady for good and all. And all\r\nthere was of it, she found his folks felt put out and hurt, and\r\ninstead of pleasing \'em up and doing the best she could, she didn\'t\r\nknow no better than to aggravate \'em. She was wrong there, but I hold\r\nto it that if they\'d pleased her up a little and done well by her,\r\nshe\'d ha\' bloomed out, and fell right in with their ways. She\'s got\r\noutward ambitions enough, but I view it she was all a part of his\r\nfoolishness to them; I dare say they give her the blame o\' the whole\r\non\'t. Ad\'line ought to had the sense to see they had some right on\r\ntheir side. Folks say he was the smartest fellow in his class to\r\ncollege."\r\n\r\n"Good King Agrippy! how hot it does git," said Jake rising\r\nindignantly, as if the fire alone were to blame. "I must shove back\r\nthe cider again or \'t will bile over, spite of everything. But \'t is\r\ncalled unwholesome to get a house full o\' damp in the fall o\' the\r\nyear; \'t will freeze an\' thaw in the walls all winter. I must git me a\r\nnew pipe if we go to the Corners to-morrow. I s\'pose I\'ve told ye of a\r\npipe a man had aboard the schooner that time I went to sea?"\r\n\r\nMartin gave a little grumble of assent.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas made o\' some sort o\' whitish stuff like clay, but \'twa\'n\'t\r\nshaped like none else I ever see and it had a silver trimmin\' round\r\nit; \'twas very light to handle and it drawed most excellent. I al\'ays\r\nkind o\' expected he may have stole it; he was a hard lookin\' customer,\r\na Dutchman or from some o\' them parts o\' the earth. I wish while I was\r\nabout it I\'d gone one trip more."\r\n\r\n"Was it you was tellin\' me that Ad\'line was to work again in Lowell? I\r\nshouldn\'t think her husband\'s folks would want the child to be fetched\r\nup there in them boardin\' houses"--\r\n\r\n"Belike they don\'t," responded Jacob, "but when they get Ad\'line to\r\ncome round to their ways o\' thinkin\' now, after what\'s been and gone,\r\nthey\'ll have cause to thank themselves. She\'s just like her gre\'t\r\ngrandsir Thacher; you can see she\'s made out o\' the same stuff. You\r\nmight ha\' burnt him to the stake, and he\'d stick to it he liked it\r\nbetter\'n hanging and al\'ays meant to die that way. There\'s an awful\r\nbad streak in them Thachers, an\' you know it as well as I do. I expect\r\nthere\'ll be bad and good Thachers to the end o\' time. I\'m glad for the\r\nold lady\'s sake that John ain\'t one o\' the drinkin\' ones. Ad\'line\'ll\r\ngive no favors to her husband\'s folks, nor take none. There\'s plenty\r\no\' wrongs to both sides, but as I view it, the longer he\'d lived the\r\nworse \'t would been for him. She was a well made, pretty lookin\' girl,\r\nbut I tell ye \'t was like setting a laylock bush to grow beside an\r\nellum tree, and expecting of \'em to keep together. They wa\'n\'t mates.\r\nHe\'d had a different fetchin\' up, and he _was_ different, and I wa\'n\'t\r\nsurprised when I come to see how things had turned out,--I believe I\r\nshall have to set the door open a half a minute, \'t is gettin\'\r\ndreadful"--but there was a sudden flurry outside, and the sound of\r\nheavy footsteps, the bark of the startled cur, who was growing very\r\nold and a little deaf, and Mrs. Martin burst into the room and sank\r\ninto the nearest chair, to gather a little breath before she could\r\ntell her errand. "For God\'s sake what\'s happened?" cried the men.\r\n\r\nThey presented a picture of mingled comfort and misery at which Mrs.\r\nMartin would have first laughed and then scolded at any other time.\r\nThe two honest red faces were well back toward the farther side of the\r\nroom from the fire, which still held its own; it was growing toward\r\nlow tide in the cider jug and its attendant mugs, and the pipes were\r\nlying idle. The mistress of the old farm-house did not fail to notice\r\nthat high treason had been committed during her short absence, but she\r\nmade no comment upon the fireplace nor on anything else, and gasped as\r\nsoon as she could that one of the men must go right up to the Corners\r\nfor the doctor and hurry back with him, for\'t was a case of life and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n"Mis\' Thacher?" "Was it a shock?" asked the brothers in sorrowful\r\nhaste, while Mrs. Martin told the sad little story of Adeline\'s having\r\ncome from nobody knew where, wet and forlorn, carrying her child in\r\nher arms. She looked as if she were in the last stages of a decline.\r\nShe had fallen just at the doorstep and they had brought her in,\r\nbelieving that she was dead. "But while there\'s life, there\'s hope,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Martin, "and I\'ll go back with you if you\'ll harness up.\r\nJacob must stop to look after this gre\'t fire or \'twill burn the\r\nhouse down," and this was the punishment which befell Jacob, since\r\nnothing else would have kept him from also journeying toward the\r\nThacher house.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little later the bewildered horse had been fully wakened and\r\nharnessed; Jacob\'s daughter and her lover had come eagerly out to hear\r\nwhat had happened; Mrs. Martin had somehow found a chance amidst all\r\nthe confusion to ascend to her garret in quest of some useful remedies\r\nin the shape of herbs, and then she and her husband set forth on their\r\nbenevolent errands. Martin was very apt to look on the dark side of\r\nthings, and it was a curious fact that while the two sisters were like\r\nthe brothers, one being inclined to despondency and one to enthusiasm,\r\nthe balance was well kept by each of the men having chosen his\r\nopposite in temperament. Accordingly, while Martin heaved a great sigh\r\nfrom time to time and groaned softly, "Pore gal--pore gal!" his\r\npartner was brimful of zealous eagerness to return to the scene of\r\ndistress and sorrow which she had lately left. Next to the doctor\r\nhimself, she was the authority on all medical subjects for that\r\nneighborhood, and it was some time since her skill had been needed.\r\n\r\n"Does the young one seem likely?" asked Martin with solemn curiosity.\r\n\r\n"Fur\'s I could see," answered his wife promptly, "but nobody took no\r\ngreat notice of it. Pore Ad\'line catched hold of it with such a grip\r\nas she was comin\' to that we couldn\'t git it away from her and had to\r\nfetch\'em in both to once. Come urge the beast along, Martin, I\'ll give\r\nye the partic\'lars to-morrow, I do\' know\'s Ad\'line\'s livin\' now. We\r\ngot her right to bed\'s I told you, and I set right off considerin\'\r\nthat I could git over the ground fastest of any. Mis\' Thacher of\r\ncourse wouldn\'t leave and Jane\'s heavier than I be." Martin\'s smile\r\nwas happily concealed by the darkness; his wife and her sister had\r\nboth grown stout steadily as they grew older, but each insisted upon\r\nthe other\'s greater magnitude and consequent incapacity for quick\r\nmovement. A casual observer would not have been persuaded that there\r\nwas a pound\'s weight of difference between them.\r\n\r\nMartin Dyer meekly suggested that perhaps he\'d better go in a minute\r\nto see if there was anything Mis\' Thacher needed, but Eliza, his wife,\r\npromptly said that she didn\'t want anything but the doctor as quick as\r\nshe could get him, and disappeared up the short lane while the wagon\r\nrattled away up the road. The white mist from the river clung close to\r\nthe earth, and it was impossible to see even the fences near at hand,\r\nthough overhead there were a few dim stars. The air had grown somewhat\r\nsofter, yet there was a sharp chill in it, and the ground was wet and\r\nsticky under foot. There were lights in the bedroom and in the kitchen\r\nof the Thacher house, but suddenly the bedroom candle flickered away\r\nand the window was darkened. Mrs. Martin\'s heart gave a quick throb,\r\nperhaps Adeline had already died. It might have been a short-sighted\r\npiece of business that she had gone home for her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLIFE AND DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sick woman had refused to stay in the bedroom after she had come\r\nto her senses. She had insisted that she could not breathe, and that\r\nshe was cold and must go back to the kitchen. Her mother and Mrs. Jake\r\nhad wrapped her in blankets and drawn the high-backed wooden rocking\r\nchair close to the stove, and here she was just established when Mrs.\r\nMartin opened the outer door. Any one of less reliable nerves would\r\nhave betrayed the shock which the sight of such desperate illness must\r\nhave given. The pallor, the suffering, the desperate agony of the\r\neyes, were far worse than the calmness of death, but Mrs. Martin spoke\r\ncheerfully, and even when her sister whispered that their patient had\r\nbeen attacked by a h\xe6morrhage, she manifested no concern.\r\n\r\n"How long has this be\'n a-goin\' on, Ad\'line? Why didn\'t you come home\r\nbefore and get doctored up? You\'re all run down." Mrs. Thacher looked\r\nfrightened when this questioning began, but turned her face toward her\r\ndaughter, eager to hear the answer.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been sick off and on all summer," said the young woman, as if it\r\nwere almost impossible to make the effort of speaking. "See if the\r\nbaby\'s covered up warm, will you, Aunt \'Liza?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear," said the kind-hearted woman, the tears starting to her\r\neyes at the sound of the familiar affectionate fashion of speech which\r\nAdeline had used in her childhood. "Don\'t you worry one mite; we\'re\r\ngoing to take care of you and the little gal too;" and then nobody\r\nspoke, while the only sound was the difficult breathing of the poor\r\ncreature by the fire. She seemed like one dying, there was so little\r\nlife left in her after her piteous homeward journey. The mother\r\nwatched her eagerly with a mingled feeling of despair and comfort; it\r\nwas terrible to have a child return in such sad plight, but it was a\r\nblessing to have her safe at home, and to be able to minister to her\r\nwants while life lasted.\r\n\r\nThey all listened eagerly for the sound of wheels, but it seemed a\r\nlong time before Martin Dyer returned with the doctor. He had been\r\nmet just as he was coming in from the other direction, and the two men\r\nhad only paused while the tired horse was made comfortable, and a\r\nsleepy boy dispatched with the medicine for which he had long been\r\nwaiting. The doctor\'s housekeeper had besought him to wait long enough\r\nto eat the supper which she had kept waiting, but he laughed at her\r\nand shook his head gravely, as if he already understood that there\r\nshould be no delay. When he was fairly inside the Thacher kitchen, the\r\nbenefaction of his presence was felt by every one. It was most\r\ntouching to see the patient\'s face lose its worried look, and grow\r\nquiet and comfortable as if here were some one on whom she could\r\nentirely depend. The doctor\'s greeting was an every-day cheerful\r\nresponse to the women\'s welcome, and he stood for a minute warming his\r\nhands at the fire as if he had come upon a commonplace errand. There\r\nwas something singularly self-reliant and composed about him; one felt\r\nthat he was the wielder of great powers over the enemies, disease and\r\npain, and that his brave hazel eyes showed a rare thoughtfulness and\r\nforesight. The rough driving coat which he had thrown off revealed a\r\nslender figure with the bowed shoulders of an untiring scholar. His\r\nhead was finely set and scholarly, and there was that about him which\r\ngave certainty, not only of his sagacity and skill, but of his true\r\nmanhood, his mastery of himself. Not only in this farm-house kitchen,\r\nbut wherever one might place him, he instinctively took command, while\r\nfrom his great knowledge of human nature he could understand and help\r\nmany of his patients whose ailments were not wholly physical. He\r\nseemed to read at a glance the shame and sorrow of the young woman who\r\nhad fled to the home of her childhood, dying and worse than defeated,\r\nfrom the battle-field of life. And in this first moment he recognized\r\nwith dismay the effects of that passion for strong drink which had\r\nbeen the curse of more than one of her ancestors. Even the pallor and\r\nthe purifying influence of her mortal illness could not disguise these\r\nunmistakable signs.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do me any good, doctor," she whispered. "I shouldn\'t have\r\nlet you come if it had been only that. I don\'t care how soon I am out\r\nof this world. But I want you should look after my little girl," and\r\nthe poor soul watched the physician\'s face with keen anxiety as if\r\nshe feared to see a shadow of unwillingness, but none came.\r\n\r\n"I will do the best I can," and he still held her wrist, apparently\r\nthinking more of the fluttering pulse than of what poor Adeline was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n"That was what made me willing to come back," she continued, "you\r\ndon\'t know how close I came to not doing it either. John will be good\r\nto her, but she will need somebody that knows the world better by and\r\nby. I wonder if you couldn\'t show me how to make out a paper giving\r\nyou the right over her till she is of age? She must stay here with\r\nmother, long as she wants her. \'Tis what I wish I had kept sense\r\nenough to do; life hasn\'t been all play to me;" and the tears began to\r\nroll quickly down the poor creature\'s thin cheeks. "The only thing I\r\ncare about is leaving the baby well placed, and I want her to have a\r\ngood chance to grow up a useful woman. And most of all to keep her out\r\nof _their_ hands, I mean her father\'s folks. I hate \'em, and he cared\r\nmore for \'em than he did for me, long at the last of it.... I could\r\ntell you stories!"--\r\n\r\n"But not to-night, Addy," said the doctor gravely, as if he were\r\nspeaking to a child. "We must put you to bed and to sleep, and you can\r\ntalk about all these troublesome things in the morning. You shall see\r\nabout the papers too, if you think best. Be a good girl now, and let\r\nyour mother help you to bed." For the resolute spirit had summoned the\r\nfew poor fragments of vitality that were left, and the sick woman was\r\ngrowing more and more excited. "You may have all the pillows you wish\r\nfor, and sit up in bed if you like, but you mustn\'t stay here any\r\nlonger," and he gathered her in his arms and quickly carried her to\r\nthe next room. She made no resistance, and took the medicine which\r\nMrs. Martin brought, without a word. There was a blazing fire now in\r\nthe bedroom fire-place, and, as she lay still, her face took on a\r\nsatisfied, rested look. Her mother sat beside her, tearful, and yet\r\ncontented and glad to have her near, and the others whispered together\r\nin the kitchen. It might have been the last night of a long illness\r\ninstead of the sudden, startling entrance of sorrow in human shape.\r\n"No," said the doctor, "she cannot last much longer with such a cough\r\nas that, Mrs. Dyer. She has almost reached the end of it. I only hope\r\nthat she will go quickly."\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough; whether the fatal illness had run its natural course,\r\nor whether the excitement and the forced strength of the evening\r\nbefore had exhausted the small portion of strength that was left, when\r\nthe late dawn lighted again those who watched, it found them sleeping,\r\nand one was never to wake again in the world she had found so\r\ndisappointing to her ambitions, and so untrue to its fancied promises.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor had promised to return early, but it was hardly daylight\r\nbefore there was another visitor in advance of him. Old Mrs. Meeker, a\r\nneighbor whom nobody liked, but whose favor everybody for some reason\r\nor other was anxious to keep, came knocking at the door, and was let\r\nin somewhat reluctantly by Mrs. Jake, who was just preparing to go\r\nhome in order to send one or both the brothers to the village and to\r\nacquaint John Thacher with the sad news of his sister\'s death. He was\r\nolder than Adeline, and a silent man, already growing to be elderly in\r\nhis appearance. The women had told themselves and each other that he\r\nwould take this sorrow very hard, and Mrs. Thacher had said\r\nsorrowfully that she must hide her daughter\'s poor worn clothes, since\r\nit would break John\'s heart to know she had come home so beggarly. The\r\nshock of so much trouble was stunning the mother; she did not\r\nunderstand yet, she kept telling the kind friends who sorrowed with\r\nher, as she busied herself with the preparations for the funeral. "It\r\ndon\'t seem as if \'twas Addy," she said over and over again, "but I\r\nfeel safe about her now, to what I did," and Mrs. Jake and Mrs.\r\nMartin, good helpful souls and brimful of compassion, went to and fro\r\nwith their usual diligence almost as if this were nothing out of the\r\ncommon course of events.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker had heard the wagon go by and had caught the sound of the\r\ndoctor\'s voice, her house being close by the road, and she had also\r\nwatched the unusual lights. It was annoying to the Dyers to have to\r\nanswer questions, and to be called upon to grieve outwardly just then,\r\nand it seemed disloyal to the dead woman in the next room to enter\r\nupon any discussion of her affairs. But presently the little child,\r\nwhom nobody had thought of except to see that she still slept, waked\r\nand got down from the old settle where she had spent the night, and\r\nwalked with unsteady short footsteps toward her grandmother, who\r\ncaught her quickly and held her fast in her arms. The little thing\r\nlooked puzzled, and frowned, and seemed for a moment unhappy, and then\r\nthe sunshine of her good nature drove away the clouds and she clapped\r\nher hands and laughed aloud, while Mrs. Meeker began to cry again at\r\nthe sight of this unconscious orphan.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I\'m glad she can laugh," said Mrs. Martin. "She\'ll find\r\nenough to cry about later on; I foresee she\'ll be a great deal o\'\r\ncompany to you, Mis\' Thacher."\r\n\r\n"Though \'t ain\'t every one that has the strength to fetch up a child\r\nafter they reach your years," said Mrs. Meeker, mournfully. "It\'s\r\nanxious work, but I don\'t doubt strength will be given you. I s\'pose\r\nlikely her father\'s folks will do a good deal for her,"--and the three\r\nwomen looked at each other, but neither took it upon herself to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nAll that day the neighbors and acquaintances came and went in the lane\r\nthat led to the farm-house. The brothers Jake and Martin made journeys\r\nto and from the village. At night John Thacher came home from court\r\nwith as little to say as ever, but, as everybody observed, looking\r\nyears older. Young Mrs. Prince\'s return and sudden death were the only\r\nsubjects worth talking about in all the country side, and the doctor\r\nhad to run the usual gauntlet of questions from all his outlying\r\npatients and their families. Old Mrs. Thacher looked pale and excited,\r\nand insisted upon seeing every one who came to the house, with evident\r\nintention to play her part in this strange drama with exactness and\r\ncourtesy. A funeral in the country is always an era in a family\'s\r\nlife; events date from it and centre in it. There are so few\r\ncircumstances that have in the least a public nature that these\r\nconspicuous days receive all the more attention.\r\n\r\nBut while death seems far more astonishing and unnatural in a city,\r\nwhere the great tide of life rises and falls with little apparent\r\nregard to the sinking wrecks, in the country it is not so. The\r\nneighbors themselves are those who dig the grave and carry the dead,\r\nwhom they or their friends have made ready, to the last resting-place.\r\nWith all nature looking on,--the leaves that must fall, and the grass\r\nof the field that must wither and be gone when the wind passes\r\nover,--living closer to life and in plainer sight of death, they have\r\na different sense of the mysteries of existence. They pay homage to\r\nDeath rather than to the dead; they gather from the lonely farms by\r\nscores because there is a funeral, and not because their friend is\r\ndead; and the day of Adeline Prince\'s burial, the marvelous\r\ncircumstances, with which the whole town was already familiar, brought\r\na great company together to follow her on her last journey.\r\n\r\nThe day was warm and the sunshine fell caressingly over the pastures\r\nas if it were trying to call back the flowers. By afternoon there was\r\na tinge of greenness on the slopes and under the gnarled apple-trees,\r\nthat had been lost for days before, and the distant hills and\r\nmountains, which could be seen in a circle from the high land where\r\nthe Thacher farmhouse stood, were dim and blue through the Indian\r\nsummer haze. The old men who came to the funeral wore their faded\r\nwinter overcoats and clumsy caps all ready to be pulled down over\r\ntheir ears if the wind should change; and their wives were also warmly\r\nwrapped, with great shawls over their rounded, hard-worked shoulders;\r\nyet they took the best warmth and pleasantness into their hearts, and\r\nwatched the sad proceedings of the afternoon with deepest interest.\r\nThe doctor came hurrying toward home just as the long procession was\r\ngoing down the pasture, and he saw it crossing a low hill; a dark and\r\nslender column with here and there a child walking beside one of the\r\nelder mourners. The bearers went first with the bier; the track was\r\nuneven, and the procession was lost to sight now and then behind the\r\nslopes. It was forever a mystery; these people might have been a\r\ncompany of Druid worshipers, or of strange northern priests and their\r\npeople, and the doctor checked his impatient horse as he watched the\r\nretreating figures at their simple ceremony. He could not help\r\nthinking what strange ways this child of the old farm had followed,\r\nand what a quiet ending it was to her wandering life. "And I have\r\npromised to look after the little girl," he said to himself as he\r\ndrove away up the road.\r\n\r\nIt was a long walk for the elderly people from the house near the main\r\nhighway to the little burying-ground. In the earliest days of the farm\r\nthe dwelling-place was nearer the river, which was then the chief\r\nthoroughfare; and those of the family who had died then were buried on\r\nthe level bit of upland ground high above the river itself. There was\r\na wide outlook over the country, and the young pine trees that fringed\r\nthe shore sang in the south wind, while some great birds swung to and\r\nfro overhead, watching the water and the strange company of people who\r\nhad come so slowly over the land. A flock of sheep had ventured to the\r\nnearest hillock of the next pasture, and stood there fearfully, with\r\nupraised heads, as if they looked for danger.\r\n\r\nJohn Thacher had brought his sister\'s child all the way in his arms,\r\nand she had clapped her hands and laughed aloud and tried to talk a\r\ngreat deal with the few words she had learned to say. She was very gay\r\nin her baby fashion; she was amused with the little crowd so long as\r\nit did not trouble her. She fretted only when the grave, kind man, for\r\nwhom she had instantly felt a great affection, stayed too long by that\r\ndeep hole in the ground and wept as he saw a strange thing that the\r\npeople had carried all the way, put down into it out of sight. When he\r\nwalked on again, she laughed and played; but after they had reached\r\nthe empty gray house, which somehow looked that day as if it were a\r\nmourner also, she shrank from all the strangers, and seemed dismayed\r\nand perplexed, and called her mother eagerly again and again. This\r\ntouched many a heart. The dead woman had been more or less unfamiliar\r\nof late years to all of them; and there were few who had really\r\ngrieved for her until her little child had reminded them of its own\r\nloneliness and loss.\r\n\r\nThat night, after the house was still, John Thacher wrote to acquaint\r\nMiss Prince, of Dunport, with his sister\'s death and to say that it\r\nwas her wish that the child should remain with them during its\r\nminority. They should formally appoint the guardian whom she had\r\nselected; they would do their best by the little girl. And when Mrs.\r\nThacher asked if he had blamed Miss Prince, he replied that he had\r\nleft that to her own conscience.\r\n\r\nIn the answer which was quickly returned, there was a plea for the\r\ncustody of the child, her mother\'s and her own namesake, but this was\r\nindignantly refused. There was no love lost between the town and the\r\ncountry household, and for many years all intercourse was at an end.\r\nBefore twelve months were past, John Thacher himself was carried down\r\nto the pasture burying-ground, and his old mother and the little child\r\nwere left to comfort and take care of each other as best they could in\r\nthe lonely farm-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nA SUNDAY VISIT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the gray house on the hill, one spring went by and another, and it\r\nseemed to the busy doctor only a few months from the night he first\r\nsaw his ward before she was old enough to come soberly to church with\r\nher grandmother. He had always seen her from time to time, for he had\r\noften been called to the farm or to the Dyers and had watched her at\r\nplay. Once she had stopped him as he drove by to give him a little\r\nhandful of blue violets, and this had gone straight to his heart, for\r\nhe had been made too great a bugbear to most children to look for any\r\nfavor at their hands. He always liked to see her come into church on\r\nSundays, her steps growing quicker and surer as her good grandmother\'s\r\nbecame more feeble. The doctor was a lonely man in spite of his many\r\nfriends, and he found himself watching for the little brown face that,\r\nhalf-way across the old meeting-house, would turn round to look for\r\nhim more than once during the service. At first there was only the top\r\nof little Nan Prince\'s prim best bonnet or hood to be seen, unless it\r\nwas when she stood up in prayer-time, but soon the bright eyes rose\r\nlike stars above the horizon of the pew railing, and next there was\r\nthe whole well-poised little head, and the tall child was possessed by\r\na sense of propriety, and only ventured one or two discreet glances at\r\nher old friend.\r\n\r\nThe office of guardian was not one of great tasks or of many duties,\r\nthough the child\'s aunt had insisted upon making an allowance for her\r\nof a hundred dollars a year, and this was duly acknowledged and placed\r\nto its owner\'s credit in the savings bank of the next town. Her\r\ngrandmother Thacher always refused to spend it, saying proudly that\r\nshe had never been beholden to Miss Prince and she never meant to be,\r\nand while she lived the aunt and niece should be kept apart. She would\r\nnot say that her daughter had never been at fault, but it was through\r\nthe Princes all the trouble of her life had come.\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie was mindful of his responsibilities, and knew more of his\r\nward than was ever suspected. He was eager that the best district\r\nschool teacher who could be found should be procured for the Thacher\r\nand Dyer neighborhood, and in many ways he took pains that the little\r\ngirl should have all good things that were possible. He only laughed\r\nwhen her grandmother complained that Nan would not be driven to\r\nschool, much less persuaded, and that she was playing in the brook, or\r\nscampering over the pastures when she should be doing other things.\r\nMrs. Thacher, perhaps unconsciously, had looked for some trace of the\r\nfather\'s good breeding and gentlefolk fashions, but this was not a\r\nchild who took kindly to needlework and pretty clothes. She was\r\nfearlessly friendly with every one; she did not seem confused even\r\nwhen the minister came to make his yearly parochial visitation, and as\r\nfor the doctor, he might have been her own age, for all humility she\r\nthought it necessary to show in the presence of this chief among her\r\nelders and betters. Old Mrs. Thacher gave little pulls at her\r\ngranddaughter\'s sleeves when she kept turning to see the doctor in\r\nsermon-time, but she never knew how glad he was, or how willingly he\r\nsmiled when he felt the child\'s eyes watching him as a dog\'s might\r\nhave done, forcing him to forget the preaching altogether and to\r\nattend to this dumb request for sympathy. One blessed day Dr. Leslie\r\nhad waited in the church porch and gravely taken the child\'s hand as\r\nshe came out; and said that he should like to take her home with him;\r\nhe was going to the lower part of the town late in the afternoon and\r\nwould leave her then at the farm-house.\r\n\r\n"I was going to ask you for something for her shoulder," said\r\nGrandmother Thacher, much pleased, "she\'ll tell you about it, it was a\r\nfall she had out of an apple-tree,"--and Nan looked up with not a\r\nlittle apprehension, but presently tucked her small hand inside the\r\ndoctor\'s and was more than ready to go with him. "I thought she looked\r\na little pale," the doctor said, to which Mrs. Thacher answered that\r\nit was a merciful Providence who had kept the child from breaking her\r\nneck, and then, being at the foot of the church steps, they separated.\r\nIt had been a great trial to the good woman to give up the afternoon\r\nservice, but she was growing old, as she told herself often in those\r\ndays, and felt, as she certainly looked, greatly older than her years.\r\n\r\n"I feel as if Anna was sure of one good friend, whether I stay with\r\nher or not," said the grandmother sorrowfully, as she drove toward\r\nhome that Sunday noon with Jacob Dyer and his wife. "I never saw the\r\ndoctor so taken with a child before. \'Twas a pity he had to lose his\r\nown, and his wife too; how many years ago was it? I should think he\'d\r\nbe lonesome, though to be sure he isn\'t in the house much. Marilla\r\nThomas keeps his house as clean as a button and she has been a good\r\nstand-by for him, but it always seemed sort o\' homesick there ever\r\nsince the day I was to his wife\'s funeral. She made an awful sight o\'\r\nfriends considering she was so little while in the place. Well I\'m\r\nglad I let Nanny wear her best dress; I set out not to, it looked so\r\nmuch like rain."\r\n\r\nWhatever Marilla Thomas\'s other failings might have been, she\r\ncertainly was kind that day to the doctor\'s little guest. It would\r\nhave been a hard-hearted person indeed who did not enter somewhat into\r\nthe spirit of the child\'s delight. In spite of its being the first\r\ntime she had ever sat at any table but her grandmother\'s, she was not\r\nawkward or uncomfortable, and was so hungry that she gave pleasure to\r\nher entertainers in that way if no other. The doctor leaned back in\r\nhis chair and waited while the second portion of pudding slowly\r\ndisappeared, though Marilla could have told that he usually did not\r\ngive half time enough to his dinner and was off like an arrow the\r\nfirst possible minute. Before he took his often interrupted afternoon\r\nnap, he inquired for the damaged shoulder and requested a detailed\r\naccount of the accident; and presently they were both laughing\r\nheartily at Nan\'s disaster, for she owned that she had chased and\r\ntreed a stray young squirrel, and that a mossy branch of one of the\r\nold apple-trees in the straggling orchard had failed to bear even so\r\nlight a weight as hers. Nan had come to the ground because she would\r\nnot loose her hold of the squirrel, though he had slipped through her\r\nhands after all as she carried him towards home. The guest was proud\r\nto become a patient, especially as the only remedy that was offered\r\nwas a very comfortable handful of sugar-plums. Nan had never owned so\r\nmany at once, and in a transport of gratitude and affection she lifted\r\nher face to kiss so dear a benefactor.\r\n\r\nHer eyes looked up into his, and her simple nature was so unconscious\r\nof the true dangers and perils of this world, that his very heart was\r\ntouched with compassion, and he leagued himself with the child\'s good\r\nangel to defend her against her enemies.\r\n\r\nAnd Nan took fast hold of the doctor\'s hand as they went to the study.\r\nThis was the only room in the house which she had seen before; and was\r\nso much larger and pleasanter than any she knew elsewhere that she\r\ntook great delight in it. It was a rough place now, the doctor\r\nthought, but always very comfortable, and he laid himself down on the\r\ngreat sofa with a book in his hand, though after a few minutes he grew\r\nsleepy and only opened his eyes once to see that Nan was perched in\r\nthe largest chair with her small hands folded, and her feet very far\r\nfrom the floor. "You may run out to see Marilla, or go about the house\r\nanywhere you like; or there are some picture-papers on the table," the\r\ndoctor said drowsily, and the visitor slipped down from her throne and\r\nwent softly away.\r\n\r\nShe had thought the study a very noble room until she had seen the\r\ndining-room, but now she wished for another look at the pictures there\r\nand the queer clock, and the strange, grand things on the sideboard.\r\nThe old-fashioned comfort of the house was perfect splendor to the\r\nchild, and she went about on tiptoe up stairs and down, looking in at\r\nthe open doors, while she lingered wistfully before the closed ones.\r\nShe wondered at the great bedsteads with their high posts and dimity\r\nhangings, and at the carpets, and the worthy Marilla watched her for a\r\nmoment as she stood on the threshold of the doctor\'s own room. The\r\nchild\'s quick ear caught the rustle of the housekeeper\'s Sunday gown;\r\nshe whispered with shining eyes that she thought the house was\r\nbeautiful. Did Marilla live here all the time?\r\n\r\n"Bless you, yes!" replied Marilla, not without pride, though she added\r\nthat nobody knew what a sight of care it was.\r\n\r\n"I suppose y\'r aunt in Dunport lives a good deal better than this;"\r\nbut the child only looked puzzled and did not answer, while the\r\nhousekeeper hurried away to the afternoon meeting, for which the bell\r\nwas already tolling.\r\n\r\nThe doctor slept on in the shaded study, and after Nan had grown tired\r\nof walking softly about the house, she found her way into the garden.\r\nAfter all, there was nothing better than being out of doors, and the\r\napple-trees seemed most familiar and friendly, though she pitied them\r\nfor being placed so near each other. She discovered a bench under a\r\ntrellis where a grape-vine and a clematis were tangled together, and\r\nhere she sat down to spend a little time before the doctor should call\r\nher. She wished she could stay longer than that one short afternoon;\r\nperhaps some time or other the doctor would invite her again. But what\r\ncould Marilla have meant about her aunt? She had no aunts except Mrs.\r\nJake and Mrs. Martin; Marilla must well know that their houses were\r\nnot like Dr. Leslie\'s; and little Nan built herself a fine castle in\r\nSpain, of which this unknown aunt was queen. Certainly her grandmother\r\nhad now and then let fall a word about "your father\'s folks"--by and\r\nby they might come to see her!\r\n\r\nThe grape leaves were waving about in the warm wind, and they made a\r\nflickering light and shade upon the ground. The clematis was in bloom,\r\nand its soft white plumes fringed the archway of the lattice work. As\r\nthe child looked down the garden walk it seemed very long and very\r\nbeautiful to her. Her grandmother\'s flower-garden had been constantly\r\nencroached upon by the turf which surrounded it, until the snowberry\r\nbush, the London pride, the tiger-lilies, and the crimson phlox were\r\nlike a besieged garrison.\r\n\r\nNan had already found plenty of wild flowers in the world; there were\r\nno entertainments provided for her except those the fields and\r\npastures kindly spread before her admiring eyes. Old Mrs. Thacher had\r\nbeen brought up to consider the hard work of this life, and though she\r\nhad taken her share of enjoyment as she went along, it was of a\r\nsomewhat grim and sober sort. She believed that a certain amount of\r\nfriskiness was as necessary to young human beings as it is to colts,\r\nbut later both must be harnessed and made to work. As for pleasure\r\nitself she had little notion of that. She liked fair weather, and\r\ncertain flowers were to her the decorations of certain useful plants,\r\nbut if she had known that her grand-daughter could lie down beside the\r\nanemones and watch them move in the wind and nod their heads, and\r\nafterward look up into the blue sky to watch the great gulls above the\r\nriver, or the sparrows flying low, or the crows who went higher, Mrs.\r\nThacher would have understood almost nothing of such delights, and\r\nthought it a very idle way of spending one\'s time.\r\n\r\nBut as Nan sat in the old summer-house in the doctor\'s garden, she\r\nthought of many things that she must remember to tell her grandmother\r\nabout this delightful day. The bees were humming in the vines, and as\r\nshe looked down the wide garden-walk it seemed like the broad aisle in\r\nchurch, and the congregation of plants and bushes all looked at her as\r\nif she were in the pulpit. The church itself was not far away, and the\r\nwindows were open, and sometimes Nan could hear the preacher\'s voice,\r\nand by and by the people began to sing, and she rose solemnly, as if\r\nit were her own parishioners in the garden who lifted up their voices.\r\nA cheerful robin began a loud solo in one of Dr. Leslie\'s\r\ncherry-trees, and the little girl laughed aloud in her make-believe\r\nmeeting-house, and then the gate was opened and shut, and the doctor\r\nhimself appeared, strolling along, and smiling as he came.\r\n\r\nHe was looking to the right and left at his flowers and trees, and\r\nonce he stopped and took out his pocket knife to trim a straying\r\nbranch of honeysuckle, which had wilted and died. When he came to the\r\nsummer-house, he found his guest sitting there demurely with her hands\r\nfolded in her lap. She had gathered some little sprigs of box and a\r\nfew blossoms of periwinkle and late lilies of the valley, and they lay\r\non the bench beside her. "So you did not go to church with Marilla?"\r\nthe doctor said. "I dare say one sermon a day is enough for so small a\r\nperson as you." For Nan\'s part, no sermon at all would have caused\r\nlittle sorrow, though she liked the excitement of the Sunday drive to\r\nthe village. She only smiled when the doctor spoke, and gave a little\r\nsigh of satisfaction a minute afterward when he seated himself beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"We must be off presently," he told her. "I have a long drive to take\r\nbefore night. I would let you go with me, but I am afraid I should\r\nkeep you too long past your bedtime."\r\n\r\nThe little girl looked in his kind face appealingly; she could not\r\nbear to have the day come to an end. The doctor spoke to her as if she\r\nwere grown up and understood everything, and this pleased her. It is\r\nvery hard to be constantly reminded that one is a child, as if it were\r\na crime against society. Dr. Leslie, unlike many others, did not like\r\nchildren because they were children; he now and then made friends with\r\none, just as he added now and then to his narrow circle of grown\r\nfriends. He felt a certain responsibility for this little girl, and\r\ncongratulated himself upon feeling an instinctive fondness for her.\r\nThe good old minister had said only that morning that love is the\r\ngreat motive power, that it is always easy to do things for those whom\r\nwe love and wish to please, and for this reason we are taught to pray\r\nfor love to God, and so conquer the difficulty of holiness. "But I\r\nmust do my duty by her at any rate," the doctor told himself. "I am\r\nafraid I have forgotten the child somewhat in past years, and she is a\r\nbright little creature."\r\n\r\n"Have you been taking good care of yourself?" he added aloud. "I was\r\nvery tired, for I was out twice in the night taking care of sick\r\npeople. But you must come to see me again some day. I dare say you and\r\nMarilla have made friends with each other. Now we must go, I suppose,"\r\nand Nan Prince, still silent,--for the pleasure of this time was\r\nalmost too great,--took hold of the doctor\'s outstretched hand, and\r\nthey went slowly up the garden walk together. As they drove slowly\r\ndown the street they met the people who were coming from church, and\r\nthe child sat up very straight in the old gig, with her feet on the\r\ndoctor\'s medicine-box, and was sure that everybody must be envying\r\nher. She thought it was more pleasant than ever that afternoon, as\r\nthey passed through the open country outside the village; the fields\r\nand the trees were marvelously green, and the distant river was\r\nshining in the sun. Nan looked anxiously for the gray farmhouse for\r\ntwo or three minutes before they came in sight of it, but at last it\r\nshowed itself, standing firm on the hillside. It seemed a long time\r\nsince she had left home in the morning, but this beautiful day was to\r\nbe one of the landmarks of her memory. Life had suddenly grown much\r\nlarger, and her familiar horizon had vanished and she discovered a\r\ngreat distance stretching far beyond the old limits. She went gravely\r\ninto the familiar kitchen, holding fast the bits of box and the\r\nperiwinkle flowers, quite ready to answer her grandmother\'s questions,\r\nthough she was only too certain that it would be impossible to tell\r\nany one the whole dear story of that June Sunday.\r\n\r\nA little later, as Marilla came sedately home, she noticed in the\r\ndriveway some fresh hoofmarks which pointed toward the street, and\r\nquickly assured herself that they could not have been made very long\r\nbefore. "I wonder what the two of \'em have been doing all the\r\nafternoon?" she said to herself. "She\'s a little lady, that child is;\r\nand it\'s a burnin\' shame she should be left to run wild. I never set\r\nso much by her mother\'s looks as some did, but growin\' things has\r\nblooms as much as they have roots and prickles--and even them Thachers\r\nwill flower out once in a while."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIN SUMMER WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning Dr. Leslie remembered an old patient whom he liked to go\r\nto see now and then, perhaps more from the courtesy and friendliness\r\nof the thing than from any hope of giving professional assistance. The\r\nold sailor, Captain Finch, had long before been condemned as\r\nunseaworthy, having suffered for many years from the effects of a bad\r\nfall on shipboard. He was a cheerful and wise person, and the doctor\r\nwas much attached to him, besides knowing that he had borne his\r\nimprisonment with great patience, for his life on one of the most\r\nsecluded farms of the region, surrounded by his wife\'s kinsfolk, who\r\nwere all landsmen, could hardly be called anything else. The doctor\r\nhad once made a voyage to Fayal and from thence to England in a\r\nsailing-vessel, having been somewhat delicate in health in his younger\r\ndays, and this made him a more intelligent listener to the captain\'s\r\nstories than was often available.\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie had brought his case of medicines from mere force of habit,\r\nbut by way of special prescription he had taken also a generous\r\nhandful of his best cigars, and wrapped them somewhat clumsily in one\r\nof the large sheets of letter-paper which lay on his study table near\r\nby. Also he had stopped before the old sideboard in the carefully\r\ndarkened dining-room, and taken a bottle of wine from one of its\r\ncupboards. "This will do him more good than anything, poor old\r\nfellow," he told himself, with a sudden warmth in his own heart and a\r\nfeeling of grateful pleasure because he had thought of doing the\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nMarilla called eagerly from the kitchen window to ask where he was\r\ngoing, putting her hand out hastily to part the morning-glory vines,\r\nwhich had climbed their strings and twisted their stems together until\r\nthey shut out the world from their planter\'s sight. But the doctor\r\nonly answered that he should be back at dinner time, and settled\r\nhimself comfortably in his carriage, smiling as he thought of\r\nMarilla\'s displeasure. She seldom allowed a secret to escape her, if\r\nshe were once fairly on the scent of it, though she grumbled now, and\r\ntold herself that she only cared to know for the sake of the people\r\nwho might come, or to provide against the accident of his being among\r\nthe missing in case of sudden need. She found life more interesting\r\nwhen there was even a small mystery to be puzzled over. It was\r\nimpossible for Dr. Leslie to resist teasing his faithful hand-maiden\r\nonce in a while, but he did it with proper gravity and respect, and\r\ntheir friendship was cemented by these sober jokes rather than torn\r\napart.\r\n\r\nThe horse knew as well as his master that nothing of particular\r\nimportance was in hand, and however well he always caught the spirit\r\nof the occasion when there was need for hurry, he now jogged along the\r\nroad, going slowly where the trees cast a pleasant shade, and paying\r\nmore attention to the flies than to anything else. The doctor seemed\r\nto be in deep thought, and old Major understood that no notice was to\r\nbe taken of constant slight touches of the whip which his master held\r\ncarelessly. It had been hot, dusty weather until the day and night\r\nbefore, when heavy showers had fallen; the country was looking fresh,\r\nand the fields and trees were washed clean at last from the white dust\r\nthat had powdered them and given the farms a barren and discouraged\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nThey had come in sight of Mrs. Thacher\'s house on its high hillside,\r\nand were just passing the abode of Mrs. Meeker, which was close by the\r\nroadside in the low land. This was a small, weather-beaten dwelling,\r\nand the pink and red hollyhocks showed themselves in fine array\r\nagainst its gray walls. Its mistress\'s prosaic nature had one most\r\nredeeming quality in her love for flowers and her gift in making them\r\ngrow, and the doctor forgave her many things for the sake of the\r\nbright little garden in the midst of the sandy lands which surrounded\r\nher garden with their unshaded barrenness. The road that crossed these\r\nwas hot in summer and swept by bitter winds in winter. It was like a\r\nbit of desert dropped by mistake among the green farms and spring-fed\r\nforests that covered the rest of the river uplands.\r\n\r\nNo sentinel was ever more steadfast to his duty in time of war and\r\ndisorder than Mrs. Meeker, as she sat by the front window, from which\r\nshe could see some distance either way along the crooked road. She was\r\noften absent from her own house to render assistance of one sort or\r\nanother among her neighbors, but if she were at home it was impossible\r\nfor man, woman, or child to go by without her challenge or careful\r\ninspection. She made couriers of her neighbors, and sent these errand\r\nmen and women along the country roads or to the village almost daily.\r\nShe was well posted in the news from both the village and the country\r\nside, and however much her acquaintances scolded about her, they found\r\nit impossible to resist the fascination of her conversation, and few\r\ndeclined to share in the banquet of gossip which she was always ready\r\nto spread. She was quick witted, and possessed of many resources and\r\nmuch cleverness of a certain sort; but it must be confessed that she\r\nhad done mischief in her day, having been the murderer of more than\r\none neighbor\'s peace of mind and the assailant of many a reputation.\r\nBut if she were a dangerous inmate of one\'s household, few were so\r\nattractive or entertaining for the space of an afternoon visit, and it\r\nwas usually said, when she was seen approaching, that she would be\r\nsure to have something to tell. Out in the country, where so many\r\npeople can see nothing new from one week\'s end to the other, it is,\r\nafter all, a great pleasure to have the latest particulars brought to\r\none\'s door, as a townsman\'s newspaper is.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker knew better than to stop Dr. Leslie if he were going\r\nanywhere in a hurry; she had been taught this lesson years ago; but\r\nwhen she saw him journeying in such a leisurely way some instinct\r\nassured her of safety, and she came out of her door like a\r\nJack-in-the-box, while old Major, only too ready for a halt, stood\r\nstill in spite of a desperate twitch of the reins, which had as much\r\neffect as pulling at a fish-hook which has made fast to an anchor.\r\nMrs. Meeker feigned a great excitement.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t keep you but a moment," she said, "but I want to hear what\r\nyou think about Mis\' Thacher\'s chances."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Thacher\'s?" repeated the doctor, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"She\'s doing well, isn\'t she? I don\'t suppose that she will ever be a\r\nyoung woman again."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why, but I took it for granted that you was goin\'\r\nthere," explained Mrs. Meeker, humbly. "She has seemed to me as if she\r\nwas failing all summer. I was up there last night, and I never said so\r\nto her, but she had aged dreadfully. I wonder if it\'s likely she\'s had\r\na light shock? Sometimes the fust one\'s kind o\' hidden; comes by night\r\nor somethin\', and folks don\'t know till they begins to feel the damage\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"She hasn\'t looked very well of late," said the doctor. For once in\r\nhis life he was willing to have a friendly talk, Mrs. Meeker thought,\r\nand she proceeded to make the most of her opportunity.\r\n\r\n"I think the care of that girl of Ad\'line\'s has been too much for her\r\nall along," she announced, "she\'s wild as a hawk, and a perfect\r\ntorment. One day she\'ll come strollin\' in and beseechin\' me for a\r\nbunch o\' flowers, and the next she\'ll be here after dark scarin\' me\r\nout o\' my seven senses. She rigged a tick-tack here the other night\r\nagainst the window, and my heart was in my mouth. I thought \'twas a\r\nwarnin\' much as ever I thought anything in my life; the night before\r\nmy mother died \'twas in that same room and against that same winder\r\nthere came two or three raps, and my sister Drew and me we looked at\r\neach other, and turned cold all over, and mother set right up in bed\r\nthe next night and looked at that winder and then laid back dead. I\r\nwas all sole alone the other evenin\',--Wednesday it was,--and when I\r\nheard them raps I mustered up, and went and put my head out o\' the\r\ndoor, and I couldn\'t see nothing, and when I went back, knock--knock,\r\nit begun again, and I went to the door and harked. I hoped I should\r\nhear somebody or \'nother comin\' along the road, and then I heard\r\nsomethin\' a rus\'lin\' amongst the sunflowers and hollyhocks, and then\r\nthere was a titterin\', and come to find out \'twas that young one. I\r\nchased her up the road till my wind give out, and I had to go and set\r\non the stone wall, and come to. She won\'t go to bed till she\'s a mind\r\nto. One night I was up there this spring, and she never come in until\r\nafter nine o\'clock, a dark night, too; and the pore old lady was in\r\ndistress, and thought she\'d got into the river. I says to myself there\r\nwa\'n\'t no such good news. She told how she\'d be\'n up into Jake an\'\r\nMartin\'s oaks, trying to catch a little screech owl. She belongs with\r\nwild creatur\'s, I do believe,--just the same natur\'. She\'d better be\r\nkept to school, \'stead o\' growin\' up this way; but she keeps the rest\r\no\' the young ones all in a brile, and this last teacher wouldn\'t have\r\nher there at all. She\'d toll off half the school into the pasture at\r\nrecess time, and none of \'em would get back for half an hour."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a tick-tack? I don\'t remember," asked the doctor, who had been\r\nsmiling now and then at this complaint.\r\n\r\n"They tie a nail to the end of a string, and run it over a bent pin\r\nstuck in the sash, and then they get out o\' sight and pull, and it\r\nclacks against the winder, don\'t ye see? Ain\'t it surprisin\' how them\r\ndevil\'s tricks gets handed down from gineration to gineration, while\r\nso much that\'s good is forgot," lamented Mrs. Meeker, but the doctor\r\nlooked much amused.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a bright child," he said, "and not over strong. I don\'t believe\r\nin keeping young folks shut up in the schoolhouses all summer long."\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker sniffed disapprovingly. "She\'s tougher than ellum roots. I\r\nbelieve you can\'t kill them peak\xe8d-looking young ones. She\'ll run like\r\na fox all day long and live to see us all buried. I can put up with\r\nher pranks; \'t is of pore old Mis\' Thacher I\'m thinkin\'. She\'s had\r\ntrouble enough without adding on this young \'scape-gallows. You had\r\nbetter fetch her up to be a doctor," Mrs. Meeker smilingly continued,\r\n"I was up there yisterday, and one of the young turkeys had come\r\nhoppin\' and quawkin\' round the doorsteps with its leg broke, and she\'d\r\ncaught it and fixed it off with a splint before you could say Jack\r\nRobi\'son. She told how it was the way you\'d done to Jim Finch that\r\nfell from the hay-rigging and broke his arm over to Jake an\' Martin\'s,\r\nhaying time."\r\n\r\n"I remember she was standing close by, watching everything I did,"\r\nsaid the doctor, his face shining with interest and pleasure. "I\r\nshall have to carry her about for clerk. Her father studied medicine\r\nyou know. It is the most amazing thing how people inherit"--but he did\r\nnot finish his sentence and pulled the reins so quickly that the wise\r\nhorse knew there was no excuse for not moving forward.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker had hoped for a longer interview. "Stop as you come back,\r\nwon\'t you?" she asked. "I\'m goin\' to pick you some of the handsomest\r\npoppies I ever raised. I got the seed from my sister-in-law\'s cousin,\r\nshe that was \'Miry Gregg, and they do beat everything. They wilt so\r\nthat it ain\'t no use to pick \'em now, unless you was calc\'latin\' to\r\ncome home by the other road. There\'s nobody sick about here, is\r\nthere?" to which the doctor returned a shake of the head and the\r\ninformation that he should be returning that way about noon. As he\r\ndrove up the hill he assured himself with great satisfaction that he\r\nbelieved he hadn\'t told anything that morning which would be repeated\r\nall over town before night, while his hostess returned to her house\r\nquite dissatisfied with the interview, though she hoped for better\r\nfortune on Dr. Leslie\'s return.\r\n\r\nFor his part, he drove on slowly past the Thacher farmhouse, looking\r\ncarefully about him, and sending a special glance up the lane in\r\nsearch of the invalid turkey. "I should like to see how she managed\r\nit," he told himself half aloud. "If she shows a gift for such things\r\nI\'ll take pains to teach her a lesson or two by and by when she is\r\nolder.... Come Major, don\'t go to sleep on the road!" and in a few\r\nminutes the wagon was out of sight, if the reader had stood in the\r\nThacher lane, instead of following the good man farther on his errand\r\nof mercy and good fellowship.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time in the morning most housekeepers were busy in their\r\nkitchens, but Mrs. Thacher came to stand in her doorway, and shaded\r\nher forehead and eyes with her hand from the bright sunlight, as she\r\nlooked intently across the pastures toward the river. She seemed\r\nanxious and glanced to and fro across the fields, and presently she\r\nturned quickly at the sound of a footstep, and saw her young\r\ngrand-daughter coming from the other direction round the corner of the\r\nhouse. The child was wet and a little pale, though she evidently had\r\nbeen running.\r\n\r\n"What have you been doin\' now?" asked the old lady fretfully. "I won\'t\r\nhave you gettin\' up in the mornin\' before I am awake and stealin\' out\r\nof the house. I think you are drowned in the river or have broken your\r\nneck fallin\' out of a tree. Here it is after ten o\'clock. I\'ve a mind\r\nto send you to bed, Nanny; who got you out of the water, for in it\r\nyou\'ve been sure enough?"\r\n\r\n"I got out myself," said the little girl. "It was deep, though," and\r\nshe began to cry, and when she tried to cover her eyes with her\r\nalready well-soaked little apron, she felt quite broken-hearted and\r\nunnerved, and sat down dismally on the doorstep.\r\n\r\n"Come in, and put on a dry dress," said her grandmother, not unkindly;\r\n"that is, if there\'s anything but your Sunday one fit to be seen. I\'ve\r\ntold you often enough not to go playin\' in the river, and I\'ve wanted\r\nyou more than common to go out to Jake and Martin\'s to borrow me a\r\nlittle cinnamon. You\'re a real trial this summer. I believe the bigger\r\nyou are the worse you are. Now just say what you\'ve been about. I\r\ndeclare I shall have to go and have a talk with the doctor, and he\'ll\r\nscold you well. I\'m gettin\' old and I can\'t keep after you; you ought\r\nto consider me some. You\'ll think of it when you see me laying dead,\r\nwhat a misery you\'ve be\'n. No schoolin\' worth namin\';" grumbled Mrs.\r\nThacher, as she stepped heavily to and fro in the kitchen, and the\r\nlittle girl disappeared within the bed-room. In a few minutes,\r\nhowever, her unusual depression was driven away by the comfort of dry\r\ngarments, and she announced triumphantly that she had found a whole\r\nflock of young wild ducks, and that she had made a raft and chased\r\nthem about up and down the river, until the raft had proved\r\nunseaworthy, and she had fallen through into the water. Later in the\r\nday somebody came from the Jake and Martin homesteads to say that\r\nthere must be no more pulling down of the ends of the pasture fences.\r\nThe nails had easily let go their hold of the old boards, and a stone\r\nhad served our heroine for a useful shipwright\'s hammer, but the\r\nyoung cattle had strayed through these broken barriers and might have\r\ndone great damage if they had been discovered a little later,--having\r\nquickly hied themselves to a piece of carefully cultivated land. The\r\nJake and Martin families regarded Nan with a mixture of dread and\r\naffection. She was bringing a new element into their prosaic lives,\r\nand her pranks afforded them a bit of news almost daily. Her\r\nimagination was apt to busy itself in inventing tales of her unknown\r\naunt, with which she entertained a grandchild of Martin Dyer, a little\r\ngirl of nearly her own age. It seemed possible to Nan that any day a\r\ncarriage drawn by a pair of prancing black horses might be seen\r\nturning up the lane, and that a lovely lady might alight and claim her\r\nas her only niece. Why this event had not already taken place the\r\nchild never troubled herself to think, but ever since Marilla had\r\nspoken of this aunt\'s existence, the dreams of her had been growing\r\nlonger and more charming, until she seemed fit for a queen, and her\r\nunseen house a palace. Nan\'s playmate took pleasure in repeating these\r\nglowing accounts to her family, and many were the head-shakings and\r\nevil forebodings over the untruthfulness of the heroine of this story.\r\nLittle Susan Dyer\'s only aunt, who was well known to her, lived as\r\nother people did in a comparatively plain and humble house, and it was\r\nnot to be wondered at that she objected to hearing continually of an\r\naunt of such splendid fashion. And yet Nan tried over and over again\r\nto be in some degree worthy of the relationship. She must not be too\r\nunfit to enter upon more brilliant surroundings whenever the time\r\nshould come,--she took care that her pet chickens and her one doll\r\nshould have high-sounding names, such as would seem proper to the\r\naunt, and, more than this, she took a careful survey of the house\r\nwhenever she was coming home from school or from play, lest she might\r\ncome upon her distinguished relative unawares. She had asked her\r\ngrandmother more than once to tell her about this mysterious\r\nkinswoman, but Mrs. Thacher proved strangely uncommunicative, fearing\r\nif she answered one easy question it might involve others that were\r\nmore difficult.\r\n\r\nThe good woman grew more and more anxious to fulfil her duty to this\r\ntroublesome young housemate; the child was strangely dear and\r\ncompanionable in spite of her frequent naughtiness. It seemed, too, as\r\nif she could do whatever she undertook, and as if she had a power\r\nwhich made her able to use and unite the best traits of her ancestors,\r\nthe strong capabilities which had been illy balanced or allowed to run\r\nto waste in others. It might be said that the materials for a fine\r\nspecimen of humanity accumulate through several generations, until a\r\nchild appears who is the heir of all the family wit and attractiveness\r\nand common sense, just as one person may inherit the worldly wealth of\r\nhis ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nFOR THE YEARS TO COME\r\n\r\n\r\nLate one summer afternoon Dr. Leslie was waked from an unusually long\r\nafter-dinner nap by Marilla\'s footsteps along the hall. She remained\r\nstanding in the doorway, looking at him for a provoking length of\r\ntime, and finally sneezed in her most obtrusive and violent manner. At\r\nthis he sat up quickly and demanded to be told what was the matter,\r\nadding that he had been out half the night before, which was no news\r\nto the faithful housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"There, I\'m sure I didn\'t mean to wake you up," she said, with an\r\napparent lack of self-reproach. "I never can tell whether you are\r\nasleep or only kind of drowsin\'. There was a boy here just now from\r\nold Mis\' Cunningham\'s over on the b\'ilin\' spring road. They want you\r\nto come over quick as convenient. She don\'t know nothin\', the boy\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n"Never did," grumbled the doctor. "I\'ll go, toward night, but I can\'t\r\ndo her any good."\r\n\r\n"An\' Mis\' Thacher is out here waitin\' too, but she says if you\'re busy\r\nshe\'ll go along to the stores and stop as she comes back. She looks to\r\nme as if she was breakin\' up," confided Marilla in a lower tone.\r\n\r\n"Tell her I\'m ready now," answered the doctor in a more cordial tone,\r\nand though he said half to himself and half to Marilla that here was\r\nanother person who expected him to cure old age, he spoke\r\ncompassionately, and as if his heart were heavy with the thought of\r\nhuman sorrow and suffering. But he greeted Mrs. Thacher most\r\ncheerfully, and joked about Marilla\'s fear of a fly, as he threw open\r\nthe blinds of the study window which was best shaded from the sun.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thacher did indeed look changed, and the physician\'s quick eyes\r\ntook note of it, and, as he gathered up some letters and newspapers\r\nwhich had been strewn about just after dinner, he said kindly that he\r\nhoped she had no need of a doctor. It was plain that the occasion\r\nseemed an uncommon one to her. She wore her best clothes, which would\r\nnot have been necessary for one of her usual business trips to the\r\nvillage, and it seemed to be difficult for her to begin her story. Dr.\r\nLeslie, taking a purely professional view of the case, began to\r\nconsider what form of tonic would be most suitable, whether she had\r\ncome to ask for one or not.\r\n\r\n"I want to have a good talk with you about the little gell; Nanny, you\r\nknow;" she said at last, and the doctor nodded, and, explaining that\r\nthere seemed to be a good deal of draught through the room, crossed\r\nthe floor and gently shut the door which opened into the hall. He\r\nsmiled a little as he did it, having heard the long breath outside\r\nwhich was the not unfamiliar signal of Marilla\'s presence. If she were\r\ncurious, she was a discreet keeper of secrets, and the doctor had more\r\nthan once indulged her in her sinful listening by way of friendliness\r\nand reward. But this subject promised to concern his own affairs too\r\nclosely, and he became wary of the presence of another pair of ears.\r\nHe was naturally a man of uncommon reserve, and most loyal in keeping\r\nhis patients\' secrets. If clergymen knew their congregations as well\r\nas physicians do, the sermons would be often more closely related to\r\nthe parish needs. It was difficult for the world to understand why,\r\nwhen Dr. Leslie was anything but prone to gossip, Marilla should have\r\nbeen possessed of such a wealth of knowledge of her neighbors\'\r\naffairs. Strange to say this wealth was for her own miserly pleasure\r\nand not to be distributed, and while she often proclaimed with\r\nexasperating triumph that she had known for months some truth just\r\ndiscovered by others, she was regarded by her acquaintances as if she\r\nwere a dictionary written in some foreign language; immensely\r\nvaluable, but of no practical use to themselves. It was sometimes\r\ndifficult not to make an attempt to borrow from her store of news, but\r\nnothing delighted her more than to be so approached, and to present\r\nimpenetrable barriers of discretion to the enemy.\r\n\r\n"How is Nanny getting on?" the doctor asked. "She looks stronger than\r\nshe did a year ago."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, she\'s wild as ever," answered Mrs. Thacher, trying to smile;\r\n"but I\'ve been distressed about her lately, night and day. I thought\r\nperhaps I might see you going by. She\'s gettin\' to be a great girl,\r\ndoctor, and I ain\'t fit to cope with her. I find my strength\'s\r\na-goin\', and I\'m old before my time; all my folks was rugged and sound\r\nlong past my age, but I\'ve had my troubles--you don\'t need I should\r\ntell you that! Poor Ad\'line always give me a feelin\' as if I was a hen\r\nthat has hatched ducks. I never knew exactly how to do for her, she\r\nseemed to see everything so different, and Lord only knows how I worry\r\nabout her; and al\'ays did, thinkin\' if I\'d seen clearer how to do my\r\nduty her life might have come out sort of better. And it\'s the same\r\nwith little Anna; not that she\'s so prone to evil as some; she\'s a\r\nlovin\'-hearted child if ever one was born, but she\'s a piece o\'\r\nmischief; and it may come from her father\'s folks and their ways o\'\r\nlivin\', but she\'s made o\' different stuff, and I ain\'t fit to make\r\nanswer for her, or for fetchin\' of her up. I come to ask if you won\'t\r\nkindly advise what\'s best for her. I do\' know\'s anything\'s got to be\r\ndone for a good spell yet. I mind what you say about lettin\' her run\r\nand git strong, and I don\'t check her. Only it seemed to me that you\r\nmight want to speak about her sometimes and not do it for fear o\'\r\nwronging my judgment. I declare I haven\'t no judgment about what\'s\r\nreasonable for her, and you\'re her guardeen, and there\'s the money her\r\nfather\'s sister has sent her; \'t would burn my fingers to touch a cent\r\nof it, but by and by if you think she ought to have schoolin\' or\r\nanything else you must just say so."\r\n\r\n"I think nothing better could have been done for the child than you\r\nhave done," said Dr. Leslie warmly. "Don\'t worry yourself, my good\r\nfriend. As for books, she will take to them of her own accord quite\r\nsoon enough, and in such weather as this I think one day in the fields\r\nis worth five in the school-house. I\'ll do the best I can for her."\r\n\r\nMrs. Thacher\'s errand had not yet been told, though she fumbled in her\r\npocket and walked to the open window to look for the neighbor\'s wagon\r\nby which she was to find conveyance home, before she ventured to say\r\nanything more. "I don\'t know\'s my time\'ll come for some years yet,"\r\nshe said at length, falteringly, "but I have had it borne in upon my\r\nmind a good many ways this summer that I ain\'t going to stay here a\r\ngre\'t while. I\'ve been troubled considerable by the same complaints\r\nthat carried my mother off, and I\'m built just like her. I don\'t feel\r\nno concern for myself, but it\'s goin\' to leave the child without\r\nanybody of her own to look to. There\'s plenty will befriend her just\r\nso long as she\'s got means, and the old farm will sell for something\r\nbesides what she\'s got already, but that ain\'t everything, and I can\'t\r\nseem to make up my mind to havin\' of her boarded about. If \'t was so\r\nyour wife had lived I should know what I\'d go down on my knees to her\r\nto do, but I can\'t ask it of you to be burdened with a young child\r\na-growin\' up."\r\n\r\nThe doctor listened patiently, though just before this he had risen\r\nand begun to fill a small bottle at the closet shelves, which were\r\nstocked close to their perilous edges with various drugs. Without\r\nturning to look at his patient he said, "I wish you would take five or\r\nsix drops of this three times a day, and let me see you again within a\r\nweek or two." And while the troubled woman turned to look at him with\r\nhalf-surprise, he added, "Don\'t give yourself another thought about\r\nlittle Nan. If anything should happen to you, I shall be glad to bring\r\nher here, and to take care of her as if she were my own. I always have\r\nliked her, and it will be as good for me as for her. I would not\r\npromise it for any other child, but if you had not spoken to-day, I\r\nshould have found a way to arrange with you the first chance that\r\ncame. But I\'m getting to be an old fellow myself," he laughed. "I\r\nsuppose if I get through first you will be friendly to Marilla?" and\r\nMrs. Thacher let a faint sunbeam of a smile shine out from the depths\r\nof the handkerchief with which she was trying to stop a great shower\r\nof tears. Marilla was not without her little vanities, and being\r\nthought youthful was one of the chief desires of her heart.\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Thacher went away lighter hearted than she came. She asked the\r\nprice of the vial of medicine, and was answered that they would talk\r\nabout that another time; then there was a little sober joking about\r\ncertain patients who never paid their doctor\'s bills at all because of\r\na superstition that they would immediately require his aid again. Dr.\r\nLeslie stood in his study doorway and watched her drive down the\r\nstreet with Martin Dyer. It seemed to him only a year or two since\r\nboth the man and woman had been strong and vigorous; now they both\r\nlooked shrunken, and there was a wornness and feebleness about the\r\nbodies which had done such good service. "Come and go," said the\r\ndoctor to himself, "one generation after another. Getting old! all the\r\ngood old-fashioned people on the farms: I never shall care so much to\r\nbe at the beck and call of their grandchildren, but I must mend up\r\nthese old folks and do the best I can for them as long as they stay;\r\nthey\'re good friends to me. Dear me, how it used to fret me when I was\r\nyounger to hear them always talking about old Doctor Wayland and what\r\nhe used to do; and here I am the old doctor myself!" And then he went\r\ndown the gravel walk toward the stable with a quick, firm step, which\r\nmany a younger man might have envied, to ask for a horse. "You may\r\nsaddle him," he directed. "I am only going to old Mrs. Cunningham\'s,\r\nand it is a cool afternoon."\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie had ridden less and less every year of his practice; but,\r\nfor some reason best known to himself, he went down the village street\r\nat a mad pace. Indeed, almost everybody who saw him felt that it was\r\nimportant to go to the next house to ask if it were known for what\r\naccident or desperate emergency he had been called away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nA GREAT CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the autumn of this year, life had seemed to flow in one steady,\r\nunchanging current. The thought had not entered little Nan Prince\'s\r\nhead that changes might be in store for her, for, ever since she could\r\nremember, the events of life had followed each other quietly, and\r\nexcept for the differences in every-day work and play, caused by the\r\nsuccession of the seasons, she was not called upon to accommodate\r\nherself to new conditions. It was a gentle change at first: as the\r\ndays grew shorter and the house and cellar were being made ready for\r\nwinter, her grandmother seemed to have much more to do than usual, and\r\nNan must stay at home to help. She was growing older at any rate; she\r\nknew how to help better than she used; she was anxious to show her\r\ngrandmother how well she could work, and as the river side and the\r\nwindy pastures grew less hospitable, she did not notice that she was\r\nno longer encouraged to go out to play for hours together to amuse\r\nherself as best she might, and at any rate keep out of the way. It\r\nseemed natural enough now that she should stay in the house, and be\r\nentrusted with some regular part of the business of keeping it. For\r\nsome time Mrs. Thacher had kept but one cow, and early in November,\r\nafter a good offer for old Brindle had been accepted, it was announced\r\nto Nan\'s surprise that the young cow which was to be Brindle\'s\r\nsuccessor need not be bought until spring; she would be a great care\r\nin winter time, and Nan was to bring a quart of milk a day from Jake\r\nand Martin\'s. This did not seem an unpleasant duty while the mild\r\nweather lasted; if there came a rainy day, one of the kind neighbors\r\nwould leave the little pail on his way to the village before the young\r\nmessenger had started out.\r\n\r\nNan could not exactly understand at last why Mrs. Jake and Mrs. Martin\r\nalways asked about her grandmother every morning with so much interest\r\nand curiosity, or why they came oftener and oftener to help with the\r\nheavy work. Mrs. Thacher had never before minded her occasional\r\nillnesses so much, and some time passed before Nan\'s inexperienced\r\neyes and fearless young heart understood that the whole atmosphere\r\nwhich overhung the landscape of her life had somehow changed, that\r\nanother winter approached full of mystery and strangeness and\r\ndiscomfort of mind, and at last a great storm was almost ready to\r\nbreak into the shelter and comfort of her simple life. Poor Nan! She\r\ncould not think what it all meant. She was asked many a distressing\r\nquestion, and openly pitied, and heard her future discussed, as if her\r\nworld might come to an end any day. The doctor had visited her\r\ngrandmother from time to time, but always while she was at school,\r\nuntil vacation came, and poor Mrs. Thacher grew too feeble to enter\r\ninto even a part of the usual business of the farmhouse.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as Nan was coming back from the Dyer farm with the milk,\r\nshe met Mrs. Meeker in the highway. This neighbor and our heroine were\r\nrarely on good terms with each other, since Nan had usually laid\r\nherself under some serious charge of wrong-doing, and had come to\r\nbelieve that she would be disapproved in any event, and so might enjoy\r\nlife as she chose, and revel in harmless malice.\r\n\r\nThe child could not have told why she shrank from meeting her enemy so\r\nmuch more than usual, and tried to discover some refuge or chance for\r\nescape; but, as it was an open bit of the road, and a straight way to\r\nthe lane, she could have no excuse for scrambling over the stone wall\r\nand cutting short the distance. However, her second thought scorned\r\nthe idea of running away in such cowardly fashion, and not having any\r\nrecent misdemeanor on her conscience, she went forward unflinchingly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker\'s tone was not one of complaint, but of pity, and\r\ninsinuating friendliness. "How\'s your grandma to-day?" she asked, and\r\nNan, with an unsympathetic answer of "About the same," stepped bravely\r\nforward, resenting with all her young soul the discovery that Mrs.\r\nMeeker had turned and was walking alongside.\r\n\r\n"She\'s been a good, kind grandma to you, hain\'t she?" said this\r\nunwelcome companion, and when Nan had returned a wondering but almost\r\ninaudible assent, she continued, "She\'ll be a great loss to you, I can\r\ntell you. You\'ll never find nobody to do for you like her. There, you\r\nwon\'t realize nothing about it till you\'ve got older\'n you be now;\r\nbut the time\'ll come when"--and her sharp voice faltered; for Nan had\r\nturned to look full in her face, had stopped still in the frozen road,\r\ndropped the pail unconsciously and given a little cry, and in another\r\nmoment was running as a chased wild creature does toward the refuge of\r\nits nest. The doctor\'s horse was fastened at the head of the lane, and\r\nNan knew at last, what any one in the neighborhood could have told her\r\nmany days before, that her grandmother was going to die. Mrs. Meeker\r\nstared after her with a grieved sense of the abrupt ending of the\r\ncoveted interview, then she recovered her self-possession, and,\r\npicking up the forsaken pail, stepped lightly over the ruts and frozen\r\npuddles, following Nan eagerly in the hope of witnessing more of such\r\nextraordinary behavior, and with the design of offering her services\r\nas watcher or nurse in these last hours. At any rate the pail and the\r\nmilk, which had not been spilt, could not be left in the road.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the first chapter of the child\'s life was ended in the early winter\r\nweather. There was a new unsheltered grave on the slope above the\r\nriver, the farm-house door was shut and locked, and the light was out\r\nin the kitchen window. It had been a landmark to those who were used\r\nto driving along the road by night, and there were sincere mourners\r\nfor the kindly woman who had kept a simple faith and uprightness all\r\nthrough her long life of trouble and disappointment. Nan and the cat\r\nhad gone to live in the village, and both, being young, had taken the\r\nchange with serenity; though at first a piteous sorrow had been waked\r\nin the child\'s heart, a keen and dreadful fear of the future. The past\r\nseemed so secure and pleasant, as she looked back, and now she was in\r\nthe power of a fateful future which had begun with something like a\r\nwhirlwind that had swept over her, leaving nothing unchanged. It\r\nseemed to her that this was to be incessant, and that being grown up\r\nwas to be at the mercy of sorrow and uncertainty. She was pale and\r\nquiet during her last days in the old home, answering questions and\r\nobeying directions mechanically; but usually sitting in the least\r\nvisited part of the kitchen, watching the neighbors as they examined\r\nher grandmother\'s possessions, and properly disposed of the contents\r\nof the house. Sometimes a spark flew from her sad and angry eyes, but\r\nshe made no trouble, and seemed dull and indifferent. Late in the\r\nevening Dr. Leslie carried her home with him through the first heavy\r\nsnow-storm of the year, and between the excitement of being covered\r\nfrom the fast-falling flakes, and so making a journey in the dark, and\r\nof keeping hold of the basket which contained the enraged kitten, the\r\ngrief at leaving home was not dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nWhen she had been unwound from one of the doctor\'s great cloaks, and\r\nher eyes had grown used to the bright light in the dining-room, and\r\nMarilla had said that supper had been waiting half an hour, and she\r\ndid not know how she should get along with a black cat, and then\r\nbustled about talking much faster than usual, because the sight of the\r\nlonely child had made her ready to cry, Nan began to feel comforted.\r\nIt seemed a great while ago that she had cried at her grandmother\'s\r\nfuneral. If this were the future it was certainly very welcome and\r\nalready very dear, and the time of distress was like a night of bad\r\ndreams between two pleasant days.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood that no great change was made in Dr.\r\nLeslie\'s house. The doctor himself and Marilla were both well settled\r\nin their habits, and while they cordially made room for the little\r\ngirl who was to be the third member of the household, her coming made\r\nlittle difference to either of her elders. There was a great deal of\r\nillness that winter, and the doctor was more than commonly busy; Nan\r\nwas sent to school, and discovered the delight of reading one stormy\r\nday when her guardian had given her leave to stay at home, and she had\r\nfound his own old copy of Robinson Crusoe looking most friendly and\r\ninviting in a corner of one of the study shelves. As for school, she\r\nhad never liked it, and the village school gave her far greater misery\r\nthan the weather-beaten building at the cross-roads ever had done. She\r\nhad known many of the village children by sight, from seeing them in\r\nchurch, but she did not number many friends among them, even after the\r\nwinter was nearly gone and the days began to grow brighter and less\r\ncold, and the out-of-door games were a source of great merriment in\r\nthe playground. Nan\'s ideas of life were quite unlike those held by\r\nthese new acquaintances, and she could not gain the least interest in\r\nmost of the other children, though she grew fond of one boy who was a\r\nfamous rover and fisherman, and after one of the elder girls had read\r\na composition which fired our heroine\'s imagination, she worshiped\r\nthis superior being from a suitable distance, and was her willing\r\nadorer and slave. The composition was upon The Moon, and when the\r\nauthor proclaimed the fact that this was the same moon which had\r\nlooked down upon Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, little Nan\'s eyes had\r\nopened wide with reverence and awe, and she opened the doors of her\r\nheart and soul to lofty thought and high imagination. The big girl,\r\nwho sat in the back seat and glibly recited amazing lessons in\r\nhistory, and did sums which entirely covered the one small blackboard,\r\nwas not unmindful of Nan\'s admiration, and stolidly accepted and\r\nmunched the offerings of cracked nuts, or of the treasured English\r\napples which had been brought from the farm and kept like a squirrel\'s\r\nhoard in an archway of the cellar by themselves. Nan cherished an idea\r\nof going back to the farm to live by herself as soon as she grew a\r\nlittle older, and she indulged in pleasing day-dreams of a most\r\ncharming life there, with frequent entertainments for her friends, at\r\nwhich the author of the information about the moon would be the\r\nfavored guest, and Nan herself, in a most childish and provincial\r\nfashion, the reigning queen. What did these new town-acquaintances\r\nknow of the strawberries which grew in the bit of meadow, or the great\r\nhigh-bush blackberries by one of the pasture walls, and what would\r\ntheir pleasure be when they were taken down the river some moonlight\r\nnight and caught sight of a fire blazing on a distant bank, and went\r\nnearer to find a sumptuous feast which Nan herself had arranged? She\r\nhad been told that her aunt--that mysterious and beneficent aunt--had\r\nalready sent her money which was lying idle in the bank until she\r\nshould need to spend it, and her imaginary riches increased week by\r\nweek, while her horizon of future happiness constantly grew wider.\r\n\r\nThe other children were not unwilling at first to enter upon an\r\ninquisitive friendship with the new-comer; but Marilla was so\r\nuncongenial to the noisy visitors, and so fastidious in the matter of\r\nsnowy and muddy shoes, that she was soon avoided. Nan herself was a\r\nteachable child and gave little trouble, and Marilla sometimes\r\ncongratulated herself because she had reserved the violent objections\r\nwhich had occurred to her mind when the doctor had announced, just\r\nbefore Mrs. Thacher\'s death, that his ward would henceforth find a\r\nhome in his house.\r\n\r\nMarilla usually sat in the dining-room in the evening, though she was\r\napt to visit the study occasionally, knitting in hand, to give her\r\nopinions, or to acquaint herself with various events of which she\r\nthought the doctor would be likely to have knowledge. Sometimes in the\r\ncolder winter nights, she drew a convenient light-stand close beside\r\nthe kitchen stove and refused to wander far from such comfortable\r\nwarmth. Now that she had Nan\'s busy feet to cover, there was less\r\ndanger than ever that she should be left without knitting-work, and\r\nshe deeply enjoyed the child\'s company, since Nan could give innocent\r\nanswers to many questions which could never be put to elder members of\r\nthe Dyer and Thacher neighborhood. Mrs. Meeker was apt to be discussed\r\nwith great freedom, and Nan told long stories about her own childish\r\nexperiences, which were listened to and encouraged, and matched with\r\nothers even longer and more circumstantial by Marilla. The doctor, who\r\nwas always reading when he could find a quiet hour for himself, often\r\nsmiled as he heard the steady sound of voices from the wide kitchen,\r\nand he more than once took a few careful steps into the dining-room,\r\nand stood there shaking with laughter at the character of the\r\nconversation. Nan, though eager to learn, and curious about many\r\nthings in life and nature, at first found her school lessons\r\ndifficult, and sometimes came appealingly to him for assistance, when\r\ncircumstances had made a temporary ending of her total indifference to\r\ngetting the lessons at all. For this and other reasons she sometimes\r\nsought the study, and drew a small chair beside the doctor\'s large one\r\nbefore the blazing fire of the black birch logs; and then Marilla in\r\nher turn would venture upon the neutral ground between study and\r\nkitchen, and smile with satisfaction at the cheerful companionship of\r\nthe tired man and the idle little girl who had already found her way\r\nto his lonely heart. Nan had come to another home; there was no\r\nquestion about what should be done with her and for her, but she was\r\nmade free of the silent old house, and went on growing taller, and\r\ngrowing dearer, and growing happier day by day. Whatever the future\r\nmight bring, she would be sure to look back with love and longing to\r\nthe first summer of her village life, when, seeing that she looked\r\npale and drooping, the doctor, to her intense gratification, took her\r\naway from school. Presently, instead of having a ride out into the\r\ncountry as an occasional favor, she might be seen every day by the\r\ndoctor\'s side, as if he could not make his morning rounds without her;\r\nand in and out of the farm-houses she went, following him like a\r\nlittle dog, or, as Marilla scornfully expressed it, a briar at his\r\nheels; sitting soberly by when he dealt his medicines and gave advice,\r\nlistening to his wise and merry talk with some, and his helpful advice\r\nand consolation to others of the country people. Many of these\r\nacquaintances treated Nan with great kindness; she half belonged to\r\nthem, and was deeply interesting for the sake of her other ties of\r\nblood and bonds of fortune, while she took their courtesy with\r\nthankfulness, and their lack of notice with composure. If there were a\r\nshiny apple offered she was glad, but if not, she did not miss it,\r\nsince her chief delight was in being the doctor\'s assistant and\r\nattendant, and her eyes were always watching for chances when she\r\nmight be of use. And one day, coming out from a bedroom, the doctor\r\ndiscovered, to his amusement, that her quick and careful fingers had\r\nfolded the papers of some powders which he had left unfolded on the\r\ntable. As they drove home together in the bright noon sunshine, he\r\nsaid, as if the question were asked for the sake of joking a little,\r\n"What are you going to do when you grow up, Nan?" to which she\r\nanswered gravely, as if it were the one great question of her life, "I\r\nshould like best to be a doctor." Strangely enough there flitted\r\nthrough the doctor\'s mind a remembrance of the day when he had talked\r\nwith Mrs. Meeker, and had looked up the lane to see the unlucky turkey\r\nwhose leg had been put into splints. He had wished more than once that\r\nhe had taken pains to see how the child had managed it; but old Mrs.\r\nThacher had reported the case to have been at least partially\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nNan had stolen a look at her companion after the answer had been\r\ngiven, but had been pleased and comforted to find that he was not\r\nlaughing at her, and at once began a lively picture of becoming famous\r\nin her chosen profession, and the valued partner of Dr. Leslie, whose\r\nskill everybody praised so heartily. He should not go out at night,\r\nand she would help him so much that he would wonder how he ever had\r\nbeen able to manage his wide-spread practice alone. It was a matter of\r\nno concern to her that Marilla had laughed when she had been told of\r\nNan\'s intentions, and had spoken disrespectfully of women doctors; and\r\nthe child\'s heart was full of pride and hope. The doctor stopped his\r\nhorse suddenly to show Nan some flowers which grew at the roadside,\r\nsome brilliant cardinals, and she climbed quickly down to gather them.\r\nThere was an unwritten law that they should keep watch, one to the\r\nright hand, and the other to the left, and such treasures of blossoms\r\nor wild fruit seldom escaped Nan\'s vision. Now she felt as if she had\r\nbeen wrong to let her thoughts go wandering, and her cheeks were\r\nalmost as bright as the scarlet flowers themselves, as she clambered\r\nback to the wagon seat. But the doctor was in deep thought, and had\r\nnothing more to say for the next mile or two. It had become like a\r\nbad-case day suddenly and without apparent reason; but Nan had no\r\nsuspicion that she was the patient in charge whose welfare seemed to\r\nthe doctor to be dependent upon his own decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAT DR. LESLIE\'S\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Dr. Leslie made signs that he was not to be interrupted,\r\nand even shut the study doors, to which precaution he seldom resorted.\r\nHe was evidently disturbed when an hour later a vigorous knocking was\r\nheard at the seldom-used front entrance, and Marilla ushered in with\r\nanything but triumph an elderly gentleman who had been his college\r\nclassmate. Marilla\'s countenance wore a forbidding expression, and as\r\nshe withdrew she took pains to shut the door between the hall and\r\ndining-room with considerable violence. It was almost never closed\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, but the faithful housekeeper was\r\nimpelled to express her wrath in some way, and this was the first\r\nthat offered itself. Nan was sitting peacefully in the kitchen playing\r\nwith her black cat and telling herself stories no doubt, and was quite\r\nunprepared for Marilla\'s change of temper. The bell for the Friday\r\nevening prayer-meeting was tolling its last strokes and it was\r\nMarilla\'s habit to attend that service. She was apt to be kept closely\r\nat home, it must be acknowledged, and this was one of her few social\r\nindulgences. Since Nan had joined the family and proved that she could\r\nbe trusted with a message, she had been left in charge of the house\r\nduring this coveted hour on Friday evenings.\r\n\r\nMarilla had descended from her room arrayed for church going, but now\r\nher bonnet was pulled off as if that were the prime offender, and when\r\nthe child looked wonderingly around the kitchen, she saw the bread-box\r\nbrought out from the closet and put down very hard on a table, while\r\nMarilla began directly afterward to rattle at the stove.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to say to some folks that we don\'t keep hotel," grumbled the\r\ngood woman, "I wish to my heart I\'d stepped right out o\' the front\r\ndoor and gone straight to meetin\' and left them there beholdin\' of me.\r\nCourse he hasn\'t had no supper, nor dinner neither like\'s not, and if\r\nmen are ever going to drop down on a family unexpected it\'s always\r\nFriday night when everything\'s eat up that ever was in the house. I\r\ns\'pose, after I bake double quantities to-morrow mornin\', he\'ll be\r\ndrivin\' off before noon-time, and treasure it up that we never have\r\nnothin\' decent to set before folks. Anna, you\'ve got to stir yourself\r\nand help, while I get the fire started up; lay one o\' them big dinner\r\nnapkins over the red cloth, and set a plate an\' a tea-cup, for as for\r\nlaying the whole table over again, I won\'t and I shan\'t. There\'s water\r\nto cart upstairs and the bed-room to open, but Heaven be thanked I was\r\nup there dustin\' to-day, and if ever you set a mug of flowers into one\r\no\' the spare-rooms again and leave it there a week or ten days to\r\nspile, I\'ll speak about it to the doctor. Now you step out o\' my way\r\nlike a good girl. I don\'t know whether you or the cat\'s the worst for\r\ngettin\' before me when I\'m in a drive. I\'ll set him out somethin\' to\r\neat, and then I\'m goin\' to meetin\' if the skies fall."\r\n\r\nNan meekly obeyed directions, and with a sense of guilt concerning the\r\ndeserted posies went to hover about the study door after the plates\r\nwere arranged, instead of braving further the stormy atmosphere of the\r\nkitchen. Marilla\'s lamp had shone in so that there had been light\r\nenough in the dining-room, but the study was quite dark except where\r\nthere was one spark at the end of the doctor\'s half-finished cigar,\r\nwhich was alternately dim and bright like the revolving lantern of a\r\nlighthouse.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the smoker rose, and with his most considerate and\r\nconciliatory tone asked Marilla for the study lamp, but Nan heard, and\r\nran on tiptoe and presently brought it in from the kitchen, holding it\r\ncarefully with both hands and walking slowly. She apparently had no\r\nthought beyond her errand, but she was brimful of eagerness to see the\r\nunexpected guest; for guests were by no means frequent, and since she\r\nhad really become aware of a great outside world beyond the boundaries\r\nof Oldfields she welcomed the sight of any messengers.\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie hastily pushed away some books from the lamp\'s place; and\r\nnoticing that his visitor looked at Nan with surprise, quickly\r\nexplained that this little girl had come to take care of him, and bade\r\nNan speak to Dr. Ferris. Whereupon her bravery was sorely tried, but\r\nnot overcome, and afterward she sat down in her own little chair,\r\nquite prepared to be hospitable. As she heard a sound of water being\r\npoured into a pitcher in the best room upstairs, she was ready to\r\nlaugh if there had been anybody to laugh with, and presently Marilla\r\nappeared at the door with the announcement that there was some tea\r\nwaiting in the dining-room, after which and before anybody had thought\r\nof moving, the side gate clacked resolutely, and Marilla, looking more\r\nprim and unruffled than usual, sped forth to the enjoyment of her\r\nFriday evening privileges.\r\n\r\nNan followed the gentlemen to the dining-room not knowing whether she\r\nwere wanted or not, but feeling quite assured when it was ascertained\r\nthat neither sugar nor teaspoons had been provided. The little feast\r\nlooked somewhat meagre, and the doctor spoke irreverently of his\r\nhousekeeper and proceeded to abstract a jar of her best strawberry jam\r\nfrom the convenient store-closet, and to collect other articles of\r\nfood which seemed to him to be inviting, however inappropriate to the\r\noccasion. The guest would have none of the jam, but Dr. Leslie cut a\r\nslice of the loaf of bread for himself and one for Nan, though it had\r\nalready waned beyond its last quarter, and nobody knew what would\r\nhappen if there were no toast at breakfast time. Marilla would never\r\nknow what a waste of jam was spread upon these slices either, but she\r\nwas a miser only with the best preserves, and so our friends reveled\r\nin their stolen pleasure, and were as merry together as heart could\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nNan thought it very strange when she found that the doctor and his\r\nguest had been at school together, for the stranger seemed so old and\r\nworn. They were talking about other classmates at first, and she sat\r\nstill to listen, until the hour of Marilla\'s return drew near and Dr.\r\nLeslie prudently returned to his own uninvaded apartment. Nan was\r\ntold, to her sorrow, that it was past her bed-time and as she stopped\r\nto say good-night, candle in hand, a few moments afterward, the doctor\r\nstooped to kiss her with unusual tenderness, and a little later, when\r\nshe was safe in her small bedroom and under the coverlet which was\r\nMarilla\'s glory, having been knit the winter before in an intricate\r\npattern, she almost shook with fear at the sound of its maker\'s\r\nvengeful footsteps in the lower room. It is to be hoped that the\r\ninfluence of the meeting had been very good, and that one of its\r\nattendants had come home equal to great demands upon her fortitude and\r\npatience. Nan could not help wishing she had thought to put away the\r\njam, and she wondered how Marilla would treat them all in the morning.\r\nBut, to do that worthy woman justice, she was mild and considerate,\r\nand outdid herself in the breakfast that was set forth in the guest\'s\r\nhonor, and Dr. Ferris thought he could do no less than to add to his\r\nmorning greeting the question why she was not growing old like the\r\nrest of them, which, though not answered, was pleasantly received.\r\n\r\nThe host and guest talked very late the night before, and told each\r\nother many things. Dr. Leslie had somewhat unwillingly undertaken the\r\ncountry practice which had grown dearer to him with every year, but\r\nthere were family reasons why he had decided to stay in Oldfields for\r\na few months at least, and though it was not long before he was left\r\nalone, not only by the father and mother whose only child he was, but\r\nby his wife and child, he felt less and less inclination to break the\r\nold ties and transplant himself to some more prominent position of the\r\nmedical world. The leisure he often had at certain seasons of the year\r\nwas spent in the studies which always delighted him, and little by\r\nlittle he gained great repute among his professional brethren. He was\r\na scholar and a thinker in other than medical philosophies, and most\r\npersons who knew anything of him thought it a pity that he should be\r\nburying himself alive, as they were pleased to term his devotion to\r\nhis provincial life. His rare excursions to the cities gave more\r\npleasure to other men than to himself, however, in these later years,\r\nand he laughingly proclaimed himself to be growing rusty and behind\r\nthe times to Dr. Ferris, who smiled indulgently, and did not take the\r\ntrouble to contradict so untrue and preposterous an assertion.\r\n\r\nIf one man had been a stayer at home; a vegetable nature, as Dr.\r\nLeslie had gone on to say, which has no power to change its locality\r\nor to better itself by choosing another and more adequate or\r\nstimulating soil; the other had developed the opposite extreme of\r\ncharacter, being by nature a rover. From the medical school he had\r\nentered at once upon the duties of a naval appointment, and after he\r\nhad become impatient of its routine of practice and its check upon his\r\nfreedom, he had gone, always with some sufficient and useful object,\r\nto one far country after another. Lately he had spent an unusual\r\nnumber of consecutive months in Japan, which was still unfamiliar even\r\nto most professional travelers, and he had come back to America\r\nenthusiastic and full of plans for many enterprises which his shrewd,\r\nbut not very persistent brain had conceived. The two old friends were\r\ndelighted to see each other, but they took this long-deferred meeting\r\nas calmly as if they were always next-door neighbors. It was a most\r\ninteresting thing that while they led such different lives and took\r\nsuch apparently antagonistic routes of progression, they were pretty\r\nsure to arrive at the same conclusion, though it might appear\r\notherwise to a listener who knew them both slightly.\r\n\r\n"And who is the little girl?" asked Dr. Ferris, who had refused his\r\nentertainer\'s cigars and produced a pipe from one pocket, after having\r\ndrawn a handful of curious small jade figures from another and pushed\r\nthem along the edge of the study table, without comment, for his\r\nfriend to look at. Some of them were so finely carved that they looked\r\nlike a heap of grotesque insects struggling together as they lay\r\nthere, but though Dr. Leslie\'s eyes brightened as he glanced at them,\r\nhe gave no other sign of interest at that time, and answered his\r\nguest\'s question instead.\r\n\r\n"She is a ward of mine," he said; "she was left quite alone by the\r\ndeath of her grandmother some months ago, and so I brought her here."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t often that I forget a face," said Dr. Ferris, "but I have\r\nbeen trying to think what association I can possibly have with that\r\nchild. I remember at last; she looks like a young assistant surgeon\r\nwho was on the old frigate Fortune with me just before I left the\r\nservice. I don\'t think he was from this part of the country though; I\r\nnever heard what became of him."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it was her father; I believe he made a voyage or two,"\r\nsaid Dr. Leslie, much interested. "Do you know anything more about\r\nhim? you always remember everything, Ferris."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered the guest, slowly puffing away at his pipe. "Yes, he\r\nwas a very bright fellow, with a great gift at doctoring, but he was\r\nwillful, full of queer twists and fancies, the marry in haste and\r\nrepent at his leisure sort of young man."\r\n\r\n"Exactly what he did, I suppose," interrupted the host. "Only his\r\nleisure was fortunately postponed to the next world, for the most\r\npart; he died very young."\r\n\r\n"I used to think it a great pity that he had not settled himself\r\nashore in a good city practice," continued Dr. Ferris. "He had a great\r\nknack at pleasing people and making friends, and he was always\r\nspoiling for want of work. I was ready enough to shirk my part of\r\nthat, you may be sure, but if you start with a reasonably healthy set\r\nof men, crew and officers, and keep good discipline, and have no\r\naccidents on the voyage, an old-fashioned ship-master\'s kit of\r\nnumbered doses is as good as anything on board a man-of-war in time of\r\npeace. You have mild cases that result from over-heating or\r\nover-eating, and sometimes a damaged finger to dress, or a tooth to\r\npull. I used to tell young Prince that it was a pity one of the men\r\nwouldn\'t let himself be chopped to pieces and fitted together again to\r\ngive us a little amusement."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the name," announced Nan\'s guardian with great satisfaction.\r\n"This is a very small world; we are all within hail of each other. I\r\ndare say when we get to Heaven there will not be a stranger to make\r\nfriends with."\r\n\r\n"I could give you more wonderful proofs of that than you would be\r\nlikely to believe," responded the surgeon. "But tell me how you\r\nhappened to have anything to do with the child; did Prince wander into\r\nthis neighborhood?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, but he fell in love with a young girl who was brought up\r\non one of the farms just out of the village. She was a strange\r\ncharacter, a handsome creature, with a touch of foolish ambition, and\r\nsoon grew impatient of the routine of home life. I believe that she\r\nwent away at first to work in one of the factories in Lowell, and\r\nafterward she drifted to Dunport, where young Prince\'s people lived,\r\nand I dare say it was when he came home from that very voyage you knew\r\nof that he saw her and married her. She worked in a dressmaker\'s shop,\r\nand worked very well too, but she had offended his sister to begin\r\nwith, one day when she was finding fault with some work that had been\r\ndone for her, and so there was no end of trouble, and the young man\r\nhad a great battle at home, and the more he was fought the less\r\ninclined he was to yield, and at last off he went to be married, and\r\nnever came home again until he died. It was a wretched story; he only\r\nlived two years, and they went from one place to another, and finally\r\nthe end came in some Western town. He had not been happy with his\r\nwife, and they quarreled from time to time, and he asked to be brought\r\nback to Dunport and buried. This child was only a baby, and the\r\nPrinces begged her mother to give her up, and used every means to try\r\nto make friends, and to do what was right. But I have always thought\r\nthere was blame on both sides. At any rate the wife was insolent and\r\nunruly, and went flinging out of the house as soon as the funeral was\r\nover. I don\'t know what became of them for a while, but it always\r\nseemed to me as if poor Adeline must have had a touch of insanity,\r\nwhich faded away as consumption developed itself. Her mother\'s people\r\nwere a fine, honest race, self-reliant and energetic, but there is a\r\nvery bad streak on the other side. I have heard that she was seen\r\nbegging somewhere, but I am not sure that it is true; at any rate she\r\nwould neither come here to her own home nor listen to any plea from\r\nher husband\'s family, and at last came back to the farm one night like\r\na ghost, carrying the child in her arms across the fields; all in rags\r\nand tatters, both of them. She confessed to me that she had meant to\r\ndrown herself and little Nan together. I could never understand why\r\nshe went down so fast. I know that she had been drinking. Some people\r\nmight say that it was the scorn of her husband\'s relatives, but that\r\nis all nonsense, and I have no doubt she and the young man might have\r\ndone very well if this hadn\'t spoiled all their chances at the outset.\r\nShe was quite unbalanced and a strange, wild creature, very handsome\r\nin her girlhood, but morally undeveloped. It was impossible not to\r\nhave a liking for her. I remember her when she was a baby."\r\n\r\n"And yet people talk about the prosaic New England life!" exclaimed\r\nDr. Ferris. "I wonder where I could match such a story as that, though\r\nI dare say that you know a dozen others. I tell you, Leslie, that for\r\nintense, self-centred, smouldering volcanoes of humanity, New England\r\ncannot be matched the world over. It\'s like the regions in Iceland\r\nthat are full of geysers. I don\'t know whether it is the inheritance\r\nfrom those people who broke away from the old countries, and who ought\r\nto be matched to tremendous circumstances of life, but now and then\r\nthere comes an amazingly explosive and uncontrollable temperament that\r\ngoes all to pieces from its own conservation and accumulation of\r\nforce. By and by you will have all blown up,--you quiet descendants of\r\nthe Pilgrims and Puritans, and have let off your superfluous\r\nwickedness like blizzards; and when the blizzards of each family have\r\nspent themselves you will grow dull and sober, and all on a level, and\r\nbe free from the troubles of a transition state. Now, you\'re neither a\r\nnew country nor an old one. You ought to see something of the older\r\ncivilizations to understand what peace of mind is. Unless some\r\nimportation of explosive material from the westward stirs them up, one\r\ncentury is made the pattern for the next. But it is perfectly\r\nwonderful what this climate does for people who come to it,--a south\r\nof Ireland fellow, for instance, who has let himself be rained on and\r\nthen waited for the sun to dry him again, and has grubbed a little in\r\na bit of ground, just enough to hint to it that it had better be\r\nmaking a crop of potatoes for him. I always expect to see the gorse\r\nand daisies growing on the old people\'s heads to match the cabins. But\r\nthey come over here and forget their idleness, and in a week or two\r\nthe east winds are making them work, and thrashing them if they are\r\nslow, worse than any slave-driver who ever cracked his whip-lash. I\r\nwonder how you stand it; I do, indeed! I can\'t take an afternoon nap\r\nor have my coffee in bed of a morning without thinking I must put into\r\nport at the next church to be preached at."\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie laughed a little and shook his head gently. "It\'s very well\r\nfor you to talk, Ferris," he said, "since you have done more work than\r\nany man I know. And I find this neighborhood entirely placid; one bit\r\nof news will last us a fortnight. I dare say Marilla will let\r\neverybody know that you have come to town, and have explained why she\r\nwas ten minutes late, even to the minister."\r\n\r\n"How about the little girl herself?" asked the guest presently; "she\r\nseems well combined, and likely, as they used to say when I was a\r\nboy."\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie resumed the subject willingly: "So far as I can see, she\r\nhas the good qualities of all her ancestors without the bad ones. Her\r\nmother\'s mother was an old fashioned country woman of the best stock.\r\nOf course she resented what she believed to be her daughter\'s wrongs,\r\nand refused to have anything to do with her son-in-law\'s family, and\r\nkept the child as carefully as possible from any knowledge of them.\r\nLittle Nan was not strong at first, but I insisted that she should be\r\nallowed to run free out of doors. It seems to me that up to seven or\r\neight years of age children are simply bundles of inheritances, and I\r\ncan see the traits of one ancestor after another; but a little later\r\nthan the usual time she began to assert her own individuality, and has\r\ngrown capitally well in mind and body ever since. There is an amusing\r\ntrace of the provincial self-reliance and self-respect and farmer-like\r\ndignity, added to a quick instinct, and tact and ready courtesy, which\r\nmust have come from the other side of her ancestry. She is more a\r\nchild of the soil than any country child I know, and yet she would not\r\nput a city household to shame. She has seen nothing of the world of\r\ncourse, but you can see she isn\'t like the usual village school-girl.\r\nThere is one thing quite remarkable. I believe she has grown up as\r\nnaturally as a plant grows, not having been clipped back or forced in\r\nany unnatural direction. If ever a human being were untrammeled and\r\nleft alone to see what will come of it, it is this child. And I will\r\nown I am very much interested to see what will appear later."\r\n\r\nThe navy surgeon\'s eyes twinkled at this enthusiasm, but he asked\r\nsoberly what seemed to be our heroine\'s bent, so far as could be\r\ndiscovered, and laughed outright when he was gravely told that it was\r\na medical bent; a surprising understanding of things pertaining to\r\nthat most delightful profession.\r\n\r\n"But you surely don\'t mean to let her risk her happiness in following\r\nthat career?" Dr. Ferris inquired with feigned anxiety for his answer.\r\n"You surely aren\'t going to sacrifice that innocent creature to a\r\ntheory! I know it\'s a theory; last time I was here, you could think of\r\nnothing but hypnotism or else the action of belladonna in congestion\r\nand inflammation of the brain;" and he left his very comfortable chair\r\nsuddenly, with a burst of laughter, and began to walk up and down the\r\nroom. "She has no relatives to protect her, and I consider it a\r\nshocking case of a guardian\'s inhumanity. Grown up naturally indeed! I\r\ndon\'t doubt that you supplied her with Bell\'s \'Anatomy\' for a\r\npicture-book and made her say over the names of the eight little bones\r\nof her wrist, instead of \'This little pig went to market.\'"\r\n\r\n"I only hope that you\'ll live to grow up yourself, Ferris," said his\r\nentertainer, "you\'ll certainly be an ornament to your generation. What\r\na boy you are! I should think you would feel as old as Methuselah by\r\nthis time, after having rattled from one place to the next all these\r\nyears. Don\'t you begin to get tired?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t believe I do," replied Dr. Ferris, lending himself to\r\nthis new turn of the conversation, but not half satisfied with the\r\nnumber of his jokes. "I used to be afraid I should, and so I tried to\r\nsee everything I could of the world before my enthusiasm began to\r\ncool. And as for rattling to the next place, as you say, you show\r\nyourself to be no traveler by nature, or you wouldn\'t speak so\r\nslightingly. It is extremely dangerous to make long halts. I could cry\r\nwith homesickness at the thought of the towns I have spent more than a\r\nmonth in; they are like the people one knows; if you see them once,\r\nyou go away satisfied, and you can bring them to mind afterward, and\r\nthink how they looked or just where it was you met them,--out of doors\r\nor at the club. But if you live with those people, and get fond of\r\nthem, and have a thousand things to remember, you get more pain than\r\npleasure out of it when you go away. And one can\'t be everywhere at\r\nonce, so if you\'re going to care for things tremendously, you had\r\nbetter stay in one town altogether. No, give me a week or two, and\r\nthen I\'ve something calling me to the next place; somebody to talk\r\nwith or a book to see, and off I go. Yet, I\'ve done a good bit of work\r\nin my day after all. Did you see that paper of mine in the \'Lancet\'\r\nabout some experiments I made when I was last in India with those\r\ntree-growing jugglers? and I worked out some curious things about the\r\nmathematics of music on this last voyage home! Why, I thought it would\r\ntear my heart in two when I came away. I should have grown to look\r\nlike the people, and you might have happened to find a likeness of me\r\non a tea plate after another year or two. I made all my plans one day\r\nto stay another winter, and next day at eleven o\'clock I was steaming\r\ndown the harbor. But there was a poor young lad I had taken a liking\r\nfor, an English boy, who was badly off after an accident and needed\r\nsomebody to look after him. I thought the best thing I could do was to\r\nbring him home. Are you going to fit your ward for general practice\r\nor for a specialty?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; that\'ll be for the young person herself to decide,"\r\nsaid Dr. Leslie good-humoredly. "But she\'s showing a real talent for\r\nmedical matters. It is quite unconscious for the most part, but I find\r\nthat she understands a good deal already, and she sat here all the\r\nafternoon last week with one of my old medical dictionaries. I\r\ncouldn\'t help looking over her shoulder as I went by, and she was\r\nreading about fevers, if you please, as if it were a story-book. I\r\ndidn\'t think it was worth while to tell her we understood things\r\nbetter nowadays, and didn\'t think it best to bleed as much as old Dr.\r\nRush recommended."\r\n\r\n"You\'re like a hen with one chicken, Leslie," said the friend, still\r\npacing to and fro. "But seriously, I like your notion of her having\r\ncome to this of her own accord. Most of us are grown in the shapes\r\nthat society and family preference and prejudice fasten us into, and\r\ndon\'t find out until we are well toward middle life that we should\r\nhave done a great deal better at something else. Our vocations are\r\nlikely enough to be illy chosen, since few persons are fit to choose\r\nthem for us, and we are at the most unreasonable stage of life when we\r\nchoose them for ourselves. And what the Lord made some people for,\r\nnobody ever can understand; some of us are for use and more are for\r\nwaste, like the flowers. I am in such a hurry to know what the next\r\nworld is like that I can hardly wait to get to it. Good heavens! we\r\nlive here in our familiar fashion, going at a jog-trot pace round our\r\nlittle circles, with only a friend or two to speak with who understand\r\nus, and a pipe and a jack-knife and a few books and some old clothes,\r\nand please ourselves by thinking we know the universe! Not a soul of\r\nus can tell what it is that sends word to our little fingers to move\r\nthemselves back and forward."\r\n\r\n"We\'re sure of two things at any rate," said Dr. Leslie, "love to God\r\nand love to man. And though I have lived here all my days, I have\r\nlearned some truths just as well as if I had gone about with you, or\r\neven been to the next world and come back. I have seen too many lives\r\ngo to pieces, and too many dissatisfied faces, and I have heard too\r\nmany sorrowful confessions from these country death-beds I have\r\nwatched beside, one after another, for twenty or thirty years. And if\r\nI can help one good child to work with nature and not against it, and\r\nto follow the lines marked out for her, and she turns out useful and\r\nintelligent, and keeps off the rocks of mistaking her duty, I shall be\r\nmore than glad. I don\'t care whether it\'s a man\'s work or a woman\'s\r\nwork; if it is hers I\'m going to help her the very best way I can. I\r\ndon\'t talk to her of course; she\'s much too young; but I watch her and\r\nmean to put the things in her way that she seems to reach out for and\r\ntry to find. She is going to be very practical, for her hands can\r\nalmost always work out her ideas already. I like to see her take hold\r\nof things, and I like to see her walk and the way she lifts her feet\r\nand puts them down again. I must say, Ferris, there is a great\r\nsatisfaction in finding a human being once in a while that has some\r\nuse of itself."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right!" said Dr. Ferris; "but don\'t be disappointed when she\'s\r\nten years older if she picks out a handsome young man and thinks there\r\nis nothing like housekeeping. Have you taken a look at my pocketful of\r\nheathen idols there yet? I don\'t think you\'ve ever seen their mates."\r\n\r\nThe stayer at home smiled as if he understood his friend\'s quiet bit\r\nof pleasantry, and reached for one of the treasures, but folded it in\r\nhis hand without looking at it and seemed to be lost in meditation.\r\nThe surgeon concluded that he had had enough exercise and laid himself\r\ndown on the wide sofa at the end of the room, from whence he could\r\nwatch his companion\'s face. He clasped his hands under his head and\r\nlooked eager and interested. He had grown to have something of the\r\nappearance of a foreigner, as people often do who have spent much time\r\nin eastern countries. The two friends were silent for some minutes,\r\nuntil an impatient voice roused Dr. Leslie from his reflections.\r\n\r\n"It always makes me covet my neighbor\'s wits when I see you!"\r\nannounced the wanderer. "If I settled myself into a respectable\r\npractice I should be obliged to march with the army of doctors who\r\ncarry a great array of small weapons, and who find out what is the\r\nmatter with their patients after all sorts of experiment and\r\npainstaking analysis, and comparing the results of their thermometers\r\nand microscopes with scientific books of reference. After I have done\r\nall that, you know, if I have had good luck I shall come to exactly\r\nwhat you can say before you have been with a sick man five minutes.\r\nYou have the true gift for doctoring, you need no medical dictator,\r\nand whatever you study and whatever comes to you in the way of\r\ninstruction simply ministers to your intuition. It grows to be a\r\nwonderful second-sight in such a man as you. I don\'t believe you\r\ninvestigate a case and treat it as a botanist does a strange flower,\r\nonce a month. You know without telling yourself what the matter is,\r\nand what the special difference is, and the relative dangers of this\r\ncase and one apparently just like it across the street, and you could\r\ndo this before you were out of the hospitals. I remember you!" and\r\nafter a few vigorous puffs of smoke he went on; "It is all very well\r\nfor the rest of the men to be proud of their book learning, but they\r\ndon\'t even try to follow nature, as Sydenham did, who followed no man.\r\nI believe such study takes one to more theory and scientific digest\r\nrather than to more skill. It is all very well to know how to draw\r\nmaps when one gets lost on a dark night, or even to begin with\r\nastronomical calculations and come down to a chemical analysis of the\r\nmud you stand in, but hang me if I wouldn\'t rather have the instinct\r\nof a dog who can go straight home across a bit of strange country. A\r\nman has no right to be a doctor if he doesn\'t simply make everything\r\nbend to his work of getting sick people well, and of trying to remedy\r\nthe failures of strength that come from misuse or inheritance or\r\nignorance. The anatomists and the pathologists have their place, but\r\nwe must look to the living to learn the laws of life, not to the dead.\r\nA wreck shows you where the reef is, perhaps, but not how to manage a\r\nship in the offing. The men who make it their business to write the\r\nbooks and the men who make it their business to follow them aren\'t the\r\nones for successful practice."\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie smiled, and looked over his shoulder at his beloved library\r\nshelves, as if he wished to assure the useful volumes of his continued\r\naffection and respect, and said quietly, as if to beg the displeased\r\nsurgeon\'s patience with his brethren: "They go on, poor fellows,\r\nstudying the symptoms and never taking it in that the life power is at\r\nfault. I see more and more plainly that we ought to strengthen and\r\nbalance the whole system, and aid nature to make the sick man well\r\nagain. It is nature that does it after all, and diseases are oftener\r\neffects of illness than causes. But the young practitioners must\r\nfollow the text-books a while until they have had enough experience to\r\nopen their eyes to observe and have learned to think for themselves. I\r\ndon\'t know which is worse; too much routine or no study at all. I was\r\ntrying the other day to count up the different treatments of pneumonia\r\nthat have been in fashion in our day; there must be seven or eight,\r\nand I am only afraid the next thing will be a sort of skepticism and\r\ncontempt of remedies. Dr. Johnson said long ago that physicians were a\r\nclass of men who put bodies of which they knew little into bodies of\r\nwhich they knew less, but certainly this isn\'t the fault of the\r\nmedicines altogether; you and I know well enough they are often most\r\nstupidly used. If we blindly follow the medical dictators, as you call\r\nthem, and spend our treatment on the effects instead of the causes,\r\nwhat success can we expect? We do want more suggestions from the men\r\nat work, but I suppose this is the same with every business. The\r\npractical medical men are the juries who settle all the theories of\r\nthe hour, as they meet emergencies day after day."\r\n\r\n"The men who have the true gift for their work," said Dr. Ferris\r\nimpatiently. "I hadn\'t the conscience to go on myself, that\'s why I\r\nresigned, you know. I can talk about it, but I am not a good workman.\r\nBut if there are going to be doctors in the next world, I wish I might\r\nbe lucky enough to be equal to such a heavenly business. You thought I\r\ndidn\'t care enough about the profession to go on, but it wasn\'t so. Do\r\npush your little girl ahead if she has the real fitness. I suppose it\r\nis a part of your endowment that you can distinguish the capacities\r\nand tendencies of health as well as illness; and there\'s one thing\r\ncertain, the world cannot afford to do without the workmen who are\r\nmasters of their business by divine right."\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie was looking at the jade-stone gods. "I suppose the poor\r\nfellows who chipped out these treasures of yours may have thought they\r\nwere really putting a visible piece of Heaven within their neighbors\'\r\nreach," he said. "We can\'t get used to the fact that whatever truly\r\nbelongs to the next world is not visible in this, and that there is\r\nidol-making and worshiping forever going on. When we let ourselves\r\nforget to educate our faith and our spiritual intellects, and lose\r\nsight of our relation and dependence upon the highest informing\r\nstrength, we are trying to move our machinery by some inferior motive\r\npower. We worship our tools and beg success of them instead of\r\nremembering that we are all apprentices to the great Master of our own\r\nand every man\'s craft. It is the great ideas of our work that we need,\r\nand the laws of its truths. We shall be more intelligent by and by\r\nabout making the best of ourselves; our possibilities are infinitely\r\nbeyond what most people even dream. Spiritual laziness and physical\r\nlaziness together keep us just this side of sound sleep most of the\r\ntime. Perhaps you think it is a proper season for one at least?"\r\n\r\n"Dear me, no!" said Dr. Ferris, who was evidently quite wide awake.\r\n"Do you remember how well Buckle says that the feminine intellect is\r\nthe higher, and that the great geniuses of the world have possessed\r\nit? The gift of intuition reaches directly towards the truth, and it\r\nis only reasoning by deduction that can take flight into the upper air\r\nof life and certainty. You remember what he says about that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. Leslie. "Yes, it isn\'t a thing one easily forgets. But\r\nI have long believed that the powers of Christ were but the higher\r\npowers of our common humanity. We recognize them dimly now and then,\r\nbut few of us dare to say so yet. The world moves very slowly, doesn\'t\r\nit? If Christ were perfect man, He could hardly tell us to follow Him\r\nand be like Him, and yet know all the while that it was quite\r\nimpossible, because a difference in his gifts made his character an\r\nunapproachable one to ours. We don\'t amount to anything, simply\r\nbecause we won\'t understand that we must receive the strength of\r\nHeaven into our souls; that it depends upon our degree of receptivity,\r\nand our using the added power that comes in that way; not in our\r\ntaking our few tools, and our self-esteem and satisfaction with\r\nourselves, and doing our little tricks like dancing dogs; proud\r\nbecause the other dogs can do one less than we, or only bark and walk\r\nabout on their four legs. It is our souls that make our bodies worth\r\nanything, and the life of the soul doesn\'t come from its activity, or\r\nany performance of its own. Those things are only the results and the\r\nsigns of life, not the causes of it."\r\n\r\n"Christ in us, the hope of glory," said the other doctor gravely, "and\r\nChrist\'s glory was his usefulness and gift for helping others; I\r\nbelieve there\'s less quackery in our profession than any other, but it\r\nis amazing how we bungle at it. I wonder how you will get on with your\r\nlittle girl? If people didn\'t have theories of life of their own, or\r\nwouldn\'t go exactly the wrong way, it would be easier to offer\r\nassistance; but where one person takes a right direction of his own\r\naccord, there are twenty who wander to and fro."\r\n\r\n"I may as well confess to you," he continued presently, "that I have\r\nhad a _prot\xe9g\xe9_ myself, but I don\'t look for much future joy in\r\nwatching the development of my plots. He has taken affairs into his\r\nown hands, and I dare say it is much better for him, for if I had\r\ncaught him young enough, I should have wished him to run the gauntlet\r\nof all the professions, not to speak of the arts and sciences. He was\r\na clever young fellow; I saw him married the day before I left\r\nEngland. His wife was the daughter of a curate, and he the younger son\r\nof a younger son, and it was a love affair worth two or three\r\nstory-books. It came to be a question of money alone. I had known the\r\nboy the year before in Bombay and chanced to find him one day in the\r\nMarine Hospital at Nagasaki. We had been up into the interior\r\ntogether. He was recommended to me as a sort of secretary and\r\nassistant and knew more than I did about most things. When he caught\r\nsight of me he cried like a baby, and I sat down and heard what the\r\ntrouble was, for I had let him go off with somebody who could give him\r\na good salary,--a government man of position, and I thought poor Bob\r\nwould be put in the way of something better. Dear me, the climate was\r\nkilling him before my eyes, and I took passage for both of us on the\r\nnext day\'s steamer. When I got him home I turned my bank account into\r\na cheque and tucked it into his pocket, and told him to marry his wife\r\nand settle down and be respectable and forget such a wandering old\r\nfellow as I."\r\n\r\nThe listener made a little sound of mingled admiration and disgust.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re the same piece of improvidence as ever! I wonder if you\r\nworked your passage over to Boston, or came as a stowaway? Well, I\'m\r\nglad to give you house-room, and, to tell the truth, I was wondering\r\nhow I should get on to-morrow without somebody to help me in a piece\r\nof surgery. My neighbors are not very skillful, but they\'re good men\r\nevery one of them, unless it\'s old Jackson, who knows no more about\r\nthe practice of medicine than a turtle knows about the nearest fixed\r\nstar. Ferris! I don\'t wonder at your giving away the last cent you had\r\nin the world, I only wonder that you had a cent to give. I hope the\r\nyoung man was grateful, that\'s all, only I\'m not sure I like his\r\ntaking it."\r\n\r\n"He thought I had enough more, I dare say. He said so much I couldn\'t\r\nstand his nonsense. He\'ll use it better than I could," said the guest\r\nbriefly. "As I said, I couldn\'t bring him up; in the first place I\r\nhaven\'t the patience, and beside, it wouldn\'t be just to him. But you\r\nmust let me know how you get on with your project; I shall make you a\r\nday\'s visit once in six months."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be good luck," responded the cheerful host. "Now that I am\r\ngrowing old I find I wish for company oftener; just the right man, you\r\nknow, to come in for an hour or two late in the evening to have a\r\ncigar, and not say a word if he doesn\'t feel like it."\r\n\r\nThe two friends were very comfortable together; the successive cigars\r\nburnt themselves out slowly, and the light of the great lamp was\r\nbright in the room. Here and there a tinge of red shone out on the\r\nbacks of the books that stood close together in the high cases. There\r\nwas an old engraving or two, and in one corner a solemn bronze figure\r\nof Dante, thin and angular, as if he had risen from his coffin to take\r\na last look at this world. Marilla had often spoken of him\r\ndisrespectfully, and had suggested many other ornaments which might be\r\nbrought to take his place, but the doctor had never acted upon her\r\nsuggestions. From the corner of one book-case there hung a huge wasp\'s\r\nnest, and over the mantel-shelf, which was only wide enough for some\r\ncigar boxes and a little clock and a few vials of medicines, was a\r\nrack where three or four riding whips and a curious silver bit and\r\nsome long-stemmed pipes found unmolested quarters; and in one corner\r\nwere some walking sticks and a fishing rod or two which had a very\r\nancient unused look. There was a portrait of Dr. Leslie\'s grandfather\r\nopposite the fire-place; a good-humored looking old gentleman who had\r\nbeen the most famous of the Oldfields ministers. The study-table was\r\nwide and long, but it was well covered with a miscellaneous array of\r\nits owner\'s smaller possessions, and the quick-eyed visitor smiled as\r\nhe caught sight of Nan\'s new copy of Miss Edgeworth\'s "Parent\'s\r\nAssistant" lying open and face downward on the top of an instrument\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMarilla did not hear the doctor and his guest tramp up to bed until\r\nvery late at night, and though she had tried to keep awake she had\r\nbeen obliged to take a nap first and then wake up again to get the\r\nbenefit of such an aggravating occasion. "I\'m not going to fret myself\r\ntrying to make one of my baked omelets in the morning," she assured\r\nherself, "they\'ll keep breakfast waiting three quarters of an hour,\r\nand it would fall flat sure\'s the world, and the doctor\'s got to ride\r\nto all p\'ints of the compass to-morrow, too."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nACROSS THE STREET\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say why the village of Oldfields should have\r\nbeen placed in the least attractive part of the township, if one were\r\nnot somewhat familiar with the law of growth of country communities.\r\nThe first settlers, being pious kindred of the Pilgrims, were mindful\r\nof the necessity of a meeting-house, and the place for it was chosen\r\nwith reference to the convenience of most of the worshipers. Then the\r\nparson was given a parsonage and a tract of glebe land somewhere in\r\nthe vicinity of his pulpit, and since this was the centre of social\r\nattraction, the blacksmith built his shop at the nearest cross-road.\r\nAnd when some enterprising citizen became possessed of an idea that\r\nthere were traders enough toiling to and fro on the rough highways to\r\nthe nearest larger village to make it worth his while to be an\r\ninterceptor, the first step was taken toward a local centre of\r\ncommerce, and the village was fairly begun. It had not yet reached a\r\nremarkable size, though there was a time-honored joke because an\r\nenthusiastic old woman had said once, when four or five houses and a\r\nnew meeting-house were being built all in one summer, that she\r\nexpected now that she might live to see Oldfields a seaport town.\r\nThere had been a great excitement over the second meeting-house, to\r\nwhich the conservative faction had strongly objected, but, after the\r\nradicals had once gained the day, other innovations passed without\r\npublic challenge. The old First Parish Church was very white and held\r\naloft an imposing steeple, and strangers were always commiserated if\r\nthey had to leave town without the opportunity of seeing its front by\r\nmoonlight. Behind this, and beyond a green which had been the\r\nplayground of many generations of boys and girls, was a long row of\r\nhorse-sheds, where the farmers\' horses enjoyed such part of their\r\nSunday rest as was permitted them after bringing heavy loads of rural\r\nparishioners to their public devotions. The Sunday church-going was by\r\nno means so carefully observed in these days as in former ones, when\r\ndisinclination was anything but a received excuse. In Parson\r\nLeslie\'s--the doctor\'s grandfather\'s--day, it would have condemned a\r\nman or woman to the well-merited reproof of their acquaintances. And\r\nindeed most parishioners felt deprived of a great pleasure when, after\r\na week of separation from society, of a routine of prosaic farm-work,\r\nthey were prevented from seeing their friends parade into church, from\r\nhearing the psalm-singing and the sermon, and listening to the news\r\nafterward. It was like going to mass and going to the theatre and the\r\nopera, and making a round of short calls, and having an outing in\r\none\'s own best clothes to see other people\'s, all rolled into one;\r\nbeside which, there was (and is) a superstitious expectation of good\r\nluck in the coming week if the religious obligations were carefully\r\nfulfilled. So many of the old ideas of the efficacy of ecclesiasticism\r\nstill linger, most of them by no means unlawfully. The elder people of\r\nNew England are as glad to have their clergyman visit them in their\r\nlast days as if he granted them absolution and extreme unction. The\r\nold traditions survive in our instincts, although our present opinions\r\nhave long since ticketed many thoughts and desires and customs as out\r\nof date and quite exploded.\r\n\r\nWe go so far in our vigorous observance of the first commandment, and\r\nour fear of worshiping strange gods, that sometimes we are in danger\r\nof forgetting that we must worship God himself. And worship is\r\nsomething different from a certain sort of constant church-going, or\r\nfrom even trying to be conformers and to keep our own laws and our\r\nneighbors\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause an old-fashioned town like Oldfields grows so slowly and with\r\nsuch extreme deliberation, is the very reason it seems to have such a\r\ndelightful completeness when it has entered fairly upon its maturity.\r\nIt is possessed of kindred virtues to a winter pear, which may be\r\nunattractive during its preparatory stages, but which takes time to\r\ngather from the ground and from the air a pleasant and rewarding\r\nindividuality and sweetness. The towns which are built in a hurry can\r\nbe left in a hurry without a bit of regret, and if it is the fate or\r\nfortune of the elder villages to find themselves the foundation upon\r\nwhich modern manufacturing communities rear their thinly built houses\r\nand workshops, and their quickly disintegrating communities of people,\r\nthe weaknesses of these are more glaring and hopeless in the contrast.\r\nThe hurry to make money and do much work, and the ambition to do good\r\nwork, war with each other, but, as Longfellow has said, the lie is the\r\nhurrying second-hand of the clock, and the truth the slower hand that\r\nwaits and marks the hour. The New England that built itself houses a\r\nhundred years ago was far less oppressed by competition and by other\r\nquestions with which the enormous increase of population is worrying\r\nits younger citizens. And the overgrown Oldfields that increase now,\r\nstreet by street, were built then a single steady sound-timbered house\r\nat a time, and all the neighbors watched them rise, and knew where the\r\nplanks were sawn, and where the chimney bricks were burnt.\r\n\r\nIn these days when Anna Prince was young and had lately come to live\r\nin the doctor\'s square house, with the three peaked windows in the\r\nroof, and the tall box borders and lilac bushes in its neat front\r\nyard, Oldfields was just beginning to wake from a fifty years\'\r\narchitectural sleep, and rub its eyes, and see what was thought about\r\na smart little house with a sharp gabled roof, and much scalloping of\r\nits edges, which a new store-keeper had seen fit to build. There was\r\none long street which had plenty of room on either side for most of\r\nthe houses, and where it divided, each side of the First Parish\r\nChurch, it became the East road and the West road, and the rest of the\r\ndwellings strayed off somewhat undecidedly toward the world beyond.\r\nThere were a good many poplars in the front yards, though their former\r\nproud ranks were broken in many places, so that surviving veterans\r\nstood on guard irregularly before the houses, where usually one or two\r\nmembers of the once busy households were also left alone. Many of the\r\npeople who lived in the village had outlying land and were farmers of\r\nit, but beside the doctor\'s there were some other households which the\r\nland supported indirectly, either through professions or because some\r\nkind ancestor had laid by enough money for his children and\r\ngrandchildren. The ministers were both excellent men; but Dr. Leslie\r\nwas the only man who looked far ahead or saw much or cared much for\r\ntrue success. In Titian\'s great Venetian picture of the Presentation\r\nof the Virgin, while the little maiden goes soberly up the steps of\r\nthe temple, in the busy crowd beneath only one man is possessed by the\r\nthought that something wonderful is happening, and lifts his head,\r\nforgetting the buyers and sellers and gossipers, as his eyes follow\r\nthe sacred sight. Life goes on everywhere like that fragment of it in\r\nthe picture, but while the man who knows more than his fellows can be\r\nfound in every company, and sees the light which beckons him on to the\r\nhigher meanings and better gifts, his place in society is not always\r\nsuch a comfortable and honored one as Dr. Leslie\'s. What his friends\r\nwere apt to call his notions were not of such aggressive nature that\r\nhe was accused of outlawry, and he was apt to speak his mind\r\nuncontradicted and undisturbed. He cared little for the friction and\r\nattrition, indeed for the inspiration, which one is sure to have who\r\nlives among many people, and which are so dear and so helpful to most\r\nof us who fall into ruts if we are too much alone. He loved his\r\nfriends and his books, though he understood both as few scholars can,\r\nand he cared little for social pleasure, though Oldfields was, like\r\nall places of its size and dignity, an epitome of the world. One or\r\ntwo people of each class and rank are as good as fifty, and, to use\r\nthe saying of the doctor\'s friend, old Captain Finch: "Human nature is\r\nthe same the world over."\r\n\r\nThrough the long years of his solitary life, and his busy days as a\r\ncountry practitioner, he had become less and less inclined to take\r\nmuch part in what feeble efforts the rest of the townspeople made to\r\nentertain themselves. He was more apt to loiter along the street,\r\nstopping here and there to talk with his neighbors at their gates or\r\ntheir front-yard gardening, and not infrequently asked some one who\r\nstood in need of such friendliness to take a drive with him out into\r\nthe country. Nobody was grieved at remembering that he was a\r\nrepository of many secrets; he was a friend who could be trusted\r\nalways, though he was one who had been by no means slow to anger or\r\nunwilling at times to administer rebuke.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, late in November, while the first snow-storm of\r\nthe year was beginning, Dr. Leslie threw down a stout French medical\r\nwork of high renown as if it had failed to fulfil its mission of being\r\ninstructive first and interesting afterward. He rose from his chair\r\nand stood looking at the insulted volume as if he had a mind to\r\napologize and try again, but kept his hands behind him after all. It\r\nwas thinly dressed in fluttering paper covers, and was so thick and so\r\nlightly bound that it had a tendency to divide its material substance\r\ninto parts, like the seventhlies and eighthlies of an old-fashioned\r\nsermon. "Those fellows must be in league with the book-binders over\r\nhere," grumbled the doctor. "I must send word to that man in New York\r\nto have some sort of cover put on these things before they come down."\r\nThen he lifted the book again and poised it on one hand, looking at\r\nits irregular edges, and reflecting at length that it would be in much\r\nbetter condition if he had not given it a careless crushing in the\r\ncorner of his carriage the day before. It had been sunshiny, pleasant\r\nweather, and he had taken Nan for a long drive in the Saturday\r\nhalf-holiday. He had decided, before starting, that she should manage\r\nthe reins and he would think over one or two matters and read a\r\nwhile; it had been a great convenience lately that Nan understood the\r\nresponsibility of a horse and carriage. He was finding her a more and\r\nmore useful little companion. However, his studies and reflections had\r\nbeen postponed until some other time, for Nan had been very eager to\r\ntalk about some of her lessons in which it seemed his duty to take an\r\ninterest. The child seemed stronger and better that autumn than he had\r\never known her, and her mind had suddenly fastened itself upon certain\r\nof her studies. She seemed very quick and very accurate, the doctor\r\nthought, and the two traits do not always associate themselves.\r\n\r\nHe left the table and walked quickly to the west window, and, clasping\r\nhis hands behind him, stood looking out into the front yard and the\r\nstreet beyond. The ground was already white and he gave a little sigh,\r\nfor winter weather is rarely a source of happiness to a doctor,\r\nalthough this member of the profession was not made altogether\r\nsorrowful by it. He sometimes keenly enjoyed a hard tramp of a mile or\r\ntwo when the roads were so blocked and the snow so blinding that he\r\nleft his horse in some sheltering barn on his way to an impatient\r\nsufferer.\r\n\r\nA little way down the street on the other side was a house much like\r\nhis own, with a row of tall hemlocks beside it, and a front fence\r\nhigher and more imposing than his, with great posts at the gateway,\r\nwhich held slender urns aloft with funereal solemnity. The doctor\'s\r\neyesight was not far from perfect, and he looked earnestly at the\r\nwindows of one of the lower rooms and saw a familiar sight enough; his\r\nneighbor Mrs. Graham\'s face in its accustomed quarter of the sash. Dr.\r\nLeslie half smiled as the thought struck him that she always sat so\r\nexactly in the same place that her white cap was to be seen through\r\nthe same lower window-pane. "Most people would have moved their chairs\r\nabout until they wore holes in the floor," he told himself, and then\r\nremembered how many times he had gone to look over at his placid\r\nfriend, in her favorite afternoon post of observation. He was strongly\r\nattached to her, and he reminded himself that she was growing old and\r\nthat he must try to see her oftener. He valued her companionship, more\r\nbecause he knew it was always ready for him, than because he always\r\navailed himself of it, but the sense of mutual dependence made them\r\nvery familiar to each other when they did meet and had time for a bit\r\nof quiet talk.\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie suddenly turned; he had watched long enough to make sure\r\nthat Mrs. Graham was alone; her head had not moved for many minutes;\r\nand at first he was going out of the front door, from some instinct he\r\nwould hardly have been willing to acknowledge, but he resolutely\r\nturned and went out to the dining-room, to tell Marilla, after his\r\nusual professional custom of giving notice of his whereabouts, that he\r\nwas going to Mrs. Graham\'s. A prompt inquiry came from the kitchen to\r\nknow if anything ailed her, to which the doctor returned a scornful\r\nnegative and escaped through the side-door which gave entrance both to\r\nthe study and the dining-room. There was the usual service at\r\nMarilla\'s meeting-house, but she had not ventured out to attend it,\r\ngiving the weather and a grumbling toothache for her reasons, though\r\nshe concealed the fact that the faithless town milliner had\r\ndisappointed her about finishing her winter bonnet. Marilla had begun\r\nlife with certain opinions which she had never changed, though time\r\nand occasion had lessened the value of some of them. She liked to\r\ncount herself among those who are persecuted for conscience\'s sake,\r\nand was immensely fond of an argument and of having it known that she\r\nwas a dissenter from the First Parish Church.\r\n\r\nMrs. Graham looked up with surprise from her book to see the doctor\r\ncoming in from the street, and, being helplessly lame, sat still, and\r\nput out her hand to greet him, with a very pleased look on her face.\r\n"Is there anything the matter with me?" she asked. "I have begun to\r\nthink you don\'t care to associate with well people; you don\'t usually\r\ngo to church in the afternoon either, so you haven\'t taken refuge here\r\nbecause Mr. Talcot is ill. I must say that I missed hearing the bell;\r\nI shall lose myself altogether by the middle of the week. One must\r\nhave some landmarks."\r\n\r\n"Marilla complained yesterday that she was all at sea because her\r\napple pies gave out a day too soon. She put the bread to rise the\r\nwrong night, and everything went wrong about the sweeping. It has been\r\na week of great domestic calamity with us, but Nan confided to me\r\nthis morning that there was some trouble with our bonnet into the\r\nbargain. I had forgotten it was time for that," said the doctor,\r\nlaughing. "We always have a season of great anxiety and disaster until\r\nthe bonnet question is settled. I keep out of the way as much as I\r\ncan. Once I tried to be amusing, and said it was a pity the women did\r\nnot follow their grandmothers\' fashion and make a good Leghorn\r\nstructure last ten years and have no more trouble about it; but I was\r\nassured that there wasn\'t a milliner now living who could set such an\r\narrangement going."\r\n\r\n"Marilla\'s taste is not what one might call commonplace," said Mrs.\r\nGraham, with a smile. "I think her summer head-covering was a little\r\nthe most remarkable we have had yet. She dresses so decently\r\notherwise, good soul!"\r\n\r\n"It was astonishing," said the doctor gravely, as he stood before the\r\nfire thinking how pleasant the room looked; almost as familiar as his\r\nown study, with its heavy mahogany furniture and two old portraits and\r\nfew quaint ornaments. Mrs. Graham\'s geraniums were all flourishing and\r\ngreen and even in bloom, unlike most treasures of their kind. There\r\nwas a modern element in the room also,--some pretty cushions and other\r\nbits of embroidery; for Mrs. Graham had some grandchildren who were\r\ncity born and bred, and who made little offerings to her from time to\r\ntime. On the table near her and between the front windows were many\r\nnew books and magazines, and though the two neighbors kept up a\r\nregular system of exchange, the doctor went nearer to see what might\r\nbe found. There were a few minutes of silence, and he became conscious\r\nthat Mrs. Graham was making up her mind to say something, but when she\r\nspoke it was only to ask if there were anything serious the matter\r\nwith the minister.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said the doctor, "he\'s a dyspeptic, nervous soul, too\r\nconscientious! and when the time arrives for the sacrifice of pigs,\r\nand his whole admiring parish vie with each other to offer spare-ribs\r\non that shrine, it goes hard with the poor man."\r\n\r\nThis was worth hearing, but Mrs. Graham was a little sorry that she\r\nhad let such a good chance go by for saying something that was near\r\nher heart, so presently she added, "I am sorry that poor Marilla\r\nhasn\'t a better gift at personal decoration. It seems a pity to let\r\nher disfigure that pretty child with such structures in the way of\r\nhead-gear. I was so glad when that abominable great summer hat was\r\nlaid by for the season."\r\n\r\n"It was pretty bad," the doctor agreed, in a provokingly indifferent\r\ntone, whereupon Mrs. Graham\'s interest was rekindled, and saying to\r\nherself that the poor man did not know the danger and foolishness of\r\nsuch carelessness, she ventured another comment.\r\n\r\n"So much depends upon giving a child\'s taste the right direction."\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie had taken up a magazine, and seemed to have found something\r\nthat pleased him, but he at once laid it down and glanced once or\r\ntwice at his hostess, as if he hoped for future instructions. "You see\r\nI don\'t know anything about it, and Nan doesn\'t think of her clothes\r\nat all, so far as I can tell, and so poor Marilla has to do the best\r\nshe can," he said mildly.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes," answered Mrs. Graham, not without impatience. "But the\r\nchild\'s appearance is of some importance, and since a dollar or two\r\ndoesn\'t make any difference to you, she should be made to look like\r\nthe little lady that she is. Dear old Mrs. Thacher would turn in her\r\ngrave, for she certainly had a simple good taste that was better than\r\nthis. Marilla became the easy prey of that foolish little woman who\r\nmakes bonnets on the East road. She has done more to deprave the ideas\r\nof our townspeople than one would believe, and they tell you with such\r\npleasure that she used to work in New York, as if that settled the\r\nquestion. It is a comfort to see old Sally Turner and Miss Betsy\r\nMilman go by in their decent dark silk bonnets that good Susan Martin\r\nmade for them. If I could go out to-morrow I believe I would rather\r\nhunt for a very large velvet specimen of her work, which is somewhere\r\nupstairs in a big bandbox, than trust myself to these ignorant hands.\r\nIt is a great misfortune to a town if it has been disappointed in its\r\nmilliner. You are quite at her mercy, and, worse than all, liable to\r\nentire social misapprehension when you venture far from home."\r\n\r\n"So bonnets are not a question of free will and individual\r\nresponsibility?" asked the doctor soberly. "I must say that I have\r\nwondered sometimes if the women do not draw lots for them. But what\r\nshall I do about the little girl? I am afraid I do her great injustice\r\nin trying to bring her up at all--it needs a woman\'s eye."\r\n\r\n"Your eye is just as good as anybody\'s," responded Mrs. Graham\r\nquickly, lest the doctor should drift into sad thought about his young\r\nwife who had been so long dead and yet seemed always a nearer and\r\ndearer living presence to him. He was apt to say a word or two about\r\nher and not answer the next question which was put to him, and\r\npresently go silently away,--but to-day Mrs. Graham had important\r\nbusiness in hand.\r\n\r\n"My daughter will be here next week," she observed, presently, "and\r\nI\'m sure that she will do any shopping for you in Boston with great\r\npleasure. We might forestall Marilla\'s plans. You could easily say\r\nwhen you go home that you have spoken to me about it. I think it would\r\nbe an excellent opportunity now, while the East Road establishment is\r\nin disfavor," and when the doctor smiled and nodded, his friend and\r\nhostess settled herself comfortably in her chair, and felt that she\r\nhad gained a point.\r\n\r\nThe sunshine itself could hardly have made that south parlor look\r\npleasanter. There was a log in the fire that was wet, and singing\r\ngently to itself, as if the sound of the summer rustlings and\r\nchirpings had somehow been stored away in its sap, and above it were\r\nsome pieces of drier white birch, which were sending up a yellow\r\nconflagration to keep the marauding snow-flakes from coming down the\r\nchimney. The geraniums looked brighter than by daylight, and seemed to\r\nhold their leaves toward the fireplace as if they were hands; and were\r\neven leaning out a little way themselves and lifting their blossoms\r\nlike torches, as if they were a reserve force, a little garrison of\r\nweaker soldiers who were also enemies of the cold. The gray twilight\r\nwas gathering out of doors; the trees looked naked and defenceless, as\r\none saw them through the windows. Mrs. Graham tapped the arms of her\r\nchair gently with the tips of her fingers, and in a few minutes the\r\ndoctor closed the book he was looking over and announced that the days\r\nwere growing very short. There was something singularly pleasant to\r\nboth the friends in their quiet Sunday afternoon companionship.\r\n\r\n"You used to pay me a Sunday visit every week," said the old lady,\r\npleased to find that her guest still lingered. "I don\'t know why, but\r\nI always have a hope that you will find time to run over for half an\r\nhour. I said to myself yesterday that a figure of me in wax would do\r\njust as well as anything nowadays. I get up and dress myself, and make\r\nthe journey downstairs, and sit here at the window and have my dinner\r\nand go through the same round day after day. If it weren\'t for a\r\ncertain amount of expense it incurs, and occupation to other people, I\r\nthink it would be of very little use. However, there are some people\r\nstill left who need me. Who is it says--B\xe9ranger perhaps--that to love\r\nbenefits one\'s self, and to inspire love benefits others. I like to\r\nthink that the children and grandchildren have the old place to think\r\nof and come back to. I can see that it is a great bond between them\r\nall, and that is very good. I begin to feel like a very old woman; it\r\nwould be quite different, you know, if I were active and busy out of\r\ndoors, and the bustling sort of person for which nature intended me.\r\nAs it is, my mind is bustling enough for itself and its body both."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the doctor, laughing a little, "what is it now?"\r\n\r\n"The little girl," answered Mrs. Graham, gravely. "I think it is quite\r\ntime she knew something of society. Don\'t tell yourself that I am\r\nnotional and frivolous; I know you have put a great deal of hope and\r\nfaith and affection into that child\'s career. It would disappoint you\r\ndreadfully if she were not interesting and harmonious to people in\r\ngeneral. It seems a familiar fact now that she should have come to\r\nlive with you, that she should be growing up in your house; but the\r\nfirst thing we know she will be a young lady instead of an amusing\r\nchild, and I think that you cannot help seeing that a great deal of\r\nresponsibility belongs to you. She must be equipped and provisioned\r\nfor the voyage of life; she must have some resources."\r\n\r\n"But I think she has more than most children."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I dare say. She is a bright little creature, but her\r\nbrightness begins to need new things to work upon. She does very well\r\nat school now, I hear, and she minds very well and is much less\r\nlawless than she used to be; but she is like a candle that refuses to\r\nburn, and is satisfied with admiring its candlestick. She is quite the\r\nqueen of the village children in one way, and in another she is quite\r\napart from them. I believe they envy her and look upon her as being of\r\nanother sort, and yet count her out of half their plans and pleasures,\r\nand she runs home, not knowing whether to be pleased or hurt, and\r\npulls down half a dozen of your books and sits proudly at the window.\r\nHer poor foolish mother had some gifts, but she went adrift very soon,\r\nand I should teach Nan her duty to her neighbor, and make her take in\r\nthe idea that she owes something to the world beside following out her\r\nown most satisfying plans. When I was a young woman it was a most\r\nblessed discovery to me--though I was not any quicker at making it\r\nthan other people, perhaps,--that, beside being happy myself and\r\nvaluable to myself, I must fit myself into my place in society. We are\r\nseldom left to work alone, you know. No, not even you. I know too much\r\nabout you to believe that. And it isn\'t enough that we are willing to\r\ntalk about ourselves. We must learn to understand the subjects of the\r\nday that everybody talks about, and to make sure of a right to stand\r\nupon the highest common ground wherever we are. Society is a sort of\r\nclose corporation, and we must know its watchwords, and keep an\r\ninterest in its interests and affairs. I call a gentleman the man who,\r\neither by birth or by nature, belongs to the best society. There may\r\nbe bad gentlemen and good gentlemen, but one must feel instinctively\r\nat home with a certain class, representatives of which are likely to\r\nbe found everywhere.\r\n\r\n"And as for Nan, you will be disappointed if she does not understand a\r\nlittle later your own way of looking at things. She mustn\'t grow up\r\nfull of whims and indifferences. I am too fond of you to look forward\r\ncalmly to your being disappointed, and I do believe she will be a most\r\nlovely, daughterly, friendly girl, who will keep you from being lonely\r\nas you grow older, and be a great blessing in every way. Yet she has a\r\nstrange history, and is in a strange position. I hope you will find a\r\ngood school for her before very long."\r\n\r\nThis was said after a moment\'s pause, and with considerable\r\nhesitation, and Mrs. Graham was grateful for the gathering darkness\r\nwhich sheltered her, and not a little surprised at the doctor\'s\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking of that," he said quickly, "but it is a great\r\npuzzle at present and I am thankful to say, I think it is quite safe\r\nto wait a year or two yet. You and I live so much apart from society\r\nthat we idealize it a good deal, though you are a stray-away bit of\r\nit. We too seldom see the ideal gentleman or lady; we have to be\r\ncontented with keeping the ideal in our minds, it seems to me, and\r\nsaying that this man is gentlemanly, and that woman ladylike. But I do\r\nbelieve in aiming at the best things, and turning this young\r\ncreature\'s good instincts and uncommon powers into the proper channels\r\ninstead of letting her become singular and self-centred because she\r\ndoes not know enough of people of her own sort."\r\n\r\nMrs. Graham gave a little sound of approval that did not stand for any\r\nword in particular: "I wonder if her father\'s people will ever make\r\nany claim to her? She said something about her aunt one day; I think\r\nit was to hear whatever I might answer. It seemed to me that the poor\r\nchild had more pleasure in this unknown possession than was worth\r\nwhile; she appeared to think of her as a sort of fairy godmother who\r\nmight descend in Oldfields at any moment."\r\n\r\n"I did not know she thought of her at all," announced the doctor,\r\nsomewhat dismayed. "She never has talked about her aunt to me. I dare\r\nsay that she has been entertained with the whole miserable story."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," answered Mrs. Graham, placidly. "I don\'t think that is\r\nlikely, but it is quite reasonable that the child should be aware of\r\nsome part of it by this time. The Dyer neighbors are far from being\r\nreticent, good creatures, and they have little to remember that\r\napproaches the interest and excitement of that time. Do you know\r\nanything about Miss Prince nowadays? I have not heard anything of her\r\nin a long while."\r\n\r\n"She still sends the yearly remittance, which I acknowledge and put\r\ninto the savings bank as I always have done. When Nan came to me I\r\nadvised Miss Prince that I wished to assume all care of her and should\r\nbe glad if she would give me entire right to the child, but she took\r\nno notice of the request. It really makes no practical difference.\r\nOnly," and the doctor became much embarrassed, "I must confess that I\r\nhave a notion of letting her study medicine by and by if she shows a\r\nfitness for it."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!" said the hostess, leaning forward so suddenly that she\r\nknocked two or three books from the corner of the table, and feeling\r\nvery much excited. "John Leslie, I can\'t believe it! but my dear man\r\nused to say you thought twice for everybody else\'s once. What can have\r\ndecided you upon such a plan?"\r\n\r\n"How happened the judge to say that?" asked the doctor, trying to\r\nscoff, but not a little pleased. "I\'m sure I can\'t tell you, Mrs.\r\nGraham, only the idea has grown of itself in my mind, as all right\r\nideas do, and everything that I can see seems to favor it. You may\r\nthink that it is too early to decide, but I see plainly that Nan is\r\nnot the sort of girl who will be likely to marry. When a man or woman\r\nhas that sort of self-dependence and unnatural self-reliance, it shows\r\nitself very early. I believe that it is a mistake for such a woman to\r\nmarry. Nan\'s feeling toward her boy-playmates is exactly the same as\r\ntoward the girls she knows. You have only to look at the rest of the\r\nchildren together to see the difference; and if I make sure by and by,\r\nthe law of her nature is that she must live alone and work alone, I\r\nshall help her to keep it instead of break it, by providing something\r\nelse than the business of housekeeping and what is called a woman\'s\r\nnatural work, for her activity and capacity to spend itself upon."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you think that a married life is happiest?" urged the\r\nlistener, a good deal shocked at such treason, yet somewhat persuaded\r\nby its truth.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. Leslie, sadly. "Yes indeed, for most of us. We could\r\nsay almost everything for that side, you and I; but a rule is\r\nsometimes very cruel for its exceptions; and there is a life now and\r\nthen which is persuaded to put itself in irons by the force of custom\r\nand circumstances, and from the lack of bringing reason to bear upon\r\nthe solving of the most important question of its existence. Of course\r\nI don\'t feel sure yet that I am right about Nan, but looking at her\r\nsad inheritance from her mother, and her good inheritances from other\r\nquarters, I cannot help feeling that she might be far more unhappy\r\nthan to be made ready to take up my work here in Oldfields when I have\r\nto lay it down. She will need a good anchor now and then. Only this\r\nsummer she had a bad day of it that made me feel at my wits\' end. She\r\nwas angry with one of the children at school, and afterward with\r\nMarilla because she scolded her for not keeping better account of the\r\nfamily times and seasons, and ran away in the afternoon, if you\r\nplease, and was not heard from until next morning at breakfast time.\r\nShe went to the old place and wandered about the fields as she used,\r\nand crept into some shelter or other. I dare say that she climbed in\r\nat one of the windows of the house, though I could not make quite sure\r\nwithout asking more questions than I thought worth while. She came\r\nstealing in early in the morning, looking a little pale and wild, but\r\nshe hasn\'t played such a prank since. I had a call to the next town\r\nand Marilla had evidently been awake all night. I got home early in\r\nthe morning myself, and was told that it was supposed I had picked up\r\nNan on the road and carried her with me, so the blame was all ready\r\nfor my shoulders unless we had both happened to see the young culprit\r\nstrolling in at the gate. I was glad she had punished herself, so that\r\nthere was no need of my doing it, though I had a talk with her a day\r\nor two afterward, when we were both in our right minds. She is a good\r\nchild enough."\r\n\r\n"I dare say," remarked Mrs. Graham drily, "but it seems to me that\r\nneither of you took Marilla sufficiently into account. That must have\r\nbeen the evening that the poor soul went to nearly every house in town\r\nto ask if there were any stray company to tea. Some of us could not\r\nhelp wondering where the young person was finally discovered. She has\r\na great fancy for the society of Miss Betsy Milman and Sally Turner at\r\npresent, and I quite sympathize with her. I often look over there and\r\nsee the end of their house with that one little square window in the\r\nvery peak of it spying up the street, and wish I could pay them a\r\nvisit myself and hear a bit of their wise gossip. I quite envy Nan her\r\nchance of going in and being half forgotten as she sits in one of\r\ntheir short chairs listening and watching. They used to be great\r\nfriends of her grandmother\'s. Oh no; if I could go to see them they\r\nwould insist upon my going into the best room, and we should all be\r\nquite uncomfortable. It is much better to sit here and think about\r\nthem and hear their flat-irons creak away over the little boys\'\r\njackets and trousers."\r\n\r\n"I must confess that I have my own clothes mended there to this day,"\r\nsaid the doctor. "Marilla says their mending is not what it used to\r\nbe, too, but it is quite good enough. As for that little window, I\r\nhardly ever see it without remembering the day of your aunt Margaret\'s\r\nfuneral. I was only a boy and not deeply afflicted, but of course I\r\nhad my place in the procession and was counted among the mourners, and\r\nas we passed the Milman place I saw the old lady\'s face up there just\r\nfilling the four small panes. You know she was almost helpless, and\r\nhow she had got up into the little garret I cannot imagine, but she\r\nwas evidently determined to inspect the procession as it went down the\r\nburying-ground lane. It was a pity they did not cut the window beneath\r\nit in the lower room in her day. You know what an odd face she had; I\r\nsuppose it was distorted by disease and out of all shape it ever knew;\r\nbut I can see it now, framed in with its cap border and the window as\r\nif there were no more of her."\r\n\r\n"She really was the most curious old creature; it more than accounts\r\nfor Mrs. Turner\'s and Miss Betsy\'s love for a piece of news," said\r\nMrs. Graham, who was much amused. "But I wish we understood the value\r\nof these old news-loving people. So much local history and tradition\r\nmust die with every one of them if we take no pains to save it. I hope\r\nyou are wise about getting hold of as much as possible. You doctors\r\nought to be our historians, for you alone see the old country folks\r\nfamiliarly and can talk with them without restraint."\r\n\r\n"But we haven\'t time to do any writing," the guest replied. "That is\r\nwhy our books amount to so little for the most part. The active men,\r\nwho are really to be depended upon as practitioners, are kept so busy\r\nthat they are too tired to use the separate gift for writing, even if\r\nthey possess it, which many do not. And the literary doctors, the\r\nmedical scholars, are a different class, who have not had the\r\nexperience which alone can make their advice reliable. I mean of\r\ncourse in practical matters, not anatomy and physiology. But we have\r\nto work our way and depend upon ourselves, we country doctors, to whom\r\na consultation is more or less a downfall of pride. Whenever I hear\r\nthat an old doctor is dead I sigh to think what treasures of wisdom\r\nare lost instead of being added to the general fund. That was one\r\nadvantage of putting the young men with the elder practitioners; many\r\nvaluable suggestions were handed down in that way."\r\n\r\n"I am very well contented with my doctor," said Mrs. Graham, with\r\nenthusiasm, at this first convenient opportunity. "And it is very wise\r\nof you all to keep up our confidence in the face of such facts as\r\nthese. You can hardly have the heart to scold any more about the\r\nmalpractice of patients when we believe in you so humbly and so\r\nignorantly. You are always safe though, for our consciences are\r\nusually smarting under the remembrance of some transgression which\r\nmight have hindered you if it did not. Poor humanity," she added in a\r\ntone of compassion. "It has to grope its way through a deal of\r\ndarkness."\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed, but he was uncommonly restful and comfortable in\r\nthe large arm-chair before the fender. It was quite dark out of doors\r\nnow, and the fire gave all the light that was in the room. Presently\r\nhe roused himself a little to say "\'Poor humanity,\' indeed! And I\r\nsuppose nobody sees the failures and miseries as members of my\r\nprofession do. There will be more and more sorrow and defeat as the\r\npopulation increases and competition with it. It seems to me that to\r\nexcel in one\'s work becomes more and more a secondary motive; to do a\r\ngreat deal and be well paid for it ranks first. One feels the injury\r\nof such purposes even in Oldfields."\r\n\r\n"I cannot see that the world changes much. I often wish that I could,\r\nthough surely not in this way," said the lame woman from her seat by\r\nthe window, as the doctor rose to go away. "I find my days piteously\r\nalike, and you do not know what a pleasure this talk has been. It\r\nsatisfies my hungry mind and gives me a great deal to think of; you\r\nwould not believe what an appetite I had. Oh, don\'t think I need any\r\nexcuses, it is a great pleasure to see you drive in and out of the\r\ngate, and I like to see your lamp coming into the study, and to know\r\nthat you are there and fond of me. But winter looked very long and\r\nlife very short before you came in this afternoon. I suppose you have\r\nhad enough of society for one day, so I shall not tell you what I mean\r\nto have for tea, but next Sunday night I shall expect you to come and\r\nbring your ward. Will you please ring, so that Martha will bring the\r\nlights? I should like to send Nan a nice letter to read which came\r\nyesterday from my little grand-daughter in Rome. I shall be so glad\r\nwhen they are all at home again. She is about Nan\'s age, you know; I\r\nmust see to it that they make friends with each other. Don\'t put me on\r\na dusty top shelf again and forget me for five or six weeks," laughed\r\nthe hostess, as her guest protested and lingered a minute still before\r\nhe opened the door.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t say anything of my confidences?" at which Mrs. Graham\r\nshakes her head with satisfactory gravity, though if Doctor Leslie had\r\nknown she was inwardly much amused, and assured herself directly that\r\nshe hoped to hear no more of such plans; how could he tell that the\r\ngirl herself would agree to them, and whether Oldfields itself would\r\nfavor Nan as his own successor and its medical adviser? But John\r\nLeslie was a wise, far-seeing man, with a great power of holding to\r\nhis projects. He really must be kept to his promise of a weekly visit;\r\nshe was of some use in the world after all, so long as these\r\nunprotected neighbors were in it, and at any rate she had gained her\r\npoint about the poor child\'s clothes.\r\n\r\nAs for the doctor, he found the outer world much obscured by the\r\nstorm, and hoped that nobody would need his services that night, as he\r\nwent stumbling home though the damp and clogging snow underfoot. He\r\nfelt a strange pleasure in the sight of a small, round head at the\r\nfront study window between the glass and the curtain, and Nan came to\r\nopen the door for him, while Marilla, whose unwonted Sunday afternoon\r\nleisure seemed to have been devoted to fragrant experiments in\r\ncookery, called in pleased tones from the dining-room that she had\r\nbegun to be afraid he was going to stay out to supper. It was somehow\r\nmuch more homelike than it used to be, the doctor told himself, as he\r\npushed his feet into the slippers which had been waiting before the\r\nfire until they were in danger of being scorched. And before Marilla\r\nhad announced with considerable ceremony that tea was upon the table,\r\nhe had assured himself that it had been a very pleasant hour or two at\r\nMrs. Graham\'s, and it was the best thing in the world for both of them\r\nto see something of each other. For the little girl\'s sake he must try\r\nto keep out of ruts, and must get hold of somebody outside his own\r\nlittle world.\r\n\r\nBut while he called himself an old fogy and other impolite names he\r\nwas conscious of a grave and sweet desire to make the child\'s life a\r\nsuccessful one,--to bring out what was in her own mind and capacity,\r\nand so to wisely educate her, to give her a place to work in, and\r\nwisdom to work with, so far as he could; for he knew better than most\r\nmen that it is the people who can do nothing who find nothing to do,\r\nand the secret of happiness in this world is not only to be useful,\r\nbut to be forever elevating one\'s uses. Some one must be intelligent\r\nfor a child until it is ready to be intelligent for itself, and he\r\ntold himself with new decision that he must be wise in his laws for\r\nNan and make her keep them, else she never would be under the grace of\r\nany of her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nNEW OUTLOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie held too securely the affection of his townspeople to be\r\nin danger of losing their regard or respect, yet he would have been\r\nhalf pained and half amused if he had known how foolishly his plans,\r\nwhich came in time to be his ward\'s also, were smiled and frowned upon\r\nin the Oldfields houses. Conformity is the inspiration of much\r\nsecond-rate virtue. If we keep near a certain humble level of morality\r\nand achievement, our neighbors are willing to let us slip through life\r\nunchallenged. Those who anticipate the opinions and decisions of\r\nsociety must expect to be found guilty of many sins.\r\n\r\nThere was not one of the young village people so well known as the\r\ndoctor\'s little girl, who drove with him day by day, and with whom he\r\nkept such delightful and trustful companionship. If she had been asked\r\nin later years what had decided her to study not only her profession,\r\nbut any profession, it would have been hard for her to answer anything\r\nbeside the truth that the belief in it had grown with herself. There\r\nhad been many reasons why it seemed unnecessary. There was every\r\nprospect that she would be rich enough to place her beyond the\r\nnecessity of self-support. She could have found occupation in simply\r\nkeeping the doctor\'s house and being a cordial hostess in that home\r\nand a welcome guest in other people\'s. She was already welcome\r\neverywhere in Oldfields, but in spite of this, which would have seemed\r\nto fill the hearts and lives of other girls, it seemed to her like a\r\nfragment of her life and duty; and when she had ordered her\r\nhousekeeping and her social duties, there was a restless readiness for\r\na more absorbing duty and industry; and, as the years went by, all her\r\ndesire tended in one direction. The one thing she cared most to learn\r\nincreased its attraction continually, and though one might think the\r\npurpose of her guardian had had its influence and moulded her\r\ncharacter by its persistence, the truth was that the wise doctor\r\nsimply followed as best he could the leadings of the young nature\r\nitself, and so the girl grew naturally year by year, reaching out half\r\nunconsciously for what belonged to her life and growth; being taught\r\none thing more than all, that her duty must be followed eagerly and\r\nreverently in spite of the adverse reasons which tempted and sometimes\r\nbaffled her. As she grew older she was to understand more clearly that\r\nindecision is but another name for cowardice and weakness; a habit of\r\nmind that quickly increases its power of hindrance. She had the faults\r\nthat belonged to her character, but these were the faults of haste and\r\nrashness rather than the more hopeless ones of obstinacy or a lack of\r\nwill and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday evening tea-drinking with Mrs. Graham, though somewhat\r\nformidable at first to our heroine, became quickly one of her dearest\r\npleasures, and led to a fast friendship between the kind hostess and\r\nher young guest. Soon Nan gave herself eagerly to a plan of spending\r\ntwo or three evenings a week across the way for the purpose of reading\r\naloud, sometimes from books she did not understand, but oftener from\r\nbooks of her own choice. It was supposed to be wholly a kindness on\r\nthe young girl\'s part, and Mrs. Graham allowed the excuse of a\r\ntemporary ailment of her own strong and useful eyes to serve until\r\nneither she nor Nan had the least thought of giving up their pleasant\r\nhabit of reading together. And to this willing listener Nan came in\r\ntime with her youthful dreams and visions of future prosperities in\r\nlife, so that presently Mrs. Graham knew many things which would have\r\nsurprised the doctor, who on the other hand was the keeper of equally\r\namazing and treasured confidences of another sort. It was a great\r\npleasure to both these friends, but most especially to the elderly\r\nwoman, that Nan seemed so entirely satisfied with their friendship.\r\nThe busy doctor, who often had more than enough to think and worry\r\nabout, sometimes could spare but little time to Nan for days together,\r\nbut her other companion was always waiting for her, and the smile was\r\nalways ready by way of greeting when the child looked eagerly up at\r\nthe parlor window. What stories of past days and memories of youth and\r\nof long-dead friends belonging to the dear lady\'s own girlhood were\r\npoured into Nan\'s delighted ears! She came in time to know Mrs.\r\nGraham\'s own immediate ancestors, and the various members of her\r\nfamily with their fates and fortunes, as if she were a contemporary,\r\nand was like another grandchild who was a neighbor and beloved crony,\r\nwhich real blessing none of the true grandchildren had ever been lucky\r\nenough to possess. She formed a welcome link with the outer world, did\r\nlittle Nan, and from being a cheerful errand-runner, came at last to\r\npaying friendly visits in the neighborhood to carry Mrs. Graham\'s\r\nmessages and assurances. And from all these daily suggestions of\r\ncourtesy and of good taste and high breeding, and helpful fellowship\r\nwith good books, and the characters in their stories which were often\r\nmore real and dear and treasured in her thoughts than her actual\r\nfellow townsfolk, Nan drew much pleasure and not a little wisdom; at\r\nany rate a direction for which she would all her life be thankful. It\r\nwould have been surprising if her presence in the doctor\'s house had\r\nnot after some time made changes in it, but there was no great\r\ndifference outwardly except that she gathered some trifling\r\npossessions which sometimes harmonized, and as often did not, with the\r\nhousehold gods of the doctor and Marilla. There was a shy sort of\r\nintercourse between Nan and Mrs. Graham\'s grandchildren, but it was\r\nnot very valuable to any of the young people at first, the country\r\nchild being too old and full of experience to fellowship with the\r\nyoungest, and too unversed in the familiar machinery of their social\r\nlife to feel much kinship with the eldest.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of these early summer visits, and directly after a\r\ntea-party which Marilla had proudly projected on Nan\'s account, that\r\nDr. Leslie suddenly announced that he meant to go to Boston for a few\r\ndays and should take Nan with him. This event had long been promised,\r\nbut had seemed at length like the promise of happiness in a future\r\nworld, reasonably certain, but a little vague and distant. It was a\r\nmore important thing than anybody understood, for a dear and familiar\r\nchapter of life was ended when the expectant pair drove out of the\r\nvillage on their way to the far-off railway station, as another had\r\nbeen closed when the door of the Thacher farm-house had been shut and\r\npadlocked, and Nan had gone home one snowy night to live with the\r\ndoctor. The weather at any rate was different now, for it was early\r\nJune, the time when doctors can best give themselves a holiday; and\r\nthough Dr. Leslie assured himself that he had little wish to take the\r\njourney, he felt it quite due to his ward that she should see a little\r\nmore of the world, and happily due also to certain patients and his\r\nbrother physicians that he should visit the instrument-makers\' shops,\r\nand some bookstores; in fact there were a good many important errands\r\nto which it was just as well to attend in person. But he watched Nan\'s\r\nwide-open, delighted eyes, and observed her lack of surprise at\r\nstrange sights, and her perfect readiness for the marvelous, with\r\ngreat amusement. He was touched and pleased because she cared most for\r\nwhat had concerned him; to be told where he lived and studied, and to\r\nsee the places he had known best, roused most enthusiasm. An afternoon\r\nin a corner of the reading-room at the Athen\xe6um library, in which he\r\nhad spent delightful hours when he was a young man, seemed to please\r\nthe young girl more than anything else. As he sat beside the table\r\nwhere he had gathered enough books and papers to last for many days,\r\nin his delight at taking up again his once familiar habit, Nan looked\r\non with sympathetic eyes, or watched the squirrels in the trees of the\r\nquiet Granary Burying Ground, which seemed to her like a bit of\r\ncountry which the noisy city had caught and imprisoned. Now that she\r\nwas fairly out in the world she felt a new, strange interest in her\r\nmysterious aunt, for it was this hitherto unknown space outside the\r\nborders of Oldfields to which her father and his people belonged. And\r\nas a charming old lady went by in a pretty carriage, the child\'s gaze\r\nfollowed her wistfully as she and the doctor were walking along the\r\nstreet. With a sudden blaze of imagination she had wished those\r\npleasant eyes might have seen the likeness to her father, of which she\r\nhad been sometimes told, and that the carriage had been hurried back,\r\nso that the long estrangement might be ended. It was a strange thing\r\nthat, just afterward, Dr. Leslie had, with much dismay, caught sight\r\nof the true aunt; for Miss Anna Prince of Dunport had also seen fit to\r\nmake one of her rare visits to Boston. She looked dignified and\r\nstately, but a little severe, as she went down the side street away\r\nfrom them. Nan\'s quick eyes had noticed already the difference between\r\nthe city people and the country folks, and would have even recognized\r\na certain provincialism in her father\'s sister. The doctor had only\r\nseen Miss Prince once many years before, but he had known her again\r\nwith instinctive certainty, and Nan did not guess, though she was most\r\ngrateful for it, why he reached for her hand, and held it fast as they\r\nwalked together, just as he always used to do when she was a little\r\ngirl. She was not yet fully grown, and she never suspected the sudden\r\nthrill of dread, and consciousness of the great battle of life which\r\nshe must soon begin to fight, which all at once chilled the doctor\'s\r\nheart. "It\'s a cold world, a cold world," he had said to himself.\r\n"Only one thing will help her through safely, and that is her\r\nusefulness. She shall never be either a thief or a beggar of the\r\nworld\'s favor if I can have my wish." And Nan, holding his hand with\r\nher warm, soft, childish one, looked up in his face, all unconscious\r\nthat he thought with pity how unaware she was of the years to come,\r\nand of their difference to this sunshine holiday. "And yet I never was\r\nso happy at her age as I am this summer," the doctor told himself by\r\nway of cheer.\r\n\r\nThey paid some visits together to Dr. Leslie\'s much-neglected friends,\r\nand it was interesting to see how, for the child\'s sake, he resumed\r\nhis place among these acquaintances to whom he had long been linked\r\neither personally in times past, or by family ties. He was sometimes\r\nreproached for his love of seclusion and cordially welcomed back to\r\nhis old relations, but as often found it impossible to restore\r\nanything but a formal intercourse of a most temporary nature. The\r\npeople for whom he cared most, all seemed attracted to his young ward,\r\nand he noted this with pleasure, though he had not recognized the fact\r\nthat he had been, for the moment, basely uncertain whether his\r\njudgment of her worth would be confirmed. He laughed at the\r\ninsinuation that he had made a hermit or an outlaw of himself; he\r\nwould have been still more amused to hear one of his old friends say\r\nthat this was the reason they had seen so little of him in late years,\r\nand that it was a shame that a man of his talent and many values to\r\nthe world should be hiding his light under the Oldfields bushel, and\r\nall for the sake of bringing up this child. As for Nan, she had little\r\nto say, but kept her eyes and ears wide open, and behaved herself\r\ndiscreetly. She had ceased to belong only to the village she had left;\r\nin these days she became a citizen of the world at large. Her horizon\r\nhad suddenly become larger, and she might have discovered more than\r\none range of mountains which must be crossed as the years led her\r\nforward steadily, one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so interesting as to be able to watch the change and\r\nprogress of the mental and moral nature, provided it grows eagerly\r\nand steadily. There must be periods of repose and hibernation like the\r\nwinter of a plant, and in its springtime the living soul will both\r\nconsciously and unconsciously reach out for new strength and new\r\nlight. The leaves and flowers of action and achievement are only the\r\nsigns of the vitality that works within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nAGAINST THE WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years, while Nan was growing up, Oldfields itself\r\nchanged less than many country towns of its size. Though some faces\r\nmight be missed or altered, Dr. Leslie\'s household seemed much the\r\nsame, and Mrs. Graham, a little thinner and older, but more patient\r\nand sweet and delightful than ever, sits at her parlor window and\r\nreads new books and old ones, and makes herself the centre of much\r\nlove and happiness. She and the doctor have grown more and more\r\nfriendly, and they watch the young girl\'s development with great\r\npride: they look forward to her vacations more than they would care to\r\nconfess even to each other; and when she comes home eager and gay, she\r\nmakes both these dear friends feel young again. When Nan is not there\r\nto keep him company, Dr. Leslie always drives, and has grown more\r\ncareful about the comfort of his carriages, though he tells himself\r\nwith great pleasure that he is really much more youthful in his\r\nfeelings than he was twenty years before, and does not hesitate to say\r\nopenly that he should have been an old fogy by this time if it had not\r\nbeen for the blessing of young companionship. When Nan is pleased to\r\ncommand, he is always ready to take long rides and the two saddles are\r\nbrushed up, and they wonder why the bits are so tarnished, and she\r\nholds his horse\'s bridle while he goes in to see his patients, and is\r\nready with merry talk or serious questions when he reappears. And one\r\ndark night she listens from her window to the demand of a messenger,\r\nand softly creeps down stairs and is ready to take her place by his\r\nside, and drive him across the hills as if it were the best fun in the\r\nworld, with the frightened country-boy clattering behind on his\r\nbare-backed steed. The moon rises late and they come home just before\r\ndaybreak, and though the doctor tries to be stern as he says he cannot\r\nhave such a piece of mischief happen again, he wonders how the girl\r\nknew that he had dreaded for once in his life the drive in the dark,\r\nand had felt a little less strong than usual.\r\n\r\nMarilla still reigns in noble state. She has some time ago accepted a\r\ncolleague after a preliminary show of resentment, and Nan has little\r\nby little infused a different spirit into the housekeeping; and when\r\nher friends come to pay visits in the vacations they find the old home\r\na very charming place, and fall quite in love with both the doctor and\r\nMrs. Graham before they go away. Marilla always kept the large east\r\nparlor for a sacred shrine of society, to be visited chiefly by\r\nherself as guardian priestess; but Nan has made it a pleasanter room\r\nthan anybody ever imagined possible, and uses it with a freedom which\r\nappears to the old housekeeper to lack consideration and respect. Nan\r\nmakes the most of her vacations, while the neighbors are all glad to\r\nsee her come back, and some of them are much amused because in summer\r\nshe still clings to her childish impatience at wearing any head\r\ncovering, and no matter how much Marilla admires the hat which is\r\ndecorously worn to church every Sunday morning, it is hardly seen\r\nagain, except by chance, during the week, and the brown hair is sure\r\nto be faded a little before the summer sunshine is past. Nan goes\r\nabout visiting when she feels inclined, and seems surprisingly\r\nunchanged as she seats herself in one of the smoke-browned Dyer\r\nkitchens, and listens eagerly to whatever information is offered, or\r\nanswers cordially all sorts of questions, whether they concern her own\r\nexperiences or the world\'s in general. She has never yet seen her\r\nfather\'s sister, though she still thinks of her, and sometimes with a\r\nstrange longing for an evidence of kind feeling and kinship which has\r\nnever been shown. This has been chief among the vague sorrows of her\r\ngirlhood. Yet once when her guardian had asked if she wished to make\r\nsome attempt at intercourse or conciliation, he had been answered,\r\nwith a scorn and decision worthy of grandmother Thacher herself, that\r\nit was for Miss Prince to make advances if she ever wished for either\r\nthe respect or affection of her niece. But the young girl has clung\r\nwith touching affection to the memory and association of her\r\nchildhood, and again and again sought in every season of the year the\r\nold playgrounds and familiar corners of the farm, which she has grown\r\nfonder of as the months go by. The inherited attachment of generations\r\nseems to have been centred in her faithful heart.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the summer which followed the close of her\r\nschool-life was, for the most part, very unsatisfactory. Her\r\nschool-days had been more than usually pleasant and rewarding, in\r\nspite of the sorrows and disappointments and unsolvable puzzles which\r\nare sure to trouble thoughtful girls of her age. But she had grown so\r\nused at last to living by rules and bells that she could not help\r\nfeeling somewhat adrift without them. It had been so hard to put\r\nherself under restraint and discipline after her free life in\r\nOldfields that it was equally hard for a while to find herself at\r\nliberty; though, this being her natural state, she welcomed it\r\nheartily at first, and was very thankful to be at home. It did not\r\ntake long to discover that she had no longer the same desire for her\r\nchildish occupations and amusements; they were only incidental now and\r\npertained to certain moods, and could not again be made the chief\r\npurposes of her life. She hardly knew what to do with herself, and\r\nsometimes wondered what would become of her, and why she was alive at\r\nall, as she longed for some sufficient motive of existence to catch\r\nher up into its whirlwind. She was filled with energy and a great\r\ndesire for usefulness, but it was not with her, as with many of her\r\nfriends, that the natural instinct toward marriage, and the building\r\nand keeping of a sweet home-life, ruled all other plans and\r\npossibilities. Her best wishes and hopes led her away from all this,\r\nand however tenderly she sympathized in other people\'s happiness, and\r\nrecognized its inevitableness, for herself she avoided unconsciously\r\nall approach or danger of it. She was trying to climb by the help of\r\nsome other train of experiences to whatever satisfaction and success\r\nwere possible for her in this world. If she had been older and of a\r\ndifferent nature, she might have been told that to climb up any other\r\nway toward a shelter from the fear of worthlessness, and mistake, and\r\nreproach, would be to prove herself in most people\'s eyes a thief and\r\na robber. But in these days she was not fit to reason much about her\r\nfate; she could only wait for the problems to make themselves\r\nunderstood, and for the whole influence of her character and of the\r\npreparatory years to shape and signify themselves into a simple chart\r\nand unmistakable command. And until the power was given to "see life\r\nsteadily and see it whole," she busied herself aimlessly with such\r\ndetails as were evidently her duty, and sometimes following the right\r\nroad and often wandering from it in willful impatience, she stumbled\r\nalong more or less unhappily. It seemed as if everybody had forgotten\r\nNan\'s gift and love for the great profession which was her childish\r\ndelight and ambition. To be sure she had studied anatomy and\r\nphysiology with eager devotion in the meagre text-books at school,\r\nthough the other girls had grumbled angrily at the task. Long ago,\r\nwhen Nan had confided to her dearest cronies that she meant to be a\r\ndoctor, they were hardly surprised that she should determine upon a\r\ncareer which they would have rejected for themselves. She was not of\r\ntheir mind, and they believed her capable of doing anything she\r\nundertook. Yet to most of them the possible and even probable marriage\r\nwhich was waiting somewhere in the future seemed to hover like a\r\ncloudy barrier over the realization of any such unnatural plans.\r\n\r\nThey assured themselves that their school-mate showed no sign of being\r\nthe sort of girl who tried to be mannish and to forsake her natural\r\nvocation for a profession. She did not look strong-minded; besides she\r\nhad no need to work for her living, this ward of a rich man, who was\r\naltogether the most brilliant and beautiful girl in school. Yet\r\neverybody knew that she had a strange tenacity of purpose, and there\r\nwas a lack of pretension, and a simplicity that scorned the deceits of\r\nschool-girl existence. Everybody knew too that she was not a\r\ncommonplace girl, and her younger friends made her the heroine of\r\ntheir fondest anticipations and dreams. But after all, it seemed as if\r\neverybody, even the girl herself, had lost sight of the once familiar\r\nidea. It was a natural thing enough that she should have become expert\r\nin rendering various minor services to the patients in Dr. Leslie\'s\r\nabsence, and sometimes assist him when no other person was at hand.\r\nMarilla became insensible at the sight of the least dangerous of\r\nwounds, and could not be trusted to suggest the most familiar\r\nhousehold remedy, after all her years of association with the\r\npractice of medicine, and it was considered lucky that Nan had some\r\naptness for such services. In her childhood she had been nicknamed\r\n"the little doctor," by the household and even a few familiar friends,\r\nbut this was apparently outgrown, though her guardian had more than\r\nonce announced in sudden outbursts of enthusiasm that she already knew\r\nmore than most of the people who tried to practice medicine. They once\r\nin a while talked about some suggestion or discovery which was\r\nattracting Dr. Leslie\'s attention, but the girl seemed hardly to have\r\ngained much interest even for this, and became a little shy of being\r\nfound with one of the medical books in her hand, as she tried to fancy\r\nherself in sympathy with the conventional world of school and of the\r\nevery-day ideas of society. And yet her inward sympathy with a\r\ndoctor\'s and a surgeon\'s work grew stronger and stronger, though she\r\ndismissed reluctantly the possibility of following her bent in any\r\nformal way, since, after all, her world had seemed to forbid it. As\r\nthe time drew near for her school-days to be ended, she tried to\r\nbelieve that she should be satisfied with her Oldfields life. She was\r\nfond of reading, and she had never lacked employment, besides, she\r\nwished to prove herself an intelligent companion to Dr. Leslie, whom\r\nshe loved more and more dearly as the years went by. There had been a\r\nlong time of reserve between her childish freedom of intercourse with\r\nhim and the last year or two when they had begun to speak freely to\r\neach other as friend to friend. It was a constant surprise and\r\npleasure to the doctor when he discovered that his former plaything\r\nwas growing into a charming companion who often looked upon life from\r\nthe same standpoint as himself, and who had her own outlooks upon the\r\nworld, from whence she was able to give him by no means worthless\r\nintelligence; and after the school-days were over he was not amazed to\r\nfind how restless and dissatisfied the girl was; how impossible it was\r\nfor her to content herself with following the round of household\r\nduties which were supposed to content young women of her age and\r\nstation. Even if she tried to pay visits or receive them from her\r\nfriends, or to go on with her studies, or to review some text-book of\r\nwhich she had been fond, there was no motive for it; it all led to\r\nnothing; it began for no reason and ended in no use, as she exclaimed\r\none day most dramatically. Poor Nan hurried through her house\r\nbusiness, or neglected it, as the case might be, greatly to Manila\'s\r\nsurprise and scorn, for the girl had always proved herself diligent\r\nand interested in the home affairs. More and more she puzzled herself\r\nand everybody about her, and as the days went by she spent them out of\r\ndoors at the old farm, or on the river, or in taking long rides on a\r\nyoung horse; a bargain the doctor had somewhat repented before he\r\nfound that Nan was helped through some of her troubled hours by the\r\ncreature\'s wildness and fleetness. It was very plain that his ward was\r\nadrift, and at first the doctor suggested farther study of Latin or\r\nchemistry, but afterward philosophically resigned himself to patience,\r\nfeeling certain that some indication of the right course would not be\r\nlong withheld, and that a wind from the right quarter would presently\r\nfill the flapping sails of this idle young craft and send it on its\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Nan went hurrying out of the house just after dinner,\r\nand the doctor saw that her face was unusually troubled. He had asked\r\nher if she would like to drive with him to a farm just beyond the\r\nDyers\' later in the day, but for a wonder she had refused. Dr. Leslie\r\ngave a little sigh as he left the table, and presently watched her go\r\ndown the street as he stood by the window. It would be very sad if the\r\nrestlessness and discord of her poor mother should begin to show\r\nthemselves again; he could not bear to think of such an inheritance.\r\n\r\nBut Nan thought little of anybody else\'s discomforts as she hurried\r\nalong the road; she only wished to get to the beloved farm, and to be\r\nfree there from questions, and from the evidences of her unfitness for\r\nthe simple duties which life seemed offering her with heartless irony.\r\nShe was not good for anything after all, it appeared, and she had been\r\ncheating herself. This was no life at all, this fretful idleness; if\r\nonly she had been trained as boys are, to the work of their lives! She\r\nhad hoped that Dr. Leslie would help her; he used to talk long ago\r\nabout her studying medicine, but he must have forgotten that, and the\r\ngirl savagely rebuked society in general for her unhappiness. Of\r\ncourse she could keep the house, but it was kept already; any one with\r\nfive senses and good health like hers could prove herself able to do\r\nany of the ordinary work of existence. For her part it was not enough\r\nto be waited upon and made comfortable, she wanted something more, to\r\nbe really of use in the world, and to do work which the world needed.\r\n\r\nWhere the main road turned eastward up the hills, a footpath, already\r\nfamiliar to the reader, shortened the distance to the farm, and the\r\nyoung girl quickly crossed the rude stile and disappeared among the\r\nunderbrush, walking bareheaded with the swift steps of a creature\r\nwhose home was in some such place as this. Often the dry twigs, fallen\r\nfrom the gray lower branches of the pines, crackled and snapped under\r\nher feet, or the bushes rustled backed again to their places after she\r\npushed against them in passing; she hurried faster and faster, going\r\nfirst through the dense woods and then out into the sunlight. Once or\r\ntwice in the open ground she stopped and knelt quickly on the soft\r\nturf or moss to look at a little plant, while the birds which she\r\nstartled came back to their places directly, as if they had been quick\r\nto feel that this was a friend and not an enemy, though disguised in\r\nhuman shape. At last Nan reached the moss-grown fence of the farm and\r\nleaped over it, and fairly ran to the river-shore, where she went\r\nstraight to one of the low-growing cedars, and threw herself upon it\r\nas if it were a couch. While she sat there, breathing fast and glowing\r\nwith bright color, the river sent a fresh breeze by way of messenger,\r\nand the old cedar held its many branches above her and around her most\r\ncomfortably, and sheltered her as it had done many times before. It\r\nneed not have envied other trees the satisfaction of climbing straight\r\nupward in a single aspiration of growth.\r\n\r\nAnd presently Nan told herself that there was nothing like a good run.\r\nShe looked to and fro along the river, and listened to the sheep-bell\r\nwhich tinkled lazily in the pasture behind her. She looked over her\r\nshoulder to see if a favorite young birch tree had suffered no harm,\r\nfor it grew close by the straight-edged path in which the cattle came\r\ndown to drink. So she rested in the old playground, unconscious that\r\nshe had been following her mother\'s footsteps, or that fate had again\r\nbrought her here for a great decision. Years before, the miserable,\r\nsuffering woman, who had wearily come to this place to end their\r\nlives, had turned away that the child might make her own choice\r\nbetween the good and evil things of life. Though Nan told herself that\r\nshe must make it plain how she could spend her time in Oldfields to\r\ngood purpose and be of most use at home, and must get a new strength\r\nfor these duties, a decision suddenly presented itself to her with a\r\nforce of reason and necessity the old dream of it had never shown. Why\r\nshould it not be a reality that she studied medicine?\r\n\r\nThe thought entirely possessed her, and the glow of excitement and\r\nenthusiasm made her spring from the cedar boughs and laugh aloud. Her\r\nwhole heart went out to this work, and she wondered why she had ever\r\nlost sight of it. She was sure this was the way in which she could\r\nfind most happiness. God had directed her at last, and though the\r\nopening of her sealed orders had been long delayed, the suspense had\r\nonly made her surer that she must hold fast this unspeakably great\r\nmotive: something to work for with all her might as long as she lived.\r\nPeople might laugh or object. Nothing should turn her aside, and a new\r\naffection for kind and patient Dr. Leslie filled her mind. How eager\r\nhe had been to help her in all her projects so far, and yet it was\r\nasking a great deal that he should favor this; he had never seemed to\r\nshow any suspicion that she would not live on quietly at home like\r\nother girls; but while Nan told herself that she would give up any\r\nplan, even this, if he could convince her that it would be wrong,\r\nstill her former existence seemed like a fog and uncertainty of death,\r\nfrom which she had turned away, this time of her own accord, toward a\r\ngreat light of satisfaction and certain safety and helpfulness. The\r\ndoctor would know how to help her; if she only could study with him\r\nthat would be enough; and away she went, hurrying down the river-shore\r\nas if she were filled with a new life and happiness.\r\n\r\nShe startled a brown rabbit from under a bush, and made him a grave\r\nsalutation when he stopped and lifted his head to look at her from a\r\nconvenient distance. Once she would have stopped and seated herself on\r\nthe grass to amaze him with courteous attempts at friendliness, but\r\nnow she only laughed again, and went quickly down the steep bank\r\nthrough the junipers and then hurried along the pebbly margin of the\r\nstream toward the village. She smiled to see lying side by side a\r\nflint arrowhead and a water-logged bobbin that had floated down from\r\none of the mills, and gave one a toss over the water, while she put\r\nthe other in her pocket. Her thoughts were busy enough, and though\r\nsome reasons against the carrying out of her plan ventured to assert\r\nthemselves, they had no hope of carrying the day, being in piteous\r\nminority, though she considered them one by one. By and by she came\r\ninto the path again, and as she reached the stile she was at first\r\nglad and then sorry to see the doctor coming along the high road from\r\nthe Donnell farm. She was a little dismayed at herself because she had\r\na sudden disinclination to tell this good friend her secret.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Leslie greeted her most cheerfully, giving her the reins when\r\nshe had climbed into the wagon, and they talked of the weather and of\r\nthe next day\'s plans as they drove home together. The girl felt a\r\nsense of guilt and a shameful lack of courage, but she was needlessly\r\nafraid that her happiness might be spoiled by a word from that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThat very evening it was raining outside, and the doctor and Nan were\r\nsitting in the library opposite each other at the study-table, and as\r\nthey answered some letters in order to be ready for the early morning\r\npost, they stole a look at each other now and then. The doctor laid\r\ndown his pen first, and presently, as Nan with a little sigh threw\r\nhers into the tray beside it, he reached forward to where there was\r\none of the few uncovered spaces of the dark wood of the table and drew\r\nhis finger across it. They both saw the shining surface much more\r\nclearly, and as the dusty finger was held up and examined carefully by\r\nits owner, the girl tried to laugh, and then found her voice trembling\r\nas she said: "I believe I haven\'t forgotten to put the table in order\r\nbefore. I have tried to take care of the study at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Nan dear, it isn\'t the least matter in the world!" said Dr. Leslie.\r\n"I think we are a little chilly here this damp night; suppose you\r\nlight the fire? At any rate it will clear away all those envelopes and\r\nnewspaper wrappers," and he turned his arm-chair so that it faced the\r\nfireplace, and watched the young girl as she moved about the room. She\r\nlifted one of the large sticks and stood it on one end at the side of\r\nthe hearth, and the doctor noticed that she did it less easily than\r\nusual and without the old strength and alertness. He had sprung up to\r\nhelp her just too late, but she had indignantly refused any assistance\r\nwith a half pettishness that was not a common mood with her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why Jane or Marilla, or whoever it was, put that heavy\r\nlog on at this time of the year," said Dr. Leslie, as if it were a\r\nmatter of solemn consequence. By this time he had lighted a fresh\r\ncigar, and Nan had brought her little wooden chair from some corner of\r\nthe room where it had always lived since it came with her from the\r\nfarm. It was a dear old-fashioned little thing, but quite too small\r\nfor its owner, who had grown up tall and straight, but who had felt a\r\nsudden longing to be a child again, as she quietly took her place\r\nbefore the fire.\r\n\r\n"That log?" she said, "I wonder if you will never learn that we must\r\nnot burn it? I saw Marilla myself when she climbed the highest\r\nwood-pile at the farther end of the wood-house for it. I suppose all\r\nthe time I have been away you have been remorselessly burning up the\r\nshow logs. I don\'t wonder at her telling me this very morning that she\r\nwas born to suffer, and suffer she supposed she must. We never used to\r\nbe allowed to put papers in the fireplace, but you have gained ever so\r\nmany liberties. I wonder if Marilla really thinks she has had a hard\r\nlife?" the girl said, in a different tone.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you think yours is hard too?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\nAnd Nan did not know at first what to say. The bright light of the\r\nburning papers and the pine-cone kindlings suddenly faded out and the\r\nstudy seemed dark and strange by contrast; but the doctor did not\r\nspeak either; he only bent towards her presently, and put his hand on\r\nthe top of the girl\'s head and stroked the soft hair once or twice,\r\nand then gently turned it until he could see Nan\'s face.\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his frankly as ever, but they were full of tears. "Yes,"\r\nshe said; "I wish you would talk to me. I wish you would give me a\r\ngreat scolding. I never needed it so much in my life. I meant to come\r\nhome and be very good, and do everything I could to make you happy,\r\nbut it all grows worse every day. I thought at first I was tired with\r\nthe last days of school, but it is something more than that. I don\'t\r\nwish in the least that I were back at school, but I can\'t understand\r\nanything; there is something in me that wants to be busy, and can\'t\r\nfind anything to do. I don\'t mean to be discontented; I don\'t want to\r\nbe anywhere else in the world."\r\n\r\n"There is enough to do," answered the doctor, as placidly as possible,\r\nfor this was almost the first time he had noticed distinctly the\r\nmother\'s nature in her daughter; a restless, impatient, miserable sort\r\nof longing for The Great Something Else, as Dr. Ferris had once called\r\nit. "Don\'t fret yourself, Nan, yours is a short-lived sorrow; for if\r\nyou have any conscience at all about doing your work you will be sure\r\nenough to find it."\r\n\r\n"I think I have found it at last, but I don\'t know whether any one\r\nelse will agree with me," half whispered poor Nan; while the doctor,\r\nin spite of himself, of his age, and experience, and sympathy, and\r\nself-control, could not resist a smile. "I hate to talk about myself\r\nor to be sentimental, but I want to throw my whole love and life into\r\nwhatever there is waiting for me to do, and--I began to be afraid I\r\nhad missed it somehow. Once I thought I should like to be a teacher,\r\nand come back here when I was through school and look after the\r\nvillage children. I had such splendid ideas about that, but they all\r\nfaded out. I went into the school-house one day, and I thought I would\r\nrather die than be shut up there from one week\'s end to another."\r\n\r\n"No," said Dr. Leslie, with grave composure. "No, I don\'t feel sure\r\nthat you would do well to make a teacher of yourself."\r\n\r\n"I wish that I had known when school was over that I must take care of\r\nmyself, as one or two of the girls meant to do, and sometimes it seems\r\nas if I ought," said Nan, after a silence of a few minutes, and this\r\ntime it was very hard to speak. "You have been so kind, and have done\r\nso much for me; I supposed at first there was money enough of my own,\r\nbut I know now."\r\n\r\n"Dear child!" the doctor exclaimed, "you will never know, unless you\r\nare left alone as I was, what a blessing it is to have somebody to\r\ntake care of and to love; I have put you in the place of my own little\r\nchild, and have watched you grow up here, with more thankfulness every\r\nyear. Don\'t ever say another word to me about the money part of it.\r\nWhat had I to spend money for? And now I hear you say all these\r\ndespairing things; but I am an old man, and I take them for what they\r\nare worth. You have a few hard months before you, perhaps, but before\r\nyou know it they will be over with. Don\'t worry yourself; look after\r\nMarilla a little, and that new hand-maid, and drive about with me.\r\nTo-morrow I must be on the road all day, and, to tell the truth, I\r\nmust think over one or two of my cases before I go to bed. Won\'t you\r\nhand me my old prescription book? I was trying to remember something\r\nas I came home."\r\n\r\nNan, half-comforted, went to find the book, while Dr. Leslie, puffing\r\nhis cigar-smoke very fast, looked up through the cloud abstractedly at\r\na new ornament which had been placed above the mantel shelf since we\r\nfirst knew the room. Old Captain Finch had solaced his weary and\r\npainful last years by making a beautiful little model of a ship, and\r\nhad left it in his will to the doctor. There never was a more touching\r\ngift, this present owner often thought, and he had put it in its place\r\nwith reverent hands. A comparison of the two lives came stealing into\r\nhis mind, and he held the worn prescription-book a minute before he\r\nopened it. The poor old captain waiting to be released, stranded on\r\nthe inhospitable shore of this world, and eager Nan, who was\r\nsorrowfully longing for the world\'s war to begin. "Two idle heroes,"\r\nthought Dr. Leslie, "and I neither wished to give one his discharge\r\nnor the other her commission;" but he said aloud, "Nan, we will take a\r\nsix o\'clock start in the morning, and go down through the sandy plains\r\nbefore the heat begins. I am afraid it will be one of the worst of the\r\ndog-days."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Nan eagerly, and then she came close to the doctor,\r\nand looked at him a moment before she spoke, while her face shone with\r\ndelight. "I am going to be a doctor, too! I have thought it would be\r\nthe best thing in the world ever since I can remember. The little\r\nprescription-book was the match that lit the fire! but I have been\r\nwishing to tell you all the evening."\r\n\r\n"We must ask Marilla," the doctor began to say, and tried to add,\r\n"What _will_ she think?" but Nan hardly heard him, and did not laugh\r\nat his jokes. For she saw by his face that there was no need of\r\nteasing. And she assured herself that if he thought it was only a\r\nfreak of which she would soon tire, she was quite willing to be put to\r\nthe proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, for a wonder, Nan waked early, even before the birds had\r\nquite done singing, and it seemed a little strange that the weather\r\nshould be clear and bright, and almost like June, since she was a good\r\ndeal troubled.\r\n\r\nShe felt at first as if there were some unwelcome duty in her day\'s\r\nwork, and then remembered the early drive with great pleasure, but the\r\nnext minute the great meaning and responsibility of the decision she\r\nhad announced the evening before burst upon her mind, and a flood of\r\nreasons assailed her why she should not keep to so uncommon a purpose.\r\nIt seemed to her as if the first volume of life was ended, and as if\r\nit had been deceitfully easy, since she had been led straight-forward\r\nto this point. It amazed her to find the certainty take possession of\r\nher mind that her vocation had been made ready for her from the\r\nbeginning. She had the feeling of a reformer, a radical, and even of a\r\npolitical agitator, as she tried to face her stormy future in that\r\nsummer morning loneliness. But by the time she had finished her early\r\nbreakfast, and was driving out of the gate with the doctor, the day\r\nseemed so much like other days that her trouble of mind almost\r\ndisappeared. Though she had known instinctively that all the early\r\npart of her life had favored this daring project, and the next few\r\nyears would hinder it if they could, still there was something within\r\nher stronger than any doubts that could possibly assail her. And\r\ninstead of finding everything changed, as one always expects to do\r\nwhen a great change has happened to one\'s self, the road was so\r\nfamiliar, and the condition of the outer world so harmonious, that she\r\nhardly understood that she had opened a gate and shut it behind her,\r\nbetween that day and its yesterday. She held the reins, and the doctor\r\nwas apparently in a most commonplace frame of mind. She wished he\r\nwould say something about their talk of the night before, but he did\r\nnot. She seemed very old to herself, older than she ever would seem\r\nagain, perhaps, but the doctor had apparently relapsed into their old\r\nrelations as guardian and child. Perhaps he thought she would forget\r\nher decision, and did not know how much it meant to her. He was quite\r\nprovoking. He hurried the horse himself as they went up a somewhat\r\nsteep ascent, and as Nan touched the not very fleet steed with the\r\nwhip on the next level bit of road, she was reminded that it was a\r\nvery hot morning and that they had a great way to drive. When she\r\nasked what was the matter with the patient they were on their way to\r\nsee, she was answered abruptly that he suffered from a complication of\r\ndisorders, which was the more aggravating because Nan had heard this\r\nanswer laughed at as being much used by old Dr. Jackson, who was\r\nusually unwilling or unable to commit himself to a definite opinion.\r\nNan fancied herself at that minute already a member of the profession,\r\nand did not like to be joked with in such a fashion, but she tried to\r\nbe amused, which generosity was appreciated by her companion better\r\nthan she knew.\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie was not much of a singer, but he presently lifted what\r\nlittle voice he had, and began to favor Nan with a not very successful\r\nrendering of "Bonny Doon." Every minute seemed more critical to the\r\ngirl beside him, and she thought of several good ways to enter upon a\r\ndiscussion of her great subject, but with unusual restraint and\r\nreserve let the moments and the miles go by until the doctor had\r\nquickly stepped down from the carriage and disappeared within his\r\npatient\'s door. Nan\'s old custom of following him had been neglected\r\nfor some time, since she had found that the appearance of a tall young\r\nwoman had quite a different effect upon a household from that of a\r\nlittle child. She had formed the habit of carrying a book with her on\r\nthe long drives, though she often left it untouched while she walked\r\nup and down the country roads, or even ventured upon excursions as far\r\nafield as she dared, while the doctor made his visit, which was apt to\r\nbe a long one in the lonely country houses. This morning she had\r\npossessed herself of a square, thin volume which gave lists and plates\r\nof the nerve system of the human body. The doctor had nearly laughed\r\naloud when he caught sight of it, and when Nan opened it with decision\r\nand gravity and read the first page slowly, she was conscious of a\r\nlack of interest in her subject. She had lost the great enthusiasm of\r\nthe night before, and felt like the little heap of ashes which such a\r\nburning and heroic self might well have left.\r\n\r\nPresently she went strolling down the road, gathering some large\r\nleaves on her way, and stopped at the brook, where she pulled up some\r\nbits of a strange water-weed, and made them into a damp, round bundle\r\nwith the leaves and a bit of string. This was a rare plant which they\r\nhad both noticed the day before, and they had taken some specimens\r\nthen, Nan being at this time an ardent botanist, but these had\r\nwithered and been lost, also, on the way home.\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie was in even less of a hurry than usual, and when he came\r\nout he looked very much pleased. "I never was more thankful in my\r\nlife," he said eagerly, as soon as he was within convenient distance.\r\n"That poor fellow was at death\'s door yesterday, and when I saw his\r\nwife and little children, and thought his life was all that stood\r\nbetween them and miserable destitution, it seemed to me that I _must_\r\nsave it! This morning he is as bright as a dollar, but I have been\r\ndreading to go into that house ever since I left it yesterday noon.\r\nThey didn\'t in the least know how narrow a chance he had. And it isn\'t\r\nthe first time I have been chief mourner. Poor souls! they don\'t dread\r\ntheir troubles half so much as I do. He will have a good little farm\r\nhere in another year or two, it only needs draining to be excellent\r\nland, and he knows that." The doctor turned and looked back over the\r\nfew acres with great pleasure. "Now we\'ll go and see about old Mrs.\r\nWillet, though I don\'t believe there\'s any great need of it. She\r\nbelongs to one of two very bad classes of patients. It makes me so\r\nangry to hear her cough twice as much as need be. In your practice,"\r\nhe continued soberly, "you must remember that there is danger of\r\ngiving too strong doses to such a sufferer, and too light ones to the\r\nfriends who insist there is nothing the matter with them. I wouldn\'t\r\ngive much for a doctor who can\'t see for himself in most cases, but\r\nnot always,--not always."\r\n\r\nThe doctor was in such a hospitable frame of mind that nobody could\r\nhave helped telling him anything, and happily he made an excellent\r\nintroduction for Nan\'s secret by inquiring how she had got on with her\r\nstudies, but she directed his attention to the wet plants in the\r\nbottom of the carriage, which were complimented before she said, a\r\nminute afterward, "Oh, I wonder if I shall make a mistake? I was\r\nafraid you would laugh at me, and think it was all nonsense."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, no," replied the doctor. "You will be the successor of Mrs.\r\nMartin Dyer, and the admiration of the neighborhood;" but changing his\r\ntone quickly, he said: "I am going to teach you all I can, just as\r\nlong as you have any wish to learn. It has not done you a bit of harm\r\nto know something about medicine, and I believe in your studying it\r\nmore than you do yourself. I have always thought about it. But you are\r\nvery young; there\'s plenty of time, and I don\'t mean to be hurried;\r\nyou must remember that,--though I see your fitness and peculiar\r\nadaptability a great deal better than you can these twenty years yet.\r\nYou will be growing happier these next few years at any rate, however\r\nimpossible life has seemed to you lately."\r\n\r\n"I suppose there will be a great many obstacles," reflected Nan, with\r\nan absence of her usual spirit.\r\n\r\n"Obstacles! Yes," answered Dr. Leslie, vigorously. "Of course there\r\nwill be; it is climbing a long hill to try to study medicine or to\r\nstudy anything else. And if you are going to fear obstacles you will\r\nhave a poor chance at success. There are just as many reasons as you\r\nwill stop to count up why you should not do your plain duty, but if\r\nyou are going to make anything of yourself you must go straight ahead,\r\ntaking it for granted that there will be opposition enough, but doing\r\nwhat is right all the same. I suppose I have repeated to you fifty\r\ntimes what old Friend Meadows told me years ago; he was a great\r\nsuccess at money-making, and once I asked him to give me some advice\r\nabout a piece of property. \'Friend Leslie,\' says he, \'thy own opinion\r\nis the best for thee; if thee asks ten people what to do, they will\r\ntell thee ten things, and then thee doesn\'t know as much as when thee\r\nset out,\'" and Dr. Leslie, growing very much in earnest, reached\r\nforward for the whip. "I want you to be a good woman, and I want you\r\nto be all the use you can," he said. "It seems to me like stealing,\r\nfor men and women to live in the world and do nothing to make it\r\nbetter. You have thought a great deal about this, and so have I, and\r\nnow we will do the best we can at making a good doctor of you. I don\'t\r\ncare whether people think it is a proper vocation for women or not. It\r\nseems to me that it is more than proper for you, and God has given you\r\na fitness for it which it is a shame to waste. And if you ever\r\nhesitate and regret what you have said, you won\'t have done yourself\r\nany harm by learning how to take care of your own health and other\r\npeople\'s."\r\n\r\n"But I shall never regret it," said Nan stoutly. "I don\'t believe I\r\nshould ever be fit for anything else, and you know as well as I that I\r\nmust have something to do. I used to wish over and over again that I\r\nwas a boy, when I was a little thing down at the farm, and the only\r\nreason I had in the world was that I could be a doctor, like you."\r\n\r\n"Better than that, I hope," said Dr. Leslie. "But you mustn\'t think it\r\nwill be a short piece of work; it will take more patience than you are\r\nready to give just now, and we will go on quietly and let it grow by\r\nthe way, like your water-weed here. If you don\'t drive a little\r\nfaster, Sister Willet may be gathered before we get to her;" and this\r\nbeing a somewhat unwise and hysterical patient, whose recovery was not\r\nin the least despaired of, Dr. Leslie and his young companion were\r\nheartlessly merry over her case.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had been unprepared for such an episode; outwardly, life\r\nhad seemed to flow so easily from one set of circumstances to the\r\nnext, and the changes had been so gradual and so natural. He had\r\nlooked forward with such certainty to Nan\'s future, that it seemed\r\nstrange that the formal acceptance of such an inevitable idea as her\r\nstudying medicine should have troubled her so much.\r\n\r\nSeparated as he was from the groups of men and women who are\r\nresponsible for what we call the opinion of society, and independent\r\nhimself of any fettering conventionalities, he had grown careless of\r\nwhat anybody might say. He only hoped, since his ward had found her\r\nproper work, that she would hold to it, and of this he had little\r\ndoubt. The girl herself quickly lost sight of the fancied difficulty\r\nof making the great decision, and, as is usually the case, saw all the\r\nfirst objections and hindrances fade away into a dim distance, and\r\ngrow less and less noticeable. And more than that, it seemed to her as\r\nif she had taken every step of her life straight toward this choice of\r\na profession. So many things she had never understood before, now\r\nbecame perfectly clear and evident proofs that, outside her own\r\npreferences and choices, a wise purpose had been at work with her and\r\nfor her. So it all appeared more natural every day, and while she knew\r\nthat the excitement and formality of the first very uncomfortable day\r\nor two had proved her freedom of choice, it seemed the more impossible\r\nthat she should have shirked this great commission and trust for which\r\nnature had fitted her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nA STRAIGHT COURSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next year or two was spent in quiet life at home. It was made\r\nevident that, beside her inclination and natural fitness for her\r\nchosen work, our student was also developing the other most important\r\nrequisite, a capacity for hard study and patient continuance. There\r\nhad been as little said as possible about the plan, but it was not\r\nlong before the propriety of it became a favorite subject of\r\ndiscussion. It is quite unnecessary, perhaps, to state that everybody\r\nhad his or her own opinion of the wisdom of such a course, and both\r\nDr. Leslie and his ward suffered much reproach and questioning, as the\r\ncomments ranged from indignation to amusement. But it was as true of\r\nNan\'s calling, as of all others, that it would be her own failure to\r\nmake it respected from which any just contempt might come, and she had\r\nthrown herself into her chosen career with such zeal, and pride, and\r\naffectionate desire to please her teacher, that the small public who\r\nhad at first jeered or condemned her came at last to accepting the\r\nthing as inevitable and a matter of course, even if they did not\r\nactually approve. There was such a vigorous determination in the minds\r\nof the doctor and his pupil that Nan should not only be a doctor but a\r\ngood one, that anything less than a decided fitness for the profession\r\nwould have doomed them both to disappointment, even with such\r\nunwearied effort and painstaking. In the earlier years of his practice\r\nDr. Leslie had been much sought as an instructor, but he had long\r\nsince begun to deny the young men who had wished to be his students,\r\nthough hardly one had ever gone from the neighborhood of Oldfields who\r\ndid not owe much to him for his wise suggestions and practical help.\r\n\r\nHe patiently taught this eager young scholar day by day, and gave her,\r\nas fast as he could, the benefit of the wisdom which he had gained\r\nthrough faithful devotion to his business and the persistent study of\r\nmany years. Nan followed step by step, and, while becoming more\r\nconscious of her own ignorance and of the uncertainties and the laws\r\nof the practice of medicine with every week\'s study, knew better and\r\nbetter that it is resource, and bravery, and being able to think for\r\none\'s self, that make a physician worth anything. There must be an\r\ninstinct that recognizes a disease and suggests its remedy, as much as\r\nan instinct that finds the right notes and harmonies for a composer of\r\nmusic, or the colors for a true artist\'s picture, or the results of\r\nfigures for a mathematician. Men and women may learn these callings\r\nfrom others; may practice all the combinations until they can carry\r\nthem through with a greater or less degree of unconsciousness of brain\r\nand fingers; but there is something needed beside even drill and\r\nexperience; every student of medicine should be fitted by nature with\r\na power of insight, a gift for his business, for knowing what is the\r\nright thing to do, and the right time and way to do it; must have this\r\nGod-given power in his own nature of using and discovering the\r\nresources of medicine without constant reliance upon the books or the\r\nfashion. Some men use their ability for their own good and renown, and\r\nsome think first of the good of others, and as the great poet tells\r\nthe truths of God, and makes other souls wiser and stronger and fitter\r\nfor action, so the great doctor works for the body\'s health, and tries\r\nto keep human beings free from the failures that come from neglect and\r\nignorance, and ready to be the soul\'s instrument of action and service\r\nin this world. It is not to keep us from death, it is no superstitious\r\navoidance of the next life, that should call loudest for the\r\nphysician\'s skill; but the necessity of teaching and remedying the\r\ninferior bodies which have come to us through either our ancestors\'\r\nfoolishness or our own. So few people know even what true and complete\r\nphysical life is, much less anything of the spiritual existence that\r\nis already possible, and so few listen to what the best doctors are\r\ntrying their best to teach. While half-alive people think it no wrong\r\nto bring into the world human beings with even less vitality than\r\nthemselves, and take no pains to keep the simplest laws of health, or\r\nto teach their children to do so, just so long there will be plenty of\r\nsorrow of an avoidable kind, and thousands of shipwrecked, and\r\nfailing, and inadequate, and useless lives in the fullest sense of the\r\nword. How can those who preach to the soul hope to be heard by those\r\nwho do not even make the best of their bodies? but alas, the\r\nconvenience and easiness, or pleasure, of the present moment is\r\nallowed to become the cause of an endless series of terrible effects,\r\nwhich go down into the distance of the future, multiplying themselves\r\na thousandfold.\r\n\r\nThe doctor told Nan many curious things as they drove about together:\r\ncertain traits of certain families, and how the Dyers were of strong\r\nconstitution, and lived to a great age in spite of severe illnesses\r\nand accidents and all manner of unfavorable conditions; while the\r\nDunnells, who looked a great deal stronger, were sensitive, and\r\ndeficient in vitality, so that an apparently slight attack of disease\r\nquickly proved fatal. And so Nan knew that one thing to be considered\r\nwas the family, and another the individual variation, and she began\r\nto recognize the people who might be treated fearlessly, because they\r\nwere safe to form a league with against any ailment, being responsive\r\nto medicines, and straightforward in their departure from or return to\r\na state of health; others being treacherous and hard to control; full\r\nof surprises, and baffling a doctor with their feints and follies of\r\nsymptoms; while all the time Death himself was making ready for a\r\nlast, fatal siege; these all being the representatives of types which\r\nmight be found everywhere. Often Dr. Leslie would be found eagerly\r\npraising some useful old-fashioned drugs which had been foolishly\r\nneglected by those who liked to experiment with newer remedies and be\r\n"up with the times," as they called their not very intelligent\r\ndependence upon the treatment in vogue at the moment among the younger\r\nmen of certain cliques, to some of whom the brilliant operation was\r\nmore important than its damaging result. There was, even in those\r\ndays, a haphazard way of doctoring, in which the health of the patient\r\nwas secondary to the promotion of new theories, and the young scholar\r\nwho could write a puzzlingly technical paper too often outranked the\r\nold practitioner who conquered some malignant disorder single-handed,\r\nwhere even the malpractice of the patient and his friends had stood\r\nlike a lion in the way.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Leslie was always trying to get at the truth, and nobody\r\nrecognized more clearly the service which the reverent and truly\r\nprogressive younger men were rendering to the profession. He added\r\nmany new publications to his subscription list, and gleaned here and\r\nthere those notes which he knew would be helpful, and which were\r\nsuited to the degree of knowledge which his apprentice had already\r\ngained. It is needless to say what pleasure it gave him, and what\r\nevening talks they had together; what histories of former victories\r\nand defeats and curious discoveries were combined, like a bit of\r\nnovel-reading, with Nan\'s diligent devotion to her course of study.\r\nAnd presently the girl would take a step or two alone, and even make a\r\nvisit by herself to see if anything chanced to be needed when a case\r\nwas progressing favorably, and with the excuse of the doctor\'s\r\nbusiness or over-fatigue. And the physicians of the neighboring towns,\r\nwho came together occasionally for each other\'s assistance, most of\r\nwhom had known Nan from her childhood, though at first they had shrunk\r\nfrom speaking of many details of their professional work in her\r\nhearing, and covered their meaning, like the ostriches\' heads, in the\r\nsand of a Latin cognomen, were soon set at their ease by Nan\'s\r\nunconsciousness of either shamefacedness or disgust, and one by one\r\ngrew interested in her career, and hopeful of her success.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the importance of such experiences as\r\nthese in forming the character of the young girl\'s power of resource,\r\nand wealth of self-reliance and practical experience. Sometimes in\r\nhouses where she would have felt at least liberty to go only as\r\nspectator and scholar of medicine, Dr. Leslie insisted upon\r\nestablishing her for a few days as chief nurse and overseer, and\r\nbefore Nan had been at work many months her teacher found her of great\r\nuse, and grew more proud and glad day by day as he watched her\r\ndetermination, her enthusiasm, and her excellent progress. Over and\r\nover again he said to himself, or to her, that she was doing the work\r\nfor which nature had meant her, and when the time came for her to go\r\naway from Oldfields, it seemed more impossible than it ever had before\r\nthat he should get on without her, at home, or as an independent human\r\nbeing, who was following reverently in the path he had chosen so many\r\nyears before. For her sake he had reached out again toward many\r\nacquaintances from whom he had drifted away, and he made many short\r\njourneys to Boston or to New York, and was pleased at his hearty\r\nwelcome back to the medical meetings he had hardly entered during so\r\nmany years. He missed not a few old friends, but he quickly made new\r\nones. He was vastly pleased when the younger men seemed glad to hear\r\nhim speak, and it was often proved that either through study or\r\nexperience he had caught at some fresh knowledge of which his\r\nassociates were still ignorant. He had laughingly accused himself of\r\nbeing a rusty country doctor and old fogy who had not kept up with the\r\ntimes; but many a letter followed him home, with thanks for some\r\nhelpful suggestion or advice as to the management of a troublesome\r\ncase. He was too far away to give room for any danger of professional\r\njealousy, or for the infringement of that ever lengthening code of\r\netiquette so important to the sensitive medical mind. Therefore he\r\nhad only much pleasure and a fine tribute of recognition and honor,\r\nand he smiled more than once as he sat in the quiet Oldfields study\r\nbefore the fire, and looked up at Captain Finch\'s little ship, and\r\ntold Nan of his town experiences, not always omitting, though\r\nattempting to deprecate, the compliments, in some half-hour when they\r\nwere on peculiarly good terms with each other. And Nan believed there\r\ncould be no better doctor in the world, and stoutly told him so, and\r\nyet listened only half-convinced when he said that he had a great mind\r\nto go to town and open an office, and make a specialty of treating\r\ndiseases of the heart, since everybody had a specialty nowadays. He\r\nnever felt so ready for practice as now, but Nan somehow could not\r\nbear the thought of his being anywhere but in his home. For herself,\r\nshe would have been ready to venture anything if it would further her\r\never-growing purpose; but that Dr. Leslie should begin a new career or\r\ncontest with the world seemed impossible. He was not so strong as he\r\nused to be, and he was already famous among his fellows. She would\r\nhelp him with his work by and by even more than now, and her own\r\nchosen calling of a country doctor was the dearer to her, because he\r\nhad followed it so gallantly before her loving and admiring eyes. But\r\nDr. Leslie built many a castle in the air, with himself and a great\r\ncity practice for tenants, and said that it would be a capital thing\r\nfor Nan; she could go on with it alone by and by. It was astonishing\r\nhow little some of the city doctors knew: they relied upon each other\r\ntoo much; they should all be forced to drive over hill and dale, and\r\nbe knocked about in a hard country practice for eight or ten years\r\nbefore they went to town. "Plenty of time to read their books in June\r\nand January," the doctor would grumble to himself, and turn to look\r\nfondly at the long rows of his dear library acquaintances, his\r\nBraithwaites and Lancets, and their younger brothers, beside the first\r\nnew Sydenham Society\'s books, with their clumsy blot of gilding. And\r\nhe would stand sometimes with his hands behind him and look at the\r\nmany familiar rows of brown leather-covered volumes, most of them\r\ndelightfully worn with his own use and that of the other physicians\r\nwhose generous friend and constant instructor he had been through\r\nyears of sometimes stormy but usually friendly intercourse and\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen people in general had grown tired of discussing this strange\r\nfreak and purpose of the doctor and his ward, and had become familiar\r\nwith Nan\'s persistent interest and occupation in her studies, there\r\ncame a time of great discontent to the two persons most concerned. For\r\nit was impossible to disguise the fact that the time had again come\r\nfor the girl to go away from home. They had always looked forward to\r\nthis, and directed much thought and action toward it, and yet they\r\ndecided with great regret upon setting a new train of things in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nWhile it was well enough and useful enough that Nan should go on with\r\nher present mode of life, they both had a wider outlook, and though\r\nwith the excuse of her youthfulness they had put off her departure as\r\nlong as possible, still almost without any discussion it was decided\r\nthat she must enter the medical school to go through with its course\r\nof instruction formally, and receive its authority to practice her\r\nprofession. They both felt that this held a great many unpleasantnesses\r\namong its store of benefits. Nan was no longer to be shielded and\r\nprotected and guided by some one whose wisdom she rarely questioned,\r\nbut must make her own decisions instead, and give from her own bounty,\r\nand stand in her lot and place. Her later school-days were sure to be\r\nmore trying than her earlier ones, as they carried her into deeper\r\nwaters of scholarship, and were more important to her future position\r\nbefore the public.\r\n\r\nIf a young man plans the same course, everything conspires to help him\r\nand forward him, and the very fact of his having chosen one of the\r\nlearned professions gives him a certain social pre\xebminence and\r\ndignity. But in the days of Nan\'s student life it was just the\r\nreverse. Though she had been directed toward such a purpose entirely\r\nby her singular talent, instead of by the motives of expediency which\r\nrule the decisions of a large proportion of the young men who study\r\nmedicine, she found little encouragement either from the quality of\r\nthe school or the interest of society in general. There were times\r\nwhen she actually resented the prospect of the many weeks which she\r\nmust spend in listening to inferior instruction before gaining a\r\ndiploma, which was only a formal seal of disapproval in most persons\'\r\neyes. And yet, when she remembered her perfect certainty that she was\r\ndoing the right thing, and remembered what renown some women\r\nphysicians had won, and the avenues of usefulness which lay open to\r\nher on every side, there was no real drawing back, but rather a proud\r\ncertainty of her most womanly and respectable calling, and a reverent\r\ndesire to make the best use possible of the gifts God had certainly\r\nnot made a mistake in giving her. "If He meant I should be a doctor,"\r\nthe girl told herself, "the best thing I can do is to try to be a good\r\none."\r\n\r\nSo Nan packed her boxes and said good-by to Mrs. Graham, who looked\r\nwistful and doubtful, but blessed her most heartily, saying she should\r\nmiss her sadly in the winter. And Marilla, who had unexpectedly\r\nreserved her opinion of late, made believe that she was very busy in\r\nthe pantry, just as she had done when Nan was being launched for\r\nboarding-school. She shook her own floury hands vigorously, and\r\noffered one at last, muffled in her apron, and wished our friend good\r\nluck, with considerable friendliness, mentioning that she should be\r\nglad if Nan would say when she wrote home what shapes they seemed to\r\nbe wearing for bonnets in the city, though she supposed they would be\r\nflaunting for Oldfields anyway. The doctor was going too, and they\r\nstarted for the station much too early for the train, since Dr. Leslie\r\nalways suffered from a nervous dread of having an unavoidable summons\r\nto a distant patient at the last moment.\r\n\r\nAnd when the examinations were over, and Nan had been matriculated,\r\nand the doctor had somewhat contemptuously overlooked the building and\r\nits capabilities, and had compared those students whom he saw with his\r\nremembrance of his own class, and triumphantly picked out a face and\r\nfigure that looked hopeful here and there; he told himself that like\r\nall new growths it was feeble yet, and needed girls like his Nan, with\r\nhigh moral purpose and excellent capacity, who would make the college\r\nstrong and to be respected. Not such doctors as several of whom he\r\nreminded himself, who were disgracing their sex, but those whose\r\nlives were ruled by a pettiness of detail, a lack of power, and an\r\nabsence of high aim. Somehow both our friends lost much of the feeling\r\nthat Nan was doing a peculiar thing, when they saw so many others\r\nfollowing the same path. And having seen Nan more than half-settled in\r\nher winter quarters, and knowing that one or two of her former school\r\nfriends had given her a delighted and most friendly welcome, and\r\nhaving made a few visits to the people whom he fancied would help her\r\nin one way or another, Dr. Leslie said good-by, and turned his face\r\nhomeward, feeling more lonely than he had felt in a great many years\r\nbefore. He thought about Nan a great deal on the journey, though he\r\nhad provided himself with some most desirable new books. He was\r\nthankful he had been able to do a kind turn for one of the most\r\ninfluential doctors, who had cheerfully promised to put some special\r\nadvantages in Nan\'s way; but when he reached home the house seemed\r\nvery empty, and he missed his gay companion as he drove along the\r\ncountry roads. After the days began to grow longer, and the sun\r\nbrighter, such pleasant letters came from the absent scholar, that the\r\ndoctor took heart more and more, and went over to Mrs. Graham with\r\nalmost every fresh bit of news. She smiled, and listened, and\r\napplauded, and one day said with delightful cordiality that she wished\r\nthere were more girls who cared whether their lives really amounted to\r\nanything. But not every one had a talent which was such a stimulus as\r\nNan\'s.\r\n\r\n"Nothing succeeds like success," rejoined the doctor cheerfully, "I\r\nalways knew the child would do the best she could."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nMISS PRINCE OF DUNPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile all these years were passing, Miss Anna Prince the elder was\r\nliving quietly in Dunport, and she had changed so little that her\r\nfriends frequently complimented her upon such continued youthfulness.\r\nShe had by no means forgotten the two greatest among the many losses\r\nand sorrows of her life, but the first sharp pain of them was long\r\nsince over with. The lover from whom she had parted for the sake of a\r\npetty misunderstanding had married afterward and died early; but he\r\nhad left a son of whom Miss Prince was very proud and fond; and she\r\nhad given him the place in her heart which should have belonged to her\r\nown niece. When she thought of the other trial, she believed herself,\r\nstill, more sinned against than sinning, and gave herself frequent\r\nassurances that it had been impossible to act otherwise at the time of\r\nher brother\'s death and his wife\'s strange behavior afterward. And she\r\nhad persuaded her conscience to be quiet, until at last, with the\r\nideal of a suspicious, uncongenial, disagreeable group of rustics in\r\nher mind, she thought it was well ordered by Heaven that she had been\r\nspared any closer intercourse.\r\n\r\nMiss Prince was a proud and stately woman of the old New England type:\r\nmore colonial than American perhaps, and quite provincial in her\r\ntraditions and prejudices. She was highly respected in her native\r\ntown, where she was a prominent figure in society. Nobody was more\r\ngenerous and kind or public spirited, as her friends often said, and\r\nyoung George Gerry was well-rewarded, though he gave her great\r\npleasure by his evident affection and interest. He liked to pay\r\nfrequent visits to his old friend, and to talk with her. She had been\r\na very attractive girl long ago, and the best of her charms had not\r\nfaded yet; the young man was always welcomed warmly, and had more than\r\nonce been helped in his projects. His mother was a feeble woman, who\r\ntook little interest in anything outside her own doors; and he liked\r\nhimself better as he sat in Miss Prince\'s parlor than anywhere else.\r\nWe are always fond of the society of our best selves, and though he\r\nwas popular with the rest of his townspeople, he somehow could not\r\nhelp trying always to be especially agreeable to Miss Prince.\r\n\r\nAlthough she was apparently free from regrets, and very well satisfied\r\nwith life, even her best friends did not know how lonely her life had\r\nseemed to her, or how sadly hurt she had been by the shame and sorrow\r\nof her only brother\'s marriage. The thought of his child and of the\r\nimpossibility of taking her to her heart and home had been like a\r\nnightmare at first, and yet Miss Prince lacked courage to break down\r\nthe barriers, and to at least know the worst. She kept the two ideas\r\nof the actual niece and the ideal one whom she might have loved so\r\nmuch distinct and separate in her mind, and was divided between a\r\nlonging to see the girl and a fierce dread of her sudden appearance.\r\nShe had forbidden any allusion to the subject years and years before,\r\nand so had prevented herself from hearing good news as well as bad;\r\nthough she had always been careful that the small yearly remittance\r\nshould be promptly sent, and was impatient to receive the formal\r\nacknowledgment of it, which she instantly took pains to destroy. She\r\nsometimes in these days thought about making her will; there was no\r\nhurry about it, but it would be only fair to provide for her nearest\r\nof kin, while she was always certain that she should not let all her\r\nmoney and the old house with its handsome furnishings go into such\r\nunworthy hands. It was a very hard question to settle, and she thought\r\nof it as little as possible, and was sure there was nothing to prevent\r\nher living a great many years yet. She loved her old home dearly, and\r\nwas even proud of it, and had always taken great care of the details\r\nof its government. She never had been foolish enough to make away with\r\nher handsome mahogany furniture, and to replace it with cheaper and\r\nless comfortable chairs and tables, as many of her neighbors had done,\r\nand had taken an obstinate satisfaction all through the years when it\r\nseemed quite out of date, in insisting upon the polishing of the fine\r\nwood and the many brass handles, and of late she had been reaping a\r\nreward for her constancy. It had been a marvel to certain progressive\r\npeople that a person of her comfortable estate should be willing to\r\nreflect that there was not a marble-topped table in her house, until\r\nit slowly dawned upon them at last that she was mistress of the finest\r\nhouse in town. Outwardly, it was painted white and stood close upon\r\nthe street, with a few steep front steps coming abruptly down into the\r\nmiddle of the narrow sidewalk; its interior was spacious and very\r\nimposing, not only for the time it was built in the last century, but\r\nfor any other time. Miss Prince\'s ancestors had belonged to some of\r\nthe most distinguished among the colonial families, which fact she\r\nneither appeared to remember nor consented to forget; and, as often\r\nhappened in the seaport towns of New England, there had been one or\r\ntwo men in every generation who had followed the sea. Her own father\r\nhad been among the number, and the closets of the old house were well\r\nprovided with rare china and fine old English crockery that would\r\ndrive an enthusiastic collector to distraction. The carved woodwork of\r\nthe railings and wainscotings and cornices had been devised by\r\ningenious and patient craftsmen, and the same portraits and old\r\nengravings hung upon the walls that had been there when its mistress\r\ncould first remember. She had always been so well suited with her home\r\nthat she had never desired to change it in any particular. Her maids\r\nwere well drilled to their duties, and Priscilla, who was chief of the\r\nstaff, had been in that dignified position for many years. If Miss\r\nPrince\'s grandmother could return to Dunport from another world, she\r\nwould hardly believe that she had left her earthly home for a day, it\r\npresented so nearly the same appearance.\r\n\r\nBut however conscientiously the effort had been made to keep up the\r\nold reputation for hospitality, it had somehow been a failure, and\r\nMiss Prince had given fewer entertainments every year. Long ago, while\r\nshe was still a young woman, she had begun to wear a certain quaint\r\nand elderly manner, which might have come from association with such\r\nantiquated household gods and a desire to match well with her beloved\r\nsurroundings. A great many of her early friends had died, and she was\r\nnot the sort of person who can easily form new ties of intimate\r\nfriendship. She was very loyal to those who were still left, and, as\r\nhas been said, her interest in George Gerry, who was his father\'s\r\nnamesake and likeness, was a very great pleasure to her. Some persons\r\nliked to whisper together now and then about the mysterious niece, who\r\nwas never mentioned otherwise. But though curiosity had led to a\r\npartial knowledge of our heroine\'s not unfavorable aspect and\r\ncircumstances, nobody ever dared to give such information to the\r\nperson who should have been most interested.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the standard long stories of Dunport with which old\r\nresidents liked to regale newcomers, and handsome Jack Prince was the\r\nhero of a most edifying romance, being represented as a victim of the\r\nPrince pride, as his sister had been before him. His life had been\r\nruined, and he had begged his wretched wife at the last to bring him\r\nhome to Dunport, alive or dead. The woman had treated Miss Prince with\r\nshameful impudence and had disappeared afterward. The child had been\r\nbrought up with her own people, and it was understood that Miss\r\nPrince\'s efforts to have any connection with them were all thwarted.\r\nLately it had become known that the girl\'s guardian was a very fine\r\nman and was taking a great interest in her. But the reader will\r\nimagine how this story grew and changed in different people\'s minds.\r\nSome persons insisted that Miss Prince had declined to see her\r\nbrother\'s child, and others that it was denied her. It was often said\r\nin these days that Nan must be free to do as she chose, but it was\r\nmore than likely that she had assumed the prejudices against her aunt\r\nwith which she must have become most familiar.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Prince herself, she had long ago become convinced that\r\nthere was nothing to be done in this matter. After one has followed a\r\ncertain course for some time, everything seems to persuade one that no\r\nother is possible. Sometimes she feared that an excitement and danger\r\nlurked in her future, but, after all, her days went by so calmly, and\r\nnearer things seemed so much more important than this vague sorrow and\r\ndread, that she went to and fro in the Dunport streets, and was\r\ncourteous and kind in her own house, and read a sensible book now and\r\nthen, and spent her time as benevolently and respectably as possible.\r\nShe was indeed an admirable member of society, who had suffered very\r\nmuch in her youth, and those who knew her well could not be too glad\r\nthat her later years were passing far less unhappily than most\r\npeople\'s.\r\n\r\nIn the days when her niece had lately finished her first winter at the\r\nmedical school, Miss Prince had just freed herself from the\r\nresponsibility of some slight repairs which the house had needed. She\r\nhad been in many ways much more occupied than usual, and had given\r\nhardly a thought to more remote affairs. At last there had come an\r\nevening when she felt at leisure, and happily Miss Fraley, one of her\r\nearliest friends, had come to pay her a visit. The two ladies sat at\r\nthe front windows of the west parlor looking out upon the street,\r\nwhile the hostess expressed her gratitude that the overturning of her\r\nhousehold affairs was at an end, and that she was all in order for\r\nsummer. They talked about the damage and discomfort inflicted by\r\nmasons, and the general havoc which follows a small piece of fallen\r\nceiling. Miss Prince, having made a final round of inspection just\r\nafter tea, had ascertained that the last of the white dimity curtains\r\nand coverings were in their places upstairs in the bedrooms, and her\r\nlove of order was satisfied. She had complimented Priscilla, and made\r\nher and the maids the customary spring present, and had returned to\r\nher evening post of observation at the parlor window just as Miss\r\nFraley came in. She was not in the mood for receiving guests, being a\r\ntrifle tired, but Eunice Fraley was a mild little creature, with a\r\ngentle, deprecatory manner which had always appealed to Miss Prince\'s\r\nmore chivalrous nature. Besides, she knew this to be a most true and\r\naffectionate friend, who had also the gift of appearing when\r\neverything was ready for her, as the bluebirds come, and the robins,\r\nin the early days of spring.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could say that our house was all in order but one closet,"\r\nsaid the guest, in a more melancholy tone than usual. "I believe we\r\nare more behind-hand than ever this year. You know we have Susan\'s\r\nchildren with us for a fortnight while she goes away for a rest, and\r\nthey have been a good deal of care. I think mother is getting tired of\r\nthem now, though she was very eager to have a visit from them at\r\nfirst. She said this morning that the little girl was worse than a\r\nkitten in a fit, and she did hope that Susan wouldn\'t think it best to\r\npass another week away."\r\n\r\nMiss Prince laughed a little, and so did Miss Fraley after a moment\'s\r\nhesitation. She seemed to be in a somewhat sentimental and\r\nintrospective mood as she looked out of the window in the May\r\ntwilight.\r\n\r\n"I so often feel as if I were not accomplishing anything," she said\r\nsadly. "It came over me to-day that here I am, really an old woman,\r\nand I am just about where I first started,--doing the same things over\r\nand over and no better than ever. I haven\'t the gift of style; anybody\r\nelse might have done my work just as well, I am afraid; I am sure the\r\nworld would have got along just as well without me. Mother has been\r\nso active, and has reached such a great age, that perhaps it hasn\'t\r\nbeen much advantage to me. I have only learned to depend upon her\r\ninstead of myself. I begin to see that I should have amounted to a\r\ngreat deal more if I had had a home of my own. I sometimes wish that I\r\nwere as free to go and come as you are, Nancy."\r\n\r\nBut Miss Prince\'s thoughts were pleased to take a severely practical\r\nturn: "I\'m not in the least free," she answered cheerfully. "I believe\r\nyou need something to strengthen you, Eunice. I haven\'t seen you so\r\nout of spirits for a great while. Free! why I\'m tied to this house as\r\nif I were the knocker on the front door; and I certainly have a great\r\ndeal of care. I put the utmost confidence in Priscilla, but those\r\nnieces of hers would be going wherever they chose, from garret to\r\ncellar, before I was ten miles away from Dunport. I have let the cook\r\ngo away for a week, and Phoebe and Priscilla are alone. Phoebe is a\r\ngood little creature; I only hope she won\'t be married within six\r\nmonths, for I don\'t know when I have liked a young girl so well.\r\nPriscilla was anxious I should take that black-eyed daughter of her\r\nbrother\'s, and was quite hurt because I refused."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you were right," acknowledged Miss Fraley, though she\r\ncould not exactly see the obstacles to her friend\'s freedom in such\r\nstrong light as was expected.\r\n\r\n"I know that it must be difficult for you sometimes," resumed the\r\nhostess presently, in a more sympathetic tone. "Your mother naturally\r\nfinds it hard to give up the rule. We can\'t expect her to look at life\r\nas younger persons do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect it," said poor Miss Fraley appealingly, "and I am sure\r\nI try to be considerate; but how would you like it, to be treated as\r\nif you were sixteen instead of nearly sixty? I know it says in the\r\nBible that children should obey their parents, but there is no such\r\ncommandment, that I can see, to women who are old enough to be\r\ngrandmothers themselves. It does make me perfectly miserable to have\r\neverything questioned and talked over that I do; but I know I ought\r\nnot to say such things. I suppose I shall lie awake half the night\r\ngrieving over it. You know I have the greatest respect for mother\'s\r\njudgment; I\'m sure I don\'t know what in the world I should do without\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"You are too yielding, Eunice," said Miss Prince kindly. "You try to\r\nplease everybody, and that\'s your way of pleasing yourself; but, after\r\nall, I believe we give everybody more satisfaction when we hold fast\r\nto our own ideas of right and wrong. There have been a great many\r\nfriends who were more than willing to give me their advice in all\r\nthese years that I have been living alone; but I have always made up\r\nmy mind and gone straight ahead. I have no doubt I should be very\r\nimpatient now of much comment and talking over; and yet there are so\r\nmany times when I would give anything to see father or mother for a\r\nlittle while. I haven\'t suffered from living alone as much as some\r\npersons do, but I often feel very sad and lonely when I sit here and\r\nthink about the past. Dear me! here is Phoebe with the lights, and I\r\ndare say it is just as well. I am going to ask you to go up stairs and\r\nsee the fresh paint, and how ship-shape we are at last, as father used\r\nto say."\r\n\r\nMiss Fraley rose at once, with an expression of pleasure, and the two\r\nfriends made a leisurely tour of the old house which seemed all ready\r\nfor a large family, and though its owner apparently enjoyed her\r\nfreedom and dominion, it all looked deserted and empty to her guest.\r\nThey lingered together in the wide lower hall, and parted with unusual\r\naffection. This was by no means the first hint that had been given of\r\na somewhat fettered and disappointing home life, though Miss Fraley\r\nwould have shuddered at the thought of any such report\'s being sent\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n"Send the children round to see me," said Miss Prince, by way of\r\nparting benediction. "They can play in the garden an hour or two, and\r\nit will be a change for them and for you;" which invitation was\r\ngratefully accepted, though Miss Eunice smiled at the idea of their\r\nneeding a change, when they were sure to be on every wharf in town in\r\nthe course of the day, and already knew more people in Dunport than\r\nshe did.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Miss Prince\'s sense of general well-being seemed to\r\nhave deserted her altogether. She was overshadowed by a fear of\r\nimpending disaster and felt strangely tired and dissatisfied. But she\r\ndid not believe in moping, and only assured herself that she must make\r\nthe day an easy one. So, being strong against tides, as some old poet\r\nsays of the whale, Miss Prince descended the stairs calmly, and\r\nadvised Priscilla to put off the special work that had been planned\r\nuntil still later in the week. "You had better ask your sister to come\r\nand spend the day with you and have a good, quiet visit," which\r\npermission Priscilla received without comment, being a person of few\r\nwords; but she looked pleased, and while her mistress went down the\r\ngarden walk to breathe the fresh morning air, she concocted a small\r\nomelet as an unexpected addition to the breakfast. Miss Prince was\r\nvery fond of an omelet, but Priscilla, in spite of all her good\r\nqualities, was liable to occasional fits of offishness and depression,\r\nand in those seasons kept her employer, in one way or another, on\r\nshort commons.\r\n\r\nThe day began serenely. It was the morning for the Dunport weekly\r\npaper, which Miss Prince sat down at once to read, making her\r\ninvariable reproachful remark that there was nothing in it, after\r\nhaving devoted herself to this duty for an hour or more. Then she\r\nmounted to the upper floor of her house to put away a blanket which\r\nhad been overlooked in the spring packing of the camphor-wood chests\r\nwhich stood in a solemn row in the north corner of the garret. There\r\nwere three dormer windows in the front of the garret-roof, and one of\r\nthese had been a favorite abiding-place in her youth. She had played\r\nwith her prim Dutch dolls there in her childhood, and she could\r\nremember spending hour after hour watching for her father\'s ship when\r\nthe family had begun to expect him home at the end of a long voyage.\r\nShe remembered with a smile how grieved she had been because once he\r\ncame into port late in the night and surprised them all early in the\r\nmorning, but he had made amends by taking her back with him when he\r\nhurried on board again after a hasty greeting. Miss Prince lived that\r\nmorning over again as she stood there, old and gray and alone in the\r\nworld. She could see again the great weather-beaten and tar-darkened\r\nship, and even the wizened monkey which belonged to one of the\r\nsailors. She lingered at her father\'s side admiringly, and felt the\r\ntears come into her eyes once more when he gave her a taste of the\r\nfiery contents of his tumbler. They were all in his cabin; old Captain\r\nDunn and Captain Denny and Captain Peterbeck were sitting round the\r\nlittle table, also provided with tumblers, as they listened eagerly to\r\nthe story of the voyage. The sailors came now and then for orders;\r\nNancy thought her handsome father, with his bronzed cheeks and white\r\nforehead and curly hair, was every inch a king. He was her hero, and\r\nnothing could please her so much to the end of her days as to have\r\nsomebody announce, whether from actual knowledge or hearsay, that\r\nCaptain Jack Prince was the best shipmaster that ever sailed out of\r\nDunport.... She always was sure there were some presents stored away\r\nfor herself and young Jack, her brother, in one of the lockers of the\r\nlittle cabin. Poor Jack! how he used to frighten her by climbing the\r\nshrouds and waving his cap from almost inaccessible heights. Poor\r\nJack! and Miss Prince climbed the step to look down the harbor again,\r\nas if the ship were more than thirty days out from Amsterdam, and\r\nmight be expected at any time if the voyage had been favorable.\r\n\r\nThe house was at no great distance from the water side, though the\r\ncrowded buildings obscured the view from the lower stories. There was\r\nnothing coming in from sea but a steam-tug, which did not harmonize\r\nwith these pleasant reminiscences, though as Miss Prince raised the\r\nwindow a fine salt breeze entered, well warmed with the May sunshine.\r\nIt had the flavor of tar and the spirit of the high seas, and for a\r\nwonder there could be heard the knocking of shipwrights\' hammers,\r\nwhich in old times were never silent in the town. As she sat there for\r\na few minutes in the window seat, there came to her other\r\nrecollections of her later girlhood, when she had stolen to this\r\ncorner for the sake of being alone with her pleasant thoughts, though\r\nshe had cried there many an hour after Jack\'s behavior had given them\r\nthe sorrow they hardly would own to each other. She remembered hearing\r\nher father\'s angry voice down stairs. No! she would not think of that\r\nagain, why should she? and she shut the window and went back to be\r\nsure that she had locked the camphor chest, and hung its key on the\r\nflat-headed rusty nail overhead. Miss Prince heard some one open and\r\nshut the front door as she went down, and in the small front room she\r\nfound Captain Walter Parish, who held a high place among her most\r\nintimate friends. He was her cousin, and had become her general\r\nadviser and counselor. He sometimes called himself laughingly the\r\nship\'s husband, for it was he who transacted most of Miss Prince\'s\r\nimportant business, and selected her paint and shingles and her garden\r\nseeds beside, and made and mended her pens. He liked to be useful and\r\nagreeable, but he had not that satisfaction in his own home, for his\r\nwife had been a most efficient person to begin with, and during his\r\nabsences at sea in early life had grown entirely self-reliant. The\r\ncaptain joked about it merrily, but he nevertheless liked to feel that\r\nhe was still important, and Miss Prince generously told him, from time\r\nto time, that she did not know how she should get on without him, and\r\nconsiderately kept up the fiction of not wishing to take up his time\r\nwhen he must be busy with his own affairs.\r\n\r\n"How are you this fine morning, Cousin Nancy?" said the captain\r\ngallantly. "I called to say that Jerry Martin will be here to-morrow\r\nwithout fail. It seems he thought you would send him word when you\r\nwanted him next, and he has been working for himself. I don\'t think\r\nthe garden will suffer, we have had so much cold weather. And here is\r\na letter I took from the office." He handed it to Miss Prince with a\r\nquestioning look; he knew the handwriting of her few correspondents\r\nalmost as well as she, and this was a stranger\'s.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is a receipt for my subscription to the"--But Miss Prince\r\nnever finished the sentence, for when she had fairly taken the letter\r\ninto her hand, the very touch of it seemed to send a tinge of ashen\r\ngray like some quick poison over her face. She stood still, looking at\r\nit, then flushed crimson, and sat down in the nearest chair, as if it\r\nwere impossible to hold herself upright. The captain was uncertain\r\nwhat he ought to do.\r\n\r\n"I hope you haven\'t heard bad news," he said presently, for Miss\r\nPrince had leaned back in the arm-chair and covered her eyes with one\r\nhand, while the letter was tightly held in the other.\r\n\r\n"It is from my niece," she answered, slowly.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean it\'s from Jack\'s daughter?" inquired the captain, not\r\nwithout eagerness. He never had suspected such a thing; the only\r\nexplanation which had suggested itself to his mind was that Miss\r\nPrince had been investing some of her money without his advice or\r\nknowledge, and he had gone so far as to tell himself that it was just\r\nlike a woman, and quite good enough for her if she had lost it. "I\r\nnever thought of its being from her," he said, a little bewildered,\r\nfor the captain was not a man of quick wit; his powers of reflection\r\nserved him better. "Well, aren\'t you going to tell me what she has to\r\nsay for herself?"\r\n\r\n"She proposes to make me a visit," answered Miss Prince, trying to\r\nsmile as she handed him the little sheet of paper which she had\r\nunconsciously crumpled together; but she did not give even one glance\r\nat his face as he read it, though she thought it a distressingly long\r\ntime before he spoke.\r\n\r\n"I must say that this is a very good letter, very respectful and\r\nlady-like," said the captain honestly, though he felt as if he had\r\nbeen expected to condemn it, and proceeded to read it through again,\r\nthis time aloud:--\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR AUNT,--I cannot think it is right that we do not know\r\n   each other. I should like to go to Dunport for a day some time\r\n   next month; but if you do not wish to see me you have only to\r\n   tell me so, and I will not trouble you.\r\n\r\n                                         Yours sincerely,\r\n                                           ANNA PRINCE.\r\n\r\n"A very good handwriting, too," the captain remarked, and then\r\ngathered courage to say that he supposed Miss Prince would give her\r\nniece the permission for which she asked. "I have been told that she\r\nis a very fine girl," he ventured, as if he were poor Nan\'s\r\nambassador; and at this Miss Prince\'s patience gave way.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall ask her to come, but I do not wish anything said about\r\nit; it need not be made the talk of the town." She answered her cousin\r\nangrily, and then felt as if she had been unjust. "Do not mind me,\r\nWalter," she said; "it has been a terrible grief and trouble to me all\r\nthese years. Perhaps if I had gone to see those people, and told them\r\nall I felt, they would have pitied me, and not blamed me, and so\r\neverything would have been better, but it is too late now. I don\'t\r\nknow what sort of a person my own niece is, and I wish that I need\r\nnever find out, but I shall try to do my duty."\r\n\r\nThe captain was tender-hearted, and seemed quite unmanned, but he gave\r\nhis eyes a sudden stroke with his hand and turned to go away. "You\r\nwill command me, Nancy, if I can be of service to you?" he inquired,\r\nand his cousin bowed her head in assent. It was, indeed, a dismal hour\r\nof the family history.\r\n\r\nFor some time Miss Prince did not move, except as she watched Captain\r\nParish cross the street and take his leisurely way along the uneven\r\npavement. She was almost tempted to call him back, and felt as if he\r\nwere the last friend she had in the world, and was leaving her\r\nforever. But after she had allowed the worst of the miserable shock to\r\nspend itself, she summoned the stern energy for which she was famous,\r\nand going with slower steps than usual to the next room, she unlocked\r\nthe desk of the ponderous secretary and seated herself to write.\r\nBefore many minutes had passed the letter was folded, and sealed, and\r\naddressed, and the next evening Nan was reading it at Oldfields. She\r\nwas grateful for being asked to come on the 5th of June to Dunport,\r\nand to stay a few days if it were convenient, and yet her heart fell\r\nbecause there was not a sign of welcome or affection in the stately\r\nfashioning of the note. It had been hardly wise to expect it under the\r\ncircumstances, the girl assured herself later, and at any rate it was\r\nkind in her aunt to answer her own short letter so soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nHOSTESS AND GUEST\r\n\r\n\r\nNan had, indeed, resolved to take a most important step. She had\r\nalways dismissed the idea of having any communication with her aunt\r\nmost contemptuously when she had first understood their unhappy\r\nposition toward each other; but during the last year or two she had\r\nbeen forced to look at the relationship from a wider point of view.\r\nDr. Leslie protested that he had always treated Miss Prince in a\r\nperfectly fair and friendly manner, and that if she had chosen to show\r\nno interest in her only niece, nobody was to blame but herself. But\r\nNan pleaded that her aunt was no longer young; that she might be\r\nwishing that a reconciliation could be brought about; the very fact of\r\nher having constantly sent the yearly allowance in spite of Mrs.\r\nThacher\'s and Dr. Leslie\'s unwillingness to receive it appealed to the\r\nyoung girl, who was glad to believe that her aunt had, after all, more\r\ninterest in her than others cared to observe. She had no near\r\nrelatives except Miss Prince. There were some cousins of old Mrs.\r\nThacher\'s and their descendants settled in the vicinity of Oldfields;\r\nbut Nan clung more eagerly to this one closer tie of kindred than she\r\ncared to confess even to her guardian. It was too late now for any\r\ninterference in Dr. Leslie\'s plans, or usurping of his affectionate\r\nrelationship; so, after he found that Nan\'s loyal heart was bent upon\r\nmaking so kind a venture, he said one day, with a smile, that she had\r\nbetter write a letter to her aunt, the immediate result of which we\r\nalready know. Nan had been studying too hard, and suffering not a\r\nlittle from her long-continued city life, and though the doctor had\r\nbeen making a most charming plan that later in the season they should\r\ntake a journey together to Canada, he said nothing about that, and\r\ntold himself with a sigh that this would be a more thorough change,\r\nand even urged Nan to stay as long as she pleased in Dunport, if she\r\nfound her aunt\'s house pleasant and everything went well. For whether\r\nNan liked Miss Prince remained to be proved, though nobody in their\r\nsenses could doubt that Miss Prince would be proud of her niece.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after Nan had fairly started that she began to feel\r\nat all dismayed. Perhaps she had done a foolish thing after all;\r\nMarilla had not approved the adventure, while at the last minute Nan\r\nhad become suspicious that the doctor had made another plan, though\r\nshe contented herself with the remembrance of perfect freedom to go\r\nhome whenever she chose. She told herself grimly that if her aunt died\r\nshe should be thankful that she had done this duty; yet when, after a\r\njourney of several hours, she knew that Dunport was the next station,\r\nher heart began to beat in a ridiculous manner. It was unlike any\r\nexperience that had ever come to her, and she felt strangely unequal\r\nto the occasion. Long ago she had laughed at her early romances of her\r\ngrand Dunport belongings, but the memory of them lingered still, in\r\nspite of this commonplace approach to their realities, and she looked\r\neagerly at the groups of people at the railway station with a great\r\nhope and almost certainty that she should find her aunt waiting to\r\nmeet her. There was no such good fortune, which was a chill at the\r\noutset to the somewhat tired young traveler, but she beckoned a driver\r\nwhom she had just ignored, and presently was shut into a somewhat\r\nantiquated public carriage and on her way to Miss Prince\'s house.\r\n\r\nSo this was Dunport, and in these very streets her father had played,\r\nand here her mother had become deeper and deeper involved in the\r\nsuffering and tragedy which had clouded the end of her short life. It\r\nseemed to the young stranger as if she must shrink away from the\r\ncurious glances that stray passers-by sent into the old carriage; and\r\nthat she was going to be made very conspicuous by the newly-awakened\r\ninterest in a sad story which surely could not have been forgotten.\r\nPoor Nan! she sent a swift thought homeward to the doctor\'s house and\r\nMrs. Graham\'s; even to the deserted little place which had sheltered\r\nher good old grandmother and herself in the first years she could\r\nremember. And with strange irony came also a picture of the home of\r\none of her schoolmates,--where the father and mother and their\r\nchildren lived together and loved each other. The tears started to her\r\neyes until some good angel whispered the kind "Come back soon, Nan\r\ndear," with which Dr. Leslie had let her go away.\r\n\r\nThe streets were narrow and roughly paved in the old provincial\r\nseaport town; the houses looked a good deal alike as they stood close\r\nto the street, though here and there the tops of some fruit trees\r\nshowed themselves over a high garden fence. And presently before a\r\nbroad-faced and gambrel-roofed house, the driver stopped his horses,\r\nand now only the front door with its bull\'s-eyed top-lights and\r\nshining knocker stood between Nan and her aunt. The coachman had given\r\na resounding summons at this somewhat formidable entrance before he\r\nturned to open the carriage door, but Nan had already alighted, and\r\nstepped quickly into the hall. Priscilla directed her with some\r\nceremony to the south parlor, and a prim figure turned away from one\r\nof the windows that overlooked the garden, and came forward a few\r\nsteps. "I suppose this is Anna," the not very cordial voice began, and\r\nfaltered; and then Miss Prince led her niece toward the window she had\r\nleft, and without a thought of the reserve she had decided upon,\r\npushed one of the blinds wide open, and looked again at Nan\'s\r\nappealing face, half eager herself, and half afraid. Then she fumbled\r\nfor a handkerchief, and betook herself to the end of the sofa and\r\nbegan to cry: "You are so like my mother and Jack," she said. "I did\r\nnot think I should be so glad to see you."\r\n\r\nThe driver had deposited Nan\'s box, and now appeared at the door of\r\nthe parlor with Priscilla (who had quite lost her wits with\r\nexcitement) looking over his shoulder. Nan sprang forward, glad of\r\nsomething to do in the midst of her vague discomfort, and at this\r\nsight the hostess recovered herself, and, commanding Priscilla to show\r\nMiss Prince to her room, assumed the direction of business affairs.\r\n\r\nThe best bedroom was very pleasant, though somewhat stiff and unused,\r\nand Nan was glad to close its door and find herself in such a\r\ncomfortable haven of rest and refuge from the teasing details of that\r\nstrange day. The wind had gone to the eastward, and the salt odor was\r\nmost delightful to her. A vast inheritance of memories and\r\nassociations was dimly brought to mind by that breath of the sea and\r\nfreshness of the June day by the harbor side. Her heart leaped at the\r\nthought of the neighborhood of the wharves and shipping, and as she\r\nlooked out at the ancient street, she told herself with a sense of\r\ngreat fun that if she had been a boy she would inevitably have been a\r\nsurgeon in the navy. So this was the aunt whom Nan had thought about\r\nand dreamed about by day and by night, whose acquaintance had always\r\nbeen a waiting pleasure, and the mere fact of whose existence had\r\nalways given her niece something to look forward to. She had not known\r\nuntil this moment what a reserved pleasure this meeting had been, and\r\nnow it was over with. Miss Prince was so much like other people,\r\nthough why she should not have been it would be difficult to suggest,\r\nand Nan\'s taste had been so educated and instructed by her Oldfields\'\r\nadvantages, not to speak of her later social experiences, that she\r\nfelt at once that her aunt\'s world was smaller than her own. There was\r\nsomething very lovable about Miss Prince, in spite of the constraint\r\nof her greeting, and for the first time Nan understood that her aunt\r\nalso had dreaded the meeting. Presently she came to the door, and this\r\ntime kissed Nan affectionately. "I don\'t know what to say to you, I am\r\nsure," she told the girl, "only I am thankful to have you here. You\r\nmust understand that it is a great event to me;" at which Nan laughed\r\nand spoke some cheerful words. Miss Prince seated herself by the other\r\nfront window, and looked at her young guest with ever-growing\r\nsatisfaction. This was no copy of that insolent, ill-bred young woman\r\nwho had so beguiled and ruined poor Jack; she was a little lady, who\r\ndid honor to the good name of the Princes and Lesters,--a niece whom\r\nanybody might be proud to claim, and whom Miss Prince could cordially\r\nentreat to make herself quite at home, for she had only been too long\r\nin coming to her own. And presently, when tea was served, the careful\r\nordering of it, which had been meant partly to mock and astonish the\r\ngirl who could not have been used to such ways of living, seemed only\r\na fitting entertainment for so distinguished a guest. "Blood will\r\ntell," murmured Miss Prince to herself as she clinked the teacups and\r\nlooked at the welcome face the other side of the table. But when they\r\ntalked together in the evening, it was made certain that Nan was\r\nneither ashamed of her mother\'s people nor afraid to say gravely to\r\nMiss Prince that she did not know how much injustice was done to\r\ngrandmother Thacher, if she believed she were right in making a\r\ncertain statement. Aunt Nancy smiled, and accepted her rebuff without\r\nany show of disapproval, and was glad that the next day was Sunday,\r\nso that she could take Nan to church for the admiration of all\r\nobservers. She was even sorry that she had not told young Gerry to\r\ncome and pay an evening visit to her niece, and spoke of him once or\r\ntwice. Her niece observed a slight self-consciousness at such times,\r\nand wondered a little who Mr. George Gerry might be.\r\n\r\nNan thought of many things before she fell asleep that night. Her\r\nideas of her father had always been vague, and she had somehow\r\nassociated him with Dr. Leslie, who had shown her all the fatherliness\r\nshe had ever known. As for the young man who had died so long ago, if\r\nshe had said that he seemed to her like a younger brother of Dr.\r\nLeslie, it would have been nearest the truth, in spite of the details\r\nof the short and disappointed life which had come to her ears. Dr.\r\nFerris had told her almost all she knew of him, but now that she was\r\nin her own father\'s old home, among the very same sights he had known\r\nbest, he suddenly appeared to her in a vision, as one might say, and\r\ninvested himself in a cloud of attractive romance. His daughter felt a\r\nsudden blaze of delight at this first real consciousness of her\r\nkinship. Miss Prince had shown her brother\'s portrait early in the\r\nevening, and had even taken the trouble to light a candle and hold it\r\nhigh, so that Nan could see the handsome, boyish face, in which she\r\nrecognized quickly the likeness to her own. "He was only thirteen\r\nthen," said Miss Prince, "but he looks several years older. We all\r\nthought that the artist had made a great mistake when it was painted,\r\nbut poor Jack grew to look like it. Yes, you are wonderfully like\r\nhim," and she held the light near Nan\'s face and studied it again as\r\nshe had just studied the picture. Nan\'s eyes filled with tears as she\r\nlooked up at her father\'s face. The other portraits in the room were\r\nall of older people, her grandfather and grandmother and two or three\r\nancestors, and Miss Prince repeated proudly some anecdotes of the most\r\ndistinguished. "I suppose you never heard of them," she added sadly at\r\nthe close, but Nan made no answer; it was certainly no fault of her\r\nown that she was ignorant of many things, and she would not confess\r\nthat during the last few years she had found out everything that was\r\npossible about her father\'s people. She was so thankful to have grown\r\nup in Oldfields that she could not find it in her heart to rail at the\r\nfate that had kept her away from Dunport; but the years of silence\r\nhad been very unlovely in her aunt.\r\n\r\nShe wondered, before she went to sleep that night, where her father\'s\r\nroom had been, and thought she would ask Miss Prince in the morning.\r\nThe windows were open, and the June air blew softly in, and sometimes\r\nswayed the curtains of the bed. There was a scent of the sea and of\r\nroses, and presently up the quiet street came the sound of footsteps\r\nand young voices. Nan said to herself that some party had been late in\r\nbreaking up, and felt her heart thrill with sympathy. She had been\r\ndwelling altogether in the past that evening, and she liked to hear\r\nthe revelers go by. But as they came under the windows she heard one\r\nsay, "I should be afraid of ghosts in that best room of Miss\r\nPrince\'s," and then they suddenly became quiet, as if they had seen\r\nthat the windows were open, and Nan first felt like a stranger, but\r\nnext as if this were all part of the evening\'s strange experiences,\r\nand as if these might be her father\'s young companions, and she must\r\ncall to them as they went by.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning both the hostess and her guest waked early, and were\r\neager for the time when they should see each other again. The beauty\r\nand quiet of the Sunday morning were very pleasant, and Nan stood for\r\nsome minutes at the dining-room windows, looking out on the small\r\npaved courtyard, and the flowers and green leaves beyond the garden\r\ngate. Miss Prince\'s was one of the fine old houses which kept its\r\ngarden behind it, well-defended from the street, for the family\'s own\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"Those are the same old bushes and trees which we used to play among;\r\nI have hardly changed it at all," said Miss Prince, as she came in. It\r\nmust be confessed that she had lost the feeling of patroness with\r\nwhich she had approached her acquaintance with Nan. She was proud and\r\ngrateful now, and as she saw the girl in her pretty white dress, and\r\nfound her as simple and affectionate and eager to please as she had\r\nthought her the night before, she owned to herself that she had not\r\nlooked for such happiness to fall into her life. And there was\r\nsomething about the younger Anna Prince which others had quickly\r\nrecognized; a power of direction and of command. There are some\r\nnatures like the Prussian blue on a painter\'s palette, which rules all\r\nthe other colors it is mixed with; natures which quickly make\r\nthemselves felt in small or great companies.\r\n\r\nNan discovered her father\'s silver mug beside her plate, and was fired\r\nwith a fiercer resentment than she had expected to feel again, at the\r\nsight of it. The thought of her childhood in good grandmother\r\nThacher\'s farm-house came quickly to her mind, with the plain living,\r\nto her share of which she had been made a thousand times welcome;\r\nwhile by this richer house, of which she was also heir, such rightful\r\ntrinkets and treasures had been withheld. But at the next minute she\r\ncould meet Miss Prince\'s observant eyes without displeasure, and\r\nwisely remembered that she herself had not been responsible for the\r\nstate of affairs, and that possibly her aunt had been as wronged and\r\ninsulted and beaten back as she complained. So she pushed the\r\nnewly-brightened cup aside with an almost careless hand, as a sort of\r\ncompromise with revenge, and Miss Prince at once caught sight of it.\r\n"Dear me," she said, not without confusion, "Priscilla must have\r\nthought you would be pleased," and then faltered, "I wish with all my\r\nheart you had always had it for your own, my dear." And this was a\r\ngreat deal for Miss Prince to say, as any of her acquaintances could\r\nhave told her nearest relative, who sat, almost a stranger, at the\r\nbreakfast-table.\r\n\r\nThe elder woman felt a little light-headed and unfamiliar to herself\r\nas she went up the stairway to get ready for church. It seemed as if\r\nshe had entered upon a new stage of existence, since for so many years\r\nshe had resented the existence of her brother\'s child, and had kept up\r\nan imaginary war, in which she ardently fought for her own rights. She\r\nhad brought forward reason after reason why she must maintain her\r\nposition as representative of a respected family who had been shamed\r\nand disgraced and insulted by her brother\'s wife. Now all aggressors\r\nof her peace, real and imaginary, were routed by the appearance of\r\nthis young girl upon the field of battle, which she traversed with\r\nmost innocent and fearless footsteps, looking smilingly into her\r\naunt\'s face, and behaving almost as if neither of them had been\r\nconcerned in the family unhappiness. Beside, Nan had already added a\r\nnew interest to Miss Prince\'s life, and as this defeated warrior took\r\na best dress from the closet without any of the usual reflection upon\r\nso important a step, she felt a great consciousness of having been\r\nadded to and enriched, as the person might who had suddenly fallen\r\nheir to an unexpected property. From this first day she separated\r\nherself as much as possible from any thought of guilt or complicity in\r\nthe long estrangement. She seemed to become used to her niece\'s\r\npresence, and with the new relationship\'s growth there faded away the\r\nthought of the past times. If any one dared to hint that it was a pity\r\nthis visit had been so long delayed, Miss Prince grandly ignored all\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nPriscilla had come to the guest\'s room on some undeclared errand, for\r\nit had already been put in order, and she viewed with pleasure the\r\nsimple arrangements for dressing which were in one place and another\r\nabout the room. Priscilla had scorned the idea of putting this visitor\r\ninto the best bedroom, and had had secret expectations that Miss\r\nPrince\'s niece would feel more at home with her than with her\r\nmistress. But Miss Anna was as much of a lady as Miss Prince, which\r\nwas both pleasing and disappointing, as Priscilla hoped to solace some\r\ndisrespectful feelings of her own heart by taking down Miss Nancy\'s\r\npride. However, her loyalty to the house was greater than her own very\r\nsmall grudges, and as she pretended to have some difficulty with the\r\nfastening of the blind, she said in a whisper, "Y\'r aunt\'ll like to\r\nhave you make yourself look pretty," which was such a reminder of\r\nMarilla\'s affectionate worldliness that Nan had to laugh aloud. "I\'m\r\nafraid I haven\'t anything grand enough," she told the departing\r\nhousekeeper, whose pleasure it was not hard to discern.\r\n\r\nIt was with a very gratified mind that Miss Prince walked down the\r\nstreet with her niece and bowed to one and another of her\r\nacquaintances. She was entirely careless of what any one should say,\r\nbut she was brimful of excitement, and answered several of Nan\'s\r\nquestions entirely wrong. The old town was very pleasant that Sunday\r\nmorning. The lilacs were in full bloom, and other early summer flowers\r\nin the narrow strips of front-yards or the high-fenced gardens were\r\nin blossom too, and the air was full of sweetness and delight. The\r\nancient seaport had gathered for itself quaint names and treasures; it\r\nwas pleased with its old fashions and noble memories; its ancient\r\nbells had not lost their sweet voices, and a flavor of the past\r\npervaded everything. The comfortable houses, the elderly citizens, the\r\nvery names on the shop signs, and the worn cobblestones of the streets\r\nand flagstones of the pavements, delighted the young stranger, who\r\nfelt so unreasonably at home in Dunport. The many faces that had been\r\ncolored and fashioned by the sea were strangely different from those\r\nwhich had known an inland life only, and she seemed to have come a\r\ngreat deal nearer to foreign life and to the last century. Her heart\r\nsoftened as she wondered if her father knew that she was following his\r\nboyish footsteps, for the first time in her life, on that Sunday\r\nmorning. She would have liked to wander away by herself and find her\r\nway about the town, but such a proposal was not to be thought of, and\r\nall at once Miss Nancy turned up a narrow side street toward a\r\nhigh-walled brick church, and presently they walked side by side up\r\nthe broad aisle so far that it seemed to Nan as if her aunt were\r\naiming for the chancel itself, and had some public ceremony in view,\r\nof a penitential nature. They were by no means early, and the girl was\r\ndisagreeably aware of a little rustle of eagerness and curiosity as\r\nshe took her seat, and was glad to have fairly gained the shelter of\r\nthe high-backed pew as she bent her head. But Miss Prince the senior\r\nseemed calm; she said her prayer, settled herself as usual, putting\r\nthe footstool in its right place and finding the psalms and the\r\ncollect. She then laid the prayer-book on the cushion beside her and\r\nfolded her hands in her lap, before she turned discreetly to say\r\ngood-morning to Miss Fraley, and exchange greetings until the\r\nclergyman made his appearance. Nan had taken the seat next the pew\r\ndoor, and was looking about her with great interest, forgetting\r\nherself and her aunt as she wondered that so dear and quaint a place\r\nof worship should be still left in her iconoclastic native country.\r\nShe had seen nothing even in Boston like this, there were so many\r\nantique splendors about the chancel, and many mural tablets on the\r\nwalls, where she read with sudden delight her own family name and the\r\nlist of virtues which had belonged to some of her ancestors. The dear\r\nold place! there never had been and never could be any church like\r\nit; it seemed to have been waiting all her life for her to come to say\r\nher prayers where so many of her own people had brought their sins and\r\nsorrows in the long years that were gone. She only wished that the\r\ndoctor were with her, and the same feeling that used to make her watch\r\nfor him in her childhood until he smiled back again filled all her\r\nloving and grateful heart. She knew that he must be thinking of her\r\nthat morning; he was not in church himself, he had planned a long\r\ndrive to the next town but one, to see a dying man, who seemed to be\r\nhelped only by this beloved physician\'s presence. There had been some\r\ntalk between Dr. Leslie and Nan about a medicine which might possibly\r\nbe of use, and she found herself thinking about that again and again.\r\nShe had reminded the doctor of it and he had seemed very pleased. It\r\nmust be longer ago than yesterday since she left Oldfields, it already\r\ncounted for half a lifetime.\r\n\r\nOne listener at least was not resentful because the sermon was neither\r\nwise nor great, for she had so many things to think of; but while she\r\nwas sometimes lost in her own thoughts, Nan stole a look at the thinly\r\nfilled galleries now and then, and at one time was pleased with the\r\nsight of the red-cheeked cherubs which seemed to have been caught like\r\nclumsy insects and pinned as a sort of tawdry decoration above the\r\ntablets where the Apostle\'s Creed and the Ten Commandments were\r\nprinted in faded gilt letters. The letter s was made long in these\r\ncopies and the capitals were of an almost forgotten pattern, and after\r\nNan had discovered her grandfather\'s name in the prayer-book she held,\r\nand had tried again to listen to the discourse, she smiled at the\r\ndiscovery of a familiar face in one of the wall pews. It somehow gave\r\nher a feeling of security as being a link with her past experiences,\r\nand she looked eagerly again and again until this old acquaintance,\r\nwho also was a stranger and a guest in Dunport, happened to direct a\r\ncareless glance toward her, and a somewhat dull and gloomy expression\r\nwas changed for surprised and curious recognition. When church was\r\nover at last Miss Prince seemed to have a great deal to say to her\r\nneighbor in the next pew, and Nan stood in her place waiting until her\r\naunt was ready. More than one person had lingered to make sure of a\r\ndistinct impression of the interesting stranger who had made one of\r\nthe morning congregation, and Nan smiled suddenly as she thought that\r\nit might seem proper that she and her aunt should walk down the aisle\r\ntogether as if they had been married, or as if the ceremony were\r\nfinished which she had anticipated as they came in. And Miss Prince\r\ndid make an admirable exit from the church, mustering all her\r\nself-possession and taking stately steps at her niece\'s side, while\r\nshe sometimes politely greeted her acquaintances. There were\r\nflickering spots of color in her cheeks when they were again in the\r\nsun-shiny street.\r\n\r\n"It is really the first day this summer when I have needed my\r\nparasol," said Aunt Nancy, as she unfurled the carefully preserved\r\narticle of her wardrobe and held it primly aloft. "I am so sorry that\r\nour rector was absent this morning. I suppose that you have attended\r\nan Episcopal church sometimes; I am glad that you seem to be familiar\r\nwith the service;" to which Nancy replied that she had been confirmed\r\nwhile she was first at boarding-school, and this seemed to give her\r\naunt great satisfaction. "Very natural and proper, my dear," she said.\r\n"It is one thing I have always wished when I thought of you at serious\r\nmoments. But I was persuaded that you were far from such influences,\r\nand that there would be nothing in your surroundings to encourage your\r\ninherited love of the church."\r\n\r\n"I have always liked it best," said Nan, who seemed all at once to\r\ngrow taller. "But I think one should care more about being a good\r\nwoman than a good Episcopalian, Aunt Nancy."\r\n\r\n"No doubt," said the elder woman, a little confused and dismayed,\r\nthough she presently rallied her forces and justly observed that the\r\nrules of the church were a means to the end of good living, and\r\nhappily, before any existing differences of opinion could be\r\ndiscovered, they were interrupted by a pleasant-faced young man, who\r\nlifted his hat and gracefully accepted his introduction to the younger\r\nMiss Prince.\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. George Gerry, Anna, one of my young friends," smiled Aunt\r\nNancy, and saying, as she walked more slowly, "You must come to see\r\nus soon, for I shall have to depend upon the younger people to make my\r\nniece\'s stay agreeable."\r\n\r\n"I was looking forward to my Sunday evening visit," the wayfarer said\r\nhesitatingly; "you have not told me yet that I must not come;" which\r\nappeal was only answered by a little laugh from all three, as they\r\nseparated. And Miss Prince had time to be quite eloquent in her\r\nfavorite\'s praise before they reached home. Nan thought her first\r\nDunport acquaintance very pleasant, and frankly said so. This seemed\r\nto be very gratifying to her aunt, and they walked toward home\r\ntogether by a roundabout way and in excellent spirits. It seemed more\r\nand more absurd to Nan that the long feud and almost tragic state of\r\nfamily affairs should have come to so prosaic a conclusion, and that\r\nshe who had been the skeleton of her aunt\'s ancestral closet should\r\nhave dared to emerge and to walk by her side through the town. After\r\nall, here was another proof of the wisdom of the old Spanish proverb,\r\nthat it takes two to make a quarrel, but only one to end it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nA JUNE SUNDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Prince\'s custom to indulge herself by taking a long Sunday\r\nafternoon nap in summer, though on this occasion she spoke of it to\r\nher niece as only a short rest. She was glad to gain the shelter of\r\nher own room, and as she brushed a little dust from her handsome silk\r\ngown before putting it away she held it at arm\'s length and shook it\r\nalmost indignantly. Then she hesitated a moment and looked around the\r\ncomfortable apartment with a fierce disdain. "I wonder what gives me\r\nsuch a sense of importance," she whispered. "I have been making\r\nmistakes my whole life long, and giving excuses to myself for not\r\ndoing my duty. I wish I had made her a proper allowance, to say the\r\nleast. Everybody must be laughing at me!" and Miss Prince actually\r\nstamped her foot. It had been difficult to keep up an appearance of\r\nself-respect, but her pride had helped her in that laudable effort,\r\nand as she lay down on the couch she tried to satisfy herself with the\r\nassurance that her niece should have her rights now, and be treated\r\njustly at last.\r\n\r\nMiss Fraley had come in to pay a brief visit on her way to\r\nSunday-school just as they finished dinner, and had asked Nan to tea\r\nthe following Wednesday, expressing also a hope that she would come\r\nsooner to call, quite without ceremony. Finding the state of affairs\r\nso pleasant, Miss Eunice ventured to say that Nan\'s father had been a\r\nfavorite of her mother, who was now of uncommon age. Miss Prince\r\nbecame suddenly stern, but it was only a passing cloud, which\r\ndisturbed nobody.\r\n\r\nNan had accepted willingly the offered apologies and gayly wished her\r\naunt a pleasant dream, but being wide awake she gladly made use of the\r\nquiet time to send a letter home, and to stroll down the garden\r\nafterward. It all seemed so unlike what she had expected, yet her\r\nformer thoughts about her aunt were much more difficult to recall as\r\nevery hour went by and made the impression of actual things more\r\ndistinct. Her fancied duty to a lonely old lady who mourned over a sad\r\npast seemed quite quixotic when she watched this brisk woman come and\r\ngo without any hindrance of age, or, now that the first meeting was\r\nover, any appearance of former melancholy. As our friend went down the\r\ngarden she told herself that she was glad to have come; it was quite\r\nright, and it was very pleasant, though there was no particular use in\r\nstaying there long, and after a few days she would go away. Somehow\r\nher life seemed a great deal larger for this new experience, and she\r\nwould try to repeat the visit occasionally. She wished to get Dunport\r\nitself by heart, but she had become so used to giving the best of\r\nherself to her studies, that she was a little shy of the visiting and\r\nthe tea-parties and the apparently fruitless society life of which she\r\nhad already learned something. "I suppose the doctor would say it is\r\ngood for me," said Nan, somewhat grimly, "but I think it is most\r\nsatisfactory to be with the persons whose interests and purposes are\r\nthe same as one\'s own." The feeling of a lack of connection with the\r\npeople whom she had met made life appear somewhat blank. She had\r\nalready gained a certain degree of affection for her aunt; to say the\r\nleast she was puzzled to account for such an implacable hostility as\r\nhad lasted for years in the breast of a person so apparently friendly\r\nand cordial in her relations with her neighbors. Our heroine was slow\r\nto recognize in her relative the same strength of will and of\r\ndetermination which made the framework of her own character,--an\r\niron-like firmness of structure which could not be easily shaken by\r\nthe changes or opinions of other people. Miss Prince\'s acquaintances\r\ncalled her a very set person, and were shy of intruding into her\r\nsecret fastnesses. There were all the traits of character which are\r\nnecessary for the groundwork of an enterprising life, but Miss Prince\r\nseemed to have neither inherited nor acquired any high aims or any\r\nespecial and fruitful single-heartedness, so her gifts of persistence\r\nand self-confidence had ranked themselves for the defense of a\r\ncomparatively unimportant and commonplace existence. As has been said,\r\nshe forbade, years before, any mention of her family troubles, and had\r\nlived on before the world as if they could be annihilated, and not\r\nonly were not observable, but never had been. In a more thoughtful and\r\nactive circle of social life the contrast between her rare capacity\r\nand her unnoticeable career would have been more striking. She stood\r\nas a fine representative of the old school, but it could not be justly\r\nsaid that she was a forward scholar, since, however sure of some of\r\nher early lessons, she was most dull and reluctant before new ones of\r\nvarious enlightening and uplifting descriptions.\r\n\r\nNan had observed that her aunt had looked very tired and spent as she\r\nwent up-stairs after dinner, and understood better than she had before\r\nthat this visit was moving the waters of Miss Prince\'s soul more\r\ndeeply than had been suspected. She gained a new sympathy, and as the\r\nhours of the summer afternoon went by she thought of a great many\r\nthings which had not been quite plain to her, and strolled about the\r\ngarden until she knew that by heart, and had made friends with the\r\ndisorderly company of ladies-delights and periwinkles which had\r\ncropped up everywhere, as if the earth were capable of turning itself\r\ninto such small blossoms without anybody\'s help, after so many years\r\nof unvarying tuition. The cherry-trees and pear-trees had a most\r\nvenerable look, and the plum-trees were in dismal mourning of black\r\nknots. There was a damp and shady corner where Nan found a great many\r\nlilies of the valley still lingering, though they had some time ago\r\ngone out of bloom in the more sunshiny garden at Oldfields. She\r\nremembered that there were no flowers in the house and gathered a\r\ngreat handful at last of one sort and another to carry in.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room was very dark, and Nan wished at first to throw open\r\nthe blinds which had been carefully closed. It seemed too early in the\r\nsummer to shut out the sunshine, but it seemed also a little too soon\r\nto interfere with the housekeeping, and so she brought two or three\r\ntall champagne glasses from a high shelf of the closet and filled them\r\nwith her posies, and after putting them in their places, went back to\r\nthe garden. There was a perfect silence in the house, except for the\r\nsound of the tall clock in the dining-room, and it seemed very lonely.\r\nShe had taken another long look at her father\'s portrait, but as she\r\nshut the rusty-hinged garden gate after her, she smiled at the thought\r\nof her unusual idleness, and wondered if it need last until Tuesday,\r\nwhich was the day she had fixed upon for her departure. Nan wished\r\nthat she dared to go away for a long walk; it was a pity she had not\r\ntold her aunt of a wish to see something of the town and of the\r\nharbor-side that afternoon, but it would certainly be a little strange\r\nif she were to disappear, and very likely the long nap would soon come\r\nto an end. Being well taught in the details of gardening, she took a\r\nknife from her pocket and pruned and trained the shrubs and vines, and\r\nsang softly to herself as she thought about her next winter\'s study\r\nand her plans for the rest of the summer, and also decided that she\r\nwould insist upon the doctor\'s going away with her for a journey when\r\nshe reached home again.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while she heard her aunt open the blinds of the garden\r\ndoor and call her in most friendly tones, and when she reached the\r\nhouse Miss Prince was in the south parlor entertaining a\r\nvisitor,--Captain Walter Parish, who had gladly availed himself of\r\nsome trifling excuse of a business nature, which involved the signing\r\nand sending of a paper by the early post of next day. He was going to\r\nhis daughter\'s to tea, and it was quite a long drive to her house, so\r\nhe had not dared to put off his errand, he explained, lest he should\r\nbe detained in the evening. But he had been also longing to take a\r\nlook at Miss Prince\'s guest. His wife went to another church and he\r\ndutifully accompanied her, though he had been brought up with Miss\r\nPrince at old St. Ann\'s.\r\n\r\n"So this is my young cousin?" said the captain gallantly, and with\r\ngreat simplicity and tenderness held both Nan\'s hands and looked full\r\nin her face a moment before he kissed her; then to Miss Prince\'s great\r\ndiscomposure and embarrassment he turned to the window and looked out\r\nwithout saying a word, though he drew the back of his hand across his\r\neyes in sailor-fashion, as if he wished to make them clear while he\r\nsighted something on the horizon. Miss Prince thought it was all\r\nnonsense and would have liked to say so, though she trusted that her\r\nsilence was eloquent enough.\r\n\r\n"She brings back the past," said Captain Walter as he returned\r\npresently and seated himself where he could look at Nan as much as he\r\nliked. "She brings back the past."\r\n\r\n"You were speaking of old Captain Slater," reminded Miss Prince with\r\nsome dignity.\r\n\r\n"I just came from there," said Captain Parish, with his eyes still\r\nfixed on his young relative, though it was with such a friendly gaze\r\nthat Nan was growing fonder of him every minute. "They told me he was\r\nabout the same as yesterday. I offered to watch with him to-morrow\r\nnight. And how do you like the looks of Dunport, my dear?"\r\n\r\nNan answered eagerly with brightening face, and added that she was\r\nlonging to see more of it; the old wharves especially.\r\n\r\n"Now that\'s good," said the captain; "I wonder if you would care\r\nanything about taking a stroll with me in the morning. Your aunt here\r\nis a famous housekeeper, and will be glad to get you off her hands, I\r\ndare say."\r\n\r\nNan eagerly accepted, and though it was suggested that Miss Prince had\r\na plan for showing the town in the afternoon, she was promptly told\r\nthat there was nothing easier than taking both these pleasant\r\nopportunities. "You would lose yourself among the old storehouses, I\'m\r\nsure, Nancy," laughed the old sailor, "and you must let me have my\r\nway. It\'s a chance one doesn\'t get every day, to tell the old Dunport\r\nstories to a new listener."\r\n\r\nSome one had opened the front door, and was heard coming along the\r\nhall. "This is very kind, George," said Miss Prince, with much\r\npleasure, while the captain looked a little disconcerted at his young\r\nrival; he assured himself that he would make a long morning\'s cruise\r\nof it, next day, with this attractive sightseer, and for once the\r\nyoung beaux would be at a disadvantage; the girls of his own day used\r\nto think him one of the best of their gallants, and at this thought\r\nthe captain was invincible. Mr. Gerry must take the second chance.\r\n\r\nThe blinds were open now, and the old room seemed very pleasant. Nan\'s\r\nbrown hair had been blown about not a little in the garden, and as she\r\nsat at the end of the long, brass-nailed sofa, a ray of sunshine\r\ntouched the glass of a picture behind her and flew forward again to\r\ntangle itself in her stray locks, so that altogether there was a sort\r\nof golden halo about her pretty head. And young Gerry thought he had\r\nnever seen anything so charming. The white frock was a welcome\r\naddition to the usually sombre room, and his eyes quickly saw the\r\nflowers on the table. He knew instantly that the bouquet was none of\r\nMiss Prince\'s gathering.\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t think I mean to stay as much too late as I have come\r\ntoo early," he laughed. "I must go away soon after tea, for I have\r\npromised to talk with the captain of a schooner which is to sail in\r\nthe morning. Mr. Wills luckily found out that he could give some\r\nevidence in a case we are working up."\r\n\r\n"The collision?" asked Captain Parish, eagerly. "I was wondering\r\nto-day when I saw the Highflyer\'s foremast between the buildings on\r\nFleet Street as I went to meeting, if they were going to let her lie\r\nthere and dry-rot. I don\'t think she\'s being taken proper care of. I\r\nmust say I hate to see a good vessel go to ruin when there\'s no need\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"The man in charge was recommended very highly, and everything seemed\r\nto be all right when I was on board one day this week," said young\r\nGerry, good-naturedly, and turned to explain to Nan that this vessel\r\nhad been damaged by collision with another, and the process of\r\nsettling the matter by litigation had been provokingly slow.\r\n\r\nThe captain listened with impatience. "I dare say she looked very well\r\nto your eyes, but I\'d rather have an old ship-master\'s word for it\r\nthan a young lawyer\'s. I haven\'t boarded her for some weeks; I dare\r\nsay \'twas before the snow was gone; but she certainly needed attention\r\nthen. I saw some bad-looking places in the sheathing and planking.\r\nThere ought to be a coat of paint soon, and plenty of tar carried\r\naloft besides, or there\'ll be a long bill for somebody to pay before\r\nshe\'s seaworthy."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would make a careful inspection of her," said the young\r\nman, with gratifying deference. "I don\'t doubt that it is necessary; I\r\nwill see that you are well satisfied for your services. Of course the\r\ncaptain himself should have stayed there and kept charge, but you\r\nremember he was sick and had to resign. He looks feeble yet. I hope\r\nnothing will happen to him before the matter is settled up, but we are\r\nsure of the trial in September."\r\n\r\n"She\'s going to be rigged with some of your red tape, I\'m afraid,"\r\nsaid Captain Parish, with great friendliness. "I don\'t see any reason\r\nwhy I can\'t look her over to-morrow morning, I\'m obliged to you, or at\r\nleast make a beginning," and he gave a most knowing nod at Nan, as if\r\nthey would divide the pleasure. "I\'ll make the excuse of showing this\r\nyoung lady the construction of a good-sized merchant vessel, and then\r\nthe keeper can\'t feel affronted. She is going to take a stroll with me\r\nalong the wharves," he concluded triumphantly. While Mr. Gerry looked\r\nwistful for a moment, and Miss Prince quickly took advantage of a\r\npause in the conversation to ask if he knew whether anything pleasant\r\nwas going forward among the young people this week. She did not wish\r\nher niece to have too dull a visit.\r\n\r\n"Some of us are going up the river very soon," said the young man,\r\nwith eager pleasure, looking at Nan. "It would be so pleasant if Miss\r\nPrince would join us. We think our Dunport supper parties of that sort\r\nwould be hard to match."\r\n\r\n"The young folks will all be flocking here by to-morrow," said the\r\ncaptain; and Miss Prince answered "Surely," in a tone of command,\r\nrather than entreaty. She knew very well how the news of Nan\'s coming\r\nmust be flying about the town, and she almost regretted the fact of\r\nher own previous silence about this great event. In the mean time Nan\r\nwas talking to the two gentlemen as if she had already been to her\r\nroom to smooth her hair, which her aunt looked at reproachfully from\r\ntime to time, though the sunshine had not wholly left it. The girl was\r\nquite unconscious of herself, and glad to have the company and\r\nsympathy of these kind friends. She thought once that if she had a\r\nbrother she would like him to be of young Mr. Gerry\'s fashion. He had\r\nnone of the manner which constantly insisted upon her remembering that\r\nhe was a man and she a girl; she could be good friends with him in the\r\nsame way that she had been with some Oldfields schoolfellows, and\r\nafter the captain had reluctantly taken his leave, they had a pleasant\r\ntalk about out-of-door life and their rides and walks, and were soon\r\nexchanging experiences in a way that Miss Nancy smiled upon gladly. It\r\nwas not to be wondered at that she could not get used to so great a\r\nchange in her life. She could not feel sure yet that she no longer had\r\na secret, and that this was the niece whom she had so many years\r\ndreaded and disclaimed. George Gerry had taken the niece\'s place in\r\nher affections, yet here was Anna, her own namesake, who showed\r\nplainly in so many ways the same descent as herself, being as much a\r\nPrince as herself in spite of her mother\'s low origin and worse\r\npersonal traits, and the loutish companions to whom she had always\r\npersuaded herself poor Nan was akin. And it was by no means sure that\r\nthe last of the Princes was not the best of them; she was very proud\r\nof her brother\'s daughter, and was more at a loss to know how to make\r\nexcuses for being shortsighted and neglectful. Miss Prince hated to\r\nthink that Nan had any but the pleasantest associations with her\r\nnearest relative; she must surely keep the girl\'s affection now. She\r\nmeant to insist at any rate upon Dunport\'s being her niece\'s home for\r\nthe future, though undoubtedly it would be hard at first to break with\r\nthe many associations of Oldfields. She must write that very night to\r\nDr. Leslie to thank him for his care, and to again express her regret\r\nthat Anna\'s misguided young mother should have placed such\r\nrestrictions upon the child\'s relations with her nearest of kin, and\r\nso have broken the natural ties of nature. And she would not stop\r\nthere; she would blame herself generously and say how sorry she was\r\nthat she had been governed by her painful recollections of a time she\r\nshould now strive to forget. Dr. Leslie must be asked to come and join\r\nhis ward for a few days, and then they would settle her plans for the\r\nfuture. She should give her niece a handsome allowance at any rate,\r\nand then, as Miss Prince looked across the room and forgot her own\r\nthoughts in listening to the young people\'s friendly talk, a sudden\r\npurpose flashed through her mind. The dream of her heart began to\r\nunfold itself slowly: could anything be so suitable, so comforting to\r\nher own mind, as that they should marry each other?\r\n\r\nTwo days before, her pleasure and pride in the manly fellow, who was\r\nalmost as dear to her as an own son could be, would have been greatly\r\nshocked, but Miss Prince\'s heart began to beat quickly. It would be\r\nsuch a blessed solution of all the puzzles and troubles of her life if\r\nshe could have both the young people near her through the years that\r\nremained, and when she died, or even before, they could live here in\r\nthe old house, and begin a new and better order of things in the place\r\nof her own failures and shortcomings. It was all so distinct and\r\npossible in Miss Prince\'s mind that only time seemed necessary, and\r\neven the time could be made short. She would not put any hindrances\r\nbetween them and their blessed decision. As she went by them to seek\r\nPriscilla, she smoothed the cushion which Nan had leaned upon before\r\nshe moved a little nearer George Gerry in some sudden excitement of\r\nthe conversation, which had begun while the captain was still there,\r\nand there was a needless distance between them. Then Miss Prince let\r\nher hand rest for a minute on the girl\'s soft hair. "You must ask Mr.\r\nGerry to excuse you for a few minutes, my dear, you have been quite\r\nblown about in the garden. I meant to join you there."\r\n\r\n"It is a dear old garden," said Nan. "I can\'t help being almost as\r\nfond of it already as I am of ours at home;" but though Aunt Nancy\'s\r\nunwonted caress had been so unlike her conduct in general, this\r\nreference to Oldfields called her to her senses, and she went quickly\r\naway. She did not like to hear Nan speak in such loving fashion of a\r\nhouse where she had no real right.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. George Gerry was left alone, he had pleasant thoughts\r\ncome flocking in to keep him company in the ladies\' stead. He had not\r\ndreamed of such a pleasure as this; who could have? and what could\r\nAunt Nancy think of herself!\r\n\r\n"It is such a holiday," said Nan, when tea was fairly begun, and her\r\nnew friend was acknowledging an uncommon attack of hunger, and they\r\nwere all merry in a sedate way to suit Miss Prince\'s ideas and\r\npreferences. "I have been quite the drudge this winter over my\r\nstudies, and I feel young and idle again, now that I am making all\r\nthese pleasant plans." For Mr. Gerry had been talking enthusiastically\r\nabout some excursions he should arrange to certain charming places in\r\nthe region of Dunport. Both he and Miss Prince smiled when Nan\r\nannounced that she was young and idle, and a moment afterward the aunt\r\nasked doubtfully about her niece\'s studies; she supposed that Anna was\r\ndone with schools.\r\n\r\nNan stopped her hand as it reached for the cup which Miss Prince had\r\njust filled. "School; yes," she answered, somewhat bewildered; "but\r\nyou know I am studying medicine." This most important of all facts had\r\nbeen so present to her own mind, even in the excitement and novelty of\r\nher new surroundings, that she could not understand that her aunt was\r\nstill entirely ignorant of the great purpose of her life.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" demanded Miss Prince, coldly, and quickly\r\nexplained to their somewhat amused and astonished companion, "My niece\r\nhas been the ward of a distinguished physician, and it is quite\r\nnatural she should have become interested in his pursuits."\r\n\r\n"But I am really studying medicine; it is to be my profession,"\r\npersisted Nan fearlessly, though she was sorry that she had spoiled\r\nthe harmony of the little company. "And my whole heart is in it, Aunt\r\nNancy."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, my dear," returned Miss Prince, who had recovered her\r\nself-possession partially. "Your father gave promise of attaining\r\ngreat eminence in a profession that was very proper for him, but I\r\nthought better of Dr. Leslie than this. I cannot understand his\r\nindulgence of such a silly notion."\r\n\r\nGeorge Gerry felt very uncomfortable. He had been a good deal shocked,\r\nbut he had a strong impulse to rush into the field as Nan\'s champion,\r\nthough it were quite against his conscience. She had been too long in\r\na humdrum country-town with no companion but an elderly medical man.\r\nAnd after a little pause he made a trifling joke about their making\r\nthe best of the holiday, and the talk was changed to other subjects.\r\nThe tide was strong against our heroine, but she had been assailed\r\nbefore, and had no idea of sorrowing yet over a lost cause. And for\r\nonce Miss Prince was in a hurry for Mr. Gerry to go away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nBY THE RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Nan went down the street next morning with Captain Parish, who had\r\nbeen most prompt in keeping his appointment, they were met by Mr.\r\nGerry and a young girl who proved to be Captain Parish\'s niece and the\r\nbearer of a cordial invitation. It would be just the evening for a\r\nboat-party, and it was hoped that Miss Prince the younger would be\r\nready to go up the river at half-past five.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, yes," said the captain; "your aunt will be pleased to have\r\nyou go, I\'m sure. These idle young folks mustn\'t expect us to turn\r\nback now, though, to have a visit from you. We have no end of business\r\non hand."\r\n\r\n"If Miss Prince will remember that I was really on my way to see her,"\r\nsaid Mary Parish pleasantly, while she looked with eager interest at\r\nthe stranger. The two girls were quite ready to be friends. "We will\r\njust stop to tell your aunt, lest she should make some other plan for\r\nyou," she added, giving Nan a nod that was almost affectionate. "We\r\nhave hardly used the boats this year, it has been such a cold, late\r\nspring, and we hope for a very good evening. George and I will call\r\nfor you," and George, who had been listening to a suggestion about the\r\nship business, smiled with pleasure as they separated.\r\n\r\n"Nice young people," announced the captain, who was in a sympathetic\r\nmood. "There has been some reason for thinking that they meant to take\r\nup with each other for good and all. I don\'t know that either of them\r\ncould do better, though I like the girl best; that\'s natural; she\'s my\r\nbrother\'s daughter, and I was her guardian; she only came of age last\r\nyear. Her father and yours were boys together, younger than I am by a\r\ndozen years, both gone before me too," sighed the captain, and quickly\r\nchanged so sad a subject by directing his companion\'s attention to one\r\nof the old houses, and telling the story of it as they walked along.\r\nLuckily they had the Highflyer all to themselves when they reached the\r\nwharf, for the keeper had gone up into the town, and his wife, who had\r\nset up a frugal housekeeping in the captain\'s cabin, sat in the shade\r\nof the house with her sewing, the Monday\'s washing having been early\r\nspread to the breeze in a corner of the main deck. She accepted\r\nCaptain Parish\'s explanations of his presence with equanimity, and\r\nseemed surprised and amused at the young landswoman\'s curiosity and\r\neagerness, for a ship was as commonplace to herself as any farm-house\r\nashore.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! you wouldn\'t know it was the same place," said the captain,\r\nin the course of his enumeration of the ropes and yards and other\r\nmysterious furnishings of the old craft. "With a good crew aboard,\r\nthis deck is as busy as a town every day. I don\'t know how I\'m going\r\nbelow until the keeper gets back. I suppose you don\'t want me to show\r\nyou the road to the main-to\'gallant cross-trees; once I knew it as\r\nwell as anybody, and I could make quicker time now than most of the\r\nyoungsters," and the captain gave a knowing glance aloft, while at\r\nthis moment somebody crossed the gangway plank. It was a broken-down\r\nold sailor, who was a familiar sight in Dunport.\r\n\r\n"Mornin\' to you, sir," and the master of the Highflyer, for the time\r\nbeing, returned the salute with a mixture of dignity and friendliness.\r\n\r\n"Goin\' to take command?" chuckled the bent old fellow. "I\'d like to\r\nship under ye; \'twouldn\'t be the first time," and he gave his hat an\r\nunsettling shake with one hand as he looked at Nan for some sign of\r\nrecognition, which was quickly given.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve shipped under better masters than I. Any man who followed the\r\nsea with Cap\'n Jack Prince had more to teach than to learn. And here\'s\r\nhis grand-daughter before you, and does him credit too," said Captain\r\nWalter. "Anna, you won\'t find many of your grandfather\'s men about the\r\nold wharves, but here\'s one of the smartest that ever had hold of a\r\nhawser."\r\n\r\n"Goodsoe by name: I thank ye kindly, cap\'n, but I ain\'t much account\r\nnowadays," said the pleased old man, trying to get the captain\'s\r\nstartling announcement well settled in his mind. "Old Cap\'n Jack\r\nPrince\'s grand-darter? Why Miss Nancy\'s never been brought to change\r\nher mind about nothing, has she?"\r\n\r\n"It seems so," answered Nan\'s escort, laughing as if this were a good\r\njoke; and Nan herself could not help smiling.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe if the old gentleman can look down at ye he begrudges\r\nthe worst of his voyages nor the blackest night he ever spent on deck,\r\nif you\'re going to have the spending of the money. Not but what Miss\r\nPrince has treated me handsome right straight along," the old sailor\r\nexplained, while the inspector, thinking this not a safe subject to\r\ncontinue, spoke suddenly about some fault of the galley; and after\r\nthis was discussed, the eyes of the two practiced men sought the\r\ndamaged mizzen mast, the rigging of which was hanging in snarled and\r\nbroken lengths. When Nan asked for some account of the accident, she\r\nwas told with great confidence that the Highflyer had been fouled, and\r\nthat it was the other vessel\'s fault; at which she was no wiser than\r\nbefore, having known already that there had been a collision. There\r\nseemed to be room enough on the high seas, she ventured to say, or\r\nmight the mischief have been done in port?\r\n\r\n"It does seem as if you ought to know the sense of sea talk without\r\nany learning, being Cap\'n Jack Prince\'s grand-darter," said old\r\nGoodsoe; for Captain Parish had removed himself to a little distance,\r\nand was again investigating the condition of the ship\'s galley, which\r\none might suppose to have been neglected in some unforgivable way,\r\njudging from his indignant grumble.\r\n\r\n"Fouled, we say aboard ship, when two vessels lay near enough so that\r\nthey drift alongside. You can see what havick \'t would make, for ten\r\nto one they don\'t part again till they have tore each other all to\r\nshoestrings; the yards will get locked together, and the same wind\r\nthat starts one craft starts both, and first one and then t\'other\r\nlifts with a wave, don\'t ye see, and the rigging\'s spoilt in a little\r\ntime. I\'ve sometimes called it to mind when I\'ve known o\' married\r\ncouples that wasn\'t getting on. \'T is easy to drift alongside, but no\r\nmatter if they was bound to the same port they\'d \'a\' done best alone;"\r\nand the old fellow shook his head solemnly, and was evidently\r\nselecting one of his numerous stories for Nan\'s edification, when his\r\nsuperior officer came bustling toward them.\r\n\r\n"You might as well step down here about four o\'clock; I shall have the\r\nkeys then. I may want you to hold a lantern for me; I\'m going into the\r\nlower hold and mean to do my work thoroughly, if I do it at all," to\r\nwhich Goodsoe responded "ay, ay, sir," in most seamanlike fashion and\r\nhobbled off.\r\n\r\n"He\'d have kept you there all day," whispered Captain Walter. "He\r\nalways loved to talk, and now he has nothing else to do; but we are\r\nall friendly to Goodsoe. Some of us pay a little every year toward his\r\nsupport, but he has always made himself very useful about the wharves\r\nuntil this last year or two; he thought everything of your\r\ngrandfather, and I knew it would please him to speak to you. It seems\r\nunfortunate that you should have grown up anywhere else than here; but\r\nI hope you\'ll stay now?"\r\n\r\n"It is not very likely," said Nan coldly. She wished that the captain\r\nwould go on with his stories of the former grandeur of Dunport, rather\r\nthan show any desire to talk about personal matters. She had been\r\nlittle troubled at first by her aunt\'s evident disapproval the evening\r\nbefore of her plans for the future, for she was so intent upon\r\ncarrying them out and certain that no one had any right to interfere.\r\nStill it would have been better to have been violently opposed than to\r\nhave been treated like a child whose foolish whim would soon be\r\nforgotten when anything better offered itself. Nan felt much older\r\nthan most girls of her years, and as if her decisions were quite as\r\nmuch to be respected as her aunt\'s. She had dealt already with graver\r\nquestions than most persons, and her responsibilities had by no means\r\nbeen light ones. She felt sometimes as if she were separated by half a\r\nlifetime from the narrow limits of school life. Yet there was an\r\nuncommon childlikeness about her which not only misled these new\r\nfriends, but many others who had known her longer. And when these\r\nlistened to accounts of her devotion to her present studies and her\r\nmarked proficiency, they shook their wise heads smilingly, as if they\r\nknew that the girl was innocent of certain proper and insurmountable\r\nobstacles farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air was fresh, and it was so pleasant on the wharf that the\r\ncaptain paced to and fro several times, while he pointed out different\r\nobjects of interest along the harbor-side, and tapped the rusty anchor\r\nand the hawsers with his walking-stick as he went by. He had made some\r\nvery pointed statements to the keeper\'s wife about the propriety of\r\nopening the hatches on such a morning as that, which she had received\r\nwithout comment, and wished her guests good-day with provoking\r\nequanimity. The captain did not like to have his authority ignored,\r\nbut mentioned placidly that he supposed every idler along shore had\r\nbeen giving advice; though he wondered what Nan\'s grandfather and old\r\nCaptain Peterbeck would have said if any one had told them this would\r\nbe the only square-rigged vessel in Dunport harbor for weeks at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" he exclaimed again presently, "there\'s young Gerry hard at\r\nwork!" and he directed his companion\'s attention to one of the upper\r\nwindows of the buildings whose fronts had two stories on the main\r\nstreet, while there were five or six on the rear, which faced the\r\nriver. Nan could see the diligent young man and thought it hard that\r\nany one must be drudging within doors that beautiful morning.\r\n\r\n"He has always been a great favorite of your aunt\'s," said Captain\r\nParish, confidentially, after the law student had pretended to\r\nsuddenly catch sight of the saunterers, and waved a greeting which the\r\ncaptain exultantly returned. "We have always thought that she was\r\nlikely to make him her heir. She was very fond of his father, you see,\r\nand some trouble came between them. Nobody ever knew, because if\r\nanybody ever had wit enough to keep her own counsel \'twas Nancy\r\nPrince. I know as much about her affairs as anybody, and what I say to\r\nyou is between ourselves. I know just how far to sail with her and\r\nwhen to stop, if I don\'t want to get wrecked on a lee shore. Your aunt\r\nhas known how to take care of what she had come to her, and I\'ve done\r\nthe best I could to help her; it\'s a very handsome property,--very\r\nhandsome indeed. She helped George Gerry to get his education, and\r\nthen he had some little money left him by his father\'s brother,--no\r\ngreat amount, but enough to give him a start; he\'s a very smart,\r\nupright fellow, and I am glad for whatever Nancy did for him; but it\r\ndidn\'t seem fair that he should be stepping into your rights. But I\r\nnever have dared to speak up for you since one day--she wouldn\'t hear\r\na word about it, that\'s all I have to remark," the captain concluded\r\nin a hurry, for wisdom\'s sake, though he longed to say more. It seemed\r\noutrageous to him at this moment that the girl at his side should have\r\nbeen left among strangers, and he was thankful that she seemed at last\r\nto have a good chance of making sure of her rightful possessions.\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t needed anything," she said, giving Captain Walter a\r\ngrateful glance for his championship. "And Mr. Gerry is very kind and\r\nattentive to my aunt, so I am glad she has been generous to him. He\r\nseems a fine fellow, as you say," and Nan thought suddenly that it was\r\nvery hard for him to have had her appear on the scene by way of rival,\r\nif he had been led to suppose that he was her aunt\'s heir. There were\r\nso many new things to think of, that Nan had a bewildering sense of\r\nbeing a stranger and a foreigner in this curiously self-centred\r\nDunport, and a most disturbing element to its peace of mind. She\r\nwondered if, since she had not grown up here, it would not have been\r\nbetter to have stayed away altogether. Her own life had always been\r\nquite unvexed by any sort of social complications, and she thought how\r\ngood it would be to leave this talkative and staring little world and\r\ngo back to Oldfields and its familiar interests and associations. But\r\nDunport was a dear old place, and the warm-hearted captain a most\r\nentertaining guide, and by the time their walk was over, the day\r\nseemed a most prosperous and entertaining one. Aunt Nancy appeared to\r\nbe much pleased with the plan for the afternoon, and announced that\r\nshe had asked some of the young people to come to drink tea the next\r\nevening, while she greeted Nan so kindly that the home-coming was\r\nparticularly pleasant. As for the captain, he was unmistakably happy,\r\nand went off down the street with a gentle, rolling gait, and a smile\r\nupon his face that fairly matched the June weather, though he was more\r\nthan an hour late for the little refreshment with which he and certain\r\ndignified associates commonly provided themselves at eleven o\'clock in\r\nthe forenoon. Life was as regular ashore as on board ship with these\r\nidle mariners of high degree. There was no definite business among\r\nthem except that of occasionally settling an estate, and the forming\r\nof decided opinions upon important questions of the past and future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shadows had begun to grow long when the merry company of young\r\npeople went up river with the tide, and Nan thought she had seldom\r\nknown such a pleasure away from her own home. She begged for the\r\noars, and kept stroke with George Gerry, pulling so well that they\r\nquickly passed the other boat. Mary Parish and the friend who made the\r\nfourth of that division of the party sat in the stern and steered with\r\nfine dexterity, and the two boats kept near each other, so that Nan\r\nsoon lost all feeling of strangeness, and shared in the good\r\ncomradeship to which she had been willingly admitted. It was some time\r\nsince she had been on the water before, and she thought more than once\r\nof her paddling about the river in her childhood, and even regaled the\r\ncompany once with a most amusing mishap, at the remembrance of which\r\nshe had been forced to laugh outright. The river was broad and brimful\r\nof water; it seemed high tide already, and the boats pulled easily.\r\nThe fields sloped down to the river-banks, shaded with elms and parted\r\nby hedgerows like a bit of English country. The freshest bloom of the\r\nJune greenness was in every blade of grass and every leaf. The birds\r\nwere beginning to sing the long day to a close, and the lowing of\r\ncattle echoed from the pastures again and again across the water;\r\nwhile the country boats were going home from the town, sometimes with\r\na crew of women, who seemed to have made this their regular conveyance\r\ninstead of following the more roundabout highways ashore. Some of\r\nthese navigators rowed with a cross-handed stroke that jerked their\r\nboats along in a droll fashion, and some were propelled by one groping\r\noar, the sculler standing at the stern as if he were trying to push\r\nhis craft out of water altogether and take to the air, toward which\r\nthe lifted bow pointed. And in one of the river reaches half a mile\r\nahead, two heavy packet boats, with high-peaked lateen sails, like a\r\ngreat bird\'s single wing, were making all the speed they could toward\r\nport before the tide should begin to fall two hours later. The young\r\nguest of the party was very happy; she had spent so many of her\r\nchildish days out of doors that a return to such pleasures always\r\nfilled her with strange delight. The color was bright in her cheeks,\r\nand her half-forgotten girlishness came back in the place of the\r\ngravity and dignity that had brought of late a sedate young\r\nwomanliness to her manner. The two new friends in the stern of the\r\nboat were greatly attracted to her, and merry laughter rang out now\r\nand then. Nan was so brave and handsome, so willing to be pleased, and\r\nso grateful to them for this little festivity, that they quickly\r\nbecame interested in each other, as girls will. The commander thought\r\nhimself a fortunate fellow, and took every chance of turning his head\r\nto catch a glimpse of our heroine, though he always had a good excuse\r\nof taking his bearings or inspecting for himself some object afloat or\r\nashore which one of the boat\'s company had pointed out. And Nan must\r\nbe told the names of the distant hills which stood out clear in the\r\nafternoon light, and to what towns up river the packet boats were\r\nbound, and so the time seemed short before the light dory was run in\r\namong the coarse river grass and pulled up higher than seemed\r\nnecessary upon the shore.\r\n\r\nTheir companions had not chosen so fleet a craft, and were five\r\ninstead of four at any rate, but they were welcomed somewhat\r\nderisively, and all chattered together in a little crowd for a few\r\nminutes before they started for a bit of woodland which overhung the\r\nriver on a high point. The wind rustled the oak leaves and roughened\r\nthe surface of the water, which spread out into a wide inland bay. The\r\nclouds began to gather in the west and to take on wonderful colors, as\r\nif such a day must be ended with a grand ceremony, and the sun go down\r\nthrough banners and gay parades of all the forces of the sky. Nan had\r\nwatched such sunsets from her favorite playground at the farm, and\r\nsomehow the memory of those days touched her heart more tenderly than\r\nthey had ever done before, and she wished for a moment that she could\r\nget away from the noisy little flock who were busy getting the supper\r\nready, though they said eagerly what a beautiful evening it would be\r\nto go back to town, and that they must go far up the river first to\r\nmeet the moonlight.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Nan heard some one say that water must be brought\r\nfrom a farm-house not far away, and quickly insisted that she should\r\nmake one of the messengers, and after much discussion and\r\nremonstrance, she and young Gerry found themselves crossing the open\r\nfield together. The girl had left her hat swinging from one of the low\r\noak branches; she wondered why Mary Parish had looked at her first as\r\nif she were very fond of her, and then almost appealingly, until the\r\nremembrance of Captain Walter\'s bit of gossip came to mind too late to\r\nbe acted upon. Nan felt a sudden sympathy, and was sorry she had not\r\nthought to share with this favorite among her new friends, the\r\ncompanion whom she had joined so carelessly. George Gerry had some\r\nvery attractive ways. He did not trouble Nan with unnecessary\r\nattentions, as some young men had, and she told herself again, how\r\nmuch she liked him. They walked fast, with free, light steps, and\r\ntalked as they went in a way that was very pleasant to both of them.\r\nNan was wise to a marvel, the good fellow told himself, and yet such\r\nan amusing person. He did not know when he had liked anybody so much;\r\nhe was very glad to stand well in the sight of these sweet, clear\r\neyes, and could not help telling their owner some of the things that\r\nlay very near his heart. He had wished to get away from Dunport; he\r\nhad not room there; everybody knew him as well as they knew the\r\ncourthouse; he somehow wanted to get to deeper water, and out of his\r\ndepth, and then swim for it with the rest. And Nan listened with deep\r\nsympathy, for she also had felt that a great engine of strength and\r\nambition was at work with her in her plans and studies.\r\n\r\nShe waited until he should have finished his confidence, to say a word\r\nfrom her own experience, but just then they reached the farm-house and\r\nstood together at the low door. There was a meagre show of flowers in\r\nthe little garden, which the dripping eaves had beaten and troubled in\r\nthe late rains, and one rosebush was loosely caught to the clapboards\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\nThere did not seem to be anybody in the kitchen, into which they could\r\nlook through the open doorway, though they could hear steps and voices\r\nfrom some part of the house beyond it; and it was not until they had\r\nknocked again loudly that a woman came to answer them, looking worried\r\nand pale.\r\n\r\n"I never was so glad to see folks, though I don\'t know who you be,"\r\nshe said hurriedly. "I believe I shall have to ask you to go for help.\r\nMy man\'s got hurt; he managed to get home, but he\'s broke his\r\nshoulder, or any ways \'tis out o\' place. He was to the pasture, and\r\nwe\'ve got some young cattle, and somehow or \'nother one he\'d caught\r\nand was meaning to lead home give a jump, and John lost his balance;\r\nhe says he can\'t see how \'t should \'a\' happened, but over he went and\r\ngot jammed against a rock before he could let go o\' the rope he\'d put\r\nround the critter\'s neck. He\'s in dreadful pain so \'t I couldn\'t leave\r\nhim, and there\'s nobody but me an\' the baby. You\'ll have to go to the\r\nnext house and ask them to send; Doctor Bent\'s always attended of us."\r\n\r\n"Let me see him," said Nan with decision. "Wait a minute, Mr. Gerry,\r\nor perhaps you had better come in too," and she led the way, while the\r\nsurprised young man and the mistress of the house followed her. The\r\npatient was a strong young fellow, who sat on the edge of the bed in\r\nthe little kitchen-bedroom, pale as ashes, and holding one elbow with\r\na look of complete misery, though he stopped his groans as the\r\nstrangers came in.\r\n\r\n"Lord bless you, young man! don\'t wait here," he said; "tell the\r\ndoctor it may only be out o\' place, but I feel as if \'twas broke."\r\n\r\nBut Nan had taken a pair of scissors from the high mantelpiece and was\r\nmaking a cut in the coarse, white shirt, which was already torn and\r\nstained by its contact with the ground, and with quick fingers and a\r\nlook of deep interest made herself sure what had happened, when she\r\nstood still for a minute and seemed a little anxious, and all at once\r\nentirely determined. "Just lie down on the floor a minute," she said,\r\nand the patient with some exclamations, but no objections, obeyed.\r\n\r\nNan pushed the spectators into the doorway of the kitchen, and quickly\r\nstooped and unbuttoned her right boot, and then planted her foot on\r\nthe damaged shoulder and caught up the hand and gave a quick pull, the\r\nsecret of which nobody understood; but there was an unpleasant cluck\r\nas the bone went back into its socket, and a yell from the sufferer,\r\nwho scrambled to his feet.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged if she ain\'t set it," he said, looking quite weak and\r\nvery much astonished. "You\'re the smartest young woman I ever see. I\r\nshall have to lay down just to pull my wits together. Marthy, a drink\r\nof water," and by the time this was brought the excitement seemed to\r\nbe at an end, though the patient was a little faint, and his wife\r\nlooked at Nan admiringly. Nan herself was fastening her boot again\r\nwith unwonted composure. George Gerry had not a word to say, and\r\nlistened to a simple direction of Nan\'s as if it were meant for him,\r\nand acceded to her remark that she was glad for the shoulder\'s sake\r\nthat it did not have to wait and grow worse and worse all the while\r\nthe doctor was being brought from town. And after a few minutes, when\r\nthe volley of thanks and compliments could be politely cut short, the\r\ntwo members of the picnic party set forth with their pail of water to\r\njoin their companions.\r\n\r\n"Will you be so good as to tell me how you knew enough to do that?"\r\nasked Mr. Gerry humbly, and looking at his companion with admiration.\r\n"I should not have had the least idea."\r\n\r\n"I was very glad it turned out so well," said Nan simply. "It was a\r\ngreat pleasure to be of use, they were so frightened, poor things. We\r\nwon\'t say anything about it, will we?"\r\n\r\nBut the young man did not like to think yet of the noise the returning\r\nbone had made. He was stout-hearted enough usually; as brave a fellow\r\nas one could wish to see; but he felt weak and womanish, and somehow\r\nwished it had been he who could play the doctor. Nan hurried back\r\nbareheaded to the oak grove as if nothing had happened, though, if\r\npossible, she looked gayer and brighter than ever. And when the\r\nwaiting party scolded a little at their slow pace, Miss Prince was\r\nmuch amused and made two or three laughing apologies for their\r\nlaziness, and even ventured to give the information that they had made\r\na pleasant call at the farm-house.\r\n\r\nThe clouds were fading fast and the twilight began to gather under the\r\ntrees before they were ready to go away, and then the high tide had\r\nfloated off one of the boats, which must be chased and brought back.\r\nBut presently the picnickers embarked, and, as the moon came up, and\r\nthe river ebbed, the boats went back to the town and overtook others\r\non the way, and then were pulled up stream again in the favoring eddy\r\nto make the evening\'s pleasure longer; at last Nan was left at her\r\ndoor. She had managed that George Gerry should give Mary Parish his\r\narm, and told them, as they came up the street with her from the\r\nwharf, that she had heard their voices Saturday night as they passed\r\nunder her window: it was Mary Parish herself who had talked about the\r\nbest room and its ghosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nA SERIOUS TEA-DRINKING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very good for Nan to find herself cordially welcomed to a\r\ncompany of young people who had little thought of anything but\r\namusement in the pleasant summer weather. Other young guests came to\r\nDunport just then, and the hospitable town seemed to give itself up to\r\ntheir entertainment. Picnics and tea-drinkings followed each other,\r\nand the pleasure boats went up river and down river, while there were\r\nwalks and rides and drives, and all manner of contrivances and excuses\r\nfor spending much time together on the part of the young men and\r\nmaidens. It was a good while since Nan had taken such a long holiday,\r\nthough she had by no means been without the pleasures of society. Not\r\nonly had she made friends easily during her school-life and her later\r\nstudies, but Oldfields itself, like all such good old nests, was apt\r\nto call back its wandering fledglings when the June weather came. It\r\ndelighted her more and more to be in Dunport, and though she sometimes\r\ngrew impatient, wise Dr. Leslie insisted that she must not hurry home.\r\nThe change was the very best thing in the world for her. Dr. Ferris\r\nhad alighted for a day or two in the course of one of his wandering\r\nflights; and it seemed to the girl that since everything was getting\r\non so well without her in Oldfields, she had better, as the doctor had\r\nalready expressed it, let her visit run its course like a fever. At\r\nany rate she could not come again very soon, and since her aunt seemed\r\nso happy, it was a pity to hurry away and end these days sooner than\r\nneed be. It had been a charming surprise to find herself such a\r\ndesired companion, and again and again quite the queen of that little\r\ncourt of frolickers, because lately she had felt like one who looks on\r\nat such things, and cannot make part of them. Yet all the time that\r\nshe was playing she thought of her work with growing satisfaction. By\r\nother people the knowledge of her having studied medicine was not very\r\nwell received. It was considered to have been the fault of Miss\r\nPrince, who should not have allowed a whimsical country doctor to have\r\nbeguiled the girl into such silly notions, and many were the shafts\r\nsped toward so unwise an aunt for holding out against her niece so\r\nmany years. To be sure the child had been placed under a most\r\nrestricted guardianship; but years ago, it was thought, the matter\r\nmight have been rearranged, and Nan brought to Dunport. It certainly\r\nhad been much better for her that she had grown up elsewhere; though,\r\nfor whatever was amiss and willful in her ways, Oldfields was held\r\naccountable. It must be confessed that every one who had known her\r\nwell had discovered sooner or later the untamed wildnesses which\r\nseemed like the tangles which one often sees in field-corners, though\r\na most orderly crop is taking up the best part of the room between the\r\nfences. Yet she was hard to find fault with, except by very\r\nshortsighted persons who resented the least departure by others from\r\nthe code they themselves had been pleased to authorize, and who could\r\nnot understand that a nature like Nan\'s must and could make and keep\r\ncertain laws of its own.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a sort of inevitableness about the visit; Nan\r\nherself hardly knew why she was drifting on day after day without\r\nreasonable excuse. Her time had been most carefully ordered and spent\r\nduring the last few years, and now she sometimes had an uneasy feeling\r\nand a lack of confidence in her own steadfastness. But everybody took\r\nit for granted that the visit must not come to an end. The doctor\r\nshowed no sign of expecting her. Miss Prince would be sure to resent\r\nher going away, and the pleasure-makers marked one day after another\r\nfor their own. It seemed impossible, and perhaps unwise, to go on with\r\nthe reading she had planned, and, in fact, she had been urged to\r\nattend to her books rather by habit than natural inclination; and when\r\nthe temptation to drift with the stream first made itself felt, the\r\nreasons for opposing it seemed to fade away. It was easier to remember\r\nthat Dr. Leslie, and even those teachers who knew her best at the\r\nmedical school, had advised a long vacation.\r\n\r\nThe first formal visits and entertainments were over with for the most\r\npart, and many of the Dunport acquaintances began to seem like old\r\nfriends. There had been a little joking about Nan\'s profession, and\r\nalso some serious remonstrance and unwise championship which did not\r\nreach this heroine\'s ears. It all seemed romantic and most unusual\r\nwhen anybody talked about her story at all, and the conclusion was\r\nsoon reached that all such whims and extravagances were merely\r\nincident to the pre-Dunportian existence, and that now the young guest\r\nhad come to her own, the responsibilities and larger field of activity\r\nwould have their influence over her plan of life. The girl herself was\r\ndisposed to talk very little about this singular fancy; it may have\r\nbeen thought that she had grown ashamed of it as seen by a brighter\r\nlight, but the truth was it kept a place too near her heart to allow\r\nher to gossip with people who had no real sympathy, and who would ask\r\nquestions from curiosity alone. Miss Eunice Fraley had taken more than\r\none opportunity, however, to confess her interest, though she did this\r\nwith the manner of one who dares to be a conspirator against public\r\nopinion, and possibly the permanent welfare of society, and had\r\navowed, beside, her own horror of a doctor\'s simplest duties. But poor\r\nMiss Fraley looked at her young friend as a caged bird at a window\r\nmight watch a lark\'s flight, and was strangely glad whenever there was\r\na chance to spend an hour in Nan\'s company.\r\n\r\nThe first evening at Mrs. Fraley\'s had been a great success, and Miss\r\nPrince had been vastly pleased because both the hostess and the guest\r\nhad received each other\'s commendation. Mrs. Fraley was, perhaps, the\r\none person whom Miss Prince recognized as a superior officer, and she\r\nobserved Nan\'s unconscious and suitable good behavior with great\r\npride. The hostess had formerly been an undisputed ruler of the\r\nhighest social circles of Dunport society, and now in her old age,\r\nwhen she could no longer be present at any public occasions, she was\r\nstill the queen of a little court that assembled in her own house. It\r\nwas true that the list of her subjects grew shorter year by year, but\r\nthe survivors remained loyal, and hardly expected, or even desired,\r\nthat any of the newcomers to the town should recognize their ruler.\r\nNan had been much interested in the old lady\'s stories, and had gladly\r\naccepted an invitation to come often to renew the first conversation.\r\nShe was able to give Mrs. Fraley much welcome information of the ways\r\nand fashions of other centres of civilization, and it was a good thing\r\nto make the hours seem shorter. The poor old lady had few\r\nalleviations; even religion had served her rather as a basis for\r\nargument than an accepted reliance and guide; and though she still\r\nprided herself on her selection of words, those which she used in\r\nformal conversations with the clergyman seemed more empty and\r\nmeaningless than most others. Mrs. Fraley was leaving this world\r\nreluctantly; she had been well fitted by nature for social\r\npreeminence, and had never been half satisfied with the opportunities\r\nprovided for the exercise of her powers. It was only lately that she\r\nhad been forced to acknowledge that Time showed signs of defeating her\r\nin the projects of her life, and she had begun to give up the fight\r\naltogether, and to mourn bitterly and aggressively to her anxious and\r\nresourceless daughter. It was plain enough that the dissatisfactions\r\nand infirmities of age were more than usually great, and poor Eunice\r\nwas only too glad when the younger Miss Prince proved herself capable\r\nof interesting the old friend of her family, and Mrs. Fraley took\r\nheart and suggested both informal visits and future entertainments.\r\nThe prudent daughter was careful not to tell her mother of the guest\'s\r\nrevolutionary ideas, and for a time all went well, until some unwise\r\nperson, unaware of Miss Fraley\'s warning gestures from the other side\r\nof the sitting-room, proceeded to give a totally unnecessary opinion\r\nof the propriety of women\'s studying medicine. Poor Eunice expected\r\nthat a sharp rebuke, followed by a day or two\'s disdain and general\r\nunpleasantness, would descend upon her quaking shoulders; but, to her\r\nsurprise, nothing was said until the next morning, when she was\r\nbidden, at much inconvenience to the household, to invite Miss Prince\r\nand her niece to come that afternoon to drink tea quite informally.\r\n\r\nThere was a pathetic look in the messenger\'s faded face,--she felt\r\nunusually at odds with fortune as she glided along the street,\r\nsheltered by the narrow shadows of the high fences. Nan herself came\r\nto the door, and when she threw back the closed blinds and discovered\r\nthe visitor, she drew her in with most cordial welcome, and the two\r\nfriends entered the darkened south parlor, where it was cool, and\r\nsweet with the fragrance of some honeysuckle which Nan had brought in\r\nearly that morning from the garden.\r\n\r\n"Dear me," said the little woman deprecatingly. "I don\'t know why I\r\ncame in at all. I can\'t stop to make a call. Mother was very desirous\r\nthat you and your aunt should come over to tea this evening. It seems\r\na good deal to ask in such hot weather, but she has so little to amuse\r\nher, and I really don\'t see that the weather makes much difference,\r\nshe used to feel the heat very much years ago." And Miss Eunice gave a\r\nsigh, and fanned herself slowly, letting the fan which had been put\r\ninto her hand turn itself quite over on her lap before it came up\r\nagain. There was an air of antique elegance about this which amused\r\nNan, who stood by the table wiping with her handkerchief some water\r\nthat had dropped from the vase. A great many of the ladies in church\r\nthe Sunday before had fanned themselves in this same little\r\nlanguishing way; she remembered one or two funny old persons in\r\nOldfields who gave themselves airs after the same fashion.\r\n\r\n"I think we shall both be very pleased," she answered directly, with a\r\nbit of a smile; while Miss Fraley gazed at her admiringly, and thought\r\nshe had never seen the girl look so fresh and fair as she did in this\r\nplain, cool little dress. There had been more water than was at first\r\nsuspected; the handkerchief was a limp, white handful, and they both\r\nlaughed as it was held up. Miss Fraley insisted that she could not\r\nstay. She must go to the shops to do some errands, and hoped to meet\r\nMiss Prince who had gone that way half an hour before.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind anything mother may say to you," she entreated, after\r\nlingering a minute, and looking imploringly in Nan\'s face. "You know\r\nwe can\'t expect a person of her age to look at everything just as we\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"Am I to be scolded?" asked Nan, serenely. "Do you know what it is\r\nabout?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, perhaps nothing," answered Miss Fraley, quickly. "I ought not to\r\nhave spoken, only I fancied she was a little distressed at the idea of\r\nyour being interested in medicines. I don\'t know anything that is more\r\nuseful myself. I am sure every family needs to have some one who has\r\nsome knowledge of such things; it saves calling a doctor. My sister\r\nSusan knows more than any of us, and it has been very useful to her\r\nwith her large family."\r\n\r\n"But I shouldn\'t be afraid to come, I think," said Nan, laughing.\r\n"Mrs. Fraley told me that she would finish that story of the diamond\r\nring, you know, and we shall get on capitally. Really I think her\r\nstories of old times are wonderfully interesting. I wish I had a gift\r\nfor writing them down whenever I am listening to her."\r\n\r\nMiss Eunice was much relieved, and felt sure that Nan was equal to any\r\nemergency. The girl had put a strong young arm quickly round her\r\nguest\'s thin shoulders, and had kissed her affectionately, and this\r\nhad touched the lonely little woman\'s very heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were signs of storm in Madam Fraley\'s face that evening, but\r\neverybody feigned not to observe them, and Nan behaved with perilous\r\ndisregard of a lack of encouragement, and made herself and the company\r\nuncommonly merry. She described the bad effect her coming had had upon\r\nher aunt\'s orderly house. She confessed to having left her own\r\npossessions in such confusion the evening before when she dressed\r\nagain to go up the river, that Priscilla had called it a monkey\'s\r\nwedding, and had gone away after one scornful look inside the door.\r\nMiss Fraley dared to say that no one could mind seeing such pretty\r\nthings, and even Miss Prince mentioned that her niece was not so\r\ncareless as she would make them believe; while Nan begged to know if\r\nanybody had ever heard of a monkey\'s wedding before, and seemed very\r\nmuch amused.\r\n\r\n"She called such a disarray in the kitchen one morning the monkey\'s\r\nwedding breakfast," said Miss Prince, as if she never had thought it\r\nparticularly amusing until this minute. "Priscilla has always made use\r\nof a great many old-fashioned expressions."\r\n\r\nThey had seated themselves at the tea-table; it was evident that Miss\r\nFraley had found it a hard day, for she looked tired and worn. The\r\nmistress of the house was dressed in her best and most imposing\r\nclothes, and sat solemnly in her place. A careful observer might have\r\nseen that the best blue teacups with their scalloped edges were not\r\nset forth. The occasion wore the air of a tribunal rather than that of\r\na festival, and it was impossible not to feel a difference between it\r\nand the former tea-party.\r\n\r\nMiss Prince was not particularly sensitive to moods and atmospheres;\r\nshe happened to be in very good spirits, and talked for some time\r\nbefore she became entirely aware that something had gone wrong, but\r\npresently faltered, and fell under the ban, looking questioningly\r\ntoward poor Eunice, who busied herself with the tea-tray.\r\n\r\n"Nancy," said Mrs. Fraley impatiently, "I was amazed to find that\r\nthere is a story going about town that your niece here is studying to\r\nbe a doctor. I hope that you don\'t countenance any such nonsense?"\r\n\r\nMiss Prince looked helpless and confounded, and turned her eyes toward\r\nher niece. She could only hope at such a mortifying juncture that Nan\r\nwas ready to explain, or at least to shoulder the responsibility.\r\n\r\n"Indeed she doesn\'t give me any encouragement, Mrs. Fraley," said Nan,\r\nfearlessly. "Only this morning she saw a work on ventilation in my\r\nroom and told me it wasn\'t proper reading for a young woman."\r\n\r\n"I really didn\'t look at the title," said Miss Prince, smiling in\r\nspite of herself.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t seem to improve the health of you young folks because you\r\nthink it necessary to become familiar with such subjects," announced\r\nthe irate old lady. It was her habit to take a very slight refreshment\r\nat the usual tea hour, and supplement it by a substantial lunch at\r\nbed-time, and so now she was not only at leisure herself, but demanded\r\nthe attention of her guests. She had evidently prepared an opinion,\r\nand was determined to give it. Miss Eunice grew smaller and thinner\r\nthan ever, and fairly shivered with shame behind the tea-tray. She\r\nlooked steadily at the big sugar-bowl, as if she were thinking whether\r\nshe might creep into it and pull something over her head. She never\r\nliked an argument, even if it were a good-natured one, and always had\r\na vague sense of personal guilt and danger.\r\n\r\n"In my time," Mrs. Fraley continued, "it was thought proper for young\r\nwomen to show an interest in household affairs. When I was married it\r\nwas not asked whether I was acquainted with dissecting-rooms."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t think there is any need of that," replied Nan. "I think\r\nsuch things are the duty of professional men and women only. I am very\r\nfar from believing that every girl ought to be a surgeon any more than\r\nthat she ought to be an astronomer. And as for the younger people\'s\r\nbeing less strong than the old, I am afraid it is their own fault,\r\nsince we understand the laws of health better than we used. \'Who\r\nbreaks, pays,\' you know."\r\n\r\nIt was evidently not expected that the young guest should venture to\r\ndiscuss the question, but rather have accepted her rebuke meekly, and\r\nacknowledged herself in the wrong. But she had the courage of her\r\nopinions, and the eagerness of youth, and could hardly bear to be so\r\neasily defeated. So when Mrs. Fraley, mistaking the moment\'s silence\r\nfor a final triumph, said again, that a woman\'s place was at home, and\r\nthat a strong-minded woman was out of place, and unwelcome everywhere,\r\nthe girl\'s cheeks flushed suddenly.\r\n\r\n"I think it is a pity that we have fallen into a habit of using\r\nstrong-mindedness as a term of rebuke," she said. "I am willing to\r\nacknowledge that people who are eager for reforms are apt to develop\r\nunpleasant traits, but it is only because they have to fight against\r\nopposition and ignorance. When they are dead and the world is reaping\r\nthe reward of their bravery and constancy, it no longer laughs, but\r\nmakes statues of them, and praises diem, and thanks them in every way\r\nit can. I think we ought to judge each other by the highest standards,\r\nMrs. Fraley, and by whether we are doing good work."\r\n\r\n"My day is past," said the hostess. "I do not belong to the present,\r\nand I suppose my judgment is worth nothing to you;" and Nan looked up\r\nquickly and affectionately.\r\n\r\n"I should like to have all my friends believe that I am doing right,"\r\nshe said. "I do feel very certain that we must educate people properly\r\nif we want them to be worth anything. It is no use to treat all the\r\nboys and girls as if nature had meant them for the same business and\r\nscholarship, and try to put them through the same drill, for that is\r\nsure to mislead and confuse all those who are not perfectly sure of\r\nwhat they want. There are plenty of people dragging themselves\r\nmiserably through the world, because they are clogged and fettered\r\nwith work for which they have no fitness. I know I haven\'t had the\r\nexperience that you have, Mrs. Fraley, but I can\'t help believing that\r\nnothing is better than to find one\'s work early and hold fast to it,\r\nand put all one\'s heart into it."\r\n\r\n"I have done my best to serve God in the station to which it has\r\npleased Him to call me," said Mrs. Fraley, stiffly. "I believe that a\r\nyoung man\'s position is very different from a girl\'s. To be sure, I\r\ncan give my opinion that everything went better when the master\r\nworkmen took apprentices to their trades, and there wasn\'t so much\r\nschooling. But I warn you, my dear, that your notion about studying to\r\nbe a doctor has shocked me very much indeed. I could not believe my\r\nears,--a refined girl who bears an honorable and respected name to\r\nthink of being a woman doctor! If you were five years older you would\r\nnever have dreamed of such a thing. It lowers the pride of all who\r\nhave any affection for you. If it were not that your early life had\r\nbeen somewhat peculiar and most unfortunate, I should blame you more;\r\nas it is, I can but wonder at the lack of judgment in others. I shall\r\nlook forward in spite of it all to seeing you happily married." To\r\nwhich Miss Prince assented with several decided nods.\r\n\r\n"This is why I made up my mind to be a physician," said the culprit;\r\nand though she had been looking down and growing more uncomfortable\r\nevery moment, she suddenly gave her head a quick upward movement and\r\nlooked at Mrs. Fraley frankly, with a beautiful light in her clear\r\neyes. "I believe that God has given me a fitness for it, and that I\r\nnever could do anything else half so well. Nobody persuaded me into\r\nfollowing such a plan; I simply grew toward it. And I have everything\r\nto learn, and a great many faults to overcome, but I am trying to get\r\non as fast as may be. I can\'t be too glad that I have spent my\r\nchildhood in a way that has helped me to use my gift instead of\r\nhindering it. But everything helps a young man to follow his bent; he\r\nhas an honored place in society, and just because he is a student of\r\none of the learned professions, he ranks above the men who follow\r\nother pursuits. I don\'t see why it should be a shame and dishonor to a\r\ngirl who is trying to do the same thing and to be of equal use in the\r\nworld. God would not give us the same talents if what were right for\r\nmen were wrong for women."\r\n\r\n"My dear, it is quite unnatural you see," said the antagonist,\r\nimpatiently. "Here you are less than twenty-five years old, and I\r\nshall hear of your being married next thing,--at least I hope I\r\nshall,--and you will laugh at all this nonsense. A woman\'s place is at\r\nhome. Of course I know that there have been some women physicians who\r\nhave attained eminence, and some artists, and all that. But I would\r\nrather see a daughter of mine take a more retired place. The best\r\nservice to the public can be done by keeping one\'s own house in order\r\nand one\'s husband comfortable, and by attending to those social\r\nresponsibilities which come in our way. The mothers of the nation have\r\nrights enough and duties enough already, and need not look farther\r\nthan their own firesides, or wish for the plaudits of an ignorant\r\npublic."\r\n\r\n"But if I do not wish to be married, and do not think it right that I\r\nshould be," said poor Nan at last. "If I have good reasons against all\r\nthat, would you have me bury the talent God has given me, and choke\r\ndown the wish that makes itself a prayer every morning that I may do\r\nthis work lovingly and well? It is the best way I can see of making\r\nmyself useful in the world. People must have good health or they will\r\nfail of reaching what success and happiness are possible for them; and\r\nso many persons might be better and stronger than they are now, which\r\nwould make their lives very different. I do think if I can help my\r\nneighbors in this way it will be a great kindness. I won\'t attempt to\r\nsay that the study of medicine is a proper vocation for women, only\r\nthat I believe more and more every year that it is the proper study\r\nfor me. It certainly cannot be the proper vocation of all women to\r\nbring up children, so many of them are dead failures at it; and I\r\ndon\'t see why all girls should be thought failures who do not marry. I\r\ndon\'t believe that half those who do marry have any real right to it,\r\nat least until people use common sense as much in that most important\r\ndecision as in lesser ones. Of course we can\'t expect to bring about\r\nan ideal state of society all at once; but just because we don\'t\r\nreally believe in having the best possible conditions, we make no\r\neffort at all toward even better ones. People ought to work with the\r\ngreat laws of nature and not against them."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know anything about it," said Mrs. Fraley, who hardly knew\r\nwhat to think of this ready opposition. "You don\'t know what you are\r\ntalking about, Anna. You have neither age nor experience, and it is\r\neasy to see you have been associating with very foolish people. I am\r\nthe last person to say that every marriage is a lucky one; but if you\r\nwere my daughter I should never consent to your injuring your chances\r\nfor happiness in this way."\r\n\r\nNan could not help stealing a glance at poor Miss Eunice, behind her\r\nfragile battlement of the tea-set, and was deeply touched at the\r\nglance of sympathy which dimly flickered in the lonely eyes. "I do\r\nthink, mother, that Anna is right about single women\'s having some\r\noccupation," was timidly suggested. "Of course, I mean those who have\r\nno special home duties; I can see that life would not"--\r\n\r\n"Now Eunice," interrupted the commander in chief, "I do wish you\r\ncould keep an opinion of your own. You are the last person to take up\r\nwith such ideas. I have no patience with people who don\'t know their\r\nown minds half an hour together."\r\n\r\n"There are plenty of foolish women who marry, I\'ll acknowledge," said\r\nMiss Prince, for the sake of coming to the rescue. "I was really angry\r\nyesterday, when Mrs. Gerry told me that everybody was so pleased to\r\nhear that Hattie Barlow was engaged, because she was incapable of\r\ndoing anything to support herself. I couldn\'t help feeling that if\r\nthere was so little power that it had never visibly turned itself in\r\nany practical direction, she wasn\'t likely to be a good housekeeper. I\r\nthink that is a most responsible situation, myself."\r\n\r\nNan looked up gratefully. "It isn\'t so much that people can\'t do\r\nanything, as that they try to do the wrong things, Aunt Nancy. We all\r\nare busy enough or ought to be; only the richest people have the most\r\ncares and have to work hardest. I used to think that rich city people\r\ndid nothing but amuse themselves, when I was a little girl; but I\r\noften wonder nowadays at the wisdom and talent that are needed to keep\r\na high social position respected in the world\'s eyes. It must be an\r\norderly and really strong-minded woman who can keep her business from\r\ngetting into a most melancholy tangle. Yet nobody is afraid when the\r\nmost foolish girls take such duties upon themselves, and all the world\r\ncries out with fear of disaster, if once in a while one makes up her\r\nmind to some other plan of life. Of course I know being married isn\'t\r\na trade: it is a natural condition of life, which permits a man to\r\nfollow certain public careers, and forbids them to a woman. And since\r\nI have not wished to be married, and have wished to study medicine, I\r\ndon\'t see what act of Parliament can punish me."\r\n\r\n"Wait until Mr. Right comes along," said Mrs. Fraley, who had pushed\r\nback her chair from the table and was beating her foot on the floor in\r\na way that betokened great displeasure and impatience. "I am only\r\nthankful I had my day when women were content to be stayers at home. I\r\nam only speaking for your good, and you\'ll live to see the truth of\r\nit, poor child!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure she will get over this," apologized Miss Prince, after they\r\nhad reached the parlor, for she found that her niece had lingered with\r\nMiss Fraley in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk to me about the Princes changing their minds," answered\r\nthe scornful old hostess. "You ought to know them better than that by\r\nthis time." But just at that moment young Gerry came tapping at the\r\ndoor, and the two ladies quickly softened their excited looks and\r\nwelcomed him as the most powerful argument for their side of the\r\ndebate. It seemed quite a thing of the past that he should have\r\nfancied Mary Parish, and more than one whisper had been listened to\r\nthat the young man was likely to have the Prince inheritance, after\r\nall. He looked uncommonly well that evening, and the elder women could\r\nnot imagine that any damsel of his own age would consider him\r\nslightingly. Nan had given a little shrug of impatience when she heard\r\nhis voice join the weaker ones in the parlor, and a sense of\r\ndiscomfort that she never had felt before came over her suddenly. She\r\nreminded herself that she must tell her aunt that very night that the\r\nvisit must come to an end. She had neglected her books and her drives\r\nwith the doctor altogether too long already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nFRIEND AND LOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these summer days the young lawyer\'s thoughts had often been busy\r\nelsewhere while he sat at the shaded office window and looked out upon\r\nthe river. The very housekeeping on the damaged ship became more\r\ninteresting to him than his law books, and he watched the keeper\'s\r\nwife at her various employments on deck, or grew excited as he\r\nwitnessed the good woman\'s encounters with marauding small boys, who\r\nprowled about hoping for chances of climbing the rigging or solving\r\nthe mysteries of the hold. It had come to be an uncommon event that a\r\nsquare-rigged vessel should make the harbor of Dunport, and the elder\r\ncitizens ignored the deserted wharves, and talked proudly of the days\r\nof Dunport\'s prosperity, convicting the railroad of its decline as\r\nmuch as was consistent with their possession of profitable stock. The\r\nyounger people took the empty warehouses for granted, and listened to\r\ntheir grandparents\' stories with interest, if they did not hear them\r\ntoo often; and the more enterprising among them spread their wings of\r\nambition and flew away to the larger cities or to the westward. George\r\nGerry had stayed behind reluctantly. He had neither enough desire for\r\na more active life, nor so high a purpose that he could disregard\r\nwhatever opposition lay in his way. Yet he was honestly dissatisfied\r\nwith his surroundings, and thought himself hardly used by a hindering\r\nfate. He believed himself to be most anxious to get away, yet he was\r\nlike a ship which will not be started out of port by anything less\r\nthan a hurricane. There really were excuses for his staying at home,\r\nand since he had stopped to listen to them they beguiled him more and\r\nmore, and his friends one by one commended his devotion to his mother\r\nand sisters, and sometimes forgot to sympathize with him for his\r\ndisappointments as they praised him for being such a dutiful son. To\r\nbe sure, he might be a great lawyer in Dunport as well as anywhere\r\nelse; he would not be the first; but a more inspiring life might have\r\nmade him more enthusiastic and energetic, and if he could have been\r\nwinning his way faster elsewhere, and sending home good accounts of\r\nhimself, not to speak of substantial aid, there is no question whether\r\nit would not have given his family greater happiness and done himself\r\nmore good. He was not possessed of the stern determination which wins\r\nits way at all hazards, and so was dependent upon his surroundings for\r\nan occasional stimulus.\r\n\r\nBut Dunport was very grateful to him because he had stayed at home,\r\nand he was altogether the most prominent young man in the town. It is\r\nso easy to be thankful that one\'s friends are no worse that one\r\nsometimes forgets to remember that they might be better; and it would\r\nhave been only natural if he thought of himself more highly than he\r\nought to think, since he had received a good deal of applause and\r\nadmiration. It is true that he had avoided vice more noticeably than\r\nhe had pursued virtue; but the senior member of the firm, Mr.\r\nSergeant, pronounced his young partner to have been a most excellent\r\nstudent, and not only showed the greatest possible confidence in him,\r\nbut was transferring a good deal of the business to him already. Miss\r\nPrince and her old lawyer had one secret which had never been\r\nsuspected, and the townspeople thought more than ever of young Mr.\r\nGerry\'s ability when it was known that the most distinguished legal\r\nauthority of that region had given him a share of a long established\r\nbusiness. George Gerry had been led to think better of himself, though\r\nit had caused him no little wonder when the proposal had been made. It\r\nwas possible that Mr. Sergeant feared that there might be some\r\nalliance offered by his rivals in Dunport. To be sure, the younger\r\nfirm had been making a good deal of money, but it was less respected\r\nby the leading business men. Mr. Sergeant had even conferred with his\r\nyoung friend one morning upon the propriety of some new investments;\r\nbut Mr. Gerry had never even suspected that they were the price of his\r\nown new dignity and claim upon the public honor. Captain Walter Parish\r\nand Mr. Sergeant had both been aids and advisers of Miss Prince; but\r\nneither had ever known the condition of all her financial affairs, and\r\nshe had made the most of a comfortable sense of liberty. To do young\r\nGerry justice, he had not hesitated to express his amazement; and\r\namong his elders and betters, at any rate, he had laid his good\r\nfortune at the door of Mr. Sergeant\'s generosity and kindness instead\r\nof his own value.\r\n\r\nBut at certain seasons of the year, like this, there was no excitement\r\nin the office, and after an attendance at court and the proper\r\nadjustment, whether temporary or permanent, of the subsequent\r\nbusiness, the partners had returned to a humdrum fulfilling of the\r\nminor duties of their profession, and the younger man worked at his\r\nlaw books when there were no deeds or affidavits to engage his\r\nattention. He thought of many things as he sat by his window; it was a\r\ngreat relief to the tiresomeness of the dull rooms to look at the\r\nriver and at the shores and hills beyond; to notice carelessly whether\r\nthe tide came in or went out. He was apt to feel a sense of\r\ndissatisfaction in his leisure moments; and now a new current was\r\nbringing all its force to bear upon him in his quiet anchorage.\r\n\r\nHe had looked upon Miss Prince as a kind adviser; he was on more\r\nintimate terms with her than with any woman he knew; and the finer\r\ntraits in his character were always brought out by some compelling\r\nforce in her dignity and simple adherence to her somewhat narrow code\r\nof morals and etiquette. He was grateful to her for many kindnesses;\r\nand as he had grown older and come to perceive the sentiment which had\r\nbeen the first motive of her affection toward him, he had\r\ninstinctively responded with a mingling of gallantry and sympathy\r\nwhich made him, as has been already said, appear at his very best. The\r\ngossips of Dunport had whispered that he knew that it was more than\r\nworth his while to be polite to Miss Prince; but he was too manly a\r\nfellow to allow any trace of subserviency to show itself in his\r\nconduct. As often happens, he had come back to Dunport almost a\r\nstranger after his years of college life were over, and he had a\r\nmingled love and impatience for the old place. The last year had been\r\nvery pleasant, however: there were a few young men whose good comrade\r\nand leader he was; his relations with his fellow-citizens were most\r\nharmonious; and as for the girls of his own age and their younger\r\nsisters, who were just growing up, he was immensely popular and\r\nadmired by them. It had become a subject of much discussion whether he\r\nand Mary Parish would not presently decide upon becoming engaged to\r\neach other, until Miss Prince\'s long-banished niece came to put a new\r\nsuspicion into everybody\'s mind.\r\n\r\nMany times when George Gerry had a new proof that he had somehow\r\nfallen into the habit of walking home with the pleasant girl who was\r\nhis friend and neighbor, he had told himself abruptly that there was\r\nno danger in it, and that they never could have any other feeling for\r\neach other. But he had begun to think also that she belonged to him in\r\nsome vague way, and sometimes acknowledged that it might be a thing to\r\nconsider more deeply by and by. He was only twenty-six, and the world\r\nwas still before him, but he was not very sympathetic with other\r\npeople\'s enthusiasm over their love affairs, and wondered if it were\r\nnot largely a matter of temperament, though by and by he should like\r\nto have a home of his own.\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat attracted toward Miss Prince, the younger, for her\r\naunt\'s sake, and had made up his mind that he would be very attentive\r\nto her, no matter how displeasing and uninteresting she might be: it\r\nwas sure to be a time of trial to his old friend, and he would help\r\nall he could to make the visit as bearable as possible. Everybody knew\r\nof the niece\'s existence who had known the Prince family at all, and\r\nthough Miss Prince had never mentioned the unhappy fact until the day\r\nor two before her guest was expected, her young cavalier had behaved\r\nwith most excellent discretion, and feigning neither surprise nor\r\ndismay, accepted the announcement in a way that had endeared him still\r\nmore to his patroness.\r\n\r\nBut on the first Sunday morning, when a most admirable young lady had\r\nwalked up the broad aisle of St. Ann\'s church, and Mr. Gerry had\r\ncaught a glimpse of her between the rows of heads which all looked\r\ncommonplace by contrast, it seemed to begin a new era of things. This\r\nwas a welcome link with the busier world outside Dunport; this was\r\nwhat he had missed since he had ended his college days, a gleam of\r\ncosmopolitan sunshine, which made the provincial fog less attractive\r\nthan ever. He was anxious to claim companionship with this fair\r\ncitizen of a larger world, and to disclaim any idea of belonging to\r\nthe humdrum little circle which exaggerated its own importance. He\r\npersuaded himself that he must pay Miss Prince\'s guest an early visit.\r\nIt was very exciting and interesting altogether; and as he watched the\r\nflicker of light in our heroine\'s hair as she sat on the straight sofa\r\nin her aunt\'s parlor on the Sunday evening, a feeling of great delight\r\nstole over him. He had known many nice girls in his lifetime, but\r\nthere was something uncommonly interesting about Miss Anna Prince;\r\nbesides, who could help being grateful to her for being so much nicer\r\nthan anybody had expected?\r\n\r\nAnd so the days went by. Nobody thought there was any objection when\r\nthe junior partner of the law firm took holiday after holiday, for\r\nthere was little business and Mr. Sergeant liked to keep on with his\r\nfamiliar routine. His old friends came to call frequently, and they\r\nhad their conferences in peace, and were not inclined to object if the\r\nyounger ears were being used elsewhere. Young people will be young\r\npeople, and June weather does not always last; and if George Gerry\r\nwere more devoted to social duties than to legal ones, it was quite\r\nnatural, and he had just acquitted himself most honorably at the May\r\nterm of court, and was his own master if he decided to take a\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nHe had been amused when the announcement had been made so early in\r\ntheir acquaintance that Nan meant to study medicine. He believed if\r\nthere were any fault, it was Dr. Leslie\'s, and only thought it a pity\r\nthat her evident practical talents had not been under the guidance of\r\na more sensible director. The girl\'s impetuous defense of her choice\r\nwas very charming; he had often heard Mr. Sergeant speak of the rare\r\ninsight and understanding of legal matters which his favorite daughter\r\nhad possessed, and her early death had left a lonely place in the good\r\nman\'s heart. Miss Prince\'s life at Oldfields must have been very dull,\r\nespecially since her boarding-school days were over. For himself he\r\nhad a great prejudice against the usurpation of men\'s duties and\r\nprerogatives by women, and had spoken of all such assumptions with\r\ncontempt. It made a difference that this attractive young student had\r\nspoken bravely on the wrong side; but if he had thought much about it\r\nhe would have made himself surer and surer that only time was needed\r\nto show her the mistake. If he had gone deeper into the subject he\r\nwould have said that he thought it all nonsense about women\'s having\r\nthe worst of it in life; he had known more than one good fellow who\r\nhad begun to go down hill from the day he was married, and if girls\r\nwould only take the trouble to fit themselves for their indoor\r\nbusiness the world would be a vastly more comfortable place. And as\r\nfor their tinkering at the laws, such projects should be bitterly\r\nresented.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt only needed a few days to make it plain to this good fellow that\r\nthe coming of one of the summer guests had made a great difference in\r\nhis life. It was easy to find a hundred excuses for going to Miss\r\nPrince\'s, who smiled benignantly upon his evident interest in the fair\r\nstranger within her gates. The truth must be confessed, however, that\r\nthe episode of the lamed shoulder at the picnic party had given Mr.\r\nGeorge Gerry great unhappiness. There was something so high and\r\nserene in Anna Prince\'s simplicity and directness, and in the way in\r\nwhich she had proved herself adequate to so unusual an occasion, that\r\nhe could not help mingling a good deal of admiration with his\r\ndissatisfaction. It is in human nature to respect power; but all his\r\nmanliness was at stake, and his natural rights would be degraded and\r\nlost, if he could not show his power to be greater than her own. And\r\nas the days went by, every one made him more certain that he longed,\r\nmore than he had ever longed for anything before, to win her love. His\r\nheart had never before been deeply touched, but life seemed now like a\r\nheap of dry wood, which had only waited for a live coal to make it\r\nflame and leap in mysterious light, and transfigure itself from\r\ndullness into a bewildering and unaccountable glory. It was no wonder\r\nany longer that poets had sung best of love and its joys and sorrows,\r\nand that men and women, since the world began, had followed at its\r\ncall. All life and its history was explained anew, yet this eager\r\nlover felt himself to be the first discoverer of the world\'s great\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to wait and to lack assurance, but while the hours when he\r\nhad the ideal and the dream seemed to make him certain, he had only to\r\ngo back to Miss Prince\'s to become doubtful and miserable again. The\r\nworld did not consent to second his haste, and the persons most\r\nconcerned in his affairs were stupidly slow at understanding the true\r\nstate of them. While every day made the prize look more desirable,\r\nevery day seemed to put another barrier between himself and Nan; and\r\nwhen she spoke of her visit\'s end it was amazing to him that she\r\nshould not understand his misery. He wondered at himself more and more\r\nbecause he seemed to have the power of behaving much as usual when he\r\nwas with his friends; it seemed impossible that he could always go on\r\nwithout betraying his thoughts. There was no question of any final\r\nopposition to his suit, it seemed to him; he could not be more sure\r\nthan he was already of Miss Prince\'s willingness to let him plead his\r\ncause with her niece, so many vexed questions would be pleasantly\r\nanswered; and he ventured to hope that the girl herself would be glad\r\nto spend her life in dear old Dunport, where her father\'s people had\r\nbeen honored for so many years. The good Dr. Leslie must be fast\r\ngrowing old, and, though he would miss his adopted child, it was\r\nreasonable that he should be glad to see her happily anchored in a\r\nhome of her own, before he died. If Nan were friendless and penniless\r\nit would make no difference; but nevertheless, for her sake, it was\r\ngood to remember that some one had said that Dr. Leslie, unlike most\r\nphysicians, was a man of fortune. And nothing remained but to win an\r\naffection which should match his own, and this impatient suitor walked\r\nand drove and spent the fleeting hours in waiting for a chance to show\r\nhimself in the lists of love. It seemed years instead of weeks at\r\nlast, and yet as if he had only been truly alive and free since love\r\nhad made him captive. He could not fasten himself down to his work\r\nwithout great difficulty, though he built many a castle in Spain with\r\nhis imagined wealth, and laid deep plans of study and acquirement\r\nwhich should be made evident as time went on.\r\n\r\nAll things seemed within his reach in these first days of his\r\nenlightenment: it had been like the rising of the sun which showed him\r\na new world of which he was lawful master, but the minor events of his\r\nblissful existence began to conspire against him in a provoking way,\r\nand presently it was sadly forced upon his understanding that Anna\r\nPrince was either unconscious or disdainful of his affection. It could\r\nhardly be the latter, for she was always friendly and hospitable, and\r\ntook his courtesies in such an unsuspecting and grateful way. There\r\nwas something so self-reliant about her and so independent of any\r\none\'s protection, that this was the most discouraging thing of all,\r\nfor his own instinct was that of standing between her and all\r\nharm,--of making himself responsible for her shelter and happiness.\r\nShe seemed to get on capitally well without him, but after all he\r\ncould not help being conqueror in so just and inevitable a war. The\r\nold proverb suddenly changed from a pebble to a diamond, and he\r\nthanked the philosopher more than once who had first reminded the\r\nworld that faint heart ne\'er won fair lady; presently he grew sad, as\r\nlovers will, and became paler and less vigorous, and made his friends\r\nwonder a good deal, until they at last suspected his sweet sorrow, and\r\nranged themselves in eager ranks upon his side, with all history and\r\ntradition in their favor.\r\n\r\nNan herself was not among the first to suspect that one of her new\r\nfriends had proved to be a lover; she had been turned away from such\r\nsuspicions by her very nature; and when she had been forced to believe\r\nin one or two other instances that she was unwillingly drawing to\r\nherself the devotion which most women unconsciously seek, she had been\r\nmade most uncomfortable, and had repelled all possibility of its\r\nfurther progress. She had believed herself proof against such\r\nassailment, and so indeed she had been; but on the very evening of her\r\nbattle for her opinions at Mrs. Fraley\'s she had been suddenly\r\nconfronted by a new enemy, a strange power, which seemed so dangerous\r\nthat she was at first overwhelmed by a sense of her own\r\ndefenselessness.\r\n\r\nShe had waited with Miss Fraley, who was not quite ready to leave the\r\ndining-room with the rest, and had been much touched by her\r\nconfidence. Poor Eunice had been very fond of one of her\r\nschool-fellows, who had afterward entered the navy, and who had been\r\nfond of her in return. But as everybody had opposed the match, for her\r\nsake, and had placed little reliance in the young man, she had meekly\r\ngiven up all hope of being his wife, and he had died of yellow fever\r\nat Key West soon after. "We were not even engaged you know, dear,"\r\nwhispered the little lady, "but somehow I have always felt in my heart\r\nthat I belonged to him. Though I believe every word you said about a\r\ngirl\'s having an independence of her own. It is a great blessing to\r\nhave always had such a person as my mother to lean upon, but I should\r\nbe quite helpless if she were taken away.... Of course I have had what\r\nI needed and what we could afford," she went on, after another pause,\r\n"but I never can get over hating to ask for money. I do sometimes envy\r\nthe women who earn what they spend."\r\n\r\nNan\'s eyes flashed. "I think it is only fair that even those who have\r\nto spend their husband\'s or their father\'s money should be made to\r\nfeel it is their own. If one does absolutely nothing in one\'s home,\r\nand is not even able to give pleasure, then I think it is stealing. I\r\nhave felt so strongly about that since I have grown up, for you know\r\nDr. Leslie, my guardian, has done everything for me. Aunt Nancy gave\r\nme money every year, but I never spent any of it until I went away to\r\nschool, and then I insisted upon taking that and what my grandmother\r\nleft me. But my later studies have more than used it all. Dr. Leslie\r\nis so kind to me, like an own father, and I am looking forward to my\r\nlife with him most eagerly. After the next year or two I shall be at\r\nhome all the time, and I am so glad to think I can really help him,\r\nand that we are interested in the same things."\r\n\r\nMiss Eunice was a little incredulous, though she did not dare to say\r\nso. In the first place, she could not be persuaded that a woman could\r\npossibly know as much about diseases and their remedies as a man, and\r\nshe wondered if even the rural inhabitants of Oldfields would\r\ncheerfully accept the change from their trusted physician to his young\r\nward, no matter what sails of diplomas she might spread to the breeze.\r\nBut Nan\'s perfect faith and confidence were not to be lightly\r\ndisputed; and if the practice of medicine by women could be made\r\nhonorable, it certainly was in able hands here, as far as an admiring\r\nfriend could decide. Nan was anything but self-asserting, and she had\r\nno noisy fashion of thrusting herself before the public gaze, but\r\neverybody trusted her who knew her; she had the rare and noble faculty\r\nof inspiring confidence.\r\n\r\nThere was no excuse for a longer absence from the parlor, where Mrs.\r\nFraley was throned in state in her high-backed chair, and was already\r\ncalling the loiterers. She and Miss Prince were smiling indulgently\r\nupon the impatient young man, who was describing to them a meeting of\r\nthe stockholders of the Turnpike Company, of which he had last year\r\nbeen made secretary. A dividend had been declared, and it was larger\r\nthan had been expected, and the ladies were as grateful as if he had\r\nfurnished the means from his own pocket. He looked very tall and\r\nhandsome and business-like as he rose to salute Miss Fraley and Nan,\r\nand presently told his real errand. He apologized for interfering with\r\nthe little festival, but two or three of the young people had suddenly\r\nmade a plan for going to see a play which was to be given that night\r\nin the town hall by a traveling company. Would Miss Anna Prince care\r\nto go, and Miss Fraley?\r\n\r\nNan hardly knew why she at once refused, and was filled with regret\r\nwhen she saw a look of childish expectancy on Miss Eunice\'s face\r\nquickly change to disappointment.\r\n\r\n"It is too hot to shut one\'s self into that close place, I am afraid,"\r\nshe said. "And I am enjoying myself very much here, Mr. Gerry." Which\r\nwas generous on Nan\'s part, if one considered the premeditated war\r\nwhich had been waged against her. Then the thought flashed through her\r\nmind that it might be a bit of good fun for her companion; and without\r\nwaiting for either approval or opposition from the elder women, she\r\nsaid, in a different tone, "However, if Miss Fraley will go too, I\r\nwill accept with pleasure; I suppose it is quite time?" and before\r\nthere could be a formal dissent she had hurried the pleased daughter\r\nof the house, who was not quick in her movements, to her room, and in\r\na few minutes, after a good deal of laughter which the presence of the\r\nescort kept anybody from even wishing to silence, the three were\r\nfairly started down the street. It was of no avail that Mrs. Fraley\r\ncondemned her own judgment in not having advised Eunice to stay at\r\nhome and leave the young people free, and that Miss Prince made a\r\nfeeble protest for politeness\' sake,--the pleasure-makers could not be\r\ncalled back.\r\n\r\nNan had really grown into a great liking for George Gerry. She often\r\nthought it would have been very good to have such a brother. But more\r\nthan one person in the audience thought they had never seen a braver\r\nyoung couple; and the few elderly persons of discretion who had gone\r\nto the play felt their hearts thrill with sudden sympathy as our\r\nfriends went far down the room to their seats. Miss Fraley was almost\r\ngirlish herself, and looked so pleased and bright that everybody who\r\ncared anything about her smiled when they caught sight of her, she was\r\nso prim and neat; it was impossible for her, under any circumstances,\r\nto look anything but discreet and quaint; but as for Nan, she was\r\nbeautiful with youth and health; as simply dressed as Miss Eunice, but\r\nwith the gayety of a flower,--some slender, wild thing, that has\r\nsprung up fearlessly under the great sky, with only the sunshine and\r\nthe wind and summer rain to teach it, and help it fulfill its\r\ndestiny,--a flower that has grown with no painful effort of its own,\r\nbut because God made it and kept it; that has bloomed because it has\r\ncome in the course of its growth to the right time. And Miss Eunice,\r\nlike a hindered little house-plant, took a long breath of delight as\r\nshe sat close by her kind young friend, and felt as if somebody had\r\nset her roots free from their familiar prison.\r\n\r\nTo let God make us, instead of painfully trying to make ourselves; to\r\nfollow the path that his love shows us, instead of through conceit or\r\ncowardice or mockery choosing another; to trust Him for our strength\r\nand fitness as the flowers do, simply giving ourselves back to Him in\r\ngrateful service,--this is to keep the laws that give us the freedom\r\nof the city in which there is no longer any night of bewilderment or\r\nignorance or uncertainty. So the woman who had lived a life of\r\nbondage, whose hardest task-master was herself, and the woman who had\r\nbeen both taught and inspired to hold fast her freedom, sat side by\r\nside: the one life having been blighted because it lacked its mate,\r\nand was but half a life in itself; while the other, fearing to give\r\nhalf its royalty or to share its bounty, was being tempted to cripple\r\nitself, and to lose its strait and narrow way where God had left no\r\nroom for another.\r\n\r\nFor as the play went on and the easily pleased audience laughed and\r\nclapped its hands, and the tired players bowed and smiled from behind\r\nthe flaring foot-lights, there was one spectator who was conscious of\r\na great crisis in her own life, which the mimicry of that evening\r\nseemed to ridicule and counterfeit. And though Nan smiled with the\r\nrest, and even talked with her neighbors while the tawdry curtain had\r\nfallen, it seemed to her that the coming of Death at her life\'s end\r\ncould not be more strange and sudden than this great barrier which had\r\nfallen between her and her girlhood, the dear old life which had kept\r\nher so unpuzzled and safe. So this was love at last, this fear, this\r\nchange, this strange relation to another soul. Who could stand now at\r\nher right hand and give her grace to hold fast the truth that her soul\r\nmust ever be her own?\r\n\r\nThe only desire that possessed her was to be alone again, to make Love\r\nshow his face as well as make his mysterious presence felt. She was\r\nthankful for the shelter of the crowd, and went on, wishing that the\r\nshort distance to her aunt\'s home could be made even shorter. She had\r\nfelt this man\'s love for her only in a vague way before, and now, as\r\nhe turned to speak to her from time to time, she could not meet his\r\neyes. The groups of people bade each other good-night merrily, though\r\nthe entertainment had been a little tiresome to every one at the last,\r\nand it seemed the briefest space of time before Miss Fraley and Nan\r\nand their cavalier were left by themselves, and at last Nan and George\r\nGerry were alone together.\r\n\r\nFor his part he had never been so happy as that night. It seemed to\r\nhim that his wish was coming true, and he spoke gently enough and of\r\nthe same things they might have talked about the night before, but a\r\nsplendid chorus of victory was sounding in his ears; and once, as they\r\nstopped for a moment to look between two of the old warehouses at the\r\nshining river and the masts and rigging of the ship against the\r\nmoonlighted sky, he was just ready to speak to the girl at his side.\r\nBut he looked at her first and then was silent. There was something in\r\nher face that forbade it,--a whiteness and a strange look in her eyes,\r\nthat made him lose all feeling of comradeship or even acquaintance. "I\r\nwonder if the old Highflyer will ever go out again?" she said slowly.\r\n"Captain Parish told me some time ago that he had found her more badly\r\ndamaged than he supposed. A vessel like that belongs to the high seas,\r\nand is like a prisoner when it touches shore. I believe that the stray\r\nsouls that have no bodies must sometimes make a dwelling in inanimate\r\nthings and make us think they are alive. I am always sorry for that\r\nship"--\r\n\r\n"Its guardian angel must have been asleep the night of the collision,"\r\nlaughed young Gerry, uneasily; he was displeased with himself the\r\nmoment afterward, but Nan laughed too, and felt a sense of reprieve;\r\nand they went on again and said good night quietly on the steps of the\r\nold Prince house. It was very late for Dunport, and the door was shut,\r\nbut through the bull\'s-eyed panes of glass overhead a faint light was\r\nshining, though it could hardly assert itself against the moonlight.\r\nMiss Prince was still down-stairs, and her niece upbraided her, and\r\nthen began to give an account of the play, which was cut short by the\r\nmistress of the house; for after one eager, long look at Nan, she\r\nbecame sleepy and disappointed, and they said good-night; but the girl\r\nfelt certain that her aunt was leagued against her, and grew sick at\r\nheart and tired as she climbed the stairs. There was a letter on the\r\nlong mahogany table in the hall, and Nan stopped and looked over the\r\nrailing at it wearily. Miss Prince stopped too, and said she was sorry\r\nshe had forgotten,--it was from Oldfields, and in Dr. Leslie\'s\r\nwriting. But though Nan went back for it, and kissed it more than once\r\nbefore she went to bed, and even put it under her pillow as a comfort\r\nand defense against she knew not what, for the first time in her life\r\nshe was afraid to open it and read the kind words. That night she\r\nwatched the moonlight creep along the floor, and heard the cocks crow\r\nat midnight and in the morning; the birds woke with the new day while\r\nshe tried to understand the day that had gone, wondering what she must\r\ndo and say when she faced the world again only a few hours later.\r\n\r\nSometimes she felt herself carried along upon a rushing tide, and was\r\namazed that a hundred gifts and conditions to which she had scarcely\r\ngiven a thought seemed dear and necessary. Once she fancied herself in\r\na quiet home; living there, perhaps, in that very house, and being\r\npleased with her ordering and care-taking. And her great profession\r\nwas all like a fading dream; it seemed now no matter whether she had\r\never loved the studies of it, or been glad to think that she had it in\r\nher power to make suffering less, or prevent it altogether. Her old\r\nambitions were torn away from her one by one, and in their place came\r\nthe hardly-desired satisfactions of love and marriage, and home-making\r\nand housekeeping, the dear, womanly, sheltered fashions of life,\r\ntoward which she had been thankful to see her friends go hand in hand,\r\nmaking themselves a complete happiness which nothing else could match.\r\nBut as the night waned, the certainty of her duty grew clearer and\r\nclearer. She had long ago made up her mind that she must not marry.\r\nShe might be happy, it was true, and make other people so, but her\r\nduty was not this, and a certainty that satisfaction and the blessing\r\nof God would not follow her into these reverenced and honored limits\r\ncame to her distinctly. One by one the reasons for keeping on her\r\nchosen course grew more unanswerable than ever. She had not thought\r\nshe should be called to resist this temptation, but since it had come\r\nshe was glad she was strong enough to meet it. It would be no real\r\nlove for another person, and no justice to herself, to give up her\r\nwork, even though holding it fast would bring weariness and pain and\r\nreproach, and the loss of many things that other women held dearest\r\nand best.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Nan smiled when her aunt noticed her tired look, and\r\nsaid that the play had been a pursuit of pleasure under difficulties.\r\nAnd though Miss Prince looked up in dismay, and was full of objections\r\nand almost querulous reproaches because Nan said she must end her\r\nvisit within a day or two, she hoped that George Gerry would be, after\r\nall, a reason for the girl\'s staying. Until Nan, who had been standing\r\nby the window, looking wistfully at the garden, suddenly turned and\r\nsaid, gently and solemnly, "Listen, Aunt Nancy! I must be about my\r\nbusiness; you do not know what it means to me, or what I hope to make\r\nit mean to other people." And then Miss Prince knew once for all, that\r\nit was useless to hope or to plan any longer. But she would not let\r\nherself be vanquished so easily, and summoned to her mind many\r\nassurances that girls would not be too easily won, and after a short\r\nseason of disapproving silence, returned to her usual manner as if\r\nthere had been neither difference nor dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nASHORE AND AFLOAT\r\n\r\n\r\n"Your cousin Walter Parish is coming to dine with us to-day," said\r\nMiss Prince, later that morning. "He came to the Fraleys just after\r\nyou went out last evening, to speak with me about a business matter,\r\nand waited to walk home with me afterward. I have been meaning to\r\ninvite him here with his wife, but there doesn\'t seem to be much\r\nprospect of her leaving her room for some time yet, and this morning I\r\nhappened to find an uncommonly good pair of young ducks. Old Mr. Brown\r\nhas kept my liking for them in mind for a great many years. Your\r\ngrandfather used to say that there was nothing like a duckling to his\r\ntaste; he used to eat them in England, but people in this country let\r\nthem get too old. He was willing to pay a great price for ducklings\r\nalways; but even Mr. Brown seems to think it is a great wrong not to\r\nlet them grow until Thanksgiving time, and makes a great many\r\napologies every year. It is from his farm that we always get the best\r\nlamb too; they are very nice people, the Browns, but the poor old man\r\nseems very feeble this summer. Some day I should really like to take a\r\ndrive out into the country to see them, you know so well how to manage\r\na horse. You can spare a day or two to give time for that, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\nNan was sorry to hear the pleading tone, it was so unlike her aunt\'s\r\nusually severe manner, and answered quickly that she should be very\r\nglad to make the little excursion. Mr. Brown had asked her to come to\r\nthe farm one day near the beginning of her visit.\r\n\r\n"You must say this is home, if you can," said Miss Prince, who was a\r\ngood deal excited and shaken that morning, "and not think of yourself\r\nas a visitor any more. There are a great many things I hope you can\r\nunderstand, even if I have left them unsaid. It has really seemed more\r\nlike home since you have been here, and less like a lodging. I wonder\r\nhow I--When did you see Mr. Brown? I did not know you had ever spoken\r\nto him."\r\n\r\n"It was some time ago," the girl answered. "I was in the kitchen, and\r\nhe came to the door. He seemed very glad to see me," and Nan hesitated\r\na moment. "He said I was like my father."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," responded Miss Prince, drearily; and the thought seized\r\nher that it was very strange that the same mistaken persistency should\r\nshow itself in father and child in exactly opposite ways. If Nan would\r\nonly care as much for marrying George Gerry, as her father had for\r\nmarrying his wretched wife! It seemed more and more impossible that\r\nthis little lady should be the daughter of such a woman; how dismayed\r\nthe girl would be if she could be shown her mother\'s nature as Miss\r\nPrince remembered it. Alas! this was already a sorrow which no vision\r\nof the reality could deepen, and the frank words of the Oldfields\r\ncountry people about the bad Thachers had not been spoken fruitlessly\r\nin the ears of their last descendant.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad the captain is coming," Nan said presently, to break the\r\npainful silence. "I do hope that he and Dr. Leslie will know each\r\nother some time, they would be such capital friends. The doctor sent\r\nhis kind regards to you in last night\'s letter, and asked me again to\r\nsay that he hoped that you would come to us before the summer is over.\r\nI should like so much to have you know what Oldfields is like." It was\r\nhard to save herself from saying "home" again, instead of Oldfields,\r\nbut the change of words was made quickly.\r\n\r\n"He is very courteous and hospitable, but I never pay visits\r\nnowadays," said Miss Prince, and thought almost angrily that there was\r\nno necessity for her making a target of herself for all those curious\r\ncountry-people\'s eyes. And then they rose and separated for a time,\r\neach being burdened less by care than thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe captain came early to dine, and brought with him his own and Miss\r\nPrince\'s letters from the post-office, together with the morning\r\npaper, which he proceeded to read. He also seemed to have a weight\r\nupon his mind, but by the time they were at table a mild cheerfulness\r\nmade itself felt, and Nan summoned all her resources and was gayer and\r\nbrighter than usual. Miss Prince had gone down town early in the day,\r\nand her niece was perfectly sure that there had been a consultation\r\nwith Mr. Gerry. He had passed the house while Nan sat at her upper\r\nwindow writing, and had looked somewhat wistfully at the door as if he\r\nhad half a mind to enter it. He was like a great magnet: it seemed\r\nimpossible to resist looking after him, and indeed his ghost-like\r\npresence would not forsake her mind, but seemed urging her toward his\r\nvisible self. The thought of him was so powerful that the sight of the\r\nyoung man was less strange and compelling, and it was almost a relief\r\nto have seen his familiar appearance,--the strong figure in its\r\nevery-day clothes, his unstudent-like vigor, and easy step as he went\r\nby. She liked him still, but she hated love, it was making her so\r\nmiserable,--even when later she told Captain Parish some delightful\r\nOldfields stories, of so humorous a kind that he laughed long and\r\nstruck the table more than once, which set the glasses jingling, and\r\ngave a splendid approval to the time-honored fun. The ducklings were\r\namazingly good; and when Captain Walter had tasted his wine and read\r\nthe silver label on the decanter, which as usual gave no evidence of\r\nthe rank and dignity of the contents, his eyes sparkled with\r\nsatisfaction, and he turned to his cousin\'s daughter with impressive\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n"You may never have tasted such wine as that," he said. "Your\r\ngrandfather, the luckiest captain who ever sailed out of Dunport,\r\nbrought it home fifty years ago, and it was well ripened then. I\r\ndidn\'t know there was a bottle of it left, Nancy," he laughed. "My\r\ndear, your aunt has undertaken to pay one of us a handsome\r\ncompliment."\r\n\r\n"Your health, cousin Walter!" said the girl quickly, lifting her own\r\nglass, and making him a little bow over the old Madeira.\r\n\r\n"Bless your dear heart!" responded the captain; "the same good wishes\r\nto you in return, and now you must join me in my respects to your\r\naunt. Nancy! I beg you not to waste this in pudding-sauces; that\'s the\r\nway with you ladies."\r\n\r\nThe toast-drinking had a good effect upon the little company, and it\r\nseemed as if the cloud which had hung over it at first had been blown\r\naway. When there was no longer any excuse for lingering at the table,\r\nthe guest seemed again a little ill at ease, and after a glance at his\r\nhostess, proposed to Nan that they should take a look at the garden.\r\nThe old sailor had become in his later years a devoted tiller of the\r\nsoil, and pleaded a desire to see some late roses which were just now\r\nin bloom. So he and Nan went down the walk together, and he fidgeted\r\nand hurried about for a few minutes before he could make up his mind\r\nto begin a speech which was weighing heavily on his conscience.\r\n\r\nNan was sure that something unusual was perplexing him, and answered\r\nhis unnecessary questions patiently, wondering what he was trying to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" he grumbled at last, "I shall have to steer a straight\r\ncourse. The truth is, Nancy has been telling me that I ought to advise\r\nwith you, and see that you understand what you are about with young\r\nGerry. She has set her heart on your fancying him. I dare say you know\r\nshe has treated him like a son all through his growing up; but now\r\nthat you have come to your rightful place, she can\'t bear to have\r\nanybody hint at your going back to the other people. \'Tis plain enough\r\nwhat he thinks about it, and I must say I believe it would be for your\r\ngood. Here you are with your father\'s family, what is left of it; and\r\nI take no liberty when I tell you that your aunt desires this to be\r\nyour home, and means to give you your father\'s share of the property\r\nnow and the rest when she is done with it. It is no more than your\r\nrights, and I know as much as anybody about it, and can tell you that\r\nthere\'s a handsomer fortune than you may have suspected. Money grows\r\nfast if it is let alone; and though your aunt has done a good deal for\r\nothers, her expenses have been well held in hand. I must say I should\r\nlike to keep you here, child," the captain faltered, "but I shall want\r\nto do what\'s for your happiness. I couldn\'t feel more earnest about\r\nthat if I were your own father. You must think it over. I\'m not going\r\nto beseech you: I learned long ago that \'tis no use to drive a\r\nPrince."\r\n\r\nNan had tried at first to look unconcerned and treat the matter\r\nlightly, but this straightforward talk appealed to her much more than\r\nthe suggestion and general advice which Miss Prince had implored the\r\ncaptain to give the night before. And now her niece could only thank\r\nhim for his kindness, and tell him that by and by she would make him\r\nunderstand why she put aside these reasons, and went back to the life\r\nshe had known before.\r\n\r\nBut a sudden inspiration made her resolution grow stronger, and she\r\nlooked at Captain Parish with a convincing bravery.\r\n\r\n"When you followed the sea," she said quickly, "if you had a good ship\r\nwith a freight that you had gathered with great care and hopefulness,\r\nand had brought it almost to the market that it was suited for, would\r\nyou have been persuaded to turn about and take it to some place where\r\nit would be next to useless?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Captain Parish, "no, I shouldn\'t," and he half smiled at\r\nthis illustration.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you all my reasons for not wishing to marry," Nan went\r\non, growing very white and determined, "or all my reasons for wishing\r\nto go on with my plan of being a doctor; but I know I have no right to\r\nthe one way of life, and a perfect one, so far as I can see, to the\r\nother. And it seems to me that it would be as sensible to ask Mr.\r\nGerry to be a minister since he has just finished his law studies, as\r\nto ask me to be a wife instead of a physician. But what I used to\r\ndread without reason a few years ago, I must forbid myself now,\r\nbecause I know the wretched inheritance I might have had from my poor\r\nmother\'s people. I can\'t speak of that to Aunt Nancy, but you must\r\ntell her not to try to make me change my mind."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" said the captain. "I dare say you have the right points of\r\nit; but if I were a young man \'t would go hard with me to let you take\r\nyour life into your own hands. It\'s against nature."\r\n\r\n"No," said Nan. "The law of right and wrong must rule even love, and\r\nwhatever comes to me, I must not forget that. Three years ago I had\r\nnot thought about it so much, and I might not have been so sure; but\r\nnow I have been taught there is only one road to take. And you must\r\ntell Aunt Nancy this."\r\n\r\nBut when they went back to the house, Miss Prince was not to be seen,\r\nand the captain hurried away lest she should make her appearance, for\r\nhe did not wish just then to talk about the matter any more. He told\r\nhimself that young people were very different in these days; but when\r\nhe thought of the words he had heard in the garden, and remembered the\r\npale face and the steadfast, clear-toned voice, he brushed away\r\nsomething like a tear. "If more people used judgment in this same\r\ndecision the world would be better off," he said, and could not help\r\nreminding himself that his own niece, little Mary Parish, who was\r\nwearing a wistful countenance in these days, might by and by be happy\r\nafter all. For Nan\'s part it was a great relief to have spoken to the\r\nkind old man; she felt more secure than before; but sometimes the fear\r\nassailed her that some unforeseen event or unreckoned influence might\r\ngive her back to her indecisions, and that the battle of the night\r\nbefore might after all prove not to be final.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore away, and late in the day our heroine heard George\r\nGerry\'s step coming up the street. She listened as she sat by the\r\nupper window, and found that he was giving a message for her. It was\r\nperfect weather to go up the river, he was saying; the tide served\r\njust right and would bring them home early; and Miss Prince, who was\r\nalone in the parlor, answered with pleased assurance that she was sure\r\nher niece would like to go. "Yes," said Nan, calling from the window,\r\nurged by a sudden impulse. "Yes indeed, I should like it above all\r\nthings; I will get ready at once; will you carry two pairs of oars?"\r\n\r\nThere was a ready assent, but the uncertainty of the tone of it struck\r\nAnna Prince\'s quick ear. She seemed to know that the young man and her\r\naunt were exchanging looks of surprise, and that they felt insecure\r\nand uncertain. It was not the yielding maiden who had spoken to her\r\nlover, but the girl who was his good comrade and cordial friend. The\r\nelder woman shook her head doubtfully; she knew well what this\r\nforeboded, and was impatient at the overthrow of her plans; yet she\r\nhad full confidence in the power of Love. She had seen apparent\r\nself-reliance before, and she could not believe that her niece was\r\ninvincible. At any rate nothing could be more persuasive than a\r\ntwilight row upon the river, and for her part, she hoped more eagerly\r\nthan ever that Love would return chief in command of the boat\'s young\r\ncrew; and when the young man flushed a little, and looked at her\r\nappealingly, as he turned to go down the street, his friend and\r\ncounselor could not resist giving him a hopeful nod. Nan was\r\nsingularly frank, and free from affectations, and she might have\r\nalready decided to lower her colors and yield the victory, and it\r\nseemed for a moment that it would be much more like her to do so, than\r\nto invite further contest when she was already won. Miss Prince was\r\nvery kind and sympathetic when this explanation had once forced itself\r\nupon her mind; she gave the young girl a most affectionate kiss when\r\nshe appeared, but at this unmistakable suggestion of pleasure and\r\ntreasured hopes, Nan turned back suddenly into the shaded parlor,\r\nthough Mr. Gerry was waiting outside with his favorite oars, which he\r\nkept carefully in a corner of the office.\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Nancy," said the girl, with evident effort, "I am so sorry\r\nto disappoint you. I wish for your sake that I had been another sort\r\nof woman; but I shall never marry. I know you think I am wrong, but\r\nthere is something which always tells me I am right, and I must follow\r\nanother way. I should only wreck my life, and other people\'s. Most\r\ngirls have an instinct towards marrying, but mine is all against it,\r\nand God knew best when He made me care more for another fashion of\r\nlife. Don\'t make me seem unkind! I dare say that I can put it all into\r\nwords better by and by, but I can never be more certain of it in my\r\nown heart than now."\r\n\r\n"Sit down a minute," said Miss Prince, slowly. "George can wait. But,\r\nAnna, I believe that you are in love with him, and that you are doing\r\nwrong to the poor lad, and to yourself, and to me. I lost the best\r\nhappiness of my life for a whim, and you wish to throw away yours for\r\na theory. I hope you will be guided by me. I have come to love you\r\nvery much, and it seems as if this would be so reasonable."\r\n\r\n"It does make a difference to me that he loves me," confessed the\r\ngirl. "It is not easy to turn away from him," she said,--still\r\nstanding, and looking taller than ever, and even thin, with a curious\r\ntenseness of her whole being. "It is something that I have found it\r\nhard to fight against, but it is not my whole self longing for his\r\nlove and his companionship. If I heard he had gone to the other side\r\nof the world for years and years, I should be glad now and not sorry.\r\nI know that all the world\'s sympathy and all tradition fight on his\r\nside; but I can look forward and see something a thousand times better\r\nthan being his wife, and living here in Dunport keeping his house, and\r\ntrying to forget all that nature fitted me to do. You don\'t\r\nunderstand, Aunt Nancy. I wish you could! You see it all another way."\r\nAnd the tears started to the eager young eyes. "Don\'t you know that\r\nCousin Walter said this very day that the wind which sets one vessel\r\non the right course may set another on the wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, my dear," said the mistress of the house. "I don\'t think\r\nthis is the proper time for you to explain yourself at any rate. I\r\ndare say the fresh air will do you good and put everything right too.\r\nYou have worked yourself into a great excitement over nothing. Don\'t\r\ngo out looking so desperate to the poor fellow; he will think\r\nstrangely of it;" and the girl went out through the wide hall, and\r\nwished she were far away from all this trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nNan had felt a strange sense of weariness, which did not leave her\r\neven when she was quieted by the fresh breeze of the river-shore, and\r\nwas contented to let her oars be stowed in the bottom of the boat, and\r\nto take the comfortable seat in the stern. She pulled the tiller ropes\r\nover her shoulders, and watched her lover\'s first strong strokes,\r\nwhich had quickly sent them out into the stream, beyond the course of\r\na larger craft which was coming toward the wharf. She wished presently\r\nthat she had chosen to row, because they would not then be face to\r\nface; but, strange to say, since this new experience had come to her,\r\nshe had not felt so sure of herself as now, and the fear of finding\r\nherself too weak to oppose the new tendency of her life had lessened\r\nsince her first recognition of it the night before. But Nan had fought\r\na hard fight, and had grown a great deal older in those hours of the\r\nday and night. She believed that time would make her even more certain\r\nthat she had done right than she could be now in the heat of the\r\nbattle, but she wished whatever George Gerry meant to say to her might\r\nbe soon over with.\r\n\r\nThey went slowly up the river, which was now quite familiar to the\r\ngirl who had come to it a stranger only a few weeks before. She liked\r\nout-of-door life so well that this countryside of Dunport was already\r\nmore dear to her than to many who had seen it bloom and fade every\r\nyear since they could remember. At one moment it seemed but yesterday\r\nthat she had come to the old town, and at the next she felt as if she\r\nhad spent half a lifetime there, and as if Oldfields might have\r\nchanged unbearably since she came away.\r\n\r\nSometimes the young oarsman kept in the middle of the great stream,\r\nand sometimes it seemed pleasanter to be near the shore. The midsummer\r\nflowers were coming into blossom, and the grass and trees had long\r\nsince lost the brilliance of their greenness, and wore a look of\r\nmaturity and completion, as if they had already finished their growth.\r\nThere was a beautiful softness and harmony of color, a repose that one\r\nnever sees in a spring landscape. The tide was in, the sun was almost\r\ndown, and a great, cloudless, infinite sky arched itself from horizon\r\nto horizon. It had sent all its brilliance to shine backward from the\r\nsun,--the glowing sphere from which a single dazzling ray came across\r\nthe fields and the water to the boat. In a moment more it was gone,\r\nand a shadow quickly fell like that of a tropical twilight; but the\r\nwest grew golden, and one light cloud, like a floating red feather,\r\nfaded away upward into the sky. A later bright glow touched some high\r\nhills in the east, then they grew purple and gray, and so the evening\r\ncame that way slowly, and the ripple of the water plashed and sobbed\r\nagainst the boat\'s side; and presently in the midst of the river\'s\r\ninland bay, after a few last eager strokes, the young man drew in his\r\noars, letting them drop with a noise which startled Nan, who had\r\nhappened to be looking over her shoulder at the shore.\r\n\r\nShe knew well enough that he meant to put a grave question to her now,\r\nand her heart beat faster and she twisted the tiller cords around her\r\nhands unconsciously.\r\n\r\n"I think I could break any bonds you might use to keep yourself away\r\nfrom me," he said hurriedly, as he watched her. "I am not fit for you,\r\nonly that I love you. Somebody told me you meant to go away, and I\r\ncould not wait any longer before I asked you if you would give\r\nyourself to me."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried Nan, "dear friend, I must not do it; it would all be a\r\nmistake. You must not think of it any more. I am so sorry, I ought to\r\nhave understood what was coming to us, and have gone away long ago."\r\n\r\n"It would have made no difference," said the young man, almost\r\nangrily. He could not bear delay enough even for speech at that\r\nmoment; he watched her face desperately for a look of assurance; he\r\nleaned toward her and wondered why he had not risked everything, and\r\nspoken the evening before when they stood watching the ship\'s mast,\r\nand Nan\'s hands were close enough to be touched. But the miserable\r\nknowledge crept over him that she was a great deal farther away from\r\nhim than half that small boat\'s length, and as she looked up at him\r\nagain, and shook her head gently, a great rage of love and shame at\r\nhis repulse urged him to plead again. "You are spoiling my life," he\r\ncried. "You do not care for that, but without you I shall not care for\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"I would rather spoil your life in this way than in a far worse\r\nfashion," said Nan sadly. "I will always be your friend, but if I\r\nmarried you I might seem by and by to be your enemy. Yes, you will\r\nlove somebody else some day, and be a great deal happier than I could\r\nhave made you, and I shall be so glad. It does not belong to me."\r\n\r\nBut this seemed too scornful and cold-hearted. "Oh, my love is only\r\nworth that to you," the lover said. "You shall know better what it\r\nmeans. I don\'t want you for my friend, but for my own to keep and to\r\nhave. It makes me laugh to think of your being a doctor and going back\r\nto that country town to throw yourself away for the fancies and silly\r\ntheories of a man who has lived like a hermit. It means a true life\r\nfor both of us if you will only say you love me, or even let me ask\r\nyou again when you have thought of it more. Everybody will say I am in\r\nthe right."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there are reasons enough for it, but there is a better reason\r\nagainst it. If you love me you must help me do what is best," said\r\nNan. "I shall miss you and think of you more than you know when I am\r\naway. I never shall forget all these pleasant days we have been\r\ntogether. Oh George!" she cried, in a tone that thrilled him through\r\nand through, "I hope you will be friends with me again by and by. You\r\nwill know then I have done right because it is right and will prove\r\nitself. If it is wrong for me I couldn\'t really make you happy; and\r\nover all this and beyond it something promises me and calls me for a\r\nlife that my marrying you would hinder and not help. It isn\'t that I\r\nshouldn\'t be so happy that it is not easy to turn away even from the\r\nthought of it; but I know that the days would come when I should see,\r\nin a way that would make me long to die, that I had lost the true\r\ndirection of my life and had misled others beside myself. You don\'t\r\nbelieve me, but I cannot break faith with my duty. There are many\r\nreasons that have forbidden me to marry, and I have a certainty as\r\nsure as the stars that the only right condition of life for me is to\r\nfollow the way that everything until now has pointed out. The great\r\ngain and purpose of my being alive is there; and I must not mind the\r\nblessings that I shall have to do without."\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture of impatience and tried to interrupt her, but she\r\nsaid quickly, as if to prevent his speaking: "Listen to me. I can\'t\r\nhelp speaking plainly. I would not have come with you this afternoon,\r\nonly I wished to make you understand me entirely. I have never since I\r\ncan remember thought of myself and my life in any way but\r\nunmarried,--going on alone to the work I am fit to do. I do care for\r\nyou. I have been greatly surprised and shaken because I found how\r\nstrongly something in me has taken your part, and shown me the\r\npossibility of happiness in a quiet life that should centre itself in\r\none man\'s love, and within the walls of his home. But something tells\r\nme all the time that I could not marry the whole of myself as most\r\nwomen can; there is a great share of my life which could not have its\r\nway, and could only hide itself and be sorry. I know better and better\r\nthat most women are made for another sort of existence, but by and by\r\nI must do my part in my own way to make many homes happy instead of\r\none; to free them from pain, and teach grown people and little\r\nchildren to keep their bodies free from weakness and deformities. I\r\ndon\'t know why God should have made me a doctor, so many other things\r\nhave seemed fitter for women; but I see the blessedness of such a\r\nuseful life more and more every year, and I am very thankful for such\r\na trust. It is a splendid thing to have the use of any gift of God. It\r\nisn\'t for us to choose again, or wonder and dispute, but just work in\r\nour own places, and leave the rest to God."\r\n\r\nThe boat was being carried downward by the ebbing tide, and George\r\nGerry took the oars again, and rowed quietly and in silence. He took\r\nhis defeat unkindly and drearily; he was ashamed of himself once,\r\nbecause some evil spirit told him that he was losing much that would\r\ncontent him, in failing to gain this woman\'s love. It had all been so\r\nfair a prospect of worldly success, and she had been the queen of it.\r\nHe thought of himself growing old in Mr. Sergeant\'s dusty office, and\r\nthat this was all that life could hold for him. Yet to be was better\r\nthan to have. Alas! if he had been more earnest in his growth, it\r\nwould have been a power which this girl of high ideals could have been\r\nheld and mastered by. No wonder that she would not give up her dreams\r\nof duty and service, since she had found him less strong than such\r\nideals. The fancied dissatisfaction and piteousness of failure which\r\nshe would be sure to meet filled his heart with dismay; yet, at that\r\nvery next moment, resent it as he might, the certainty of his own\r\npresent defeat and powerlessness could not be misunderstood. Perhaps,\r\nafter all, she knew what was right; her face wore again the look he\r\nhad feared to disturb the night before, and his whole soul was filled\r\nwith homage in the midst of its sorrow, because this girl, who had\r\nbeen his merry companion in the summer holidays, so sweet and familiar\r\nand unforgetable in the midst of the simple festivals, stood nearer to\r\nholier things than himself, and had listened to the call of God\'s\r\nmessengers to whom his own doors had been ignorantly shut. And Nan\r\nthat night was a soul\'s physician, though she had been made to sorely\r\nhurt her patient before the new healthfulness could well begin.\r\n\r\nThey floated down the river and tried to talk once or twice, but there\r\nwere many spaces of silence, and as they walked along the paved\r\nstreets, they thought of many things. An east wind was blowing in from\r\nthe sea, and the elm branches were moving restlessly overhead. "It\r\nwill all be better to-morrow," said Nan, as they stood on the steps at\r\nlast. "You must come to see Aunt Nancy very often after I have gone,\r\nfor she will be lonely. And do come in the morning as if nothing had\r\nbeen spoken. I am so sorry. Good-night, and God bless you," she\r\nwhispered; and when she stood inside the wide doorway, in the dark,\r\nshe listened to his footsteps as he went away down the street. They\r\nwere slower than usual, but she did not call him back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nAT HOME AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Oldfields Dr. Leslie had outwardly lived the familiar life to which\r\nhis friends and patients had long since accustomed themselves; he had\r\nseemed a little preoccupied, perhaps, but if that were observed, it\r\nwas easily explained by his having one or two difficult cases to think\r\nabout. A few persons suspected that he missed Nan, and was, perhaps, a\r\nlittle anxious lest her father\'s people in Dunport should claim her\r\naltogether. Among those who knew best the doctor and his ward there\r\nhad been an ardent championship of Nan\'s rights and dignity, and a\r\ngreat curiosity to know the success of the visit. Dr. Leslie had\r\nanswered all questions with composure, and with a distressing\r\nmeagreness of details; but at length Mrs. Graham became sure that he\r\nwas not altogether free from anxiety, and set her own quick wits at\r\nwork to learn the cause. It seemed a time of great uncertainty, at any\r\nrate. The doctor sometimes brought one of Nan\'s bright, affectionate\r\nletters for his neighbor to read, and they agreed that this holiday\r\nwas an excellent thing for her, but there was a silent recognition of\r\nthe fact that this was a critical time in the young girl\'s history;\r\nthat it either meant a new direction of her life or an increased\r\nactivity in the old one. Mrs. Graham was less well than usual in these\r\ndays, and the doctor found time to make more frequent visits than\r\never, telling himself that she missed Nan\'s pleasant companionship,\r\nbut really wishing as much to receive sympathy as to give it. The dear\r\nold lady had laughingly disclaimed any desire to summon her children\r\nor grandchildren, saying that she was neither ill enough to need them,\r\nnor well enough to enjoy them; and so in the beautiful June weather\r\nthe two old friends became strangely dear to each other, and had many\r\na long talk which the cares of the world or their own reserve had made\r\nthem save until this favoring season.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was acknowledged to be an old man at last, though everybody\r\nstill insisted that he looked younger than his age, and could not\r\ndoubt that he had half a lifetime of usefulness before him yet. But it\r\nmakes a great difference when one\'s ambitions are transferred from\r\none\'s own life to that of a younger person\'s; and while Dr. Leslie\r\ngrew less careful for himself, trusting to the unconscious certainty\r\nof his practiced skill, he pondered eagerly over Nan\'s future,\r\nreminding himself of various hints and suggestions, which must be\r\nadded to her equipment. Sometimes he wished that she were beginning a\r\nfew years later, when her position could be better recognized and\r\nrespected, and she would not have to fight against so much of the\r\nopposition and petty fault-finding that come from ignorance; and\r\nsometimes he rejoiced that his little girl, as he fondly called her,\r\nwould be one of the earlier proofs and examples of a certain noble\r\nadvance and new vantage-ground of civilization. This has been\r\nanticipated through all ages by the women who, sometimes honored and\r\nsometimes persecuted, have been drawn away from home life by a\r\ndevotion to public and social usefulness. It must be recognized that\r\ncertain qualities are required for married, and even domestic life,\r\nwhich all women do not possess; but instead of attributing this to the\r\ndisintegration of society, it must be acknowledged to belong to its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nSo long as the visit in Dunport seemed to fulfill its anticipated\r\npurpose, and the happy guest was throwing aside her cares and enjoying\r\nthe merry holiday and the excitement of new friendships and of her\r\nuncommon position, so long the doctor had been glad, and far from\r\nimpatient to have the visit end. But when he read the later and\r\nshorter letters again and again in the vain hope of finding something\r\nin their wording which should explain the vague unhappiness which had\r\ncome to him as he had read them first, he began to feel troubled and\r\ndismayed. There was something which Nan had not explained; something\r\nwas going wrong. He was sure that if it were anything he could set\r\nright, that she would have told him. She had always done so; but it\r\nbecame evident through the strange sympathy which made him conscious\r\nof the mood of others that she was bent upon fighting her way alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of surprise, and almost of dismay to him early one\r\nmorning, when he received a brief note from her which told him only\r\nthat she should be at home late that afternoon. It seemed to the wise\r\nold doctor a day of most distressing uncertainty. He tried to make up\r\nhis mind to accept with true philosophy whatever decision she was\r\nbringing him. "Nan is a good girl," he told himself over and over\r\nagain; "she will try to do right." But she was so young and so\r\ngenerous, and whether she had been implored to break the old ties of\r\nhome life and affection for her aunt\'s sake, or whether it was a newer\r\nand stronger influence still which had prevailed, waited for\r\nexplanation. Alas, as was written once, it is often the higher nature\r\nthat yields, because it is the most generous. The doctor knew well\r\nenough the young girl\'s character. He knew what promises of growth and\r\nuncommon achievement were all ready to unfold themselves,--for what\r\ngreat uses she was made. He could not bear the thought of her being\r\nhandicapped in the race she had been set to run. Yet no one recognized\r\nmore clearly than he the unseen, and too often unconsidered, factor\r\nwhich is peculiar to each soul, which prevents any other intelligence\r\nfrom putting itself exactly in that soul\'s place, so that our\r\ndecisions and aids and suggestions are never wholly sufficient or\r\navailable for those even whom we love most. He went over the question\r\nagain and again; he followed Nan in his thoughts as she had grown\r\nup,--unprejudiced, unconstrained as is possible for any human being to\r\nbe. He remembered that her heroes were the great doctors, and that her\r\nwhole heart had been stirred and claimed by the noble duties and needs\r\nof the great profession. She had been careless of the social\r\nlimitations, of the lack of sympathy, even of the ridicule of the\r\npublic. She had behaved as a bird would behave if it were assured by\r\nbeasts and fishes that to walk and to swim were the only proper and\r\nrespectable means of getting from place to place. She had shown such\r\nrare insight into the principles of things; she had even seemed to\r\nhim, as he watched her, to have anticipated experience, and he could\r\nnot help believing that it was within her power to add much to the too\r\nsmall fund of certainty, by the sure instinct and aim of her\r\nexperiment. It counted nothing whether God had put this soul into a\r\nman\'s body or a woman\'s. He had known best, and He meant it to be the\r\nteller of new truth, a revealer of laws, and an influence for good in\r\nits capacity for teaching, as well as in its example of pure and\r\nreasonable life.\r\n\r\nBut the old doctor sighed, and told himself that the girl was most\r\nhuman, most affectionate; it was not impossible that, in spite of her\r\napparent absence of certain domestic instincts, they had only lain\r\ndormant and were now awake. He could not bear that she should lose any\r\nhappiness which might be hers; and the tender memory of the blessed\r\ncompanionship which had been withdrawn from his mortal sight only to\r\nbe given back to him more fully as he had lived closer and nearer to\r\nspiritual things, made him shrink from forbidding the same sort of\r\nfullness and completion of life to one so dear as Nan. He tried to\r\nassure himself that while a man\'s life is strengthened by his domestic\r\nhappiness, a woman\'s must either surrender itself wholly, or\r\nrelinquish entirely the claims of such duties, if she would achieve\r\ndistinction or satisfaction elsewhere. The two cannot be taken\r\ntogether in a woman\'s life as in a man\'s. One must be made of lesser\r\nconsequence, though the very natures of both domestic and professional\r\nlife need all the strength which can be brought to them. The decision\r\nbetween them he knew to be a most grave responsibility, and one to be\r\ngoverned by the gravest moral obligations, and the unmistakable\r\nleadings of the personal instincts and ambitions. It was seldom, Dr.\r\nLeslie was aware, that so typical and evident an example as this could\r\noffer itself of the class of women who are a result of natural\r\nprogression and variation, not for better work, but for different\r\nwork, and who are designed for certain public and social duties. But\r\nhe believed this class to be one that must inevitably increase with\r\nthe higher developments of civilization, and in later years, which he\r\nmight never see, the love for humanity would be recognized and\r\nemployed more intelligently; while now almost every popular prejudice\r\nwas against his ward, then she would need no vindication. The wielder\r\nof ideas has always a certain advantage over the depender upon facts;\r\nand though the two classes of minds by no means inevitably belong, the\r\none to women, and the other to men, still women have not yet begun to\r\nuse the best resources of their natures, having been later developed,\r\nand in many countries but recently freed from restraining and\r\nhindering influences.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the race is no longer the only important question;\r\nthe welfare of the individual will be considered more and more. The\r\nsimple fact that there is a majority of women in any centre of\r\ncivilization means that some are set apart by nature for other uses\r\nand conditions than marriage. In ancient times men depended entirely\r\nupon the women of their households to prepare their food and\r\nclothing,--and almost every man in ordinary circumstances of life was\r\nforced to marry for this reason; but already there is a great change.\r\nThe greater proportion of men and women everywhere will still\r\ninstinctively and gladly accept the high duties and helps of married\r\nlife; but as society becomes more intelligent it will recognize the\r\nfitness of some persons, and the unfitness of others, making it\r\nimpossible for these to accept such responsibilities and obligations,\r\nand so dignify and elevate home life instead of degrading it.\r\n\r\nIt had been one thing to act from conviction and from the promptings\r\nof instinct while no obstacles opposed themselves to his decisions,\r\nand quite another thing to be brought face to face with such an\r\nemergency. Dr. Leslie wished first to be able to distinctly explain to\r\nhimself his reasons for the opinions he held; he knew that he must\r\njudge for Nan herself in some measure; she would surely appeal to him;\r\nshe would bring this great question to him, and look for sympathy and\r\nrelief in the same way she had tearfully shown him a wounded finger in\r\nher childhood. He seemed to see again the entreating eyes, made large\r\nwith the pain which would not show itself in any other way, and he\r\nfelt the rare tears fill his own eyes at the thought. "Poor little\r\nNan," he said to himself, "she has been hurt in the great battle, but\r\nshe is no skulking soldier." He would let her tell her story, and then\r\ngive her the best help he could; and so when the afternoon shadows\r\nwere very long across the country, and the hot summer day was almost\r\ndone, the doctor drove down the wide street and along East Road to the\r\nrailroad station. As he passed a group of small houses he looked at\r\nhis watch and found that there was more than time for a second visit\r\nto a sick child whose illness had been most serious and perplexing at\r\nfirst, though now she was fast recovering. The little thing smiled as\r\nher friend came in, and asked if the young lady were coming to-morrow,\r\nfor Dr. Leslie had promised a visit and a picture-book from Nan, whom\r\nhe wished to see and understand the case. They had had a long talk\r\nupon such ailments as this just before she went away, and nothing had\r\nseemed to rouse her ambition so greatly as her experiences at the\r\nchildren\'s hospitals the winter before. Now, this weak little creature\r\nseemed to be pleading in the name of a great army of sick children,\r\nthat Nan would not desert their cause; that she would go on, as she\r\nhad promised them, with her search for ways that should restore their\r\nvigor and increase their fitness to take up the work of the world. And\r\nyet, a home and children of one\'s very own,--the doctor, who had held\r\nand lost this long ago, felt powerless to decide the future of the\r\nyoung heart which was so dear to him.\r\n\r\nNan saw the familiar old horse and carriage waiting behind the\r\nstation, and did not fail to notice that the doctor had driven to meet\r\nher himself. He almost always did, but her very anxiety to see him\r\nagain had made her doubtful. The train had hardly stopped before she\r\nwas standing on the platform and had hastily dropped her checks into\r\nthe hand of the nearest idle boy, who looked at them doubtfully, as if\r\nhe hardly dared to hope that he had been mistaken for the hackman. She\r\ncame quickly to the side of the carriage; the doctor could not look at\r\nher, for the horse had made believe that some excitement was\r\nnecessary, and was making it difficult for the welcome passenger to\r\nput her foot on the step. It was all over in a minute. Nan sprang to\r\nthe doctor\'s side and away they went down the road. He had caught a\r\nglimpse of her shining eyes and eager face as she had hurried toward\r\nhim, and had said, "Well done!" in a most cheerful and every-day\r\nfashion, and then for a minute there was silence.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is so good to get home," said the girl, and her companion\r\nturned toward her; he could not wait to hear her story.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Nan, "it is just as well to tell you now. Do you remember\r\nyou used to say to me when I was a little girl, \'If you know your\r\nduty, don\'t mind the best of reasons for not doing it\'?" And the\r\ndoctor nodded. "I never thought that this reason would come to me for\r\nnot being a doctor," she went on, "and at first I was afraid I should\r\nbe conquered, though it was myself who fought myself. But it came to\r\nme clearer than ever after a while. I think I could have been fonder\r\nof some one than most people are of those whom they marry, but the\r\nmore I cared for him the less I could give him only part of myself; I\r\nknew that was not right. Now that I can look back at it all I am so\r\nglad to have had those days; I shall work better all my life for\r\nhaving been able to make myself so perfectly sure that I know my way."\r\n\r\nThe unconsidered factor had asserted itself in the doctor\'s favor. He\r\ngave the reins to Nan and leaned back in the carriage, but as she bent\r\nforward to speak to a friend whom they passed she did not see the look\r\nthat he gave her.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you knew what was right," he said, hastily. "God bless you,\r\ndear child!"\r\n\r\nWas this little Nan, who had been his play-thing? this brave young\r\ncreature, to whose glorious future all his heart and hopes went out.\r\nIn his evening it was her morning, and he prayed that God\'s angels\r\nshould comfort and strengthen her and help her to carry the burden of\r\nthe day. It is only those who can do nothing who find nothing to do,\r\nand Nan was no idler; she had come to her work as Christ came to his,\r\nnot to be ministered unto but to minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe months went by swiftly, and through hard work and much study, and\r\nmany sights of pain and sorrow, this young student of the business of\r\nhealing made her way to the day when some of her companions announced\r\nwith melancholy truth that they had finished their studies. They were\r\npretty sure to be accused of having had no right to begin them, or to\r\ntake such trusts and responsibilities into their hands. But Nan and\r\nmany of her friends had gladly climbed the hill so far, and with every\r\nyear\'s ascent had been thankful for the wider horizon which was spread\r\nfor their eyes to see.\r\n\r\nDr. Leslie in his quiet study almost wished that he were beginning\r\nlife again, and sometimes in the twilight, or in long and lonely\r\ncountry drives, believed himself ready to go back twenty years so that\r\nhe could follow Nan into the future and watch her successes. But he\r\nalways smiled afterward at such a thought. Twenty years would carry\r\nhim back to the time when his ward was a little child, not long before\r\nshe came to live with him. It was best as God had planned it. Nobody\r\nhad watched the child\'s development as he had done, or her growth of\r\ncharacter, of which all the performances of her later years would be\r\nto him only the unnecessary proofs and evidences. He knew that she\r\nwould be faithful in great things, because she had been faithful in\r\nlittle things, and he should be with her a long time yet, perhaps. God\r\nonly knew.\r\n\r\nThere was a great change in the village; there were more small\r\nfactories now which employed large numbers of young women, and though\r\na new doctor had long ago come to Oldfields who had begun by trying to\r\nsupersede Dr. Leslie, he had ended by longing to show his gratitude\r\nsome day for so much help and kindness. More than one appointment had\r\nbeen offered the heroine of this story in the city hospitals. She\r\nwould have little trouble in making her way since she had the\r\nrequisite qualities, natural and acquired, which secure success. But\r\nshe decided for herself that she would neither do this, nor carry out\r\nyet the other plan of going on with her studies at some school across\r\nthe sea. Zurich held out a great temptation, but there was time enough\r\nyet, and she would spend a year in Oldfields with the doctor, studying\r\nagain with him, since she knew better than ever before that she could\r\nfind no wiser teacher. And it was a great pleasure to belong to the\r\ndear old town, to come home to it with her new treasures, so much\r\nricher than she had gone away that beside medicines and bandages and\r\nlessons in general hygiene for the physical ails of her patients, she\r\ncould often be a tonic to the mind and soul; and since she was trying\r\nto be good, go about doing good in Christ\'s name to the halt and\r\nmaimed and blind in spiritual things.\r\n\r\nNobody sees people as they are and finds the chance to help poor\r\nhumanity as a doctor does. The decorations and deceptions of character\r\nmust fall away before the great realities of pain and death. The\r\nsecrets of many hearts and homes must be told to this confessor, and\r\nsadder ailments than the text-books name are brought to be healed by\r\nthe beloved physicians. Teachers of truth and givers of the laws of\r\nlife, priests and ministers,--all these professions are joined in one\r\nwith the gift of healing, and are each part of the charge that a good\r\ndoctor holds in his keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in the beginning of her year at Oldfields, Nan, who had been\r\nvery busy, suddenly thought it would be well to give herself a\r\nholiday; and with a sudden return of her old sense of freedom was\r\ngoing out at the door and down toward the gateway, which opened to a\r\npleasantly wide world beyond. Marilla had taken Nan\'s successes rather\r\nreluctantly, and never hesitated to say that she only hoped to see her\r\nwell married and settled before she died; though she was always ready\r\nto defend her course with even virulence to those who would deprecate\r\nit. She now heard Nan shut the door, and called at once from an upper\r\nwindow to know if word had been left where she was going, and the\r\nyoung practitioner laughed aloud as she answered, and properly\r\nacknowledged the fetter of her calling.\r\n\r\nThe leaves were just beginning to fall, and she pushed them about with\r\nher feet, and sometimes walked and sometimes ran lightly along the\r\nroad toward the farm. But when she reached it, she passed the lane and\r\nwent on to the Dyer houses. Mrs. Jake was ailing as usual, and Nan had\r\ntold the doctor before she came out that she would venture another\r\nprofessional visit in his stead. She was a great help to him in this\r\nway, for his calls to distant towns had increased year by year, and he\r\noften found it hard to keep his many patients well in hand.\r\n\r\nThe old houses had not changed much since she first knew them, and\r\nneither they nor their inmates were in any danger of being forgotten\r\nby her; the old ties of affection and association grew stronger\r\ninstead of weaker every year. It pleased and amused the old people to\r\nbe reminded of the days when Nan was a child and lived among them, and\r\nit was a great joy to her to be able to make their pain and discomfort\r\nless, and be their interpreter of the outside world.\r\n\r\nIt was a most lovely day of our heroine\'s favorite weather. It has\r\nbeen said that November is an epitome of all the months of the year,\r\nbut for all that, no other season can show anything so beautiful as\r\nthe best and brightest November days. Nan had spent her summer in a\r\ngreat hospital, where she saw few flowers save human ones, and the\r\nwarmth and inspiration of this clear air seemed most delightful. She\r\nhad been somewhat tempted by an offer of a fine position in Canada,\r\nand even Dr. Leslie had urged her acceptance, and thought it an\r\nuncommonly good chance to have the best hospital experience and\r\nresponsibility, but she had sent the letter of refusal only that\r\nmorning. She could not tell yet what her later plans might be; but\r\nthere was no place like Oldfields, and she thought she had never loved\r\nit so dearly as that afternoon.\r\n\r\nShe looked in at Mrs. Martin\'s wide-open door first, but finding the\r\nkitchen empty, went quickly across to the other house, where Mrs. Jake\r\nwas propped up in her rocking-chair and began to groan loudly when she\r\nsaw Nan; but the tonic of so gratifying a presence soon had a most\r\nfavorable effect. Benignant Mrs. Martin was knitting as usual, and the\r\nthree women sat together in a friendly group and Nan asked and\r\nanswered questions most cordially.\r\n\r\n"I declare I was sort of put out with the doctor for sending you down\r\nhere day before yesterday instead of coming himself," stated Mrs. Jake\r\nimmediately, "but I do\' know\'s I ever had anything do me so much good\r\nas that bottle you gave me."\r\n\r\n"Of course!" laughed Nan. "Dr. Leslie sent it to you himself. I told\r\nyou when I gave it to you."\r\n\r\n"Well now, how you talk!" said Mrs. Jake, a little crestfallen. "I\r\nbegin to find my hearing fails me by spells. But I was bound to give\r\nyou the credit, for all I\'ve stood out against your meddling with a\r\ndoctor\'s business."\r\n\r\nNan laughed merrily. "I am going to steal you for my patient," she\r\nanswered, "and try all the prescriptions on your case first."\r\n\r\n"Land, if you cured her up \'twould be like stopping the leaks in a\r\nbasket," announced Mrs. Martin with a beaming smile, and clicking her\r\nknitting-needles excitedly. "She can\'t hear of a complaint anywheres\r\nabout but she thinks she\'s got the mate to it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t seem to have anything fevery about me," said Mrs. Jake, with\r\nan air of patient self-denial; and though both her companions were\r\nmost compassionate at the thought of her real sufferings, they could\r\nnot resist the least bit of a smile. "I declare you\'ve done one\r\nfirst-rate thing, if you\'re never going to do any more," said Mrs.\r\nJake, presently. "\'Liza here\'s been talking for some time past, about\r\nyour straightening up the little boy\'s back,--the one that lives down\r\nwhere Mis\' Meeker used to live you know,--but I didn\'t seem to take it\r\nin till he come over here yisterday forenoon. Looks as likely as any\r\nchild, except it may be he\'s a little stunted. When I think how he\r\nused to creep about there, side of the road, like a hopper-toad, it\r\ndoes seem amazin\'!"\r\n\r\nNan\'s eyes brightened. "I have been delighted about that. I saw him\r\nrunning with the other children as I came down the road. It was a long\r\nbit of work, though. The doctor did most of it; I didn\'t see the child\r\nfor months, you know. But he needs care yet; I\'m going to stop and\r\nhave another talk with his mother as I go home."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a pore shiftless creature," Mrs. Martin hastened to say.\r\n"There, I thought o\' the doctor, how he\'d laugh, the last time I was\r\nin to see her; her baby was sick, and she sent up to know if I\'d lend\r\nher a variety of herbs, and I didn\'t know but she might p\'isen it, so\r\nI stepped down with something myself. She begun to flutter about like\r\nshe always does, and I picked my way acrost the kitchen to the cradle.\r\n\'There,\' says she, \'I have been laying out all this week to go up to\r\nthe Corners and git me two new chairs.\' \'I should think you had plenty\r\nof chairs now,\' said I, and she looked at me sort of surprised, and\r\nsays she, \'There ain\'t a chair in this house but what\'s full.\'"\r\n\r\nAnd Nan laughed as heartily as could have been desired before she\r\nasked Mrs. Jake a few more appreciative questions about her ailments,\r\nand then rose to go away. Mrs. Martin followed her out to the gate;\r\nshe and Nan had always been very fond of each other, and the elder\r\nwoman pointed to a field not far away where the brothers were watching\r\na stubble-fire, which was sending up a thin blue thread of smoke into\r\nthe still air. "They were over in your north lot yisterday," said Mrs.\r\nMartin. "They\'re fullest o\' business nowadays when there\'s least to\r\ndo. They took it pretty hard when they first had to come down to\r\nhiring help, but they kind of enjoy it now. We\'re all old folks\r\ntogether on the farm, and not good for much. It don\'t seem but a year\r\nor two since your poor mother was playing about here, and then you\r\ncome along, and now you\'re the last o\' your folks out of all the\r\nhouseful of \'em I knew. I\'ll own up sometimes I\'ve thought strange of\r\nyour fancy for doctoring, but I never said a word to nobody against\r\nit, so I haven\'t got anything to take back as most folks have. I\r\ncouldn\'t help thinking when you come in this afternoon and sat there\r\nalong of us, that I\'d give a good deal to have Mis\' Thacher step in\r\nand see you and know what you\'ve made o\' yourself. She had it hard for\r\na good many years, but I believe \'t is all made up to her; I do\r\ncertain."\r\n\r\nNan meant to go back to the village by the shorter way of the little\r\nfoot-path, but first she went up the grass-grown lane toward the old\r\nfarm-house. She stood for a minute looking about her and across the\r\nwell-known fields, and then seated herself on the door-step, and\r\nstayed there for some time. There were two or three sheep near by,\r\nwell covered and rounded by their soft new winter wool, and they all\r\ncame as close as they dared and looked at her wonderingly. The narrow\r\npath that used to be worn to the door-step had been overgrown years\r\nago with the short grass, and in it there was a late little dandelion\r\nwith hardly any stem at all. The sunshine was warm, and all the\r\ncountry was wrapped in a thin, soft haze.\r\n\r\nShe thought of her grandmother Thacher, and of the words that had just\r\nbeen said; it was beginning to seem a very great while since the days\r\nof the old farm-life, and Nan smiled as she remembered with what tones\r\nof despair the good old woman used to repeat the well-worn phrase,\r\nthat her grandchild would make either something or nothing. It seemed\r\nto her that she had brought all the success of the past and her hopes\r\nfor the future to the dear old place that afternoon. Her early life\r\nwas spreading itself out like a picture, and as she thought it over\r\nand looked back from year to year, she was more than ever before\r\nsurprised to see the connection of one thing with another, and how\r\nsome slight acts had been the planting of seeds which had grown and\r\nflourished long afterward. And as she tried to follow herself back\r\ninto the cloudy days of her earliest spring, she rose without knowing\r\nwhy, and went down the pastures toward the river. She passed the old\r\nEnglish apple-tree, which still held aloft a flourishing bough. Its\r\nfruit had been gathered, but there were one or two stray apples left,\r\nand Nan skillfully threw a stick at these by way of summons.\r\n\r\nAlong this path she had hurried or faltered many a time. She\r\nremembered her grandmother\'s funeral, and how she had walked, with an\r\nelderly cousin whom she did not know, at the head of the procession,\r\nand had seen Martin Dyer\'s small grandson peeping like a rabbit from\r\namong the underbrush near the shore. Poor little Nan! she was very\r\nlonely that day. She had been so glad when the doctor had wrapped her\r\nup and taken her home.\r\n\r\nShe saw the neighborly old hawthorn-tree that grew by a cellar, and\r\nstopped to listen to its rustling and to lay her hand upon the rough\r\nbark. It had been a cause of wonder once, for she knew no other tree\r\nof the kind. It was like a snow-drift when it was in bloom, and in the\r\ngrass-grown cellar she had spent many an hour, for there was a good\r\nshelter from the wind and an excellent hiding-place, though it seemed\r\nvery shallow now when she looked at it as she went by.\r\n\r\nThe burying-place was shut in by a plain stone wall, which she had\r\nlong ago asked the Dyers to build for her, and she leaned over it now\r\nand looked at the smooth turf of the low graves. She had always\r\nthought she would like to lie there too when her work was done. There\r\nwere some of the graves which she did not know, but one was her poor\r\nyoung mother\'s, who had left her no inheritance except some traits\r\nthat had won Nan many friends; all her evil gifts had been buried with\r\nher, the neighbors had said, when the girl was out of hearing, that\r\nvery afternoon.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange fascination about these river uplands; no place\r\nwas so dear to Nan, and yet she often thought with a shudder of the\r\nstory of those footprints which had sought the river\'s brink, and then\r\nturned back. Perhaps, made pure and strong in a better world, in which\r\nsome lingering love and faith had given her the true direction at\r\nlast, where even her love for her child had saved her, the mother had\r\nbeen still taking care of little Nan and guiding her. Perhaps she had\r\nhelped to make sure of the blessings her own life had lost, of truth\r\nand whiteness of soul and usefulness; and so had been still bringing\r\nher child in her arms toward the great shelter and home, as she had\r\ntoiled in her fright and weakness that dark and miserable night toward\r\nthe house on the hill.\r\n\r\nAnd Nan stood on the shore while the warm wind that gently blew her\r\nhair felt almost like a hand, and presently she went closer to the\r\nriver, and looked far across it and beyond it to the hills. The eagles\r\nswung to and fro above the water, but she looked beyond them into the\r\nsky. The soft air and the sunshine came close to her; the trees stood\r\nabout and seemed to watch her; and suddenly she reached her hands\r\nupward in an ecstasy of life and strength and gladness. "O God," she\r\nsaid, "I thank thee for my future."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTED STORIES AND SKETCHES\r\n\r\nby Sarah Orne Jewett\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORIES FROM _Strangers and Wayfarers_, Published 1890\r\n\r\n  A WINTER COURTSHIP              (_Atlantic Monthly_, Feb., 1889)\r\n\r\n  GOING TO SHREWSBURY             (_Atlantic Monthly_, July, 1889)\r\n\r\n  THE WHITE ROSE ROAD             (_Atlantic Monthly_, Sept., 1889)\r\n\r\n  THE TOWN POOR                   (_Atlantic Monthly_, July, 1890)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORIES FROM _A Native of Winby and Other Tales_, Published 1893\r\n\r\n  A NATIVE OF WINBY               (_Atlantic Monthly_, May, 1891)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOKING BACK ON GIRLHOOD, _Youth\'s Companion_, January 7, 1892\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE STORIES FROM _A Native of Winby and Other Tales_, Published 1893\r\n\r\n  THE PASSING OF SISTER BARSETT   (_Cosmopolitan Magazine_, May, 1892)\r\n\r\n  DECORATION DAY                  (_Harper\'s Magazine_, June, 1892)\r\n\r\n  THE FLIGHT OF BETSEY LANE       (_Scribner\'s Magazine_, Aug. 1893)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY MILLS OF FARLEY, _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, June, 1898\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Winter Courtship_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passenger and mail transportation between the towns of North Kilby\r\nand Sanscrit Pond was carried on by Mr. Jefferson Briley, whose\r\ntwo-seated covered wagon was usually much too large for the demands of\r\nbusiness. Both the Sanscrit Pond and North Kilby people were\r\nstayers-at-home, and Mr. Briley often made his seven-mile journey in\r\nentire solitude, except for the limp leather mail-bag, which he held\r\nfirmly to the floor of the carriage with his heavily shod left foot.\r\nThe mail-bag had almost a personality to him, born of long\r\nassociation. Mr. Briley was a meek and timid-looking body, but he held\r\na warlike soul, and encouraged his fancies by reading awful tales of\r\nbloodshed and lawlessness in the far West. Mindful of stage robberies\r\nand train thieves, and of express messengers who died at their posts,\r\nhe was prepared for anything; and although he had trusted to his own\r\nstrength and bravery these many years, he carried a heavy pistol under\r\nhis front-seat cushion for better defense. This awful weapon was\r\nfamiliar to all his regular passengers, and was usually shown to\r\nstrangers by the time two of the seven miles of Mr. Briley\'s route had\r\nbeen passed. The pistol was not loaded. Nobody (at least not Mr.\r\nBriley himself) doubted that the mere sight of such a weapon would\r\nturn the boldest adventurer aside.\r\n\r\nProtected by such a man and such a piece of armament, one gray Friday\r\nmorning in the edge of winter, Mrs. Fanny Tobin was traveling from\r\nSanscrit Pond to North Kilby. She was an elderly and feeble-looking\r\nwoman, but with a shrewd twinkle in her eyes, and she felt very\r\nanxious about her numerous pieces of baggage and her own personal\r\nsafety. She was enveloped in many shawls and smaller wrappings, but\r\nthey were not securely fastened, and kept getting undone and flying\r\nloose, so that the bitter December cold seemed to be picking a lock\r\nnow and then, and creeping in to steal away the little warmth she had.\r\nMr. Briley was cold, too, and could only cheer himself by remembering\r\nthe valor of those pony-express drivers of the pre-railroad days, who\r\nhad to cross the Rocky Mountains on the great California route. He\r\nspoke at length of their perils to the suffering passenger, who felt\r\nnone the warmer, and at last gave a groan of weariness.\r\n\r\n"How fur did you say \'t was now?"\r\n\r\n"I do\' know\'s I said, Mis\' Tobin," answered the driver, with a frosty\r\nlaugh. "You see them big pines, and the side of a barn just this way,\r\nwith them yellow circus bills? That\'s my three-mile mark."\r\n\r\n"Be we got four more to make? Oh, my laws!" mourned Mrs. Tobin. "Urge\r\nthe beast, can\'t ye, Jeff\'son? I ain\'t used to bein\' out in such bleak\r\nweather. Seems if I couldn\'t git my breath. I\'m all pinched up and\r\nwigglin\' with shivers now. \'T ain\'t no use lettin\' the hoss go\r\nstep-a-ty-step, this fashion."\r\n\r\n"Landy me!" exclaimed the affronted driver. "I don\'t see why folks\r\nexpects me to race with the cars. Everybody that gits in wants me to\r\nrun the hoss to death on the road. I make a good everage o\' time, and\r\nthat\'s all I _can_ do. Ef you was to go back an\' forth every day but\r\nSabbath fur eighteen years, _you_\'d want to ease it all you could, and\r\nlet those thrash the spokes out o\' their wheels that wanted to. North\r\nKilby, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; Sanscrit Pond, Tuesdays,\r\nThu\'sdays, an\' Saturdays. Me an\' the beast\'s done it eighteen years\r\ntogether, and the creatur\' warn\'t, so to say, young when we begun it,\r\nnor I neither. I re\'lly didn\'t know\'s she\'d hold out till this time.\r\nThere, git up, will ye, old mar\'!" as the beast of burden stopped\r\nshort in the road.\r\n\r\nThere was a story that Jefferson gave this faithful creature a rest\r\nthree times a mile, and took four hours for the journey by himself,\r\nand longer whenever he had a passenger. But in pleasant weather the\r\nroad was delightful, and full of people who drove their own\r\nconveyances, and liked to stop and talk. There were not many farms,\r\nand the third growth of white pines made a pleasant shade, though\r\nJefferson liked to say that when he began to carry the mail his way\r\nlay through an open country of stumps and sparse underbrush, where the\r\nwhite pines nowadays completely arched the road.\r\n\r\nThey had passed the barn with circus posters, and felt colder than\r\never when they caught sight of the weather-beaten acrobats in their\r\ntights.\r\n\r\n"My gorry!" exclaimed Widow Tobin, "them pore creatur\'s looks as\r\ncheerless as little birch-trees in snow-time. I hope they dresses \'em\r\nwarmer this time o\' year. Now, there! look at that one jumpin\' through\r\nthe little hoop, will ye?"\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t git himself through there with two pair o\' pants on,"\r\nanswered Mr. Briley. "I expect they must have to keep limber as eels.\r\nI used to think, when I was a boy, that \'twas the only thing I could\r\never be reconciled to do for a livin\'. I set out to run away an\'\r\nfollow a rovin\' showman once, but mother needed me to home. There\r\nwarn\'t nobody but me an\' the little gals."\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t the only one that\'s be\'n disapp\'inted o\' their heart\'s\r\ndesire," said Mrs. Tobin sadly. "\'T warn\'t so that I could be spared\r\nfrom home to learn the dressmaker\'s trade."\r\n\r\n"\'T would a come handy later on, I declare," answered the sympathetic\r\ndriver, "bein\' \'s you went an\' had such a passel o\' gals to clothe an\'\r\nfeed. There, them that\'s livin\' is all well off now, but it must ha\'\r\nbeen some inconvenient for ye when they was small."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Briley, but then I\'ve had my mercies, too," said the widow\r\nsomewhat grudgingly. "I take it master hard now, though, havin\' to\r\ngive up my own home and live round from place to place, if they be my\r\nown child\'en. There was Ad\'line and Susan Ellen fussin\' an\' bickerin\'\r\nyesterday about who\'d got to have me next; and, Lord be thanked, they\r\nboth wanted me right off but I hated to hear \'em talkin\' of it over.\r\nI\'d rather live to home, and do for myself."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got consider\'ble used to boardin\'," said Jefferson, "sence ma\'am\r\ndied, but it made me ache \'long at the fust on \'t, I tell ye. Bein\' on\r\nthe road\'s I be, I couldn\'t do no ways at keepin\' house. I should want\r\nto keep right there and see to things."\r\n\r\n"Course you would," replied Mrs. Tobin, with a sudden inspiration of\r\nopportunity which sent a welcome glow all over her. "Course you would,\r\nJeff\'son,"--she leaned toward the front seat; "that is to say, onless\r\nyou had jest the right one to do it for ye."\r\n\r\nAnd Jefferson felt a strange glow also, and a sense of unexpected\r\ninterest and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"See here, Sister Tobin," he exclaimed with enthusiasm. "Why can\'t ye\r\ntake the trouble to shift seats, and come front here long o\' me? We\r\ncould put one buff\'lo top o\' the other,--they\'re both wearin\'\r\nthin,--and set close, and I do\' know but we sh\'d be more protected\r\nag\'inst the weather."\r\n\r\n"Well, I couldn\'t be no colder if I was froze to death," answered the\r\nwidow, with an amiable simper. "Don\'t ye let me delay you, nor put you\r\nout, Mr. Briley. I don\'t know\'s I\'d set forth to-day if I\'d known \'t\r\nwas so cold; but I had all my bundles done up, and I ain\'t one that\r\nputs my hand to the plough an\' looks back, \'cordin\' to Scriptur\'."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t wanted me to ride all them seven miles alone?" asked the\r\ngallant Briley sentimentally, as he lifted her down, and helped her up\r\nagain to the front seat. She was a few years older than he, but they\r\nhad been schoolmates, and Mrs. Tobin\'s youthful freshness was suddenly\r\nrevived to his mind\'s eye. She had a little farm; there was nobody\r\nleft at home now but herself, and so she had broken up housekeeping\r\nfor the winter. Jefferson himself had savings of no mean amount.\r\n\r\nThey tucked themselves in, and felt better for the change, but there\r\nwas a sudden awkwardness between them; they had not had time to\r\nprepare for an unexpected crisis.\r\n\r\n"They say Elder Bickers, over to East Sanscrit, \'s been and got\r\nmarried again to a gal that\'s four year younger than his oldest\r\ndaughter," proclaimed Mrs. Tobin presently. "Seems to me \'t was fool\'s\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"I view it so," said the stage-driver. "There\'s goin\' to be a mild\r\nopen winter for that fam\'ly."\r\n\r\n"What a joker you be for a man that\'s had so much responsibility!"\r\nsmiled Mrs. Tobin, after they had done laughing. "Ain\'t you never\r\n\'fraid, carryin\' mail matter and such valuable stuff, that you\'ll be\r\nset on an\' robbed, \'specially by night?"\r\n\r\nJefferson braced his feet against the dasher under the worn buffalo\r\nskin. "It is kind o\' scary, or would be for some folks, but I\'d like\r\nto see anybody get the better o\' me. I go armed, and I don\'t care who\r\nknows it. Some o\' them drover men that comes from Canady looks as if\r\nthey didn\'t care what they did, but I look \'em right in the eye every\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Men folks is brave by natur\'," said the widow admiringly. "You know\r\nhow Tobin would let his fist right out at anybody that undertook to\r\nsass him. Town-meetin\' days, if he got disappointed about the way\r\nthings went, he\'d lay \'em out in win\'rows; and ef he hadn\'t been a\r\nchurch-member he\'d been a real fightin\' character. I was always \'fraid\r\nto have him roused, for all he was so willin\' and meechin\' to home,\r\nand set round clever as anybody. My Susan Ellen used to boss him\r\nsame\'s the kitten, when she was four year old."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a kind of a sideways cant to my nose, that Tobin give me\r\nwhen we was to school. I don\'t know\'s you ever noticed it," said Mr.\r\nBriley. "We was scufflin\', as lads will. I never bore him no kind of a\r\ngrudge. I pitied ye, when he was taken away. I re\'lly did, now, Fanny.\r\nI liked Tobin first-rate, and I liked you. I used to say you was the\r\nhan\'somest girl to school."\r\n\r\n"Lemme see your nose. \'Tis all straight, for what I know," said the\r\nwidow gently, as with a trace of coyness she gave a hasty glance. "I\r\ndon\'t know but what \'tis warped a little, but nothin\' to speak of.\r\nYou\'ve got real nice features, like your marm\'s folks."\r\n\r\nIt was becoming a sentimental occasion, and Jefferson Briley felt that\r\nhe was in for something more than he had bargained. He hurried the\r\nfaltering sorrel horse, and began to talk of the weather. It certainly\r\ndid look like snow, and he was tired of bumping over the frozen road.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder if I hired a hand here another year, and went off\r\nout West myself to see the country."\r\n\r\n"Why, how you talk!" answered the widow.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," pursued Jefferson. "\'Tis tamer here than I like, and I was\r\ntellin\' \'em yesterday I\'ve got to know this road most too well. I\'d\r\nlike to go out an\' ride in the mountains with some o\' them great\r\nclipper coaches, where the driver don\'t know one minute but he\'ll be\r\nshot dead the next. They carry an awful sight o\' gold down from the\r\nmines, I expect."\r\n\r\n"I should be scairt to death," said Mrs. Tobin. "What creatur\'s men\r\nfolks be to like such things! Well, I do declare."\r\n\r\n"Yes," explained the mild little man. "There\'s sights of desp\'radoes\r\nmakes a han\'some livin\' out o\' followin\' them coaches, an\' stoppin\'\r\nan\' robbin\' \'em clean to the bone. Your money _or_ your life!" and he\r\nflourished his stub of a whip over the sorrel mare.\r\n\r\n"Landy me! you make me run all of a cold creep. Do tell somethin\'\r\nheartenin\', this cold day. I shall dream bad dreams all night."\r\n\r\n"They put on black crape over their heads," said the driver\r\nmysteriously. "Nobody knows who most on \'em be, and like as not some\r\no\' them fellows come o\' good families. They\'ve got so they stop the\r\ncars, and go right through \'em bold as brass. I could make your hair\r\nstand on end, Mis\' Tobin,--I could _so!_"\r\n\r\n"I hope none on \'em\'ll git round our way, I\'m sure," said Fanny Tobin.\r\n"I don\'t want to see none on \'em in their crape bunnits comin\' after\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t goin\' to let nobody touch a hair o\' your head," and Mr.\r\nBriley moved a little nearer, and tucked in the buffaloes again.\r\n\r\n"I feel considerable warm to what I did," observed the widow by way of\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n"There, I used to have my fears," Mr. Briley resumed, with an inward\r\nfeeling that he never would get to North Kilby depot a single man.\r\n"But you see I hadn\'t nobody but myself to think of. I\'ve got cousins,\r\nas you know, but nothin\' nearer, and what I\'ve laid up would soon be\r\nparted out; and--well, I suppose some folks would think o\' me if\r\nanything was to happen."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tobin was holding her cloud over her face,--the wind was sharp on\r\nthat bit of open road,--but she gave an encouraging sound, between a\r\ngroan and a chirp.\r\n\r\n"\'T wouldn\'t be like nothin\' to me not to see you drivin\' by," she\r\nsaid, after a minute. "I shouldn\'t know the days o\' the week. I says\r\nto Susan Ellen last week I was sure \'twas Friday, and she said no,\r\n\'twas Thursday; but next minute you druv by and headin\' toward North\r\nKilby, so we found I was right."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to be a featur\' of the landscape," said Mr. Briley\r\nplaintively. "This kind o\' weather the old mare and me, we wish we was\r\ndone with it, and could settle down kind o\' comfortable. I\'ve been\r\nlookin\' this good while, as I drove the road, and I\'ve picked me out a\r\npiece o\' land two or three times. But I can\'t abide the thought o\'\r\nbuildin\',--\'twould plague me to death; and both Sister Peak to North\r\nKilby and Mis\' Deacon Ash to the Pond, they vie with one another to do\r\nwell by me, fear I\'ll like the other stoppin\'-place best."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t covet livin\' long o\' neither one o\' them women,"\r\nresponded the passenger with some spirit. "I see some o\' Mis\' Peak\'s\r\ncookin\' to a farmers\' supper once, when I was visitin\' Susan Ellen\'s\r\nfolks, an\' I says \'Deliver me from sech pale-complected baked beans as\r\nthem!\' and she give a kind of a quack. She was settin\' jest at my left\r\nhand, and couldn\'t help hearin\' of me. I wouldn\'t have spoken if I had\r\nknown, but she needn\'t have let on they was hers an\' make everything\r\nunpleasant. \'I guess them beans taste just as well as other folks\',\'\r\nsays she, and she wouldn\'t never speak to me afterward."\r\n\r\n"Do\' know\'s I blame her," ventured Mr. Briley. "Women folks is\r\ndreadful pudjicky about their cookin\'. I\'ve always heard you was one\r\no\' the best o\' cooks, Mis\' Tobin. I know them doughnuts an\' things\r\nyou\'ve give me in times past, when I was drivin\' by. Wish I had some\r\non \'em now. I never let on, but Mis\' Ash\'s cookin\'s the best by a long\r\nchalk. Mis\' Peak\'s handy about some things, and looks after mendin\' of\r\nme up."\r\n\r\n"It doos seem as if a man o\' your years and your quiet make ought to\r\nhave a home you could call your own," suggested the passenger. "I kind\r\nof hate to think o\' your bangein\' here and boardin\' there, and one old\r\nwoman mendin\', and the other settin\' ye down to meals that like\'s not\r\ndon\'t agree with ye."\r\n\r\n"Lor\', now, Mis\' Tobin, le\'s not fuss round no longer," said Mr.\r\nBriley impatiently. "You know you covet me same\'s I do you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t nuther. Don\'t you go an\' say fo\'lish things you can\'t stand\r\nto."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been tryin\' to git a chance to put in a word with you ever\r\nsence--Well, I expected you\'d want to get your feelin\'s kind o\'\r\ncalloused after losin\' Tobin."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nobody can fill his place," said the widow.\r\n\r\n"I do\' know but I can fight for ye town-meetin\' days, on a pinch,"\r\nurged Jefferson boldly.\r\n\r\n"I never see the beat o\' you men fur conceit," and Mrs. Tobin laughed.\r\n"I ain\'t goin\' to bother with ye, gone half the time as you be, an\'\r\ncarryin\' on with your Mis\' Peaks and Mis\' Ashes. I dare say you\'ve\r\npromised yourself to both on \'em twenty times."\r\n\r\n"I hope to gracious if I ever breathed a word to none on \'em!"\r\nprotested the lover. "\'T ain\'t for lack o\' opportunities set afore me,\r\nnuther;" and then Mr. Briley craftily kept silence, as if he had made\r\na fair proposal, and expected a definite reply.\r\n\r\nThe lady of his choice was, as she might have expressed it, much beat\r\nabout. As she soberly thought, she was getting along in years, and\r\nmust put up with Jefferson all the rest of the time. It was not likely\r\nshe would ever have the chance of choosing again, though she was one\r\nwho liked variety.\r\n\r\nJefferson wasn\'t much to look at, but he was pleasant and appeared\r\nboyish and young-feeling. "I do\' know\'s I should do better," she said\r\nunconsciously and half aloud. "Well, yes, Jefferson, seein\' it\'s you.\r\nBut we\'re both on us kind of old to change our situation." Fanny Tobin\r\ngave a gentle sigh.\r\n\r\n"Hooray!" said Jefferson. "I was scairt you meant to keep me sufferin\'\r\nhere a half an hour. I declare, I\'m more pleased than I calc\'lated on.\r\nAn\' I expected till lately to die a single man!"\r\n\r\n"\'Twould re\'lly have been a shame; \'tain\'t natur\'," said Mrs. Tobin,\r\nwith confidence. "I don\'t see how you held out so long with bein\'\r\nsolitary."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll hire a hand to drive for me, and we\'ll have a good comfortable\r\nwinter, me an\' you an\' the old sorrel. I\'ve been promisin\' of her a\r\nrest this good while."\r\n\r\n"Better keep her a steppin\'," urged thrifty Mrs. Fanny. "She\'ll\r\nstiffen up master, an\' disapp\'int ye, come spring."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have me, now, won\'t ye, sartin?" pleaded Jefferson, to make\r\nsure. "You ain\'t one o\' them that plays with a man\'s feelin\'s. Say\r\nright out you\'ll have me."\r\n\r\n"I s\'pose I shall have to," said Mrs. Tobin somewhat mournfully. "I\r\nfeel for Mis\' Peak an\' Mis\' Ash, pore creatur\'s. I expect they\'ll be\r\nhardshipped. They\'ve always been hard-worked, an\' may have kind o\'\r\nlooked forward to a little ease. But one on \'em would be left\r\nlamentin\', anyhow," and she gave a girlish laugh. An air of victory\r\nanimated the frame of Mrs. Tobin. She felt but twenty-five years of\r\nage. In that moment she made plans for cutting her Briley\'s hair, and\r\nmaking him look smartened-up and ambitious. Then she wished that she\r\nknew for certain how much money he had in the bank; not that it would\r\nmake any difference now. "He needn\'t bluster none before me," she\r\nthought gayly. "He\'s harmless as a fly."\r\n\r\n"Who\'d have thought we\'d done such a piece of engineerin\', when we\r\nstarted out?" inquired the dear one of Mr. Briley\'s heart, as he\r\ntenderly helped her to alight at Susan Ellen\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Both on us, jest the least grain," answered the lover. "Gimme a good\r\nsmack, now, you clever creatur\';" and so they parted. Mr. Bailey had\r\nbeen taken on the road in spite of his pistol.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Going to Shrewsbury_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train stopped at a way station with apparent unwillingness, and\r\nthere was barely time for one elderly passenger to be hurried on board\r\nbefore a sudden jerk threw her almost off her unsteady old feet and we\r\nmoved on. At my first glance I saw only a perturbed old countrywoman,\r\nladen with a large basket and a heavy bundle tied up in an\r\nold-fashioned bundle-handkerchief; then I discovered that she was a\r\nfriend of mine, Mrs. Peet, who lived on a small farm, several miles\r\nfrom the village. She used to be renowned for good butter and fresh\r\neggs and the earliest cowslip greens; in fact, she always made the\r\nmost of her farm\'s slender resources; but it was some time since I had\r\nseen her drive by from market in her ancient thorough-braced wagon.\r\n\r\nThe brakeman followed her into the crowded car, also carrying a number\r\nof packages. I leaned forward and asked Mrs. Peet to sit by me; it was\r\na great pleasure to see her again. The brakeman seemed relieved, and\r\nsmiled as he tried to put part of his burden into the rack overhead;\r\nbut even the flowered carpet-bag was much too large, and he explained\r\nthat he would take care of everything at the end of the car. Mrs. Peet\r\nwas not large herself, but with the big basket, and the\r\nbundle-handkerchief, and some possessions of my own we had very little\r\nspare room.\r\n\r\n"So this \'ere is what you call ridin\' in the cars! Well, I do\r\ndeclare!" said my friend, as soon as she had recovered herself a\r\nlittle. She looked pale and as if she had been in tears, but there was\r\nthe familiar gleam of good humor in her tired old eyes.\r\n\r\n"Where in the world are you going, Mrs. Peet?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t be you ain\'t heared about me, dear?" said she. "Well, the\r\nworld\'s bigger than I used to think \'t was. I\'ve broke up,--\'twas the\r\nonly thing _to_ do,--and I\'m a-movin\' to Shrewsbury."\r\n\r\n"To Shrewsbury? Have you sold the farm?" I exclaimed, with sorrow and\r\nsurprise. Mrs. Peet was too old and too characteristic to be suddenly\r\ntransplanted from her native soil. "\'T wa\'n\'t mine, the place wa\'n\'t."\r\nHer pleasant face hardened slightly. "He was coaxed an\' over-persuaded\r\ninto signin\' off before he was taken away. Is\'iah, son of his sister\r\nthat married old Josh Peet, come it over him about his bein\' past work\r\nand how he\'d do for him like an own son, an\' we owed him a little\r\nsomethin\'. I\'d paid off everythin\' but that, an\' was fool enough to\r\nleave it till the last, on account o\' Is\'iah\'s bein\' a relation and\r\nnot needin\' his pay much as some others did. It\'s hurt me to have the\r\nplace fall into other hands. Some wanted me to go right to law; but \'t\r\nwouldn\'t be no use. Is\'iah\'s smarter \'n I be about them matters. You\r\nsee he\'s got my name on the paper, too; he said \'t was somethin\' \'bout\r\nbein\' responsible for the taxes. We was scant o\' money, an\' I was wore\r\nout with watchin\' an\' being broke o\' my rest. After my tryin\' hard for\r\nrisin\' forty-five year to provide for bein\' past work, here I be,\r\ndear, here I be! I used to drive things smart, you remember. But we\r\nwas fools enough in \'72 to put about everythin\' we had safe in the\r\nbank into that spool factory that come to nothin\'. But I tell ye I\r\ncould ha\' kept myself long\'s I lived, if I could ha\' held the place.\r\nI\'d parted with most o\' the woodland, if Is\'iah\'d coveted it. He was\r\nwelcome to that, \'cept what might keep me in oven-wood. I\'ve always\r\ndesired to travel an\' see somethin\' o\' the world, but I\'ve got the\r\nchance now when I don\'t value it no great."\r\n\r\n"Shrewsbury is a busy, pleasant place," I ventured to say by way of\r\ncomfort, though my heart was filled with rage at the trickery of\r\nIsaiah Peet, who had always looked like a fox and behaved like one.\r\n\r\n"Shrewsbury\'s be\'n held up consid\'able for me to smile at," said the\r\npoor old soul, "but I tell ye, dear, it\'s hard to go an\' live\r\ntwenty-two miles from where you\'ve always had your home and friends.\r\nIt may divert me, but it won\'t be home. You might as well set out one\r\no\' my old apple-trees on the beach, so \'t could see the waves come\r\nin,--there wouldn\'t be no please to it."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going to live in Shrewsbury?" I asked presently.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect to stop long, dear creatur\'. I\'m \'most seventy-six\r\nyear old," and Mrs. Peet turned to look at me with pathetic amusement\r\nin her honest wrinkled face. "I said right out to Is\'iah, before a\r\nroomful o\' the neighbors, that I expected it of him to git me home an\'\r\nbury me when my time come, and do it respectable; but I wanted to airn\r\nmy livin\', if \'twas so I could, till then. He\'d made sly talk, you\r\nsee, about my electin\' to leave the farm and go \'long some o\' my own\r\nfolks; but"--and she whispered this carefully--"he didn\'t give me no\r\nchance to stay there without hurtin\' my pride and dependin\' on him. I\r\nain\'t said that to many folks, but all must have suspected. A good\r\nsight on \'em\'s had money of Is\'iah, though, and they don\'t like to do\r\nnothin\' but take his part an\' be pretty soft spoken, fear it\'ll git to\r\nhis ears. Well, well, dear, we\'ll let it be bygones, and not think of\r\nit no more;" but I saw the great tears roll slowly down her cheeks,\r\nand she pulled her bonnet forward impatiently, and looked the other\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"There looks to be plenty o\' good farmin\' land in this part o\' the\r\ncountry," she said, a minute later. "Where be we now? See them\r\nhandsome farm buildin\'s; he must be a well-off man." But I had to\r\ntell my companion that we were still within the borders of the old\r\ntown where we had both been born. Mrs. Peet gave a pleased little\r\nlaugh, like a girl. "I\'m expectin\' Shrewsbury to pop up any minute.\r\nI\'m feared to be kerried right by. I wa\'n\'t never aboard of the cars\r\nbefore, but I\'ve so often thought about \'em I don\'t know but it seems\r\nnatural. Ain\'t it jest like flyin\' through the air? I can\'t catch holt\r\nto see nothin\'. Land! and here\'s my old cat goin\' too, and never\r\nmistrustin\'. I ain\'t told you that I\'d fetched her."\r\n\r\n"Is she in that basket?" I inquired with interest.\r\n\r\n"Yis, dear. Truth was, I calc\'lated to have her put out o\' the misery\r\no\' movin\', an spoke to one o\' the Barnes boys, an\' he promised me all\r\nfair; but he wa\'n\'t there in season, an\' I kind o\' made excuse to\r\nmyself to fetch her along. She\'s an\' old creatur\', like me, an\' I can\r\nmake shift to keep her some way or \'nuther; there\'s probably mice\r\nwhere we\'re goin\', an\' she\'s a proper mouser that can about keep\r\nherself if there\'s any sort o\' chance. \'T will be somethin\' o\' home to\r\nsee her goin\' an\' comin\', but I expect we\'re both on us goin\' to miss\r\nour old haunts. I\'d love to know what kind o\' mousin\' there\'s goin\' to\r\nbe for me."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t worry," I answered, with all the bravery and assurance\r\nthat I could muster. "Your niece will be thankful to have you with\r\nher. Is she one of Mrs. Winn\'s daughters?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, they ain\'t able; it\'s Sister Wayland\'s darter Isabella, that\r\nmarried the overseer of the gre\'t carriage-shop. I ain\'t seen her\r\nsince just after she was married; but I turned to her first because I\r\nknew she was best able to have me, and then I can see just how the\r\nother girls is situated and make me some kind of a plot. I wrote to\r\nIsabella, though she _is_ ambitious, and said \'twas so I\'d got to ask\r\nto come an\' make her a visit, an\' she wrote back she would be glad to\r\nhave me; but she didn\'t write right off, and her letter was scented up\r\ndreadful strong with some sort o\' essence, and I don\'t feel heartened\r\nabout no great of a welcome. But there, I\'ve got eyes, an\' I can see\r\n_ho_\'t is when I git _where_\'t is. Sister Winn\'s gals ain\'t married,\r\nan\' they\'ve always boarded, an\' worked in the shop on trimmin\'s.\r\nIsabella\'s well off; she had some means from her father\'s sister. I\r\nthought it all over by night an\' day, an\' I recalled that our folks\r\nkept Sister Wayland\'s folks all one winter, when he\'d failed up and\r\ngot into trouble. I\'m reckonin\' on sendin\' over to-night an\' gittin\'\r\nthe Winn gals to come and see me and advise. Perhaps some on \'em may\r\nknow of somebody that\'ll take me for what help I can give about house,\r\nor some clever folks that have been lookin\' for a smart cat, any ways;\r\nno, I don\'t know\'s I could let her go to strangers.\r\n\r\n"There was two or three o\' the folks round home that acted real\r\nwarm-hearted towards me, an\' urged me to come an\' winter with \'em,"\r\ncontinued the exile; "an\' this mornin\' I wished I\'d agreed to, \'twas\r\nso hard to break away. But now it\'s done I feel more\'n ever it\'s best.\r\nI couldn\'t bear to live right in sight o\' the old place, and come\r\nspring I shouldn\'t \'prove of nothing Is\'iah ondertakes to do with the\r\nland. Oh, dear sakes! now it comes hard with me not to have had no\r\nchild\'n. When I was young an\' workin\' hard and into everything, I felt\r\nkind of free an\' superior to them that was so blessed, an\' their\r\nhouses cluttered up from mornin\' till night, but I tell ye it comes\r\nhome to me now. I\'d be most willin\' to own to even Is\'iah, mean\'s he\r\nis; but I tell ye I\'d took it out of him \'fore he was a grown man, if\r\nthere\'d be\'n any virtue in cow-hidin\' of him. Folks don\'t look like\r\nwild creatur\'s for nothin\'. Is\'iah\'s got fox blood in him, an\'\r\np\'r\'haps \'t is his misfortune. His own mother always favored the looks\r\nof an old fox, true\'s the world; she was a poor tool,--a poor tool! I\r\nd\'know\'s we ought to blame him same\'s we do.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always been a master proud woman, if I was riz among the\r\npastures," Mrs. Peet added, half to herself. There was no use in\r\nsaying much to her; she was conscious of little beside her own\r\nthoughts and the smouldering excitement caused by this great crisis in\r\nher simple existence. Yet the atmosphere of her loneliness,\r\nuncertainty, and sorrow was so touching that after scolding again at\r\nher nephew\'s treachery, and finding the tears come fast to my eyes as\r\nshe talked, I looked intently out of the car window, and tried to\r\nthink what could be done for the poor soul. She was one of the\r\nold-time people, and I hated to have her go away; but even if she\r\ncould keep her home she would soon be too feeble to live there alone,\r\nand some definite plan must be made for her comfort. Farms in that\r\nneighborhood were not valuable. Perhaps through the agency of the law\r\nand quite in secret, Isaiah Peet could be forced to give up his\r\nunrighteous claim. Perhaps, too, the Winn girls, who were really no\r\nlonger young, might have saved something, and would come home again.\r\nBut it was easy to make such pictures in one\'s mind, and I must do\r\nwhat I could through other people, for I was just leaving home for a\r\nlong time. I wondered sadly about Mrs. Peet\'s future, and the\r\nambitious Isabella, and the favorite Sister Winn\'s daughters, to whom,\r\nwith all their kindliness of heart, the care of so old and perhaps so\r\ndependent an aunt might seem impossible. The truth about life in\r\nShrewsbury would soon be known; more than half the short journey was\r\nalready past.\r\n\r\nTo my great pleasure, my fellow-traveler now began to forget her own\r\ntroubles in looking about her. She was an alert, quickly interested\r\nold soul, and this was a bit of neutral ground between the farm and\r\nShrewsbury, where she was unattached and irresponsible. She had lived\r\nthrough the last tragic moments of her old life, and felt a certain\r\nrelief, and Shrewsbury might be as far away as the other side of the\r\nRocky Mountains for all the consciousness she had of its real\r\nexistence. She was simply a traveler for the time being, and began to\r\ncomment, with delicious phrases and shrewd understanding of human\r\nnature, on two or three persons near us who attracted her attention.\r\n\r\n"Where do you s\'pose they be all goin\'?" she asked contemptuously.\r\n"There ain\'t none on \'em but what looks kind o\' respectable. I\'ll\r\nwarrant they\'ve left work to home they\'d ought to be doin\'. I knowed,\r\nif ever I stopped to think, that cars was hived full o\' folks, an\'\r\nwa\'n\'t run to an\' fro for nothin\'; but these can\'t be quite up to the\r\naverage, be they? Some on \'em\'s real thrif\'less; guess they\'ve be\'n\r\nshoved out o\' the last place, an\' goin\' to try the next one,--like me,\r\nI suppose you\'ll want to say! Jest see that flauntin\' old creatur\'\r\nthat looks like a stopped clock. There! everybody can\'t be o\' one\r\ngoodness, even preachers."\r\n\r\nI was glad to have Mrs. Peet amused, and we were as cheerful as we\r\ncould be for a few minutes. She said earnestly that she hoped to be\r\nforgiven for such talk, but there were some kinds of folks in the cars\r\nthat she never had seen before. But when the conductor came to take\r\nher ticket she relapsed into her first state of mind, and was at a\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to look after me, dear, when we get to Shrewsbury," she\r\nsaid, after we had spent some distracted moments in hunting for the\r\nticket, and the cat had almost escaped from the basket, and the\r\nbundle-handkerchief had become untied and all its miscellaneous\r\ncontents scattered about our laps and the floor. It was a touching\r\ncollection of the last odds and ends of Mrs. Peet\'s housekeeping: some\r\nbattered books, and singed holders for flatirons, and the faded little\r\nshoulder shawl that I had seen her wear many a day about her bent\r\nshoulders. There were her old tin match-box spilling all its matches,\r\nand a goose-wing for brushing up ashes, and her much-thumbed Leavitt\'s\r\nAlmanac. It was most pathetic to see these poor trifles out of their\r\nplaces. At last the ticket was found in her left-hand woolen glove,\r\nwhere her stiff, work-worn hand had grown used to the feeling of it.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder, now, if I come to like living over to Shrewsbury\r\nfirst-rate," she insisted, turning to me with a hopeful, eager look to\r\nsee if I differed. "You see\'t won\'t be so tough for me as if I hadn\'t\r\nalways felt it lurking within me to go off some day or \'nother an\' see\r\nhow other folks did things. I do\' know but what the Winn gals have\r\nlaid up somethin\' sufficient for us to take a house, with the little\r\nmite I\'ve got by me. I might keep house for us all, \'stead o\' boardin\'\r\nround in other folks\' houses. That I ain\'t never been demeaned to, but\r\nI dare say I should find it pleasant in some ways. Town folks has got\r\nthe upper hand o\' country folks, but with all their work an\' pride\r\nthey can\'t make a dandelion. I do\' know the times when I\'ve set out to\r\nwash Monday mornin\'s, an\' tied out the line betwixt the old\r\npucker-pear tree and the corner o\' the barn, an\' thought, \'Here I be\r\nwith the same kind o\' week\'s work right over again.\' I\'d wonder kind\r\no\' f\'erce if I couldn\'t git out of it noways; an\' now here I be out\r\nof it, and an uprooteder creatur\' never stood on the airth. Just as I\r\ngot to feel I had somethin\' ahead come that spool-factory business.\r\nThere! you know he never was a forehanded man; his health was slim,\r\nand he got discouraged pretty nigh before ever he begun. I hope he\r\ndon\'t know I\'m turned out o\' the old place. \'Is\'iah\'s well off; he\'ll\r\ndo the right thing by ye,\' says he. But my! I turned hot all over when\r\nI found out what I\'d put my name to,--me that had always be\'n counted\r\na smart woman! I did undertake to read it over, but I couldn\'t sense\r\nit. I\'ve told all the folks so when they laid it off on to me some:\r\nbut hand-writin\' is awful tedious readin\' and my head felt that day as\r\nif the works was gone.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t goin\' to sag on to nobody," she assured me eagerly, as the\r\ntrain rushed along. "I\'ve got more work in me now than folks expects\r\nat my age. I may be consid\'able use to Isabella. She\'s got a family,\r\nan\' I\'ll take right holt in the kitchen or with the little gals. She\r\nhad four on \'em, last I heared. Isabella was never one that liked\r\nhouse-work. Little gals! I do\' know now but what they must be about\r\ngrown, time doos slip away so. I expect I shall look outlandish to\r\n\'em. But there! everybody knows me to home, an\' nobody knows me to\r\nShrewsbury; \'twon\'t make a mite o\' difference, if I take holt\r\nwillin\'."\r\n\r\nI hoped, as I looked at Mrs. Peet, that she would never be persuaded\r\nto cast off the gathered brown silk bonnet and the plain shawl that\r\nshe had worn so many years; but Isabella might think it best to insist\r\nupon more modern fashions. Mrs. Peet suggested, as if it were a matter\r\nof little consequence, that she had kept it in mind to buy some\r\nmourning; but there were other things to be thought of first, and so\r\nshe had let it go until winter, any way, or until she should be fairly\r\nsettled in Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n"Are your nieces expecting you by this train?" I was moved to ask,\r\nthough with all the good soul\'s ready talk and appealing manner I\r\ncould hardly believe that she was going to Shrewsbury for more than a\r\nvisit; it seemed as if she must return to the worn old farmhouse over\r\nby the sheep-lands. She answered that one of the Barnes boys had\r\nwritten a letter for her the day before, and there was evidently\r\nlittle uneasiness about her first reception.\r\n\r\nWe drew near the junction where I must leave her within a mile of the\r\ntown. The cat was clawing indignantly at the basket, and her mistress\r\ngrew as impatient of the car. She began to look very old and pale, my\r\npoor fellow-traveler, and said that she felt dizzy, going so fast.\r\nPresently the friendly red-cheeked young brakeman came along, bringing\r\nthe carpet-bag and other possessions, and insisted upon taking the\r\nalarmed cat beside, in spite of an aggressive paw that had worked its\r\nway through the wicker prison. Mrs. Peet watched her goods disappear\r\nwith suspicious eyes, and clutched her bundle-handkerchief as if it\r\nmight be all that she could save. Then she anxiously got to her feet,\r\nmuch too soon, and when I said good-by to her at the car door she was\r\nready to cry. I pointed to the car which she was to take next on the\r\nbranch line of railway, and I assured her that it was only a few\r\nminutes\' ride to Shrewsbury, and that I felt certain she would find\r\nsomebody waiting. The sight of that worn, thin figure adventuring\r\nalone across the platform gave my heart a sharp pang as the train\r\ncarried me away.\r\n\r\nSome of the passengers who sat near asked me about my old friend with\r\ngreat sympathy, after she had gone. There was a look of tragedy about\r\nher, and indeed it had been impossible not to get a good deal of her\r\nhistory, as she talked straight on in the same tone, when we stopped\r\nat a station, as if the train were going at full speed, and some of\r\nher remarks caused pity and amusements by turns. At the last minute\r\nshe said, with deep self-reproach, "Why, I haven\'t asked a word about\r\nyour folks; but you\'d ought to excuse such an old stray hen as I be."\r\n\r\nIn the spring I was driving by on what the old people of my native\r\ntown call the sheep-lands road, and the sight of Mrs. Peet\'s former\r\nhome brought our former journey freshly to my mind. I had last heard\r\nfrom her just after she got to Shrewsbury, when she had sent me a\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever heard how she got on?" I eagerly asked my companion.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you that I met her in Shrewsbury High Street one day?"\r\nI was answered. "She seemed perfectly delighted with everything. Her\r\nnieces have laid up a good bit of money, and are soon to leave the\r\nmill, and most thankful to have old Mrs. Peet with them. Somebody told\r\nme that they wished to buy the farm here, and come back to live, but\r\nshe wouldn\'t hear of it, and thought they would miss too many\r\nprivileges. She has been going to concerts and lectures this winter,\r\nand insists that Isaiah did her a good turn."\r\n\r\nWe both laughed. My own heart was filled with joy, for the uncertain,\r\nlonely face of this homeless old woman had often haunted me. The\r\nrain-blackened little house did certainly look dreary, and a whole\r\nlifetime of patient toil had left few traces. The pucker-pear tree was\r\nin full bloom, however, and gave a welcome gaiety to the deserted\r\ndoor-yard.\r\n\r\nA little way beyond we met Isaiah Peet, the prosperous money-lender,\r\nwho had cheated the old woman of her own. I fancied that he looked\r\nsomewhat ashamed, as he recognized us. To my surprise, he stopped his\r\nhorse in most social fashion.\r\n\r\n"Old Aunt Peet\'s passed away," he informed me briskly. "She had a\r\nshock, and went right off sudden yisterday fore-noon. I\'m about now\r\ntendin\' to the funeral \'rangements. She\'s be\'n extry smart, they say,\r\nall winter,--out to meetin\' last Sabbath; never enjoyed herself so\r\ncomplete as she has this past month. She\'d be\'n a very hard-workin\'\r\nwoman. Her folks was glad to have her there, and give her every\r\nattention. The place here never was good for nothin\'. The old\r\ngen\'leman,--uncle, you know,--he wore hisself out tryin\' to make a\r\nlivin\' off from it."\r\n\r\nThere was an ostentatious sympathy and half-suppressed excitement from\r\nbad news which were quite lost upon us, and we did not linger to hear\r\nmuch more. It seemed to me as if I had known Mrs. Peet better than any\r\none else had known her. I had counted upon seeing her again, and\r\nhearing her own account of Shrewsbury life, its pleasures and its\r\nlimitations. I wondered what had become of the cat and the contents of\r\nthe faded bundle-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The White Rose Road_\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a New Englander, it is natural that I should first speak about\r\nthe weather. Only the middle of June, the green fields, and blue sky,\r\nand bright sun, with a touch of northern mountain wind blowing\r\nstraight toward the sea, could make such a day, and that is all one\r\ncan say about it. We were driving seaward through a part of the\r\ncountry which has been least changed in the last thirty years,--among\r\nfarms which have been won from swampy lowland, and rocky,\r\nstump-buttressed hillsides: where the forests wall in the fields, and\r\nsend their outposts year by year farther into the pastures. There is a\r\nyear or two in the history of these pastures before they have arrived\r\nat the dignity of being called woodland, and yet are too much shaded\r\nand overgrown by young trees to give proper pasturage, when they made\r\ndelightful harbors for the small wild creatures which yet remain, and\r\nfor wild flowers and berries. Here you send an astonished rabbit\r\nscurrying to his burrow, and there you startle yourself with a\r\npartridge, who seems to get the best of the encounter. Sometimes you\r\nsee a hen partridge and her brood of chickens crossing your path with\r\nan air of comfortable door-yard security. As you drive along the\r\nnarrow, grassy road, you see many charming sights and delightful nooks\r\non either hand, where the young trees spring out of a close-cropped\r\nturf that carpets the ground like velvet. Toward the east and the\r\nquaint fishing village of Ogunquit, I find the most delightful\r\nwoodland roads. There is little left of the large timber which once\r\nfilled the region, but much young growth, and there are hundreds of\r\nacres of cleared land and pasture-ground where the forests are\r\nspringing fast and covering the country once more, as if they had no\r\nidea of losing in their war with civilization and the intruding white\r\nsettler. The pine woods and the Indians seem to be next of kin, and\r\nthe former owners of this corner of New England are the only proper\r\nfigures to paint into such landscapes. The twilight under tall pines\r\nseems to be untenanted and to lack something, at first sight, as if\r\none opened the door of an empty house. A farmer passing through with\r\nhis axe is but an intruder, and children straying home from school\r\ngive one a feeling of solicitude at their unprotectedness. The pine\r\nwoods are the red man\'s house, and it may be hazardous even yet for\r\nthe gray farmhouses to stand so near the eaves of the forest. I have\r\nnoticed a distrust of the deep woods, among elderly people, which was\r\nsomething more than a fear of losing their way. It was a feeling of\r\ndefenselessness against some unrecognized but malicious influence.\r\n\r\nDriving through the long woodland way, shaded and chilly when you are\r\nout of the sun; across the Great Works River and its pretty elm-grown\r\nintervale; across the short bridges of brown brooks; delayed now and\r\nthen by the sight of ripe strawberries in sunny spots by the roadside,\r\none comes to a higher open country, where farm joins farm, and the\r\ncleared fields lie all along the highway, while the woods are pushed\r\nback a good distance on either hand. The wooded hills, bleak here and\r\nthere with granite ledges, rise beyond. The houses are beside the\r\nroad, with green door-yards and large barns, almost empty now, and\r\nwith wide doors standing open, as if they were already expecting the\r\nhay crop to be brought in. The tall green grass is waving in the\r\nfields as the wind goes over, and there is a fragrance of whiteweed\r\nand ripe strawberries and clover blowing through the sunshiny barns,\r\nwith their lean sides and their festoons of brown, dusty cobwebs;\r\ndull, comfortable creatures they appear to imaginative eyes, waiting\r\nhungrily for their yearly meal. The eave-swallows are teasing their\r\nsleepy shapes, like the birds which flit about great beasts; gay,\r\nmovable, irreverent, almost derisive, those barn swallows fly to and\r\nfro in the still, clear air.\r\n\r\nThe noise of our wheels brings fewer faces to the windows than usual,\r\nand we lose the pleasure of seeing some of our friends who are apt to\r\nbe looking out, and to whom we like to say good-day. Some funeral must\r\nbe taking place, or perhaps the women may have gone out into the\r\nfields. It is hoeing-time and strawberry-time, and already we have\r\nseen some of the younger women at work among the corn and potatoes.\r\nOne sight will be charming to remember. On a green hillside sloping\r\nto the west, near one of the houses, a thin little girl was working\r\naway lustily with a big hoe on a patch of land perhaps fifty feet by\r\ntwenty. There were all sorts of things growing there, as if a child\'s\r\nfancy had made the choice,--straight rows of turnips and carrots and\r\nbeets, a little of everything, one might say; but the only touch of\r\ncolor was from a long border of useful sage in full bloom of dull\r\nblue, on the upper side. I am sure this was called Katy\'s or Becky\'s\r\n_piece_ by the elder members of the family. One can imagine how the\r\nyoung creature had planned it in the spring, and persuaded the men to\r\nplough and harrow it, and since then had stoutly done all the work\r\nherself, and meant to send the harvest of the piece to market, and\r\npocket her honest gains, as they came in, for some great end. She was\r\nas thin as a grasshopper, this busy little gardener, and hardly turned\r\nto give us a glance, as we drove slowly up the hill close by. The sun\r\nwill brown and dry her like a spear of grass on that hot slope, but a\r\nspark of fine spirit is in the small body, and I wish her a famous\r\ncrop. I hate to say that the piece looked backward, all except the\r\nsage, and that it was a heavy bit of land for the clumsy hoe to pick\r\nat. The only puzzle is, what she proposes to do with so long a row of\r\nsage. Yet there may be a large family with a downfall of measles yet\r\nahead, and she does not mean to be caught without sage-tea.\r\n\r\nAlong this road every one of the old farmhouses has at least one tall\r\nbush of white roses by the door,--a most lovely sight, with buds and\r\nblossoms, and unvexed green leaves. I wish that I knew the history of\r\nthem, and whence the first bush was brought. Perhaps from England\r\nitself, like a red rose that I know in Kittery, and the new shoots\r\nfrom the root were given to one neighbor after another all through the\r\ndistrict. The bushes are slender, but they grow tall without climbing\r\nagainst the wall, and sway to and fro in the wind with a grace of\r\nyouth and an inexpressible charm of beauty. How many lovers must have\r\npicked them on Sunday evenings, in all the bygone years, and carried\r\nthem along the roads or by the pasture footpaths, hiding them clumsily\r\nunder their Sunday coats if they caught sight of any one coming. Here,\r\ntoo, where the sea wind nips many a young life before its prime, how\r\noften the white roses have been put into paler hands, and withered\r\nthere!\r\n\r\nIn spite of the serene and placid look of the old houses, one who has\r\nalways known them cannot help thinking of the sorrows of these farms\r\nand their almost undiverted toil. Near the little gardener\'s plot, we\r\nturned from the main road and drove through lately cleared woodland up\r\nto an old farmhouse, high on a ledgy hill, whence there is a fine view\r\nof the country seaward and mountainward. There were few of the once\r\nlarge household left there: only the old farmer, who was crippled by\r\nwar wounds, active, cheerful man that he was once, and two young\r\norphan children. There has been much hard work spent on the place.\r\nEvery generation has toiled from youth to age without being able to\r\nmake much beyond a living. The dollars that can be saved are but few,\r\nand sickness and death have often brought their bitter cost. The\r\nmistress of the farm was helpless for many years; through all the\r\nsummers and winters she sat in her pillowed rocking-chair in the plain\r\nroom. She could watch the seldom-visited lane, and beyond it, a little\r\nway across the fields, were the woods; besides these, only the clouds\r\nin the sky. She could not lift her food to her mouth; she could not be\r\nher husband\'s working partner. She never went into another woman\'s\r\nhouse to see her works and ways, but sat there, aching and tired,\r\nvexed by flies and by heat, and isolated in long storms. Yet the whole\r\ncountryside neighbored her with true affection. Her spirit grew\r\nstronger as her body grew weaker, and the doctors, who grieved because\r\nthey could do so little with their skill, were never confronted by\r\nthat malady of the spirit, a desire for ease and laziness, which makes\r\nthe soundest of bodies useless and complaining. The thought of her\r\nblooms in one\'s mind like the whitest of flowers; it makes one braver\r\nand more thankful to remember the simple faith and patience with which\r\nshe bore her pain and trouble. How often she must have said, "I wish I\r\ncould do something for you in return," when she was doing a thousand\r\ntimes more than if, like her neighbors, she followed the simple round\r\nof daily life! She was doing constant kindness by her example; but\r\nnobody can tell the woe of her long days and nights, the solitude of\r\nher spirit, as she was being lifted by such hard ways to the knowledge\r\nof higher truth and experience. Think of her pain when, one after\r\nanother, her children fell ill and died, and she could not tend them!\r\nAnd now, in the same worn chair where she lived and slept sat her\r\nhusband, helpless too, thinking of her, and missing her more than if\r\nshe had been sometimes away from home, like other women. Even a\r\nstranger would miss her in the house.\r\n\r\nThere sat the old farmer looking down the lane in his turn, bearing\r\nhis afflictions with a patient sternness that may have been born of\r\nwatching his wife\'s serenity. There was a half-withered rose lying\r\nwithin his reach. Some days nobody came up the lane, and the wild\r\nbirds that ventured near the house and the clouds that blew over were\r\nhis only entertainment. He had a fine face, of the older New England\r\ntype, clean-shaven and strong-featured,--a type that is fast passing\r\naway. He might have been a Cumberland dalesman, such were his dignity,\r\nand self-possession, and English soberness of manner. His large frame\r\nwas built for hard work, for lifting great weights and pushing his\r\nplough through new-cleared land. We felt at home together, and each\r\nknew many things that the other did of earlier days, and of losses\r\nthat had come with time. I remembered coming to the old house often in\r\nmy childhood; it was in this very farm lane that I first saw anemones,\r\nand learned what to call them. After we drove away, this crippled man\r\nmust have thought a long time about my elders and betters, as if he\r\nwere reading their story out of a book. I suppose he has hauled many a\r\nstick of timber pine down for ship-yards, and gone through the village\r\nso early in the winter morning that I, waking in my warm bed, only\r\nheard the sleds creak through the frozen snow as the slow oxen plodded\r\nby.\r\n\r\nNear the house a trout brook comes plashing over the ledges. At one\r\nplace there is a most exquisite waterfall, to which neither painter\'s\r\nbrush nor writer\'s pen can do justice. The sunlight falls through\r\nflickering leaves into the deep glen, and makes the foam whiter and\r\nthe brook more golden-brown. You can hear the merry noise of it all\r\nnight, all day, in the house. A little way above the farmstead it\r\ncomes through marshy ground, which I fear has been the cause of much\r\nillness and sorrow to the poor, troubled family. I had a thrill of\r\npain, as it seemed to me that the brook was mocking at all that\r\ntrouble with all its wild carelessness and loud laughter, as it\r\nhurried away down the glen.\r\n\r\nWhen we had said good-by and were turning the horses away, there\r\nsuddenly appeared in a footpath that led down from one of the green\r\nhills the young grandchild, just coming home from school. She was as\r\nquick as a bird, and as shy in her little pink gown, and balanced\r\nherself on one foot, like a flower. The brother was the elder of the\r\ntwo orphans; he was the old man\'s delight and dependence by day, while\r\nhis hired man was afield. The sober country boy had learned to wait\r\nand tend, and the young people were indeed a joy in that lonely\r\nhousehold. There was no sign that they ever played like other\r\nchildren,--no truckle-cart in the yard, no doll, no bits of broken\r\ncrockery in order on a rock. They had learned a fashion of life from\r\ntheir elders, and already could lift and carry their share of the\r\nburdens of life.\r\n\r\nIt was a country of wild flowers; the last of the columbines were\r\nclinging to the hillsides; down in the small, fenced meadows belonging\r\nto the farm were meadow rue just coming in flower, and red and white\r\nclover; the golden buttercups were thicker than the grass, while many\r\nmulleins were standing straight and slender among the pine stumps,\r\nwith their first blossoms atop. Rudbeckias had found their way in, and\r\nappeared more than ever like bold foreigners. Their names should be\r\ntranslated into country speech, and the children ought to call them\r\n"rude-beckies," by way of relating them to bouncing-bets and\r\nsweet-williams. The pasture grass was green and thick after the\r\nplentiful rains, and the busy cattle took little notice of us as they\r\nbrowsed steadily and tinkled their pleasant bells. Looking off, the\r\nsmooth, round back of Great Hill caught the sunlight with its fields\r\nof young grain, and all the long, wooded slopes and valleys were fresh\r\nand fair in the June weather, away toward the blue New Hampshire hills\r\non the northern horizon. Seaward stood Agamenticus, dark with its\r\npitch pines, and the far sea itself, blue and calm, ruled the uneven\r\ncountry with its unchangeable line.\r\n\r\nOut on the white rose road again, we saw more of the rose-trees than\r\never, and now and then a carefully tended flower garden, always\r\ndelightful to see and think about. These are not made by merely\r\nlooking through a florist\'s catalogue, and ordering this or that new\r\nseedling and a proper selection of bulbs or shrubs; everything in a\r\ncountry garden has its history and personal association. The old\r\nbushes, the perennials, are apt to have most tender relationship with\r\nthe hands that planted them long ago. There is a constant exchange of\r\nsuch treasures between the neighbors, and in the spring, slips and\r\ncuttings may be seen rooting on the window ledges, while the house\r\nplants give endless work all winter long, since they need careful\r\nprotection against frost in long nights of the severe weather. A\r\nflower-loving woman brings back from every one of her infrequent\r\njourneys some treasure of flower-seeds or a huge miscellaneous\r\nnosegay. Time to work in the little plot of pleasure-ground is hardly\r\nwon by the busy mistress of the farmhouse. The most appealing\r\ncollection of flowering plants and vines that I ever saw was in\r\nVirginia, once, above the exquisite valley spanned by the Natural\r\nBridge, a valley far too little known or praised. I had noticed an old\r\nlog house, as I learned to know the outlook from the picturesque\r\nhotel, and was sure that it must give a charming view from its perch\r\non the summit of a hill.\r\n\r\nOne day I went there,--one April day, when the whole landscape was\r\nfull of color from the budding trees,--and before I could look at the\r\nview, I caught sight of some rare vines, already in leaf, about the\r\ndilapidated walls of the cabin. Then across the low paling I saw the\r\nbrilliant colors of tulips and daffodils. There were many rose-bushes;\r\nin fact, the whole top of the hill was a flower garden, once well\r\ncared for and carefully ordered. It was all the work of an old woman\r\nof Scotch-Irish descent, who had been busy with the cares of life, and\r\na very hard worker; yet I was told that to gratify her love for\r\nflowers she would often go afoot many miles over those rough Virginia\r\nroads, with a root or cutting from her own garden, to barter for a new\r\nrose or a brighter blossom of some sort, with which she would return\r\nin triumph. I fancied that sometimes she had to go by night on these\r\ncharming quests. I could see her business-like, small figure setting\r\nforth down the steep path, when she had a good conscience toward her\r\nhousekeeping and the children were in order to be left. I am sure\r\nthat her friends thought of her when they were away from home and\r\ncould bring her an offering of something rare. Alas, she had grown too\r\nold and feeble to care for her dear blossoms any longer, and had been\r\nforced to go to live with a married son. I dare say that she was\r\nthinking of her garden that very day, and wondering if this plant or\r\nthat were not in bloom, and perhaps had a heartache at the thought\r\nthat her tenants, the careless colored children, might tread the young\r\nshoots of peony and rose, and make havoc in the herb-bed. It was an\r\nuncommon collection, made by years of patient toil and self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nI thought of that deserted Southern garden as I followed my own New\r\nEngland road. The flower-plots were in gay bloom all along the way;\r\nalmost every house had some flowers before it, sometimes carefully\r\nfenced about by stakes and barrel staves from the miscreant hens and\r\nchickens which lurked everywhere, and liked a good scratch and\r\nfluffing in soft earth this year as well as any other. The world\r\nseemed full of young life. There were calves tethered in pleasant\r\nshady spots, and puppies and kittens adventuring from the doorways.\r\nThe trees were full of birds: bobolinks, and cat-birds, and\r\nyellow-hammers, and golden robins, and sometimes a thrush, for the\r\nafternoon was wearing late. We passed the spring which once marked the\r\nboundary where three towns met,--Berwick, York, and Wells,--a famous\r\nspot in the early settlement of the country, but many of its old\r\ntraditions are now forgotten. One of the omnipresent regicides of\r\nCharles the First is believed to have hidden himself for a long time\r\nunder a great rock close by. The story runs that he made his miserable\r\nhome in this den for several years, but I believe that there is no\r\nrecord that more than three of the regicides escaped to this country,\r\nand their wanderings are otherwise accounted for. There is a firm\r\nbelief that one of them came to York, and was the ancestor of many\r\npersons now living there, but I do not know whether he can have been\r\nthe hero of the Baker\'s Spring hermitage beside. We stopped to drink\r\nsome of the delicious water, which never fails to flow cold and clear\r\nunder the shade of a great oak, and were amused with the sight of a\r\nflock of gay little country children who passed by in deep\r\nconversation. What could such atoms of humanity be talking about?\r\n"Old times," said John, the master of horse, with instant decision.\r\n\r\nWe met now and then a man or woman, who stopped to give us hospitable\r\ngreeting; but there was no staying for visits, lest the daylight might\r\nfail us. It was delightful to find this old-established neighborhood\r\nso thriving and populous, for a few days before I had driven over\r\nthree miles of road, and passed only one house that was tenanted, and\r\nsix cellars or crumbling chimneys where good farmhouses had been, the\r\nlilacs blooming in solitude, and the fields, cleared with so much\r\ndifficulty a century or two ago, all going back to the original\r\nwoodland from which they were won. What would the old farmers say to\r\nsee the fate of their worthy bequest to the younger generation? They\r\nwould wag their heads sorrowfully, with sad foreboding.\r\n\r\nAfter we had passed more woodland and a well-known quarry, where, for\r\na wonder, the derrick was not creaking and not a single hammer was\r\nclinking at the stone wedges, we did not see any one hoeing in the\r\nfields, as we had seen so many on the white rose road, the other side\r\nof the hills. Presently we met two or three people walking sedately,\r\nclad in their best clothes. There was a subdued air of public\r\nexcitement and concern, and one of us remembered that there had been a\r\ndeath in the neighborhood; this was the day of the funeral. The man\r\nhad been known to us in former years. We had an instinct to hide our\r\nunsympathetic pleasuring, but there was nothing to be done except to\r\nfollow our homeward road straight by the house.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was nearly ended by this time: the borrowed chairs were\r\nbeing set out in the yard in little groups; even the funeral supper\r\nhad been eaten, and the brothers and sisters and near relatives of the\r\ndeparted man were just going home. The new grave showed plainly out in\r\nthe green field near by. He had belonged to one of the ancient\r\nfamilies of the region, long settled on this old farm by the narrow\r\nriver; they had given their name to a bridge, and the bridge had\r\nchristened the meeting-house which stood close by. We were much struck\r\nby the solemn figure of the mother, a very old woman, as she walked\r\ntoward her old home with some of her remaining children. I had not\r\nthought to see her again, knowing her great age and infirmity. She was\r\nlike a presence out of the last century, tall and still erect,\r\ndark-eyed and of striking features, and a firm look not modern, but as\r\nif her mind were still set upon an earlier and simpler scheme of life.\r\nAn air of dominion cloaked her finely. She had long been queen of her\r\nsurroundings and law-giver to her great family. Royalty is a quality,\r\none of Nature\'s gifts, and there one might behold it as truly as if\r\nVictoria Regina Imperatrix had passed by. The natural instincts common\r\nto humanity were there undisguised, unconcealed, simply accepted. We\r\nhad seen a royal progress; she was the central figure of that rural\r\nsociety; as you looked at the little group, you could see her only.\r\nNow that she came abroad so rarely, her presence was not without deep\r\nsignificance, and so she took her homeward way with a primitive kind\r\nof majesty.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the neighborhood was in great excitement and quite\r\nthrown out of its usual placidity. An acquaintance came from a small\r\nhouse farther down the road, and we stopped for a word with him. We\r\nspoke of the funeral, and were told something of the man who had died.\r\n"Yes, and there\'s a man layin\' very sick here," said our friend in an\r\nexcited whisper. "_He_ won\'t last but a day or two. There\'s another\r\nman buried yesterday that was struck by lightnin\', comin\' acrost a\r\nfield when that great shower begun. The lightnin\' stove through his\r\nhat and run down all over him, and ploughed a spot in the ground."\r\nThere was a knot of people about the door; the minister of that\r\nscattered parish stood among them, and they all looked at us eagerly,\r\nas if we too might be carrying news of a fresh disaster through the\r\ncountryside.\r\n\r\nSomehow the melancholy tales did not touch our sympathies as they\r\nought, and we could not see the pathetic side of them as at another\r\ntime, the day was so full of cheer and the sky and earth so glorious.\r\nThe very fields looked busy with their early summer growth, the horses\r\nbegan to think of the clack of the oat-bin cover, and we were hurried\r\nalong between the silvery willows and the rustling alders, taking time\r\nto gather a handful of stray-away conserve roses by the roadside; and\r\nwhere the highway made a long bend eastward among the farms, two of us\r\nleft the carriage, and followed a footpath along the green river bank\r\nand through the pastures, coming out to the road again only a minute\r\nlater than the horses. I believe that it is an old Indian trail\r\nfollowed from the salmon falls farther down the river, where the\r\nup-country Indians came to dry the plentiful fish for their winter\r\nsupplies. I have traced the greater part of this deep-worn footpath,\r\nwhich goes straight as an arrow across the country, the first day\'s\r\ntrail being from the falls (where Mason\'s settlers came in 1627, and\r\nbuilt their Great Works of a saw-mill with a gang of saws, and\r\npresently a grist mill beside) to Emery\'s Bridge. I should like to\r\nfollow the old footpath still farther. I found part of it by accident\r\na long time ago. Once, as you came close to the river, you were sure\r\nto find fishermen scattered along,--sometimes I myself have been\r\ndiscovered; but it is not much use to go fishing any more. If some\r\npublic-spirited person would kindly be the Frank Buckland of New\r\nEngland, and try to have the laws enforced that protect the inland\r\nfisheries, he would do his country great service. Years ago, there\r\nwere so many salmon that, as an enthusiastic old friend once assured\r\nme, "you could walk across on them below the falls;" but now they are\r\nunknown, simply because certain substances which would enrich the\r\nfarms are thrown from factories and tanneries into our clear New\r\nEngland streams. Good river fish are growing very scarce. The smelts,\r\nand bass, and shad have all left this upper branch of the Piscataqua,\r\nas the salmon left it long ago, and the supply of one necessary sort\r\nof good cheap food is lost to a growing community, for the lack of a\r\nlittle thought and care in the factory companies and saw-mills, and\r\nthe building in some cases of fish-ways over the dams. I think that\r\nthe need of preaching against this bad economy is very great. The\r\nsight of a proud lad with a string of undersized trout will scatter\r\nhalf the idlers in town into the pastures next day, but everybody\r\npatiently accepts the depopulation of a fine clear river, where the\r\ntide comes fresh from the sea to be tainted by the spoiled stream,\r\nwhich started from its mountain sources as pure as heart could wish.\r\nMan has done his best to ruin the world he lives in, one is tempted to\r\nsay at impulsive first thought; but after all, as I mounted the last\r\nhill before reaching the village, the houses took on a new look of\r\ncomfort and pleasantness; the fields that I knew so well were a\r\nfresher green than before, the sun was down, and the provocations of\r\nthe day seemed very slight compared to the satisfaction. I believed\r\nthat with a little more time we should grow wiser about our fish and\r\nother things beside.\r\n\r\nIt will be good to remember the white rose road and its quietness in\r\nmany a busy town day to come. As I think of these slight sketches, I\r\nwonder if they will have to others a tinge of sadness; but I have\r\nseldom spent an afternoon so full of pleasure and fresh and delighted\r\nconsciousness of the possibilities of rural life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Town Poor_\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. William Trimble and Miss Rebecca Wright were driving along\r\nHampden east road, one afternoon in early spring. Their progress was\r\nslow. Mrs. Trimble\'s sorrel horse was old and stiff, and the wheels\r\nwere clogged by clay mud. The frost was not yet out of the ground,\r\nalthough the snow was nearly gone, except in a few places on the north\r\nside of the woods, or where it had drifted all winter against a length\r\nof fence.\r\n\r\n"There must be a good deal o\' snow to the nor\'ard of us yet," said\r\nweather-wise Mrs. Trimble. "I feel it in the air; \'tis more than the\r\nground-damp. We ain\'t goin\' to have real nice weather till the\r\nup-country snow\'s all gone."\r\n\r\n"I heard say yesterday that there was good sleddin\' yet, all up\r\nthrough Parsley," responded Miss Wright. "I shouldn\'t like to live in\r\nthem northern places. My cousin Ellen\'s husband was a Parsley man, an\'\r\nhe was obliged, as you may have heard, to go up north to his father\'s\r\nsecond wife\'s funeral; got back day before yesterday. \'T was about\r\ntwenty-one miles, an\' they started on wheels; but when they\'d gone\r\nnine or ten miles, they found \'t was no sort o\' use, an\' left their\r\nwagon an\' took a sleigh. The man that owned it charged \'em four an\'\r\nsix, too. I shouldn\'t have thought he would; they told him they was\r\ngoin\' to a funeral; an\' they had their own buffaloes an\' everything."\r\n\r\n"Well, I expect it\'s a good deal harder scratchin\', up that way; they\r\nhave to git money where they can; the farms is very poor as you go\r\nnorth," suggested Mrs. Trimble kindly. "\'T ain\'t none too rich a\r\ncountry where we be, but I\'ve always been grateful I wa\'n\'t born up to\r\nParsley."\r\n\r\nThe old horse plodded along, and the sun, coming out from the heavy\r\nspring clouds, sent a sudden shine of light along the muddy road.\r\nSister Wright drew her large veil forward over the high brim of her\r\nbonnet. She was not used to driving, or to being much in the open air;\r\nbut Mrs. Trimble was an active business woman, and looked after her\r\nown affairs herself, in all weathers. The late Mr. Trimble had left\r\nher a good farm, but not much ready money, and it was often said that\r\nshe was better off in the end than if he had lived. She regretted his\r\nloss deeply, however; it was impossible for her to speak of him, even\r\nto intimate friends, without emotion, and nobody had ever hinted that\r\nthis emotion was insincere. She was most warm-hearted and generous,\r\nand in her limited way played the part of Lady Bountiful in the town\r\nof Hampden.\r\n\r\n"Why, there\'s where the Bray girls lives, ain\'t it?" she exclaimed,\r\nas, beyond a thicket of witch-hazel and scrub-oak, they came in sight\r\nof a weather-beaten, solitary farmhouse. The barn was too far away for\r\nthrift or comfort, and they could see long lines of light between the\r\nshrunken boards as they came nearer. The fields looked both stony and\r\nsodden. Somehow, even Parsley itself could be hardly more forlorn.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Miss Wright, "that\'s where they live now, poor things. I\r\nknow the place, though I ain\'t been up here for years. You don\'t\r\nsuppose, Mis\' Trimble--I ain\'t seen the girls out to meetin\' all\r\nwinter. I\'ve re\'lly been covetin\'"--\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, Rebecca, of course we could stop," answered Mrs. Trimble\r\nheartily. "The exercises was over earlier \'n I expected, an\' you\'re\r\ngoin\' to remain over night long o\' me, you know. There won\'t be no tea\r\ntill we git there, so we can\'t be late. I\'m in the habit o\' sendin\' a\r\nbasket to the Bray girls when any o\' our folks is comin\' this way, but\r\nI ain\'t been to see \'em since they moved up here. Why, it must be a\r\ngood deal over a year ago. I know \'t was in the late winter they had\r\nto make the move. \'T was cruel hard, I must say, an\' if I hadn\'t been\r\ndown with my pleurisy fever I\'d have stirred round an\' done somethin\'\r\nabout it. There was a good deal o\' sickness at the time, an\'--well, \'t\r\nwas kind o\' rushed through, breakin\' of \'em up, an\' lots o\' folks\r\nblamed the selec\'_men_; but when \'t was done, \'t was done, an\' nobody\r\ntook holt to undo it. Ann an\' Mandy looked same\'s ever when they come\r\nto meetin\', \'long in the summer,--kind o\' wishful, perhaps. They\'ve\r\nalways sent me word they was gittin\' on pretty comfortable."\r\n\r\n"That would be their way," said Rebecca Wright. "They never was any\r\nhand to complain, though Mandy\'s less cheerful than Ann. If Mandy \'d\r\nbeen spared such poor eyesight, an\' Ann hadn\'t got her lame wrist that\r\nwa\'n\'t set right, they\'d kep\' off the town fast enough. They both shed\r\ntears when they talked to me about havin\' to break up, when I went to\r\nsee \'em before I went over to brother Asa\'s. You see we was brought up\r\nneighbors, an\' we went to school together, the Brays an\' me. \'T was a\r\nspecial Providence brought us home this road, I\'ve been so covetin\' a\r\nchance to git to see \'em. My lameness hampers me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad we come this way, myself," said Mrs. Trimble.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see just how they fare," Miss Rebecca Wright continued.\r\n"They give their consent to goin\' on the town because they knew they\'d\r\ngot to be dependent, an\' so they felt \'t would come easier for all\r\nthan for a few to help \'em. They acted real dignified an\'\r\nright-minded, contrary to what most do in such cases, but they was\r\ndreadful anxious to see who would bid \'em off, town-meeting day; they\r\ndid so hope \'t would be somebody right in the village. I just sat down\r\nan\' cried good when I found Abel Janes\'s folks had got hold of \'em.\r\nThey always had the name of bein\' slack an\' poor-spirited, an\' they\r\ndid it just for what they got out o\' the town. The selectmen this\r\nlast year ain\'t what we have had. I hope they\'ve been considerate\r\nabout the Bray girls."\r\n\r\n"I should have be\'n more considerate about fetchin\' of you over,"\r\napologized Mrs. Trimble. "I\'ve got my horse, an\' you\'re lame-footed;\r\n\'tis too far for you to come. But time does slip away with busy folks,\r\nan\' I forgit a good deal I ought to remember."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nobody more considerate than you be," protested Miss Rebecca\r\nWright.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trimble made no answer, but took out her whip and gently touched\r\nthe sorrel horse, who walked considerably faster, but did not think it\r\nworth while to trot. It was a long, round-about way to the house,\r\nfarther down the road and up a lane.\r\n\r\n"I never had any opinion of the Bray girls\' father, leavin\' \'em as he\r\ndid," said Mrs. Trimble.\r\n\r\n"He was much praised in his time, though there was always some said\r\nhis early life hadn\'t been up to the mark," explained her companion.\r\n"He was a great favorite of our then preacher, the Reverend Daniel\r\nLongbrother. They did a good deal for the parish, but they did it\r\ntheir own way. Deacon Bray was one that did his part in the repairs\r\nwithout urging. You know \'t was in his time the first repairs was\r\nmade, when they got out the old soundin\'-board an\' them handsome\r\nsquare pews. It cost an awful sight o\' money, too. They hadn\'t done\r\npayin\' up that debt when they set to alter it again an\' git the walls\r\nfrescoed. My grandmother was one that always spoke her mind right out,\r\nan\' she was dreadful opposed to breakin\' up the square pews where she\'d\r\nalways set. They was countin\' up what \'t would cost in parish meetin\',\r\nan\' she riz right up an\' said \'t wouldn\'t cost nothin\' to let \'em\r\nstay, an\' there wa\'n\'t a house carpenter left in the parish that could\r\ndo such nice work, an\' time would come when the great-grandchildren\r\nwould give their eye-teeth to have the old meetin\'-house look just as\r\nit did then. But haul the inside to pieces they would and did."\r\n\r\n"There come to be a real fight over it, didn\'t there?" agreed Mrs.\r\nTrimble soothingly. "Well, \'t wa\'n\'t good taste. I remember the old\r\nhouse well. I come here as a child to visit a cousin o\' mother\'s, an\'\r\nMr. Trimble\'s folks was neighbors, an\' we was drawed to each other\r\nthen, young\'s we was. Mr. Trimble spoke of it many\'s the time,--that\r\nfirst time he ever see me, in a leghorn hat with a feather; \'t was one\r\nthat mother had, an\' pressed over."\r\n\r\n"When I think of them old sermons that used to be preached in that old\r\nmeetin\'-house of all, I\'m glad it\'s altered over, so\'s not to remind\r\nfolks," said Miss Rebecca Wright, after a suitable pause. "Them old\r\nbrimstone discourses, you know, Mis\' Trimble. Preachers is far more\r\nreasonable, nowadays. Why, I set an\' thought, last Sabbath, as I\r\nlistened, that if old Mr. Longbrother an\' Deacon Bray could hear the\r\ndifference they\'d crack the ground over \'em like pole beans, an\' come\r\nright up \'long side their headstones."\r\n\r\nMrs. Trimble laughed heartily, and shook the reins three or four times\r\nby way of emphasis. "There\'s no gitting round you," she said, much\r\npleased. "I should think Deacon Bray would want to rise, any way, if\r\n\'t was so he could, an\' knew how his poor girls was farin\'. A man\r\nought to provide for his folks he\'s got to leave behind him, specially\r\nif they\'re women. To be sure, they had their little home; but we\'ve\r\nseen how, with all their industrious ways, they hadn\'t means to keep\r\nit. I s\'pose he thought he\'d got time enough to lay by, when he give\r\nso generous in collections; but he didn\'t lay by, an\' there they be.\r\nHe might have took lessons from the squirrels: even them little wild\r\ncreatur\'s makes them their winter hoards, an\' men-folks ought to know\r\nenough if squirrels does. \'Be just before you are generous:\' that\'s\r\nwhat was always set for the B\'s in the copy-books, when I was to\r\nschool, and it often runs through my mind."\r\n\r\n"\'As for man, his days are as grass,\'--that was for A; the two go well\r\ntogether," added Miss Rebecca Wright soberly. "My good gracious, ain\'t\r\nthis a starved-lookin\' place? It makes me ache to think them nice Bray\r\ngirls has to brook it here."\r\n\r\nThe sorrel horse, though somewhat puzzled by an unexpected deviation\r\nfrom his homeward way, willingly came to a stand by the gnawed corner\r\nof the door-yard fence, which evidently served as hitching-place. Two\r\nor three ragged old hens were picking about the yard, and at last a\r\nface appeared at the kitchen window, tied up in a handkerchief, as if\r\nit were a case of toothache. By the time our friends reached the side\r\ndoor next this window, Mrs. Janes came disconsolately to open it for\r\nthem, shutting it again as soon as possible, though the air felt more\r\nchilly inside the house.\r\n\r\n"Take seats," said Mrs. Janes briefly. "You\'ll have to see me just as\r\nI be. I have been suffering these four days with the ague, and\r\neverything to do. Mr. Janes is to court, on the jury. \'T was\r\ninconvenient to spare him. I should be pleased to have you lay off\r\nyour things."\r\n\r\nComfortable Mrs. Trimble looked about the cheerless kitchen, and could\r\nnot think of anything to say; so she smiled blandly and shook her head\r\nin answer to the invitation. "We\'ll just set a few minutes with you,\r\nto pass the time o\' day, an\' then we must go in an\' have a word with\r\nthe Miss Brays, bein\' old acquaintance. It ain\'t been so we could git\r\nto call on \'em before. I don\'t know\'s you\'re acquainted with Miss\r\nR\'becca Wright. She\'s been out of town a good deal."\r\n\r\n"I heard she was stopping over to Plainfields with her brother\'s\r\nfolks," replied Mrs. Janes, rocking herself with irregular motion, as\r\nshe sat close to the stove. "Got back some time in the fall, I\r\nbelieve?"\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Miss Rebecca, with an undue sense of guilt and\r\nconviction. "We\'ve been to the installation over to the East Parish,\r\nan\' thought we\'d stop in; we took this road home to see if \'t was any\r\nbetter. How is the Miss Brays gettin\' on?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re well\'s common," answered Mrs. Janes grudgingly. "I was put\r\nout with Mr. Janes for fetchin\' of \'em here, with all I\'ve got to do,\r\nan\' I own I was kind o\' surly to \'em \'long to the first of it. He gits\r\nthe money from the town, an\' it helps him out; but he bid \'em off for\r\nfive dollars a month, an\' we can\'t do much for \'em at no such price as\r\nthat. I went an\' dealt with the selec\'men, an\' made \'em promise to\r\nfind their firewood an\' some other things extra. They was glad to get\r\nrid o\' the matter the fourth time I went, an\' would ha\' promised \'most\r\nanything. But Mr. Janes don\'t keep me half the time in oven-wood, he\'s\r\noff so much, an\' we was cramped o\' room, any way. I have to store\r\nthings up garrit a good deal, an\' that keeps me trampin\' right through\r\ntheir room. I do the best for \'em I can, Mis\' Trimble, but \'t ain\'t so\r\neasy for me as \'t is for you, with all your means to do with."\r\n\r\nThe poor woman looked pinched and miserable herself, though it was\r\nevident that she had no gift at house or home keeping. Mrs. Trimble\'s\r\nheart was wrung with pain, as she thought of the unwelcome inmates of\r\nsuch a place; but she held her peace bravely, while Miss Rebecca again\r\ngave some brief information in regard to the installation.\r\n\r\n"You go right up them back stairs," the hostess directed at last. "I\'m\r\nglad some o\' you church folks has seen fit to come an\' visit \'em.\r\nThere ain\'t been nobody here this long spell, an\' they\'ve aged a sight\r\nsince they come. They always send down a taste out of your baskets,\r\nMis\' Trimble, an\' I relish it, I tell you. I\'ll shut the door after\r\nyou, if you don\'t object. I feel every draught o\' cold air."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always heard she was a great hand to make a poor mouth. Wa\'n\'t\r\nshe from somewheres up Parsley way?" whispered Miss Rebecca, as they\r\nstumbled in the half-light.\r\n\r\n"Poor meechin\' body, wherever she come from," replied Mrs. Trimble, as\r\nshe knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment after this unusual sound; then one of\r\nthe Bray sisters opened the door. The eager guests stared into a\r\nsmall, low room, brown with age, and gray, too, as if former dust and\r\ncobwebs could not be made wholly to disappear. The two elderly women\r\nwho stood there looked like captives. Their withered faces wore a look\r\nof apprehension, and the room itself was more bare and plain than was\r\nfitting to their evident refinement of character and self-respect.\r\nThere was an uncovered small table in the middle of the floor, with\r\nsome crackers on a plate; and, for some reason or other, this added a\r\ngreat deal to the general desolation.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Ann Bray, the elder sister, who carried her right arm in a\r\nsling, with piteously drooping fingers, gazed at the visitors with\r\nradiant joy. She had not seen them arrive.\r\n\r\nThe one window gave only the view at the back of the house, across the\r\nfields, and their coming was indeed a surprise. The next minute she\r\nwas laughing and crying together. "Oh, sister!" she said, "if here\r\nain\'t our dear Mis\' Trimble!--an\' my heart o\' goodness, \'tis \'Becca\r\nWright, too! What dear good creatur\'s you be! I\'ve felt all day as if\r\nsomething good was goin\' to happen, an\' was just sayin\' to myself\r\n\'twas most sundown now, but I wouldn\'t let on to Mandany I\'d give up\r\nhope quite yet. You see, the scissors stuck in the floor this very\r\nmornin\' an\' it\'s always a reliable sign. There, I\'ve got to kiss ye\r\nboth again!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where we can all set," lamented sister Mandana. "There\r\nain\'t but the one chair an\' the bed; t\'other chair\'s too rickety; an\'\r\nwe\'ve been promised another these ten days; but first they\'ve forgot\r\nit, an\' next Mis\' Janes can\'t spare it,--one excuse an\' another. I am\r\ngoin\' to git a stump o\' wood an\' nail a board on to it, when I can git\r\noutdoor again," said Mandana, in a plaintive voice. "There, I ain\'t\r\ngoin\' to complain o\' nothin\', now you\'ve come," she added; and the\r\nguests sat down, Mrs. Trimble, as was proper, in the one chair.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve sat on the bed many\'s the time with you, \'Becca, an\' talked\r\nover our girl nonsense, ain\'t we? You know where \'twas--in the little\r\nback bedroom we had when we was girls, an\' used to peek out at our\r\nbeaux through the strings o\' mornin\'-glories," laughed Ann Bray\r\ndelightedly, her thin face shining more and more with joy. "I brought\r\nsome o\' them mornin\'-glory seeds along when we come away, we\'d raised\r\n\'em so many years; an\' we got \'em started all right, but the hens\r\nfound \'em out. I declare I chased them poor hens, foolish as \'twas;\r\nbut the mornin\'-glories I\'d counted on a sight to remind me o\' home.\r\nYou see, our debts was so large, after my long sickness an\' all, that\r\nwe didn\'t feel \'twas right to keep back anything we could help from\r\nthe auction."\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for any one to speak for a moment or two; the\r\nsisters felt their own uprooted condition afresh, and their guests for\r\nthe first time really comprehended the piteous contrast between that\r\nneat little village house, which now seemed a palace of comfort, and\r\nthis cold, unpainted upper room in the remote Janes farmhouse. It was\r\nan unwelcome thought to Mrs. Trimble that the well-to-do town of\r\nHampden could provide no better for its poor than this, and her round\r\nface flushed with resentment and the shame of personal responsibility.\r\n"The girls shall be well settled in the village before another winter,\r\nif I pay their board myself," she made an inward resolution, and took\r\nanother almost tearful look at the broken stove, the miserable bed,\r\nand the sisters\' one hair-covered trunk, on which Mandana was sitting\r\nBut the poor place was filled with a golden spirit of hospitality.\r\n\r\nRebecca was again discoursing eloquently of the installation; it was\r\nso much easier to speak of general subjects, and the sisters had\r\nevidently been longing to hear some news. Since the late summer they\r\nhad not been to church, and presently Mrs. Trimble asked the reason.\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t you go to pouring out our woes, Mandy!" begged little old\r\nAnn, looking shy and almost girlish, and as if she insisted upon\r\nplaying that life was still all before them and all pleasure. "Don\'t\r\nyou go to spoilin\' their visit with our complaints! They know well\'s\r\nwe do that changes must come, an\' we\'d been so wonted to our home\r\nthings that this come hard at first; but then they felt for us, I know\r\njust as well\'s can be. \'Twill soon be summer again, an\' \'tis real\r\npleasant right out in the fields here, when there ain\'t too hot a\r\nspell. I\'ve got to know a sight o\' singin\' birds since we come."\r\n\r\n"Give me the folks I\'ve always known," sighed the younger sister, who\r\nlooked older than Miss Ann, and less even-tempered. "You may have your\r\nbirds, if you want \'em. I do re\'lly long to go to meetin\' an\' see\r\nfolks go by up the aisle. Now, I will speak of it, Ann, whatever you\r\nsay. We need, each of us, a pair o\' good stout shoes an\'\r\nrubbers,--ours are all wore out; an\' we\'ve asked an\' asked, an\' they\r\nnever think to bring \'em, an\'"--\r\n\r\nPoor old Mandana, on the trunk, covered her face with her arms and\r\nsobbed aloud. The elder sister stood over her, and patted her on the\r\nthin shoulder like a child, and tried to comfort her. It crossed Mrs.\r\nTrimble\'s mind that it was not the first time one had wept and the\r\nother had comforted. The sad scene must have been repeated many times\r\nin that long, drear winter. She would see them forever after in her\r\nmind as fixed as a picture, and her own tears fell fast.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t see Mis\' Janes\'s cunning little boy, the next one to the\r\nbaby, did you?" asked Ann Bray, turning round quickly at last, and\r\ngoing cheerfully on with the conversation. "Now, hush, Mandy, dear;\r\nthey\'ll think you\'re childish! He\'s a dear, friendly little creatur\',\r\nan\' likes to stay with us a good deal, though we feel\'s if it \'t was\r\ntoo cold for him, now we are waitin\' to get us more wood."\r\n\r\n"When I think of the acres o\' woodland in this town!" groaned Rebecca\r\nWright. "I believe I\'m goin\' to preach next Sunday, \'stead o\' the\r\nminister, an\' I\'ll make the sparks fly. I\'ve always heard the saying,\r\n\'What\'s everybody\'s business is nobody\'s business,\' an\' I\'ve come to\r\nbelieve it."\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t you, \'Becca. You\'ve happened on a kind of a poor time with\r\nus, but we\'ve got more belongings than you see here, an\' a good large\r\ncluset, where we can store those things there ain\'t room to have\r\nabout. You an\' Miss Trimble have happened on a kind of poor day, you\r\nknow. Soon\'s I git me some stout shoes an\' rubbers, as Mandy says, I\r\ncan fetch home plenty o\' little dry boughs o\' pine; you remember I was\r\nalways a great hand to roam in the woods? If we could only have a\r\nfront room, so \'t we could look out on the road an\' see passin\', an\'\r\nwas shod for meetin\', I don\' know\'s we should complain. Now we\'re just\r\ngoin\' to give you what we\'ve got, an\' make out with a good welcome. We\r\nmake more tea \'n we want in the mornin\', an\' then let the fire go\r\ndown, since \'t has been so mild. We\'ve got a _good_ cluset"\r\n(disappearing as she spoke), "an\' I know this to be good tea, \'cause\r\nit\'s some o\' yourn, Mis\' Trimble. An\' here\'s our sprigged chiny cups\r\nthat R\'becca knows by sight, if Mis\' Trimble don\'t. We kep\' out four\r\nof \'em, an\' put the even half dozen with the rest of the auction\r\nstuff. I\'ve often wondered who\'d got \'em, but I never asked, for fear\r\n\'t would be somebody that would distress us. They was mother\'s, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nThe four cups were poured, and the little table pushed to the bed,\r\nwhere Rebecca Wright still sat, and Mandana, wiping her eyes, came and\r\njoined her. Mrs. Trimble sat in her chair at the end, and Ann trotted\r\nabout the room in pleased content for a while, and in and out of the\r\ncloset, as if she still had much to do; then she came and stood\r\nopposite Mrs. Trimble. She was very short and small, and there was no\r\npainful sense of her being obliged to stand. The four cups were not\r\nquite full of cold tea, but there was a clean old tablecloth folded\r\ndouble, and a plate with three pairs of crackers neatly piled, and a\r\nsmall--it must be owned, a very small--piece of hard white cheese.\r\nThen, for a treat, in a glass dish, there was a little preserved\r\npeach, the last--Miss Rebecca knew it instinctively--of the household\r\nstores brought from their old home. It was very sugary, this bit of\r\npeach; and as she helped her guests and sister Mandy, Miss Ann Bray\r\nsaid, half unconsciously, as she often had said with less reason in\r\nthe old days, "Our preserves ain\'t so good as usual this year; this is\r\nbeginning to candy." Both the guests protested, while Rebecca added\r\nthat the taste of it carried her back, and made her feel young again.\r\nThe Brays had always managed to keep one or two peach-trees alive in\r\ntheir corner of a garden. "I\'ve been keeping this preserve for a\r\ntreat," said her friend. "I\'m glad to have you eat some, \'Becca. Last\r\nsummer I often wished you was home an\' could come an\' see us, \'stead\r\no\' being away off to Plainfields."\r\n\r\nThe crackers did not taste too dry. Miss Ann took the last of the\r\npeach on her own cracker; there could not have been quite a small\r\nspoonful, after the others were helped, but she asked them first if\r\nthey would not have some more. Then there was a silence, and in the\r\nsilence a wave of tender feeling rose high in the hearts of the four\r\nelderly women. At this moment the setting sun flooded the poor plain\r\nroom with light; the unpainted wood was all of a golden-brown, and Ann\r\nBray, with her gray hair and aged face, stood at the head of the table\r\nin a kind of aureole. Mrs. Trimble\'s face was all aquiver as she\r\nlooked at her; she thought of the text about two or three being\r\ngathered together, and was half afraid.\r\n\r\n"I believe we ought to\'ve asked Mis\' Janes if she wouldn\'t come up,"\r\nsaid Ann. "She\'s real good feelin\', but she\'s had it very hard, an\'\r\ngits discouraged. I can\'t find that she\'s ever had anything real\r\npleasant to look back to, as we have. There, next time we\'ll make a\r\ngood heartenin\' time for her too."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sorrel horse had taken a long nap by the gnawed fence-rail, and\r\nthe cool air after sundown made him impatient to be gone. The two\r\nfriends jolted homeward in the gathering darkness, through the\r\nstiffening mud, and neither Mrs. Trimble nor Rebecca Wright said a\r\nword until they were out of sight as well as out of sound of the Janes\r\nhouse. Time must elapse before they could reach a more familiar part\r\nof the road and resume conversation on its natural level.\r\n\r\n"I consider myself to blame," insisted Mrs. Trimble at last. "I\r\nhaven\'t no words of accusation for nobody else, an\' I ain\'t one to\r\ntake comfort in calling names to the board o\' selec\'_men_. I make no\r\nreproaches, an\' I take it all on my own shoulders; but I\'m goin\' to\r\nstir about me, I tell you! I shall begin early to-morrow. They\'re\r\ngoin\' back to their own house,--it\'s been standin\' empty all\r\nwinter,--an\' the town\'s goin\' to give \'em the rent an\' what firewood\r\nthey need; it won\'t come to more than the board\'s payin\' out now. An\'\r\nyou an\' me\'ll take this same horse an\' wagon, an\' ride an\' go afoot by\r\nturns, an\' git means enough together to buy back their furniture an\'\r\nwhatever was sold at that plaguey auction; an\' then we\'ll put it all\r\nback, an\' tell \'em they\'ve got to move to a new place, an\' just carry\r\n\'em right back again where they come from. An\' don\'t you never tell,\r\nR\'becca, but here I be a widow woman, layin\' up what I make from my\r\nfarm for nobody knows who, an\' I\'m goin\' to do for them Bray girls\r\nall I\'m a mind to. I should be sca\'t to wake up in heaven, an\' hear\r\nanybody there ask how the Bray girls was. Don\'t talk to me about the\r\ntown o\' Hampden, an\' don\'t ever let me hear the name o\' town poor! I\'m\r\nashamed to go home an\' see what\'s set out for supper. I wish I\'d\r\nbrought \'em right along."\r\n\r\n"I was goin\' to ask if we couldn\'t git the new doctor to go up an\' do\r\nsomethin\' for poor Ann\'s arm," said Miss Rebecca. "They say he\'s very\r\nsmart. If she could get so\'s to braid straw or hook rugs again, she\'d\r\nsoon be earnin\' a little somethin\'. An\' may be he could do somethin\'\r\nfor Mandy\'s eyes. They did use to live so neat an\' ladylike. Somehow I\r\ncouldn\'t speak to tell \'em there that \'twas I bought them six best\r\ncups an\' saucers, time of the auction; they went very low, as\r\neverything else did, an\' I thought I could save it some other way.\r\nThey shall have \'em back an\' welcome. You\'re real whole-hearted, Mis\'\r\nTrimble. I expect Ann\'ll be sayin\' that her father\'s child\'n wa\'n\'t\r\ngoin\' to be left desolate, an\' that all the bread he cast on the\r\nwater\'s comin\' back through you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care what she says, dear creatur\'!" exclaimed Mrs. Trimble.\r\n"I\'m full o\' regrets I took time for that installation, an\' set there\r\nseepin\' in a lot o\' talk this whole day long, except for its kind of\r\nbringin\' us to the Bray girls. I wish to my heart \'t was to-morrow\r\nmornin\' a\'ready, an\' I a-startin\' for the selec\'_men_."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Native of Winby\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOn the teacher\'s desk, in the little roadside school-house, there was\r\na bunch of Mayflowers, beside a dented and bent brass bell, a small\r\nWorcester\'s Dictionary without any cover, and a worn morocco-covered\r\nBible. These were placed in an orderly row, and behind them was a\r\nsmall wooden box which held some broken pieces of blackboard crayon.\r\nThe teacher, whom no timid new scholar could look at boldly, wore her\r\naccustomed air of authority and importance. She might have been\r\nnineteen years old,--not more,--but for the time being she scorned the\r\nfrivolities of youth.\r\n\r\nThe hot May sun was shining in at the smoky small-paned windows;\r\nsometimes an outside shutter swung to with a creak, and eclipsed the\r\nglare. The narrow door stood wide open, to the left as you faced the\r\ndesk, and an old spotted dog lay asleep on the step, and looked wise\r\nand old enough to have gone to school with several generations of\r\nchildren. It was half past three o\'clock in the afternoon, and the\r\nprimer class, settled into the apathy of after-recess fatigue,\r\npresented a straggling front, as they stood listlessly on the floor.\r\nAs for the big boys and girls, they also were longing to be at\r\nliberty, but the pretty teacher, Miss Marilla Hender, seemed quite as\r\nenergetic as when school was begun in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe spring breeze blew in at the open door, and even fluttered the\r\nprimer leaves, but the back of the room felt hot and close, as if it\r\nwere midsummer. The children in the class read their lessons in those\r\nhigh-keyed, droning voices which older teachers learn to associate\r\nwith faint powers of perception. Only one or two of them had an\r\nawakened human look in their eyes, such as Matthew Arnold delighted\r\nhimself in finding so often in the school-children of France. Most of\r\nthese poor little students were as inadequate, at that weary moment,\r\nto the pursuit of letters as if they had been woolly spring lambs on a\r\nsunny hillside. The teacher corrected and admonished with great\r\npatience, glancing now and then toward points of danger and\r\ninsurrection, whence came a suspicious buzz of whispering from behind\r\na desk-lid or a pair of widespread large geographies. Now and then a\r\ntoiling child would rise and come down the aisle, with his forefinger\r\nfirm upon a puzzling word as if it were an unclassified insect. It was\r\na lovely beckoning day out-of-doors. The children felt like captives;\r\nthere was something that provoked rebellion in the droning voices, the\r\nbuzzing of an early wild bee against the sunlit pane, and even in the\r\nstuffy familiar odor of the place,--the odor of apples and crumbs of\r\ndoughnuts and gingerbread in the dinner pails on the high entry nails,\r\nand of all the little gowns and trousers that had brushed through\r\njunipers and young pines on their way to school.\r\n\r\nThe bee left his prisoning pane at last, and came over to the\r\nMayflowers, which were in full bloom, although the season was very\r\nlate, and deep in the woods there were still some graybacked\r\nsnowdrifts, speckled with bits of bark and moss from the trees above.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Ezra!" urged the young teacher, rapping her desk sharply.\r\n"Stop watchin\' that common bee! You know well enough what those\r\nletters spell. You won\'t learn to read at this rate until you are a\r\ngrown man. Mind your book, now; you ought to remember who went to this\r\nschool when he was a little boy. You\'ve heard folks tell about the\r\nHonorable Joseph K. Laneway? He used to be in primer just as you are\r\nnow, and \'t wasn\'t long before he was out of it, either, and was\r\ncalled the smartest boy in school. He\'s got to be a general and a\r\nSenator, and one of the richest men out West. You don\'t seem to have\r\nthe least mite of ambition to-day, any of you!"\r\n\r\nThe exhortation, entirely personal in the beginning, had swiftly\r\npassed to a general rebuke. Ezra looked relieved, and the other\r\nchildren brightened up as they recognized a tale familiar to their\r\nears. Anything was better than trying to study in that dull last hour\r\nof afternoon school.\r\n\r\n"Yes," continued Miss Hender, pleased that she had at last roused\r\nsomething like proper attention, "you all ought to be proud that you\r\nare schoolmates of District Number Four, and can remember that the\r\ncelebrated General Laneway had the same early advantages as you, and\r\nthink what he has made of himself by perseverance and ambition."\r\n\r\nThe pupils were familiar enough with the illustrious history of their\r\nnoble predecessor. They were sure to be told, in lawless moments, that\r\nif Mr. Laneway were to come in and see them he would be mortified to\r\ndeath; and the members of the school committee always referred to him,\r\nand said that he had been a poor boy, and was now a self-made\r\nman,--as if every man were not self-made as to his character and\r\nreputation!\r\n\r\nAt this point, young Johnny Spencer showed his next neighbor, in the\r\nback of his Colburn\'s Arithmetic, an imaginary portrait of their\r\ndistrict hero, which caused them both to chuckle derisively. The\r\nHonorable Mr. Laneway figured on the flyleaf as an extremely\r\ncross-eyed person, with strangely crooked legs and arms and a terrific\r\nexpression. He was outlined with red and blue pencils as to coat and\r\ntrousers, and held a reddened scalp in one hand and a blue tomahawk in\r\nthe other; being closely associated in the artist\'s mind with the\r\nearly settlements of the far West.\r\n\r\nThere was a noise of wheels in the road near by, and, though Miss\r\nHender had much more to say, everybody ceased to listen to her, and\r\nturned toward the windows, leaning far forward over their desks to see\r\nwho might be passing. They caught a glimpse of a shiny carriage; the\r\nold dog bounded out, barking, but nothing passed the open door. The\r\ncarriage had stopped; some one was coming to the school; somebody was\r\ngoing to be called out! It could not be the committee, whose pompous\r\nand uninspiring spring visit had taken place only the week before.\r\n\r\nPresently a well-dressed elderly man, with an expectant, masterful\r\nlook, stood on the doorstep, glanced in with a smile, and knocked.\r\nMiss Marilla Hender blushed, smoothed her pretty hair anxiously with\r\nboth hands, and stepped down from her little platform to answer the\r\nsummons. There was hardly a shut mouth in the primer class.\r\n\r\n"Would it be convenient for you to receive a visitor to the school?"\r\nthe stranger asked politely, with a fine bow of deference to Miss\r\nHender. He looked much pleased and a little excited, and the teacher\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"Certainly; step right in, won\'t you, sir?" in quite another tone from\r\nthat in which she had just addressed the school.\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls were sitting straight and silent in their places,\r\nin something like a fit of apprehension and unpreparedness at such a\r\ngreat emergency. The guest represented a type of person previously\r\nunknown in District Number Four. Everything about him spoke of wealth\r\nand authority. The old dog returned to the doorstep, and after a\r\ncareful look at the invader approached him, with a funny doggish grin\r\nand a desperate wag of the tail, to beg for recognition.\r\n\r\nThe teacher gave her chair on the platform to the guest, and stood\r\nbeside him with very red cheeks, smoothing her hair again once or\r\ntwice, and keeping the hard-wood ruler fast in hand, like a badge of\r\noffice. "Primer class may now retire!" she said firmly, although the\r\nlesson was not more than half through; and the class promptly escaped\r\nto their seats, waddling and stumbling, until they all came up behind\r\ntheir desks, face foremost, and added themselves to the number of\r\nstaring young countenances. After this there was a silence, which grew\r\nmore and more embarrassing.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you would be pleased to hear our first class in geography,\r\nsir?" asked the fair Marilla, recovering her presence of mind; and the\r\nguest kindly assented.\r\n\r\nThe young teacher was by no means willing to give up a certainty for\r\nan uncertainty. Yesterday\'s lesson had been well learned; she turned\r\nback to the questions about the State of Kansota, and at the first\r\nsentence the mysterious visitor\'s dignity melted into an unconscious\r\nsmile. He listened intently for a minute, and then seemed to reoccupy\r\nhimself with his own thoughts and purposes, looking eagerly about the\r\nold school-house, and sometimes gazing steadily at the children. The\r\nlesson went on finely, and when it was finished Miss Hender asked the\r\ngirl at the head of the class to name the States and Territories,\r\nwhich she instantly did, mispronouncing nearly all the names of the\r\nlatter; then others stated boundaries and capitals, and the resources\r\nof the New England States, passing on finally to the names of the\r\nPresidents. Miss Hender glowed with pride; she had worked hard over\r\nthe geography class in the winter term, and it did not fail her on\r\nthis great occasion. When she turned bravely to see if the gentleman\r\nwould like to ask any questions, she found that he was apparently\r\nlost in a deep reverie, so she repeated her own question more\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\n"They have done very well,--very well indeed," he answered kindly; and\r\nthen, to every one\'s surprise, he rose, went up the aisle, pushed\r\nJohnny Spencer gently along his bench, and sat down beside him. The\r\nspace was cramped, and the stranger looked huge and uncomfortable, so\r\nthat everybody laughed, except one of the big girls, who turned pale\r\nwith fright, and thought he must be crazy. When this girl gave a faint\r\nsqueak Miss Hender recovered herself, and rapped twice with the ruler\r\nto restore order; then became entirely tranquil. There had been talk\r\nof replacing the hacked and worn old school-desks with patent desks\r\nand chairs; this was probably an agent connected with that business.\r\nAt once she was resolute and self-reliant, and said, "No whispering!"\r\nin a firm tone that showed she did not mean to be trifled with. The\r\ngeography class was dismissed, but the elderly gentleman, in his\r\nhandsome overcoat, still sat there wedged in at Johnny Spencer\'s side.\r\n\r\n"I presume, sir, that you are canvassing for new desks," said Miss\r\nHender, with dignity. "You will have to see the supervisor and the\r\nselectmen." There did not seem to be any need of his lingering, but\r\nshe had an ardent desire to be pleasing to a person of such evident\r\ndistinction. "We always tell strangers--I thought, sir, you might be\r\ngratified to know--that this is the school-house where the Honorable\r\nJoseph K. Laneway first attended school. All do not know that he was\r\nborn in this town, and went West very young; it is only about a mile\r\nfrom here where his folks used to live."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the visitor\'s eyes fell. He did not look at pretty\r\nMarilla any more, but opened Johnny Spencer\'s arithmetic, and, seeing\r\nthe imaginary portrait of the great General Laneway, laughed a\r\nlittle,--a very deep-down comfortable laugh it was,--while Johnny\r\nhimself turned cold with alarm, he could not have told why.\r\n\r\nIt was very still in the school-room; the bee was buzzing and bumping\r\nat the pane again; the moment was one of intense expectation.\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at the children right and left. "The fact is\r\nthis, young people," said he, in a tone that was half pride and half\r\napology, "I am Joseph K. Laneway myself."\r\n\r\nHe tried to extricate himself from the narrow quarters of the desk,\r\nbut for an embarrassing moment found that he was stuck fast. Johnny\r\nSpencer instinctively gave him an assisting push, and once free the\r\ngreat soldier, statesman, and millionaire took a few steps forward to\r\nthe open floor; then, after hesitating a moment, he mounted the little\r\nplatform and stood in the teacher\'s place. Marilla Hender was as pale\r\nas ashes.\r\n\r\n"I have thought many times," the great guest began, "that some day I\r\nshould come back to visit this place, which is so closely interwoven\r\nwith the memories of my childhood. In my counting-room, on the fields\r\nof war, in the halls of Congress, and most of all in my Western home,\r\nmy thoughts have flown back to the hills and brooks of Winby and to\r\nthis little old school-house. I could shut my eyes and call back the\r\nbuzz of voices, and fear my teacher\'s frown, and feel my boyish\r\nambitions waking and stirring in my breast. On that bench where I just\r\nsat I saw some notches that I cut with my first jackknife fifty-eight\r\nyears ago this very spring. I remember the faces of the boys and girls\r\nwho went to school with me, and I see their grandchildren before me. I\r\nknow that one is a Goodsoe and another a Winn by the old family look.\r\nOne generation goes, and another comes.\r\n\r\n"There are many things that I might say to you. I meant, even in those\r\nearly restricted days, to make my name known, and I dare say that you\r\ntoo have ambition. Be careful what you wish for in this world, for if\r\nyou wish hard enough you are sure to get it. I once heard a very wise\r\nman say this, and the longer I live the more firmly I believe it to be\r\ntrue. But wishing hard means working hard for what you want, and the\r\nworld\'s prizes wait for the men and women who are ready to take pains\r\nto win them. Be careful and set your minds on the best things. I meant\r\nto be a rich man when I was a boy here, and I stand before you a rich\r\nman, knowing the care and anxiety and responsibility of wealth. I\r\nmeant to go to Congress, and I am one of the Senators from Kansota. I\r\nsay this as humbly as I say it proudly. I used to read of the valor\r\nand patriotism of the old Greeks and Romans with my youthful blood\r\nleaping along my veins, and it came to pass that my own country was in\r\ndanger, and that I could help to fight her battles. Perhaps some one\r\nof these little lads has before him a more eventful life than I have\r\nlived, and is looking forward to activity and honor and the pride of\r\nfame. I wish him all the joy that I have had, all the toil that I have\r\nhad, and all the bitter disappointments even; for adversity leads a\r\nman to depend upon that which is above him, and the path of glory is a\r\nlonely path, beset by temptations and a bitter sense of the weakness\r\nand imperfection of man. I see my life spread out like a great\r\npicture, as I stand here in my boyhood\'s place. I regret my failures.\r\nI thank God for what in his kind providence has been honest and right.\r\nI am glad to come back, but I feel, as I look in your young faces,\r\nthat I am an old man, while your lives are just beginning. When you\r\nremember, in years to come, that I came here to see the old\r\nschool-house, remember that I said: Wish for the best things, and work\r\nhard to win them; try to be good men and women, for the honor of the\r\nschool and the town, and the noble young country that gave you birth;\r\nbe kind at home and generous abroad. Remember that I, an old man who\r\nhad seen much of life, begged you to be brave and good."\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Mr. Laneway had rarely felt himself so moved in any of\r\nhis public speeches, but he was obliged to notice that for once he\r\ncould not hold his audience. The primer class especially had begun to\r\nflag in attention, but one or two faces among the elder scholars\r\nfairly shone with vital sympathy and a lovely prescience of their\r\nfuture. Their eyes met his as if they struck a flash of light. There\r\nwas a sturdy boy who half rose in his place unconsciously, the color\r\ncoming and going in his cheeks; something in Mr. Laneway\'s words lit\r\nthe altar flame in his reverent heart.\r\n\r\nMarilla Hender was pleased and a little dazed; she could not have\r\nrepeated what her illustrious visitor had said, but she longed to tell\r\neverybody the news that he was in town, and had come to school to make\r\nan address. She had never seen a great man before, and really needed\r\ntime to reflect upon him and to consider what she ought to say. She\r\nwas just quivering with the attempt to make a proper reply and thank\r\nMr. Laneway for the honor of his visit to the school, when he asked\r\nher which of the boys could be trusted to drive back his hired horse\r\nto the Four Corners. Eight boys, large and small, nearly every boy in\r\nthe school, rose at once and snapped insistent fingers; but Johnny\r\nSpencer alone was desirous not to attract attention to himself. The\r\nColburn\'s Intellectual Arithmetic with the portrait had been well\r\nsecreted between his tight jacket and his shirt. Miss Hender selected\r\na trustworthy freckled person in long trousers, who was half way to\r\nthe door in an instant, and was heard almost immediately to shout\r\nloudly at the quiet horse.\r\n\r\nThen the Hero of District Number Four made his acknowledgments to the\r\nteacher. "I fear that I have interrupted you too long," he said, with\r\npleasing deference.\r\n\r\nMarilla replied that it was of no consequence; she hoped he would call\r\nagain. She may have spoken primly, but her pretty eyes said everything\r\nthat her lips forgot. "My grandmother will want to see you, sir," she\r\nventured to say. "I guess you will remember her,--Mis\' Hender, she\r\nthat was Abby Harran. She has often told me how you used to get your\r\nlessons out o\' the same book."\r\n\r\n"Abby Harran\'s granddaughter?" Mr. Laneway looked at her again with\r\nfresh interest. "Yes, I wish to see her more than any one else. Tell\r\nher that I am coming to see her before I go away, and give her my\r\nlove. Thank you, my dear," as Marilla offered his missing hat.\r\n"Good-by, boys and girls." He stopped and looked at them once more\r\nfrom the boys\' entry, and turned again to look back from the very\r\ndoorstep.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, sir,--good-by," piped two or three of the young voices; but\r\nmost of the children only stared, and neither spoke nor moved.\r\n\r\n"We will omit the class in Fourth Reader this afternoon. The class in\r\ngrammar may recite," said Miss Hender in her most contained and\r\nofficial manner.\r\n\r\nThe grammar class sighed like a single pupil, and obeyed. She was very\r\nstern with the grammar class, but every one in school had an inner\r\nsense that it was a great day in the history of District Number Four.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Mr. Laneway found the outdoor air very fresh and sweet\r\nafter the closeness of the school-house. It had just that same odor in\r\nhis boyhood, and as he escaped he had a delightful sense of playing\r\ntruant or of having an unexpected holiday. It was easier to think of\r\nhimself as a boy, and to slip back into boyish thoughts, than to bear\r\nthe familiar burden of his manhood. He climbed the tumble-down stone\r\nwall across the road, and went along a narrow path to the spring that\r\nbubbled up clear and cold under a great red oak. How many times he had\r\nlonged for a drink of that water, and now here it was, and the thirst\r\nof that warm spring day was hard to quench! Again and again he stopped\r\nto fill the birchbark dipper which the school-children had made, just\r\nas his own comrades made theirs years before. The oak-tree was dying\r\nat the top. The pine woods beyond had been cut and had grown again\r\nsince his boyhood, and looked much as he remembered them. Beyond the\r\nspring and away from the woods the path led across overgrown pastures\r\nto another road, perhaps three quarters of a mile away, and near this\r\nroad was the small farm which had been his former home. As he walked\r\nslowly along, he was met again and again by some reminder of his\r\nyouthful days. He had always liked to refer to his early life in New\r\nEngland in his political addresses, and had spoken more than once of\r\ngoing to find the cows at nightfall in the autumn evenings, and being\r\nglad to warm his bare feet in the places where the sleepy beasts had\r\nlain, before he followed their slow steps homeward through bush and\r\nbrier. The Honorable Mr. Laneway had a touch of true sentiment which\r\nadded much to his really stirring and effective campaign speeches. He\r\nhad often been called the "king of the platform" in his adopted State.\r\nHe had long ago grown used to saying "Go" to one man, and "Come" to\r\nanother, like the ruler of old; but all his natural power of\r\nleadership and habit of authority disappeared at once as he trod the\r\npasture slopes, calling back the remembrance of his childhood. Here\r\nwas the place where two lads, older than himself, had killed a\r\nterrible woodchuck at bay in the angle of a great rock; and just\r\nbeyond was the sunny spot where he had picked a bunch of pink and\r\nwhite anemones under a prickly barberry thicket, to give to Abby\r\nHarran in morning school. She had put them into her desk, and let them\r\nwilt there, but she was pleased when she took them. Abby Harran, the\r\nlittle teacher\'s grandmother, was a year older than he, and had\r\nwakened the earliest thought of love in his youthful breast.\r\n\r\nIt was almost time to catch the first sight of his birthplace. From\r\nthe knoll just ahead he had often seen the light of his mother\'s lamp,\r\nas he came home from school on winter afternoons; but when he reached\r\nthe knoll the old house was gone, and so was the great walnut-tree\r\nthat grew beside it, and a pang of disappointment shot through this\r\ndevout pilgrim\'s heart. He never had doubted that the old farm was\r\nsomebody\'s home still, and had counted upon the pleasure of spending a\r\nnight there, and sleeping again in that room under the roof, where the\r\nrain sounded loud, and the walnut branches brushed to and fro when the\r\nwind blew, as if they were the claws of tigers. He hurried across the\r\nworn-out fields, long ago turned into sheep pastures, where the last\r\nyear\'s tall grass and golden-rod stood gray and winter-killed; tracing\r\nthe old walls and fences, and astonished to see how small the fields\r\nhad been. The prosperous owner of Western farming lands could not help\r\nremembering those widespread luxuriant acres, and the broad outlooks\r\nof his Western home.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult at first to find exactly where the house had stood;\r\neven the foundations had disappeared. At last in the long, faded grass\r\nhe discovered the doorstep, and near by was a little mound where the\r\ngreat walnut-tree stump had been. The cellar was a mere dent in the\r\nsloping ground; it had been filled in by the growing grass and slow\r\nprocesses of summer and winter weather. But just at the pilgrim\'s\r\nright were some thorny twigs of an old rosebush. A sudden brightening\r\nof memory brought to mind the love that his mother--dead since his\r\nfifteenth year--had kept for this sweetbrier. How often she had wished\r\nthat she had brought it to her new home! So much had changed in the\r\nworld, so many had gone into the world of light, and here the faithful\r\nblooming thing was yet alive! There was one slender branch where green\r\nbuds were starting, and getting ready to flower in the new year.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore late, and still the gray-haired man lingered. He\r\nmight have laughed at some one else who gave himself up to sad\r\nthoughts, and found fault with himself, with no defendant to plead his\r\ncause at the bar of conscience. It was an altogether lonely hour. He\r\nhad dreamed all his life, in a sentimental, self-satisfied fashion, of\r\nthis return to Winby. It had always appeared to be a grand affair, but\r\nso far he was himself the only interested spectator at his poor\r\noccasion. There was even a dismal consciousness that he had been\r\nundignified, perhaps even a little consequential and silly, in the old\r\nschool-house. The picture of himself on the war-path, in Johnny\r\nSpencer\'s arithmetic, was the only tribute that this longed-for day\r\nhad held, but he laughed aloud delightedly at the remembrance and\r\nreally liked that solemn little boy who sat at his own old desk. There\r\nwas another older lad, who sat at the back of the room, who reminded\r\nMr. Laneway of himself in his eager youth. There was a spark of light\r\nin that fellow\'s eyes. Once or twice in the earlier afternoon, as he\r\ndrove along, he had asked people in the road if there were a Laneway\r\nfamily in that neighborhood, but everybody had said no in indifferent\r\nfashion. Somehow he had been expecting that every one would know him\r\nand greet him, and give him credit for what he had tried to do, but\r\nold Winby had her own affairs to look after, and did very well without\r\nany of his help.\r\n\r\nMr. Laneway acknowledged to himself at this point that he was weak and\r\nunmanly. There must be some old friends who would remember him, and\r\ngive him as hearty a welcome as the greeting he had brought for them.\r\nSo he rose and went his way westward toward the sunset. The air was\r\ngrowing damp and cold, and it was time to make sure of shelter. This\r\nwas hardly like the visit he had meant to pay to his birthplace. He\r\nwished with all his heart that he had never come back. But he walked\r\nbriskly away, intent upon wider thoughts as the fresh evening breeze\r\nquickened his steps. He did not consider where he was going, but was\r\nfor a time the busy man of affairs, stimulated by the unconscious\r\ninfluence of his surroundings. The slender gray birches and pitch\r\npines of that neglected pasture had never before seen a hat and coat\r\nexactly in the fashion. They may have been abashed by the presence of\r\na United States Senator and Western millionaire, though a piece of New\r\nEngland ground that had often felt the tread of his bare feet was not\r\nlikely to quake because a pair of smart shoes stepped hastily along\r\nthe school-house path.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThere was an imperative knock at the side door of the Hender\r\nfarmhouse, just after dark. The young school-mistress had come home\r\nlate, because she had stopped all the way along to give people the\r\nnews of her afternoon\'s experience. Marilla was not coy and speechless\r\nany longer, but sat by the kitchen stove telling her eager grandmother\r\neverything she could remember or could imagine.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that knocking at the door?" interrupted Mrs. Hender. "No, I\'ll\r\ngo myself; I\'m nearest."\r\n\r\nThe man outside was cold and foot-weary. He was not used to spending a\r\nwhole day unrecognized, and, after being first amused, and even\r\nenjoying a sense of freedom at escaping his just dues of consideration\r\nand respect, he had begun to feel as if he were old and forgotten, and\r\nwas hardly sure of a friend in the world.\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Hender came to the door, with her eyes shining with delight,\r\nin great haste to dismiss whoever had knocked, so that she might hear\r\nthe rest of Marilla\'s story. She opened the door wide to whoever might\r\nhave come on some country errand, and looked the tired and\r\nfaint-hearted Mr. Laneway full in the face.\r\n\r\n"Dear heart, come in!" she exclaimed, reaching out and taking him by\r\nthe shoulder, as he stood humbly on a lower step. "Come right in, Joe.\r\nWhy, I should know you anywhere! Why, Joe Laneway, _you same boy_!"\r\n\r\nIn they went to the warm, bright, country kitchen. The delight and\r\nkindness of an old friend\'s welcome and her instant sympathy seemed\r\nthe loveliest thing in the world. They sat down in two old\r\nstraight-backed kitchen chairs. They still held each other by the\r\nhand, and looked in each other\'s face. The plain old room was aglow\r\nwith heat and cheerfulness; the tea-kettle was singing; a drowsy cat\r\nsat on the wood-box with her paws tucked in; and the house dog came\r\nforward in a friendly way, wagging his tail, and laid his head on\r\ntheir clasped hands.\r\n\r\n"And to think I haven\'t seen you since your folks moved out West, the\r\nnext spring after you were thirteen in the winter," said the good\r\nwoman. "But I s\'pose there ain\'t been anybody that has followed your\r\ncareer closer than I have, accordin\' to their opportunities. You\'ve\r\ndone a great work for your country, Joe. I\'m proud of you clean\r\nthrough. Sometimes folks has said, \'There, there, Mis\' Hender, what be\r\nyou goin\' to say now?\' but I\'ve always told \'em to wait. I knew you\r\nsaw your reasons. You was always an honest boy." The tears started and\r\nshone in her kind eyes. Her face showed that she had waged a bitter\r\nwar with poverty and sorrow, but the look of affection that it wore,\r\nand the warm touch of her hard hand, misshapen and worn with toil,\r\ntouched her old friend in his inmost heart, and for a minute neither\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\n"They do say that women folks have got no natural head for politics,\r\nbut I always could seem to sense what was goin\' on in Washington, if\r\nthere was any sense to it," said grandmother Hender at last.\r\n\r\n"Nobody could puzzle you at school, I remember," answered Mr. Laneway,\r\nand they both laughed heartily. "But surely this granddaughter does\r\nnot make your household? You have sons?"\r\n\r\n"Two beside her father. He died; but they\'re both away, up toward\r\nCanada, buying cattle. We are getting along considerable well these\r\nlast few years, since they got a mite o\' capital together; but the old\r\nfarm wasn\'t really able to maintain us, with the heavy expenses that\r\nfell on us unexpected year by year. I\'ve seen a great sight of\r\ntrouble, Joe. My boy John, Marilla\'s father, and his nice wife,--I\r\nlost \'em both early, when Marilla was but a child. John was the flower\r\no\' my family. He would have made a name for himself. You would have\r\ntaken to John."\r\n\r\n"I was sorry to hear of your loss," said Mr. Laneway. "He was a brave\r\nman. I know what he did at Fredericksburg. You remember that I lost my\r\nwife and my only son?"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence between the friends, who had no need for words\r\nnow; they understood each other\'s heart only too well. Marilla, who\r\nsat near them, rose and went out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, daughter," said Mrs. Hender, calling her back, "we ought to\r\nbe thinkin\' about supper."\r\n\r\n"I was going to light a little fire in the parlor," explained Marilla,\r\nwith a slight tone of rebuke in her clear girlish voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you ain\'t,--not now, at least," protested the elder woman\r\ndecidedly. "Now, Joseph, what should you like to have for supper? I\r\nwish to my heart I had some fried turnovers, like those you used to\r\ncome after when you was a boy. I can make \'em just about the same as\r\nmother did. I\'ll be bound you\'ve thought of some old-fashioned dish\r\nthat you\'d relish for your supper."\r\n\r\n"Rye drop-cakes, then, if they wouldn\'t give you too much trouble,"\r\nanswered the Honorable Joseph, with prompt seriousness, "and don\'t\r\nforget some cheese." He looked up at his old playfellow as she stood\r\nbeside him, eager with affectionate hospitality.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no idea what a comfort Marilla\'s been," she stopped to\r\nwhisper. "Always took right hold and helped me when she was a baby.\r\nShe\'s as good as made up already to me for my having no daughter. I\r\nwant you to get acquainted with Marilla."\r\n\r\nThe granddaughter was still awed and anxious about the entertainment\r\nof so distinguished a guest when her grandmother appeared at last in\r\nthe pantry.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t goin\' to let you do no such a thing, darlin\'," said Abby\r\nHender, when Marilla spoke of making something that she called "fairy\r\ngems" for tea, after a new and essentially feminine recipe. "You just\r\nlet me get supper to-night. The Gen\'ral has enough kickshaws to eat;\r\nhe wants a good, hearty, old-fashioned supper,--the same country\r\ncooking he remembers when he was a boy. He went so far himself as to\r\nspeak of rye drop-cakes, an\' there ain\'t one in a hundred, nowadays,\r\nknows how to make the kind he means. You go an\' lay the table just as\r\nwe always have it, except you can get out them old big sprigged cups\r\no\' my mother\'s. Don\'t put on none o\' the parlor cluset things."\r\n\r\nMarilla went off crestfallen and demurring. She had a noble desire to\r\nshow Mr. Laneway that they knew how to have things as well as\r\nanybody, and was sure that he would consider it more polite to be\r\nasked into the best room, and to sit there alone until tea was ready;\r\nbut the illustrious Mr. Laneway was allowed to stay in the kitchen, in\r\napparent happiness, and to watch the proceedings from beginning to\r\nend. The two old friends talked industriously, but he saw his rye\r\ndrop-cakes go into the oven and come out, and his tea made, and his\r\npiece of salt fish broiled and buttered, a broad piece of honeycomb\r\nset on to match some delightful thick slices of brown-crusted loaf\r\nbread, and all the simple feast prepared. There was a sufficient piece\r\nof Abby Hender\'s best cheese; it must be confessed that there were\r\nalso some baked beans, and, as one thing after another appeared, the\r\nHonorable Joseph K. Laneway grew hungrier and hungrier, until he\r\nfairly looked pale with anticipation and delay, and was bidden at that\r\nvery moment to draw up his chair and make himself a supper if he\r\ncould. What cups of tea, what uncounted rye drop-cakes, went to the\r\nmaking of that successful supper! How gay the two old friends became,\r\nand of what old stories they reminded each other, and how late the\r\ndark spring evening grew, before the feast was over and the\r\nstraight-backed chairs were set against the kitchen wall!\r\n\r\nMarilla listened for a time with more or less interest, but at last\r\nshe took one of her school-books, with slight ostentation, and went\r\nover to study by the lamp. Mrs. Hender had brought her knitting-work,\r\na blue woolen stocking, out of a drawer, and sat down serene and\r\nunruffled, prepared to keep awake as late as possible. She was a woman\r\nwho had kept her youthful looks through the difficulties of farm life\r\nas few women can, and this added to her guest\'s sense of homelikeness\r\nand pleasure. There was something that he felt to be sisterly and\r\ncomfortable in her strong figure; he even noticed the little plaid\r\nwoolen shawl that she wore about her shoulders. Dear, uncomplaining\r\nheart of Abby Hender! The appealing friendliness of the good woman\r\nmade no demands except to be allowed to help and to serve everybody\r\nwho came in her way.\r\n\r\nNow began in good earnest the talk of old times, and what had become\r\nof this and that old schoolmate; how one family had come to want and\r\nanother to wealth. The changes and losses and windfalls of good\r\nfortune in that rural neighborhood were made tragedy and comedy by\r\nturns in Abby Hender\'s dramatic speech. She grew younger and more\r\nentertaining hour by hour, and beguiled the grave Senator into\r\nconfidential talk of national affairs. He had much to say, to which\r\nshe listened with rare sympathy and intelligence. She astonished him\r\nby her comprehension of difficult questions of the day, and by her\r\nsimple good sense. Marilla grew hopelessly sleepy, and departed, but\r\nneither of them turned to notice her as she lingered a moment at the\r\ndoor to say good-night. When the immediate subjects of conversation\r\nwere fully discussed, however, there was an unexpected interval of\r\nsilence, and, after making sure that her knitting stitches counted\r\nexactly right, Abby Hender cast a questioning glance at the Senator to\r\nsee if he had it in mind to go to bed. She was reluctant to end her\r\nevening so soon, but determined to act the part of considerate\r\nhostess. The guest was as wide awake as ever: eleven o\'clock was the\r\nbest part of his evening.\r\n\r\n"Cider?" he suggested, with an expectant smile, and Abby Hender was on\r\nher feet in a moment. When she had brought a pitcher from the pantry,\r\nhe took a candle from the high shelf and led the way.\r\n\r\n"To think of your remembering our old cellar candlestick all these\r\nyears!" laughed the pleased woman, as she followed him down the steep\r\nstairway, and then laughed still more at his delight in the familiar\r\nlook of the place.\r\n\r\n"Unchanged as the pyramids!" he said. "I suppose those pound sweetings\r\nthat used to be in that farthest bin were eaten up months ago?"\r\n\r\nIt was plain to see that the household stores were waning low, as\r\nbefitted the time of year, but there was still enough in the old\r\ncellar. Care and thrift and gratitude made the poor farmhouse a rich\r\nplace. This woman of real ability had spent her strength from youth to\r\nage, and had lavished as much industry and power of organization in\r\nher narrow sphere as would have made her famous in a wider one. Joseph\r\nLaneway could not help sighing as he thought of it. How many things\r\nthis good friend had missed, and yet how much she had been able to win\r\nthat makes everywhere the very best of life! Poor and early widowed,\r\nthere must have been a constant battle with poverty on that stony\r\nHarran farm, whose owners had been pitied even in his early boyhood,\r\nwhen the best of farming life was none too easy. But Abby Hender had\r\nalways been one of the leaders of the town.\r\n\r\n"Now, before we sit down again, I want you to step into my best room.\r\nPerhaps you won\'t have time in the morning, and I\'ve got something to\r\nshow you," she said persuasively.\r\n\r\nIt was a plain, old-fashioned best room, with a look of pleasantness\r\nin spite of the spring chill and the stiffness of the best chairs.\r\nThey lingered before the picture of Mrs. Hender\'s soldier son, a poor\r\nwork of a poorer artist in crayons, but the spirit of the young face\r\nshone out appealingly. Then they crossed the room and stood before\r\nsome bookshelves, and Abby Hender\'s face brightened into a beaming\r\nsmile of triumph.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t expect we should have all those books, now, did you, Joe\r\nLaneway?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head soberly, and leaned forward to read the titles.\r\nThere were no very new ones, as if times had been hard of late; almost\r\nevery volume was either history, or biography, or travel. Their owner\r\nhad reached out of her own narrow boundaries into other lives and into\r\nfar countries. He recognized with gratitude two or three congressional\r\nbooks that he had sent her when he first went to Washington, and there\r\nwas a life of himself, written from a partisan point of view, and\r\nissued in one of his most exciting campaigns; the sight of it touched\r\nhim to the heart, and then she opened it, and showed him the three or\r\nfour letters that he had written her,--one, in boyish handwriting,\r\ndescribing his adventures on his first Western journey.\r\n\r\n"There are a hundred and six volumes now," announced the proud owner\r\nof such a library. "I lend \'em all I can, or most of them would look\r\nbetter. I have had to wait a good while for some, and some weren\'t\r\nwhat I expected \'em to be, but most of \'em\'s as good books as there is\r\nin the world. I\'ve never been so situated that it seemed best for me\r\nto indulge in a daily paper, and I don\'t know but it\'s just as well;\r\nbut stories were never any great of a temptation. I know pretty well\r\nwhat\'s goin\' on about me, and I can make that do. Real life\'s\r\ninterestin\' enough for me."\r\n\r\nMr. Laneway was still looking over the books. His heart smote him for\r\nnot being thoughtful; he knew well enough that the overflow of his own\r\nlibrary would have been delightful to this self-denying, eager-minded\r\nsoul. "I\'ve been a very busy man all my life, Abby," he said\r\nimpulsively, as if she waited for some apology for his forgetfulness,\r\n"but I\'ll see to it now that you have what you want to read. I don\'t\r\nmean to lose hold of your advice on state matters." They both laughed,\r\nand he added, "I\'ve always thought of you, if I haven\'t shown it."\r\n\r\n"There\'s more time to read than there used to be; I\'ve had what was\r\nbest for me," answered the woman gently, with a grateful look on her\r\nface, as she turned to glance at her old friend. "Marilla takes hold\r\nwonderfully and helps me with the work. In the long winter evenings\r\nyou can\'t think what a treat a new book is. I wouldn\'t change places\r\nwith the queen."\r\n\r\nThey had come back to the kitchen, and she stood before the cupboard,\r\nreaching high for two old gayly striped crockery mugs. There were some\r\ndoughnuts and cheese at hand; their early supper seemed quite\r\nforgotten. The kitchen was warm, and they had talked themselves\r\nthirsty and hungry; but with what an unexpected tang the cider\r\nfreshened their throats! Mrs. Hender had picked the apples herself\r\nthat went to the press; they were all chosen from the old russet tree\r\nand the gnarly, red-cheeked, ungrafted fruit that grew along the lane.\r\nThe flavor made one think of frosty autumn mornings on high hillsides,\r\nof north winds and sunny skies. "It \'livens one to the heart," as Mrs.\r\nHender remarked proudly, when the Senator tried to praise it as much\r\nas it deserved, and finally gave a cheerful laugh, such as he had not\r\nlaughed for many a day.\r\n\r\n"Why, it seems like drinking the month of October," he told her; and\r\nat this the hostess reached over, protesting that the striped mug was\r\ntoo narrow to hold what it ought, and filled it up again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Joe Laneway, to think that I see you at last, after all these\r\nyears!" she said. "How rich I shall feel with this evening to live\r\nover! I\'ve always wanted to see somebody that I\'d read about, and now\r\nI\'ve got that to remember; but I\'ve always known I should see you\r\nagain, and I believe \'t was the Lord\'s will."\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning they said good-by. The early breakfast had to\r\nbe hurried, and Marilla was to drive Mr. Laneway to the station,\r\nthree miles away. It was Saturday morning, and she was free from\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nMr. Laneway strolled down the lane before breakfast was ready, and\r\ncame back with a little bunch of pink anemones in his hand. Marilla\r\nthought that he meant to give them to her, but he laid them beside her\r\ngrandmother\'s plate. "You mustn\'t put those in your desk," he said\r\nwith a smile, and Abby Hender blushed like a girl.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got those others now, dried and put away somewhere in one of my\r\nbooks," she said quietly, and Marilla wondered what they meant.\r\n\r\nThe two old friends shook hands warmly at parting. "I wish you could\r\nhave stayed another day, so I could have had the minister come and see\r\nyou," urged Mrs. Hender regretfully.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t have done any more for me. I have had the best visit in\r\nthe world," he answered, a little shaken, and holding her hand a\r\nmoment longer, while Marilla sat, young and impatient, in the high\r\nwagon. "You\'re a dear good woman, Abby. Sometimes when things have\r\ngone wrong I\'ve been sorry that I ever had to leave Winby."\r\n\r\nThe woman\'s clear eyes looked straight into his; then fell. "You\r\nwouldn\'t have done everything you have for the country," she said.\r\n\r\n"Give me a kiss; we\'re getting to be old folks now," said the General;\r\nand they kissed each other gravely.\r\n\r\nA moment later Abby Hender stood alone in her dooryard, watching and\r\nwaving her hand again and again, while the wagon rattled away down the\r\nlane and turned into the high-road.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after Marilla returned from the station, and rushed into the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n"Grandma!" she exclaimed, "you never did see such a crowd in Winby as\r\nthere was at the depot! Everybody in town had got word about General\r\nLaneway, and they were pushing up to shake hands, and cheering same\r\nas at election, and the cars waited much as ten minutes, and all the\r\nfolks was lookin\' out of the windows, and came out on the platforms\r\nwhen they heard who it was. Folks say that he\'d been to see the\r\nselectmen yesterday before he came to school, and he\'s goin\' to build\r\nan elegant town hall, and have the names put up in it of all the Winby\r\nmen that went to the war." Marilla sank into a chair, flushed with\r\nexcitement. "Everybody was asking me about his being here last night\r\nand what he said to the school. I wished that you\'d gone down to the\r\ndepot instead of me."\r\n\r\n"I had the best part of anybody," said Mrs. Hender, smiling and going\r\non with her Saturday morning work. "I\'m real glad they showed him\r\nproper respect," she added a moment afterward, but her voice faltered.\r\n\r\n"Why, you ain\'t been cryin\', grandma?" asked the girl. "I guess you\'re\r\ntired. You had a real good time, now, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear heart!" said Abby Hender. "\'T ain\'t pleasant to be growin\'\r\nold, that\'s all. I couldn\'t help noticin\' his age as he rode away.\r\nI\'ve always been lookin\' forward to seein\' him again, an\' now it\'s all\r\nover."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Looking Back on Girlhood_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn giving this brief account of my childhood, or, to speak exactly, of\r\nthe surroundings which have affected the course of my work as a\r\nwriter, my first thought flies back to those who taught me to observe,\r\nand to know the deep pleasures of simple things, and to be interested\r\nin the lives of people about me.\r\n\r\nWith its high hills and pine forests, and all its ponds and brooks and\r\ndistant mountain views, there are few such delightful country towns in\r\nNew England as the one where I was born. Being one of the oldest\r\ncolonial settlements, it is full of interesting traditions and relics\r\nof the early inhabitants, both Indians and Englishmen. Two large\r\nrivers join just below the village at the head of tide-water, and\r\nthese, with the great inflow from the sea, make a magnificent stream,\r\nbordered on its seaward course now by high-wooded banks of dark pines\r\nand hemlocks, and again by lovely green fields that slope gently to\r\nlong lines of willows at the water\'s edge.\r\n\r\nThere is never-ending pleasure in making one\'s self familiar with such\r\na region. One may travel at home in a most literal sense, and be\r\nalways learning history, geography, botany, or biography--whatever one\r\nchooses.\r\n\r\nI have had a good deal of journeying in my life, and taken great\r\ndelight in it, but I have never taken greater delight than in my rides\r\nand drives and tramps and voyages within the borders of my native\r\ntown. There is always something fresh, something to be traced or\r\ndiscovered, something particularly to be remembered. One grows rich in\r\nmemories and associations.\r\n\r\nI believe that we should know our native towns much better than most\r\nof us do, and never let ourselves be strangers at home. Particularly\r\nwhen one\'s native place is so really interesting as my own!\r\n\r\nAbove tide-water the two rivers are barred by successive falls. You\r\nhear the noise of them by night in the village like the sound of the\r\nsea, and this fine water power so near the coast, beside a great\r\nsalmon fishery famous among the Indians, brought the first English\r\nsettlers to the town in 1627. I know some families who still live upon\r\nthe lands which their ancestors bought from the Indians, and their\r\nsingle deed bears the queer barbaric signatures.\r\n\r\nThere are many things to remind one of these early settlers beside the\r\nold farms upon which they and their descendants have lived for six or\r\nseven generations. One is a quaint fashion of speech which survives\r\namong the long-established neighborhoods, in words and phrases common\r\nin England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nOne curious thing is the pronunciation of the name of the town:\r\nBerwick by the elder people has always been called _Barvik_, after the\r\nfashion of Danes and Northmen; never _Berrik_, as the word has so long\r\nbeen pronounced in modern England.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of the first comers to the town have often been\r\ndistinguished in the affairs of their time. No village of its size in\r\nNew England could boast, particularly in the early part of the present\r\ncentury, of a larger number of men and women who kept themselves more\r\nclosely in touch with "the best that has been thought and said in the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I keep in mind the truth that I have no inheritance\r\nfrom the ancient worth and dignity of Berwick--or what is now North\r\nBerwick--in Maine. My own people are comparatively late comers. I was\r\nborn in a pleasant old colonial house built near 1750, and bought by\r\nmy grandfather sixty or seventy years ago, when he brought his\r\nhousehold up the river to Berwick from Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nHe was a sea-captain, and had run away to sea in his boyhood and led a\r\nmost adventurous life, but was quite ready to forsake seafaring in his\r\nearly manhood, and at last joined a group of acquaintances who were\r\nengaged in the flourishing West India trade of that time.\r\n\r\nFor many years he kept and extended his interests in shipping,\r\nbuilding ships and buying large quantities of timber from the\r\nnorthward and eastward, and sending it down the river and so to sea.\r\n\r\nThis business was still in existence in my early childhood, and the\r\nmanner of its conduct was primitive enough, the barter system still\r\nprevailing by force of necessity. Those who brought the huge sticks of\r\noak and pine timber for masts and planks were rarely paid in money,\r\nwhich was of comparatively little use in remote and sparsely settled\r\ndistricts. When the sleds and long trains of yoked oxen returned from\r\nthe river wharves to the stores, they took a lighter load in exchange\r\nof flour and rice and barrels of molasses, of sugar and salt and\r\ncotton cloth and raisins and spices and tea and coffee; in fact, all\r\nthe household necessities and luxuries that the northern farms could\r\nnot supply.\r\n\r\nThey liked to have a little money with which to pay their taxes and\r\ntheir parish dues, if they were so fortunate as to be parishioners,\r\nbut they needed very little money besides.\r\n\r\nSo I came in contact with the up-country people as well as with the\r\nsailors and shipmasters of the other side of the business. I used to\r\nlinger about the busy country stores, and listen to the graphic\r\ncountry talk. I heard the greetings of old friends, and their minute\r\ndetails of neighborhood affairs, their delightful jokes and\r\nMunchausen-like reports of tracts of timber-pines ever so many feet\r\nthrough at the butt.\r\n\r\nWhen the great teams came in sight at the head of the village street,\r\nI ran to meet them over the creaking snow, if possible to mount and\r\nride into town in triumph; but it was not many years before I began to\r\nfeel sorry at the sight of every huge lopped stem of oak or pine that\r\ncame trailing along after the slow-stepping, frosted oxen. Such trees\r\nare unreplaceable. I only know of one small group now in all this part\r\nof the country of those great timber pines.\r\n\r\nMy young ears were quick to hear the news of a ship\'s having come into\r\nport, and I delighted in the elderly captains, with their sea-tanned\r\nfaces, who came to report upon their voyages, dining cheerfully and\r\nheartily with my grandfather, who listened eagerly to their exciting\r\ntales of great storms on the Atlantic, and winds that blew them\r\nnorth-about, and good bargains in Havana, or Barbadoes, or Havre.\r\n\r\nI listened as eagerly as any one; this is the charming way in which I\r\nwas taught something of a fashion of life already on the wane, and of\r\nthat subsistence upon sea and forest bounties which is now almost a\r\nforgotten thing in my part of New England.\r\n\r\nMuch freight still came and went by the river gundelows and packets\r\nlong after the railroad had made such changes, and every village along\r\nits line lost its old feeling of self-sufficiency.\r\n\r\nIn my home the greater part of the minor furnishings had come over in\r\nthe ships from Bristol and Havre. My grandfather seemed to be a\r\ncitizen of the whole geography. I was always listening to stories of\r\nthree wars from older people--the siege of Louisburg, the Revolution,\r\nin which my father\'s ancestors had been honest but mistaken Tories,\r\nand in which my mother\'s, the Gilmans of Exeter, had taken a nobler\r\npart.\r\n\r\nAs for the War of 1812, "the last war," as everybody called it, it was\r\na thing of yesterday in the town. One of the famous privateer crews\r\nwas gathered along our own river shore, and one member of the crew, in\r\nhis old age, had been my father\'s patient.\r\n\r\nThe Berwick people were great patriots, and were naturally proud of\r\nthe famous Sullivans, who were born in the upper part of the town, and\r\ncame to be governors and judge and general.\r\n\r\nI often heard about Lafayette, who had made an ever-to-be-remembered\r\nvisit in order to see again some old friends who lived in the town.\r\nThe name of a famous Colonel Hamilton, the leader in the last century\r\nof the West India trade, and the histories of the old Berwick houses\r\nof Chadbourn and Lord were delightfully familiar, and one of the\r\ntraditions of the latter family is more than good enough to be told\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThere was a Berwick lad who went out on one of the privateers that\r\nsailed from Portsmouth in the Revolution. The vessel was taken by a\r\nBritish frigate, and the crew put in irons. One day one of the English\r\nmidshipmen stood near these prisoners as they took their airing on\r\ndeck, and spoke contemptuously about "the rebels."\r\n\r\nYoung Lord heard what he said, and turned himself about to say boldly,\r\n"If it were not for your rank, sir, I would make you take that back!"\r\n\r\n"No matter about my rank," said the gallant middy. "If you can whip\r\nme, you are welcome to."\r\n\r\nSo they had a "capital good fight," standing over a tea-chest, as\r\nproud tradition tells, and the Berwick sailor was the better fighter\r\nof the two, and won.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman shook hands, and asked his name and promised not to\r\nforget him--which was certainly most handsome behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached an English port all the prisoners but one were sent\r\naway under guard to join the other American prisoners of war; but the\r\nadmiral sent for a young man named Nathan Lord, and told him that his\r\nGrace the Duke of Clarence, son of his Majesty the King, begged for\r\nhis pardon, and had left a five-pound note at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first or last Berwick lad who proved himself of good\r\ncourage in a fight, but there never was another to whip a future King\r\nof England, and moreover to be liked the better for it by that fine\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather died in my eleventh year, and presently the Civil War\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the simple village life was at an end. Its provincial\r\ncharacter was fading out; shipping was at a disadvantage, and there\r\nwere no more bronzed sea-captains coming to dine and talk about their\r\nvoyages, no more bags of filberts or oranges for the children, or\r\ngreat red jars of olives; but in these childish years I had come in\r\ncontact with many delightful men and women of real individuality and\r\nbreadth of character, who had fought the battle of life to good\r\nadvantage, and sometimes against great odds.\r\n\r\nIn these days I was given to long, childish illnesses, and it must be\r\nhonestly confessed, to instant drooping if ever I were shut up in\r\nschool. I had apparently not the slightest desire for learning, but my\r\nfather was always ready to let me be his companion in long drives\r\nabout the country.\r\n\r\nIn my grandfather\'s business household, my father, unconscious of\r\ntonnage and timber measurement, of the markets of the Windward\r\nIslands or the Mediterranean ports, had taken to his book, as old\r\npeople said, and gone to college and begun that devotion to the study\r\nof medicine which only ended with his life.\r\n\r\nI have tried already to give some idea of my father\'s character in my\r\nstory of "The Country Doctor," but all that is inadequate to the gifts\r\nand character of the man himself. He gave me my first and best\r\nknowledge of books by his own delight and dependence upon them, and\r\nruled my early attempts at writing by the severity and simplicity of\r\nhis own good taste.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t try to write _about_ people and things, tell them just as they\r\nare!"\r\n\r\nHow often my young ears heard these words without comprehending them!\r\nBut while I was too young and thoughtless to share in an enthusiasm\r\nfor Sterne or Fielding, and Smollett or Don Quixote, my mother and\r\ngrandmother were leading me into the pleasant ways of "Pride and\r\nPrejudice," and "The Scenes of Clerical Life," and the delightful\r\nstories of Mrs. Oliphant.\r\n\r\nThe old house was well provided with leather-bound books of a deeply\r\nserious nature, but in my youthful appetite for knowledge, I could\r\neven in the driest find something vital, and in the more entertaining\r\nI was completely lost.\r\n\r\nMy father had inherited from his father an amazing knowledge of human\r\nnature, and from his mother\'s French ancestry, that peculiarly French\r\ntrait, called _gaiet\xe9 de coeur_. Through all the heavy responsibilities\r\nand anxieties of his busy professional life, this kept him young at\r\nheart and cheerful. His visits to his patients were often made\r\nperfectly delightful and refreshing to them by his kind heart, and the\r\ncharm of his personality.\r\n\r\nI knew many of the patients whom he used to visit in lonely inland\r\nfarms, or on the seacoast in York and Wells. I used to follow him\r\nabout silently, like an undemanding little dog, content to follow at\r\nhis heels.\r\n\r\nI had no consciousness of watching or listening, or indeed of any\r\nspecial interest in the country interiors. In fact, when the time came\r\nthat my own world of imaginations was more real to me than any other,\r\nI was sometimes perplexed at my father\'s directing my attention to\r\ncertain points of interest in the character or surroundings of our\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nI cannot help believing that he recognized, long before I did myself,\r\nin what direction the current of purpose in my life was setting. Now,\r\nas I write my sketches of country life, I remember again and again the\r\nwise things he said, and the sights he made me see. He was only\r\nimpatient with affectation and insincerity.\r\n\r\nI may have inherited something of my father\'s and grandfather\'s\r\nknowledge of human nature, but my father never lost a chance of trying\r\nto teach me to observe. I owe a great deal to his patience with a\r\nheedless little girl given far more to dreams than to accuracy, and\r\nwith perhaps too little natural sympathy for the dreams of others.\r\n\r\nThe quiet village life, the dull routine of farming or mill life,\r\nearly became interesting to me. I was taught to find everything that\r\nan imaginative child could ask, in the simple scenes close at hand.\r\n\r\nI say these things eagerly, because I long to impress upon every boy\r\nand girl this truth: that it is not one\'s surroundings that can help\r\nor hinder--it is having a growing purpose in one\'s life to make the\r\nmost of whatever is in one\'s reach.\r\n\r\nIf you have but a few good books, learn those to the very heart of\r\nthem. Don\'t for one moment believe that if you had different\r\nsurroundings and opportunities you would find the upward path any\r\neasier to climb. One condition is like another, if you have not the\r\ndetermination and the power to grow in yourself.\r\n\r\nI was still a child when I began to write down the things I was\r\nthinking about, but at first I always made rhymes and found prose so\r\ndifficult that a school composition was a terror to me, and I do not\r\nremember ever writing one that was worth anything. But in course of\r\ntime rhymes themselves became difficult and prose more and more\r\nenticing, and I began my work in life, most happy in finding that I\r\nwas to write of those country characters and rural landscapes to which\r\nI myself belonged, and which I had been taught to love with all my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nI was between nineteen and twenty when my first sketch was accepted by\r\nMr. Howells for the _Atlantic_. I already counted myself as by no\r\nmeans a new contributor to one or two other magazines--_Young Folks_\r\nand _The Riverside_--but I had no literary friends "at court."\r\n\r\nI was very shy about speaking of my work at home, and even sent it to\r\nthe magazine under an assumed name, and then was timid about asking\r\nthe post-mistress for those mysterious and exciting editorial letters\r\nwhich she announced upon the post-office list as if I were a stranger\r\nin the town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Passing of Sister Barsett_\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Mercy Crane was of such firm persuasion that a house is meant to\r\nbe lived in, that during many years she was never known to leave her\r\nown neat two-storied dwelling-place on the Ridge road. Yet being very\r\nfond of company, in pleasant weather she often sat in the side doorway\r\nlooking out on her green yard, where the grass grew short and thick\r\nand was undisfigured even by a path toward the steps. All her faded\r\ngreen blinds were securely tied together and knotted on the inside by\r\npieces of white tape; but now and then, when the sun was not too hot\r\nfor her carpets, she opened one window at a time for a few hours,\r\nhaving pronounced views upon the necessity of light and air. Although\r\nMrs. Crane was acknowledged by her best friends to be a peculiar\r\nperson and very set in her ways, she was much respected, and one\r\nacquaintance vied with another in making up for her melancholy\r\nseclusion by bringing her all the news they could gather. She had been\r\nleft alone many years before by the sudden death of her husband from\r\nsunstroke, and though she was by no means poor, she had, as some one\r\nsaid, "such a pretty way of taking a little present that you couldn\'t\r\nhelp being pleased when you gave her anything."\r\n\r\nFor a lover of society, such a life must have had its difficulties at\r\ntimes, except that the Ridge road was more traveled than any other in\r\nthe township, and Mrs. Crane had invented a system of signals, to\r\nwhich she always resorted in case of wishing to speak to some one of\r\nher neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was wearing late, one day toward the end of summer, and\r\nMercy Crane sat in her doorway dressed in a favorite old-fashioned\r\nlight calico and a small shoulder shawl figured with large palm\r\nleaves. She was making some tatting of a somewhat intricate pattern;\r\nshe believed it to be the prettiest and most durable of trimmings, and\r\nhaving decorated her own wardrobe in the course of unlimited leisure,\r\nshe was now making a few yards apiece for each of her more intimate\r\nfriends, so that they might have something to remember her by. She\r\nkept glancing up the road as if she expected some one, but the time\r\nwent slowly by, until at last a woman appeared to view, walking fast,\r\nand carrying a large bundle in a checked handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThen Mercy Crane worked steadily for a short time without looking up,\r\nuntil the desired friend was crossing the grass between the dusty road\r\nand the steps. The visitor was out of breath, and did not respond to\r\nthe polite greeting of her hostess until she had recovered herself to\r\nher satisfaction. Mrs. Crane made her the kind offer of a glass of\r\nwater or a few peppermints, but was answered only by a shake of the\r\nhead, so she resumed her work for a time until the silence should be\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n"I have come from the house of mourning," said Sarah Ellen Dow at\r\nlast, unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t tell me that Sister Barsett"--\r\n\r\n"She\'s left us this time, she\'s really gone," and the excited\r\nnews-bringer burst into tears. The poor soul was completely\r\noverwrought; she looked tired and wan, as if she had spent her forces\r\nin sympathy as well as hard work. She felt in her great bundle for a\r\npocket handkerchief, but was not successful in the search, and finally\r\nproduced a faded gingham apron with long, narrow strings, with which\r\nshe hastily dried her tears. The sad news appealed also to Mercy\r\nCrane, who looked across to the apple-trees, and could not see them\r\nfor a dazzle of tears in her own eyes. The spectacle of Sarah Ellen\r\nDow going home with her humble workaday possessions, from the house\r\nwhere she had gone in haste only a few days before to care for a sick\r\nperson well known to them both, was a very sad sight.\r\n\r\n"You sent word yesterday that you should be returnin\' early this\r\nafternoon, and would stop. I presume I received the message as you\r\ngave it?" asked Mrs. Crane, who was tenacious in such matters; "but I\r\ndo declare I never looked to hear she was gone."\r\n\r\n"She\'s been failin\' right along sence yisterday about this time," said\r\nthe nurse. "She\'s taken no notice to speak of, an\' been eatin\' the\r\nvally o\' nothin\', I may say, sence I went there a-Tuesday. Her sisters\r\nboth come back yisterday, an\' of course I was expected to give up\r\ncharge to them. They\'re used to sickness, an\' both havin\' such a name\r\nfor bein\' great housekeepers!"\r\n\r\nSarah Ellen spoke with bitterness, but Mrs. Crane was reminded\r\ninstantly of her own affairs. "I feel condemned that I ain\'t begun my\r\nown fall cleanin\' yet," she said, with an ostentatious sigh.\r\n\r\n"Plenty o\' time to worry about that," her friend hastened to console\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I do desire to have everything decent about my house," resumed Mrs.\r\nCrane. "There\'s nobody to do anything but me. If I was to be taken\r\naway sudden myself, I shouldn\'t want to have it said afterwards that\r\nthere was wisps under my sofy or--There! I can\'t dwell on my own\r\ntroubles with Sister Barsett\'s loss right before me. I can\'t seem to\r\nbelieve she\'s really passed away; she always was saying she should go\r\nin some o\' these spells, but I deemed her to be troubled with narves."\r\n\r\nSarah Ellen Dow shook her head. "I\'m all nerved up myself," she said\r\nbrokenly. "I made light of her sickness when I went there first, I\'d\r\nseen her what she called dreadful low so many times; but I saw her\r\nlooks this morning, an\' I begun to believe her at last. Them sisters\r\no\' hers is the master for unfeelin\' hearts. Sister Barsett was\r\na-layin\' there yisterday, an\' one of \'em was a-settin\' right by her\r\ntellin\' how difficult \'t was for her to leave home, her niece was\r\ngoin\' to graduate to the high school, an\' they was goin\' to have a\r\ntime in the evening, an\' all the exercises promised to be extry\r\ninteresting. Poor Sister Barsett knew what she said an\' looked at her\r\nwith contempt, an\' then she give a glance at me an\' closed up her eyes\r\nas if \'t was for the last time. I know she felt it."\r\n\r\nSarah Ellen Dow was more and more excited by a sense of bitter\r\ngrievance. Her rule of the afflicted household had evidently been\r\ninterfered with; she was not accustomed to be ignored and set aside at\r\nsuch times. Her simple nature and uncommon ability found satisfaction\r\nin the exercise of authority, but she had now left her post feeling\r\nhurt and wronged, besides knowing something of the pain of honest\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\n"If it hadn\'t been for esteemin\' Sister Barsett as I always have done,\r\nI should have told \'em no, an\' held to it, when they asked me to come\r\nback an\' watch to-night. \'T ain\'t for none o\' their sakes, but Sister\r\nBarsett was a good friend to me in her way." Sarah Ellen broke down\r\nonce more, and felt in her bundle again hastily, but the handkerchief\r\nwas again elusive, while a small object fell out upon the doorstep\r\nwith a bounce.\r\n\r\n"\'T ain\'t nothin\' but a little taste-cake I spared out o\' the loaf I\r\nbaked this mornin\'," she explained, with a blush. "I was so shoved out\r\nthat I seemed to want to turn my hand to somethin\' useful an\' feel I\r\nwas still doin\' for Sister Barsett. Try a little piece, won\'t you,\r\nMis\' Crane? I thought it seemed light an\' good."\r\n\r\nThey shared the taste-cake with serious enjoyment, and pronounced it\r\nvery good indeed when they had finished and shaken the crumbs out of\r\ntheir laps. "There\'s nobody but you shall come an\' do for me at the\r\nlast, if I can have my way about things," said Mercy Crane\r\nimpulsively. She meant it for a tribute to Miss Dow\'s character and\r\ngeneral ability, and as such it was meekly accepted.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a younger person than I be, an\' less wore," said Sarah Ellen,\r\nbut she felt better now that she had rested, and her conversational\r\npowers seemed to be refreshed by her share of the little cake. "Doctor\r\nBangs has behaved real pretty, I can say that," she continued\r\npresently in a mournful tone.\r\n\r\n"Heretofore, in the sickness of Sister Barsett, I have always felt to\r\nhope certain that she would survive; she\'s recovered from a sight o\'\r\nthings in her day. She has been the first to have all the new diseases\r\nthat\'s visited this region. I know she had the spinal mergeetis months\r\nbefore there was any other case about," observed Mrs. Crane with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n"An\' the new throat troubles, all of \'em," agreed Sarah Ellen; "an\'\r\nhas made trial of all the best patent medicines, an\' could tell you\r\ntheir merits as no one else could in this vicinity. She never was one\r\nthat depended on herbs alone, though she considered \'em extremely\r\nuseful in some cases. Everybody has their herb, as we know, but I\'m\r\nfree to say that Sister Barsett sometimes done everything she could to\r\nkill herself with such rovin\' ways o\' dosin\'. She must see it now\r\nshe\'s gone an\' can\'t stuff down no more invigorators." Sarah Ellen Dow\r\nburst out suddenly with this, as if she could no longer contain her\r\nhonest opinion.\r\n\r\n"There, there! you\'re all worked up," answered placid Mercy Crane,\r\nlooking more interested than ever.\r\n\r\n"An\' she was dreadful handy to talk religion to other folks, but I\'ve\r\ncome to a realizin\' sense that religion is somethin\' besides opinions.\r\nShe an\' Elder French has been mostly of one mind, but I don\'t know\'s\r\nthey\'ve got hold of all the religion there is."\r\n\r\n"Why, why, Sarah Ellen!" exclaimed Mrs. Crane, but there was still\r\nsomething in her tone that urged the speaker to further expression of\r\nher feelings. The good creature was much excited, her face was clouded\r\nwith disapproval.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t forgettin\' nothin\' about their good points either," she went\r\non in a more subdued tone, and suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n"Preachin\' \'ll be done away with soon or late,--preachin\' o\' Elder\r\nFrench\'s kind," announced Mercy Crane, after waiting to see if her\r\nguest did not mean to say anything more. "I should like to read \'em\r\nout that verse another fashion: \'Be ye doers o\' the word, not\r\npreachers only,\' would hit it about right; but there, it\'s easy for\r\nall of us to talk. In my early days I used to like to get out to\r\nmeetin\' regular, because sure as I didn\'t I had bad luck all the week.\r\nI didn\'t feel pacified \'less I\'d been half a day, but I was out all\r\nday the Sabbath before Mr. Barlow died as he did. So you mean to say\r\nthat Sister Barsett\'s really gone?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Crane\'s tone changed to one of real concern, and her manner\r\nindicated that she had put the preceding conversation behind her with\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n"She was herself to the last," instantly responded Miss Dow. "I see\r\nher put out a thumb an\' finger from under the spread an\' pinch up a\r\nfold of her sister Deckett\'s dress, to try an\' see if \'twas all wool.\r\nI thought \'twa\'n\'t all wool, myself, an\' I know it now by the way she\r\nlooked. She was a very knowin\' person about materials; we shall miss\r\npoor Mis\' Barsett in many ways, she was always the one to consult with\r\nabout matters o\' dress."\r\n\r\n"She passed away easy at the last, I hope?" asked Mrs. Crane with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"Why, I wa\'n\'t there, if you\'ll believe it!" exclaimed Sarah Ellen,\r\nflushing, and looking at her friend for sympathy. "Sister Barsett\r\nrevived up the first o\' the afternoon, an\' they sent for Elder French.\r\nShe took notice of him, and he exhorted quite a spell, an\' then he\r\nspoke o\' there being need of air in the room, Mis\' Deckett havin\'\r\nclosed every window, an\' she asked me of all folks if I hadn\'t better\r\nstep out; but Elder French come too, an\' he was very reasonable, an\'\r\nhad a word with me about Mis\' Deckett an\' Mis\' Peak an\' the way they\r\nwas workin\' things. I told him right out how they never come near when\r\nthe rest of us was havin\' it so hard with her along in the spring, but\r\nnow they thought she was re\'lly goin\' to die, they come settlin\' down\r\nlike a pair o\' old crows in a field to pick for what they could get. I\r\njust made up my mind they should have all the care if they wanted it.\r\nIt didn\'t seem as if there was anything more I could do for Sister\r\nBarsett, an\' I set there in the kitchen within call an\' waited, an\'\r\nwhen I heard \'em sayin\', \'There, she\'s gone, she\'s gone!\' and Mis\'\r\nDeckett a-weepin\', I put on my bunnit and stepped myself out into the\r\nroad. I felt to repent after I had gone but a rod, but I was so worked\r\nup, an\' I thought they\'d call me back, an\' then I was put out because\r\nthey didn\'t, an\' so here I be. I can\'t help it now." Sarah Ellen was\r\ncrying again; she and Mrs. Crane could not look at each other.\r\n\r\n"Well, you set an\' rest," said Mrs. Crane kindly, and with the merest\r\nshadow of disapproval. "You set an\' rest, an\' by an\' by, if you\'d feel\r\nbetter, you could go back an\' just make a little stop an\' inquire\r\nabout the arrangements. I wouldn\'t harbor no feelin\'s, if they be\r\ninconsiderate folks. Sister Barsett has often deplored their actions\r\nin my hearing an\' wished she had sisters like other folks. With all\r\nher faults she was a useful person an\' a good neighbor," mourned Mercy\r\nCrane sincerely. "She was one that always had somethin\' interestin\' to\r\ntell, an\' if it wa\'n\'t for her dyin\' spells an\' all that sort o\'\r\nnonsense, she\'d make a figger in the world, she would so. She walked\r\nwith an air always, Mis\' Barsett did; you\'d ask who she was if you\r\nhadn\'t known, as she passed you by. How quick we forget the outs about\r\nanybody that\'s gone! But I always feel grateful to anybody that\'s\r\nfriendly, situated as I be. I shall miss her runnin\' over. I can seem\r\nto see her now, coming over the rise in the road. But don\'t you get in\r\na way of takin\' things too hard, Sarah Ellen! You\'ve worked yourself\r\nall to pieces since I saw you last; you\'re gettin\' to be as lean as a\r\nmeetin\'-house fly. Now, you\'re comin\' in to have a cup o\' tea with me,\r\nan\' then you\'ll feel better. I\'ve got some new molasses gingerbread\r\nthat I baked this mornin\'."\r\n\r\n"I do feel beat out, Mis\' Crane," acknowledged the poor little soul,\r\nglad of a chance to speak, but touched by this unexpected mark of\r\nconsideration. "If I could ha\' done as I wanted to I should be feelin\'\r\nwell enough, but to be set aside an\' ordered about, where I\'d taken\r\nthe lead in sickness so much, an\' knew how to deal with Sister Barsett\r\nso well! She might be livin\' now, perhaps"--\r\n\r\n"Come; we\'d better go in, \'tis gettin\' damp," and the mistress of the\r\nhouse rose so hurriedly as to seem bustling. "Don\'t dwell on Sister\r\nBarsett an\' her foolish folks no more; I wouldn\'t, if I was you."\r\n\r\nThey went into the front room, which was dim with the twilight of the\r\nhalf-closed blinds and two great syringa bushes that grew against\r\nthem. Sarah Ellen put down her bundle and bestowed herself in the\r\nlarge, cane-seated rocking-chair. Mrs. Crane directed her to stay\r\nthere awhile and rest, and then come out into the kitchen when she got\r\nready.\r\n\r\nA cheerful clatter of dishes was heard at once upon Mrs. Crane\'s\r\ndisappearance. "I hope she\'s goin\' to make one o\' her nice\r\nshort-cakes, but I don\'t know\'s she\'ll think it quite worth while,"\r\nthought the guest humbly. She desired to go out into the kitchen, but\r\nit was proper behavior to wait until she should be called. Mercy Crane\r\nwas not a person with whom one could venture to take liberties.\r\nPresently Sarah Ellen began to feel better. She did not often find\r\nsuch a quiet place, or the quarter of an hour of idleness in which to\r\nenjoy it, and was glad to make the most of this opportunity. Just now\r\nshe felt tired and lonely. She was a busy, unselfish, eager-minded\r\ncreature by nature, but now, while grief was sometimes uppermost in\r\nher mind and sometimes a sense of wrong, every moment found her more\r\npeaceful, and the great excitement little by little faded away.\r\n\r\n"What a person poor Sister Barsett was to dread growing old so she\r\ncouldn\'t get about. I\'m sure I shall miss her as much as anybody,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Crane, suddenly opening the kitchen door, and letting in an\r\nunmistakable and delicious odor of short-cake that revived still more\r\nthe drooping spirits of her guest. "An\' a good deal of knowledge has\r\ndied with her," she added, coming into the room and seeming to make it\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\n"There, she knew a good deal, but she didn\'t know all, especially o\'\r\ndoctorin\'," insisted Sarah Ellen from the rocking-chair, with an\r\nunexpected little laugh. "She used to lay down the law to me as if I\r\nhad neither sense nor experience, but when it came to her bad spells\r\nshe\'d always send for me. It takes everybody to know everything, but\r\nSister Barsett was of an opinion that her information was sufficient\r\nfor the town. She was tellin\' me the day I went there how she disliked\r\nto have old Mis\' Doubleday come an\' visit with her, an\' remarked that\r\nshe called Mis\' Doubleday very officious. \'Went right down on her\r\nknees an\' prayed,\' says she. \'Anybody would have thought I was a\r\nheathen!\' But I kind of pacified her feelin\'s, an\' told her I supposed\r\nthe old lady meant well."\r\n\r\n"Did she give away any of her things?--Mis\' Barsett, I mean," inquired\r\nMrs. Crane.\r\n\r\n"Not in my hearin\'," replied Sarah Ellen Dow. "Except one day, the\r\nfirst of the week, she told her oldest sister, Mis\' Deckett,--\'twas\r\nthat first day she rode over--that she might have her green quilted\r\npetticoat; you see it was a rainy day, an\' Mis\' Deckett had complained\r\no\' feelin\' thin. She went right up an\' got it, and put it on an\' wore\r\nit off, an\' I\'m sure I thought no more about it, until I heard Sister\r\nBarsett groanin\' dreadful in the night. I got right up to see what the\r\nmatter was, an\' what do you think but she was wantin\' that petticoat\r\nback, and not thinking any too well o\' Nancy Deckett for takin\' it\r\nwhen \'twas offered. \'Nancy never showed no sense o\' propriety,\' says\r\nSister Barsett; I just wish you\'d heard her go on!\r\n\r\n"If she had felt to remember me," continued Sarah Ellen, after they\r\nhad laughed a little, "I\'d full as soon have some of her nice\r\ncrockery-ware. She told me once, years ago, when I was stoppin\' to tea\r\nwith her an\' we were havin\' it real friendly, that she should leave me\r\nher Britannia tea-set, but I ain\'t got it in writin\', and I can\'t say\r\nshe\'s ever referred to the matter since. It ain\'t as if I had a home\r\no\' my own to keep it in, but I should have thought a great deal of it\r\nfor her sake," and the speaker\'s voice faltered. "I must say that with\r\nall her virtues she never was a first-class housekeeper, but I\r\nwouldn\'t say it to any but a friend. You never eat no preserves o\'\r\nhers that wa\'n\'t commencin\' to work, an\' you know as well as I how\r\nlittle forethought she had about putting away her woolens. I sat\r\nbehind her once in meetin\' when I was stoppin\' with the Tremletts and\r\nso occupied a seat in their pew, an\' I see between ten an\' a dozen\r\nmoth millers come workin\' out o\' her fitch-fur tippet. They was\r\nflutterin\' round her bonnet same\'s \'twas a lamp. I should be mortified\r\nto death to have such a thing happen to me."\r\n\r\n"Every housekeeper has her weak point; I\'ve got mine as much as\r\nanybody else," acknowledged Mercy Crane with spirit, "but you never\r\nsee no moth millers come workin\' out o\' me in a public place."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t your oven beginning to get overhet?" anxiously inquired Sarah\r\nEllen Dow, who was sitting more in the draught, and could not bear to\r\nhave any accident happen to the supper. Mrs. Crane flew to a\r\nshort-cake\'s rescue, and presently called her guest to the table.\r\n\r\nThe two women sat down to deep and brimming cups of tea. Sarah Ellen\r\nnoticed with great gratification that her hostess had put on two of\r\nthe best tea-cups and some citron-melon preserves. It was not an\r\nevery-day supper. She was used to hard fare, poor, hard-working Sarah\r\nEllen, and this handsome social attention did her good. Sister Crane\r\nrarely entertained a friend, and it would be a pleasure to speak of\r\nthe tea-drinking for weeks to come.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve put yourself out quite a consid\'able for me," she\r\nacknowledged. "How pretty these cups is! You oughtn\'t to use \'em so\r\ncommon as for me. I wish I had a home I could really call my own to\r\nask you to, but \'t ain\'t never been so I could. Sometimes I wonder\r\nwhat\'s goin\' to become o\' me when I get so I\'m past work. Takin\' care\r\no\' sick folks an\' bein\' in houses where there\'s a sight goin\' on an\'\r\neverybody in a hurry kind of wears on me now I\'m most a-gittin\' in\r\nyears. I was wishin\' the other day that I could get with some\r\ncomfortable kind of a sick person, where I could live right along\r\nquiet as other folks do, but folks never sends for me \'less they\'re\r\ndrove to it. I ain\'t laid up anything to really depend upon."\r\n\r\nThe situation appealed to Mercy Crane, well to do as she was and not\r\nburdened with responsibilities. She stirred uneasily in her chair, but\r\ncould not bring herself to the point of offering Sarah Ellen the home\r\nshe coveted.\r\n\r\n"Have some hot tea," she insisted, in a matter of fact tone, and Sarah\r\nEllen\'s face, which had been lighted by a sudden eager hopefulness,\r\ngrew dull and narrow again.\r\n\r\n"Plenty, plenty, Mis\' Crane," she said sadly, "\'tis beautiful\r\ntea,--you always have good tea;" but she could not turn her thoughts\r\nfrom her own uncertain future. "None of our folks has ever lived to be\r\na burden," she said presently, in a pathetic tone, putting down her\r\ncup. "My mother was thought to be doing well until four o\'clock an\'\r\nwas dead at ten. My Aunt Nancy came to our house well at twelve\r\no\'clock an\' died that afternoon; my father was sick but ten days.\r\nThere was dear sister Betsy, she did go in consumption, but \'twa\'n\'t\r\nan expensive sickness."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve thought sometimes about you, how you\'d get past rovin\' from\r\nhouse to house one o\' these days. I guess your friends will stand by\r\nyou." Mrs. Crane spoke with unwonted sympathy, and Sarah Ellen\'s heart\r\nleaped with joy.\r\n\r\n"You\'re real kind," she said simply. "There\'s nobody I set so much by.\r\nBut I shall miss Sister Barsett, when all\'s said an\' done. She\'s asked\r\nme many a time to stop with her when I wasn\'t doin\' nothin\'. We all\r\nhave our failin\'s, but she was a friendly creatur\'. I sha\'n\'t want to\r\nsee her laid away."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was thinkin\' a few minutes ago that I shouldn\'t want to look\r\nout an\' see the funeral go by. She\'s one o\' the old neighbors. I\r\ns\'pose I shall have to look, or I shouldn\'t feel right afterward,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Crane mournfully. "If I hadn\'t got so kind of housebound,"\r\nshe added with touching frankness, "I\'d just as soon go over with you\r\nan\' offer to watch this night."\r\n\r\n"\'T would astonish Sister Barsett so I don\'t know but she\'d return."\r\nSarah Ellen\'s eyes danced with amusement; she could not resist her own\r\njoke, and Mercy Crane herself had to smile.\r\n\r\n"Now I must be goin\', or \'twill be dark," said the guest, rising and\r\nsighing after she had eaten her last crumb of gingerbread. "Yes, thank\r\nye, you\'re real good, I will come back if I find I ain\'t wanted. Look\r\nwhat a pretty sky there is!" and the two friends went to the side door\r\nand stood together in a moment of affectionate silence, looking out\r\ntoward the sunset across the wide fields. The country was still with\r\nthat deep rural stillness which seems to mean the absence of humanity.\r\nOnly the thrushes were singing far away in the walnut woods beyond the\r\norchard, and some crows were flying over and cawed once loudly, as if\r\nthey were speaking to the women at the door.\r\n\r\nJust as the friends were parting, after most grateful acknowledgments\r\nfrom Sarah Ellen Dow, some one came driving along the road in a hurry\r\nand stopped.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that with you, Mis\' Crane?" called one of their near neighbors.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Sarah Ellen Dow," answered Mrs. Crane. "What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I thought so, but I couldn\'t rightly see. Come, they are in a peck o\'\r\ntrouble up to Sister Barsett\'s, wonderin\' where you be," grumbled the\r\nman. "They can\'t do nothin\' with her; she\'s drove off everybody an\'\r\nkeeps a-screechin\' for you. Come, step along, Sarah Ellen, do!"\r\n\r\n"Sister Barsett!" exclaimed both the women. Mercy Crane sank down upon\r\nthe doorstep, but Sarah Ellen stepped out upon the grass all of a\r\ntremble, and went toward the wagon. "They said this afternoon that\r\nSister Barsett was gone," she managed to say. "What did they mean?"\r\n\r\n"Gone where?" asked the impatient neighbor. "I expect \'twas one of her\r\nspells. She\'s come to; they say she wants somethin\' hearty for her\r\ntea. Nobody can\'t take one step till you get there, neither."\r\n\r\nSarah Ellen was still dazed; she returned to the doorway, where Mercy\r\nCrane sat shaking with laughter. "I don\'t know but we might as well\r\nlaugh as cry," she said in an aimless sort of way. "I know you too\r\nwell to think you\'re going to repeat a single word. Well, I\'ll get my\r\nbonnet an\' start; I expect I\'ve got considerable to cope with, but I\'m\r\nwell rested. Good-night, Mis\' Crane, I certain did have a beautiful\r\ntea, whatever the future may have in store."\r\n\r\nShe wore a solemn expression as she mounted into the wagon in haste\r\nand departed, but she was far out of sight when Mercy Crane stopped\r\nlaughing and went into the house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecoration Day\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA week before the thirtieth of May, three friends--John Stover and\r\nHenry Merrill and Asa Brown--happened to meet on Saturday evening at\r\nBarton\'s store at the Plains. They were ready to enjoy this idle hour\r\nafter a busy week. After long easterly rains, the sun had at last come\r\nout bright and clear, and all the Barlow farmers had been planting.\r\nThere was even a good deal of ploughing left to be done, the season\r\nwas so backward.\r\n\r\nThe three middle-aged men were old friends. They had been\r\nschool-fellows, and when they were hardly out of their boyhood the war\r\ncame on, and they enlisted in the same company, on the same day, and\r\nhappened to march away elbow to elbow. Then came the great experience\r\nof a great war, and the years that followed their return from the\r\nSouth had come to each almost alike. These men might have been members\r\nof the same rustic household, they knew each other\'s history so well.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting on a low wooden bench at the left of the store door\r\nas you went in. People were coming and going on their Saturday night\r\nerrands,--the post-office was in Barton\'s store,--but the friends\r\ntalked on eagerly, without being interrupted, except by an occasional\r\nnod of recognition. They appeared to take no notice at all of the\r\nneighbors whom they saw oftenest. It was a most beautiful evening; the\r\ntwo great elms were almost half in leaf over the blacksmith\'s shop\r\nwhich stood across the wide road. Farther along were two small\r\nold-fashioned houses and the old white church, with its pretty belfry\r\nof four arched sides and a tiny dome at the top. The large cockerel on\r\nthe vane was pointing a little south of west, and there was still\r\nlight enough to make it shine bravely against the deep blue eastern\r\nsky. On the western side of the road, near the store, were the\r\nparsonage and the storekeeper\'s modern house, which had a French roof\r\nand some attempt at decoration, which the long-established Barlow\r\npeople called gingerbread-work, and regarded with mingled pride and\r\ndisdain. These buildings made the tiny village called Barlow Plains.\r\nThey stood in the middle of a long narrow strip of level ground. They\r\nwere islanded by green fields and pastures. There were hills beyond;\r\nthe mountains themselves seemed very near. Scattered about on the hill\r\nslopes were farmhouses, which stood so far apart, with their clusters\r\nof out-buildings, that each looked lonely, and the pine woods above\r\nseemed to besiege them all. It was lighter on the uplands than it was\r\nin the valley, where the three men sat on their bench, with their\r\nbacks to the store and the western sky.\r\n\r\n"Well, here we be \'most into June, an\' I \'ain\'t got a bush-bean above\r\nground," lamented Henry Merrill.\r\n\r\n"Your land\'s always late, ain\'t it? But you always catch up with the\r\nrest on us," Asa Brown consoled him. "I\'ve often observed that your\r\nland, though early planted, was late to sprout. I view it there\'s a\r\ngood week\'s difference betwixt me an\' Stover an\' your folks, but come\r\nfirst o\' July we all even up."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis just so," said John Stover, taking his pipe out of his mouth, as\r\nif he had a good deal more to say, and then replacing it, as if he had\r\nchanged his mind.\r\n\r\n"Made it extry hard having that long wet spell. Can\'t none on us take\r\nno day off this season," said Asa Brown; but nobody thought it worth\r\nhis while to respond to such evident truth.\r\n\r\n"Next Saturday\'ll be the thirtieth o\' May--that\'s Decoration Day,\r\nain\'t it?--come round again. Lord! how the years slip by after you git\r\nto be forty-five an\' along there!" said Asa again. "I s\'pose some o\'\r\nour folks\'ll go over to Alton to see the procession, same\'s usual.\r\nI\'ve got to git one o\' them small flags to stick on our Joel\'s grave,\r\nan\' Mis\' Dexter always counts on havin\' some for Harrison\'s lot. I\r\ncalculate to get \'em somehow. I must make time to ride over, but I\r\ndon\'t know where the time\'s comin\' from out o\' next week. I wish the\r\nwomen folks would tend to them things. There\'s the spot where Eb\r\nMunson an\' John Tighe lays in the poor-farm lot, an\' I did mean\r\ncertain to buy flags for \'em last year an\' year before, but I went an\'\r\nforgot it. I\'d like to have folks that rode by notice \'em for once, if\r\nthey was town paupers. Eb Munson was as darin\' a man as ever stepped\r\nout to tuck o\' drum."\r\n\r\n"So he was," said John Stover, taking his pipe with decision and\r\nknocking out the ashes. "Drink was his ruin; but I wan\'t one that\r\ncould be harsh with Eb, no matter what he done. He worked hard long\'s\r\nhe could, too; but he wan\'t like a sound man, an\' I think he took\r\nsomethin\' first not so much \'cause he loved it, but to kind of keep\r\nhis strength up so\'s he could work, an\' then, all of a sudden, rum\r\nclinched with him an\' threw him. Eb was talkin\' \'long o\' me one day\r\nwhen he was about half full, an\' says he, right out, \'I wouldn\'t have\r\nfell to this state,\' says he, \'if I\'d had me a home an\' a little\r\nfam\'ly; but it don\'t make no difference to nobody, and it\'s the best\r\ncomfort I seem to have, an\' I ain\'t goin\' to do without it. I\'m ailin\'\r\nall the time,\' says he, \'an\' if I keep middlin\' full, I make out to\r\nhold my own an\' to keep along o\' my work.\' I pitied Eb. I says to him,\r\n\'You ain\'t goin\' to bring no disgrace on us old army boys, be you,\r\nEb?\' an\' he says no, he wan\'t. I think if he\'d lived to get one o\'\r\nthem big fat pensions, he\'d had it easier. Eight dollars a month paid\r\nhis board, while he\'d pick up what cheap work he could, an\' then he\r\ngot so that decent folks didn\'t seem to want the bother of him, an\' so\r\nhe come on the town."\r\n\r\n"There was somethin\' else to it," said Henry Merrill soberly. "Drink\r\ncome natural to him, \'twas born in him, I expect, an\' there wan\'t\r\nnobody that could turn the divil out same\'s they did in Scriptur\'. His\r\nfather an\' his gran\'father was drinkin\' men; but they was kind-hearted\r\nan\' good neighbors, an\' never set out to wrong nobody. \'Twas the\r\ncustom to drink in their day; folks was colder an\' lived poorer in\r\nearly times, an\' that\'s how most of \'em kept a-goin\'. But what stove\r\nEb all up was his disapp\'intment with Marthy Peck--her forsakin\' of\r\nhim an\' marryin\' old John Down whilst Eb was off to war. I\'ve always\r\nlaid it up ag\'inst her."\r\n\r\n"So\'ve I," said Asa Brown. "She didn\'t use the poor fellow right. I\r\nguess she was full as well off, but it\'s one thing to show judgment,\r\nan\' another thing to have heart."\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause; the subject was too familiar to need further\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no public sperit here in Barlow," announced Asa Brown,\r\nwith decision. "I don\'t s\'pose we could ever get up anything for\r\nDecoration Day. I\'ve felt kind of \'shamed, but it always comes in a\r\nbusy time; \'twan\'t no time to have it, anyway, right in late\r\nplantin\'."\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t no use to look for public sperit \'less you\'ve got some\r\nyourself," observed John Stover soberly; but something had pleased him\r\nin the discouraged suggestion. "Perhaps we could mark the day this\r\nyear. It comes on a Saturday; that ain\'t nigh so bad as bein\' in the\r\nmiddle of the week."\r\n\r\nNobody made any answer, and presently he went on,--\r\n\r\n"There was a time along back when folks was too nigh the war-time to\r\ngive much thought to the bigness of it. The best fellows was them that\r\nhad stayed to home an\' worked their trades an\' laid up money; but I\r\ndon\'t know\'s it\'s so now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, the fellows that stayed at home got all the fat places, an\' when\r\nwe come back we felt dreadful behind the times," grumbled Asa Brown.\r\n"I remember how \'twas."\r\n\r\n"They begun to call us heroes an\' old stick-in-the-mud just about the\r\nsame time," resumed Stover, with a chuckle. "We wa\'n\'t no hand for\r\nstrippin\' woodland nor even tradin\' hosses them first few years. I\r\ndon\' know why \'twas we were so beat out. The best most on us could do\r\nwas to sag right on to the old folks. Father he never wanted me to go\r\nto the war,--\'twas partly his Quaker breed,--an\' he used to be\r\ndreadful mortified with the way I hung round down here to the store\r\nan\' loafed round a-talkin\' about when I was out South, an\' arguin\'\r\nwith folks that didn\'t know nothin\', about what the generals done.\r\nThere! I see me now just as he see me then; but after I had my\r\nboy-strut out, I took holt o\' the old farm \'long o\' father, an\' I\'ve\r\nmade it bounce. Look at them old meadows an\' see the herd\'s grass that\r\ncome off of \'em last year! I ain\'t ashamed o\' my place now, if I did\r\ngo to the war."\r\n\r\n"It all looks a sight bigger to me now than it did then," said Henry\r\nMerrill. "Our goin\' to the war, I refer to. We didn\'t sense it no more\r\nthan other folks did. I used to be sick o\' hearin\' their stuff about\r\npatriotism and lovin\' your country, an\' them pieces o\' poetry women\r\nfolks wrote for the papers on the old flag, an\' our fallen heroes, an\'\r\nthem things; they didn\'t seem to strike me in the right place; but I\r\ntell ye it kind o\' starts me now every time I come on the flag\r\nsudden,--it does so. A spell ago--\'long in the fall, I guess it was--I\r\nwas over to Alton, an\' there was a fire company paradin\'. They\'d got\r\nthe prize at a fair, an\' had just come home on the cars, an\' I heard\r\nthe band; so I stepped to the front o\' the store where me an\' my woman\r\nwas tradin\', an\' the company felt well, an\' was comin\' along the\r\nstreet \'most as good as troops. I see the old flag a-comin\', kind of\r\nblowin\' back, an\' it went all over me. Somethin\' worked round in my\r\nthroat; I vow I come near cryin\'. I was glad nobody see me."\r\n\r\n"I\'d go to war again in a minute," declared Stover, after an\r\nexpressive pause; "but I expect we should know better what we was\r\nabout. I don\' know but we\'ve got too many rooted opinions now to make\r\nus the best o\' soldiers."\r\n\r\n"Martin Tighe an\' John Tighe was considerable older than the rest, and\r\nthey done well," answered Henry Merrill quickly. "We three was the\r\nyoungest of any, but we did think at the time we knew the most."\r\n\r\n"Well, whatever you may say, that war give the country a great start,"\r\nsaid Asa Brown. "I tell ye we just begin to see the scope on\'t. There\r\nwas my cousin, you know, Dan\'l Evins, that stopped with us last\r\nwinter; he was tellin\' me that one o\' his coastin\' trips he was into\r\nthe port o\' Beaufort lo\'din\' with yaller-pine lumber, an\' he roved\r\ninto an old buryin\'-ground there is there, an\' he see a stone that had\r\non it some young Southern fellow\'s name that was killed in the war,\r\nan\' under it was, \'He died for his country.\' Dan\'l knowed how I used\r\nto feel about them South Car\'lina goings on, an\' I did feel kind o\'\r\nred an\' ugly for a minute, an\' then somethin\' come over me, an\' I\r\nsays, \'Well, I don\' know but what the poor chap did, Dan Evins, when\r\nyou come to view it all round.\'"\r\n\r\nThe other men made no answer.\r\n\r\n"Le\'s see what we can do this year. I don\'t care if we be a poor\r\nhan\'ful," urged Henry Merrill. "The young folks ought to have the\r\ngood of it; I\'d like to have my boys see somethin\' different. Le\'s get\r\ntogether what men there is. How many\'s left, anyhow? I know there was\r\nthirty-seven went from old Barlow, three-months\' men an\' all."\r\n\r\n"There can\'t be over eight now, countin\' out Martin Tighe; he can\'t\r\nmarch," said Stover. "No, \'tain\'t worth while." But the others did not\r\nnotice his disapproval.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nine in all," announced Asa Brown, after pondering and\r\ncounting two or three times on his fingers. "I can\'t make us no more.\r\nI never could carry figur\'s in my head."\r\n\r\n"I make nine," said Merrill. "We\'ll have Martin ride, an\' Jesse Dean\r\ntoo, if he will. He\'s awful lively on them canes o\' his. An\' there\'s\r\nJo Wade with his crutch; he\'s amazin\' spry for a short distance. But\r\nwe can\'t let \'em go far afoot; they\'re decripped men. We\'ll make \'em\r\nall put on what they\'ve got left o\' their uniforms, an\' we\'ll scratch\r\nround an\' have us a fife an\' drum, an\' make the best show we can."\r\n\r\n"Why, Martin Tighe\'s boy, the next to the oldest, is an excellent hand\r\nto play the fife!" said John Stover, suddenly growing enthusiastic.\r\n"If you two are set on it, let\'s have a word with the minister\r\nto-morrow, an\' see what he says. Perhaps he\'ll give out some kind of a\r\nnotice. You have to have a good many bunches o\' flowers. I guess we\'d\r\nbetter call a meetin\', some few on us, an\' talk it over first o\' the\r\nweek. \'Twouldn\'t be no great of a range for us to take to march from\r\nthe old buryin\'-ground at the meetin\'-house here up to the poor-farm\r\nan\' round by Deacon Elwell\'s lane, so\'s to notice them two stones he\r\nset up for his boys that was sunk on the man-o\'-war. I expect they\r\nnotice stones same\'s if the folks laid there, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\nHe spoke wistfully. The others knew that Stover was thinking of the\r\nstone he had set up to the memory of his only brother, whose nameless\r\ngrave had been made somewhere in the Wilderness.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know but what they\'ll be mad if we don\'t go by every house in\r\ntown," he added anxiously, as they rose to go home. "\'Tis a terrible\r\nscattered population in Barlow to favor with a procession."\r\n\r\nIt was a mild starlit night. The three friends took their separate\r\nways presently, leaving the Plains road and crossing the fields by\r\nfoot-paths toward their farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe week went by, and the next Saturday morning brought fair weather.\r\nIt was a busy morning on the farms--like any other; but long before\r\nnoon the teams of horses and oxen were seen going home from work in\r\nthe fields, and everybody got ready in haste for the great event of\r\nthe afternoon. It was so seldom that any occasion roused public\r\ninterest in Barlow that there was an unexpected response, and the\r\ngreen before the old white meeting-house was covered with country\r\nwagons and groups of people, whole families together, who had come on\r\nfoot. The old soldiers were to meet in the church; at half past one\r\nthe procession was to start, and on its return the minister was to\r\nmake an address in the old burying-ground. John Stover had been first\r\nlieutenant in the war, so he was made captain of the day. A man from\r\nthe next town had offered to drum for them, and Martin Tighe\'s proud\r\nboy was present with his fife. He had a great longing--strange enough\r\nin that peaceful, sheep-raising neighborhood--to go into the army; but\r\nhe and his elder brother were the mainstay of their crippled father,\r\nand he could not be spared from the large household until a younger\r\nbrother could take his place; so that all his fire and military zeal\r\nwent for the present into martial tunes, and the fife was a\r\nsafety-valve for his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe army men were used to seeing each other; everybody knew everybody\r\nin the little country town of Barlow; but when one comrade after\r\nanother appeared in what remained of his accoutrements, they felt the\r\nday to be greater than they had planned, and the simple ceremony\r\nproved more solemn than any one expected. They could make no use of\r\ntheir every-day jokes and friendly greetings. Their old blue coats\r\nand tarnished army caps looked faded and antiquated enough. One of\r\nthe men had nothing left but his rusty canteen and rifle; but these he\r\ncarried like sacred emblems. He had worn out all his army clothes long\r\nago, because he was too poor when he was discharged to buy any others.\r\n\r\nWhen the door of the church opened, the veterans were not abashed by\r\nthe size and silence of the crowd. They came walking two by two down\r\nthe steps, and took their places in line as if there were nobody\r\nlooking on. Their brief evolutions were like a mystic rite. The two\r\nlame men refused to do anything but march as best they could; but poor\r\nMartin Tighe, more disabled than they, was brought out and lifted into\r\nHenry Merrill\'s best wagon, where he sat up, straight and soldierly,\r\nwith his boy for driver. There was a little flag in the whip-socket\r\nbefore him, which flapped gayly in the breeze. It was such a long time\r\nsince he had been seen out-of-doors that everybody found him a great\r\nobject of interest, and paid him much attention. Even those who were\r\ntired of being asked to contribute to his support, who resented the\r\nfact of his having a helpless wife and great family; who always\r\ninsisted that with his little pension and hopeless lameness, his\r\nfingerless left hand and failing sight, he could support himself and\r\nhis household if he chose,--even those persons came forward now to\r\ngreet him handsomely and with large approval. To be sure, he enjoyed\r\nthe conversation of idlers, and his wife had a complaining way that\r\nwas the same as begging, especially since her boys began to grow up\r\nand be of some use; and there were one or two near neighbors who never\r\nlet them really want; so other people, who had cares enough of their\r\nown, could excuse themselves for forgetting him the year round, and\r\neven call him shiftless. But there were none to look askance at Martin\r\nTighe on Decoration Day, as he sat in the wagon, with his bleached\r\nface like a captive\'s, and his thin, afflicted body. He stretched out\r\nhis whole hand impartially to those who had remembered and those who\r\nhad forgotten both his courage at Fredericksburg and his sorry need in\r\nBarlow.\r\n\r\nHenry Merrill had secured the engine company\'s large flag in Alton,\r\nand now carried it proudly. There were eight men in line, two by two,\r\nand marching a good bit apart, to make their line the longer. The fife\r\nand drum struck up gallantly together, and the little procession moved\r\naway slowly along the country road. It gave an unwonted touch of color\r\nto the landscape,--the scarlet, the blue, between the new-ploughed\r\nfields and budding roadside thickets, between the wide dim ranges of\r\nthe mountains, under the great white clouds of the spring sky. Such\r\nprocessions grow more pathetic year by year; it will not be so long\r\nnow before wondering children will have seen the last. The aging faces\r\nof the men, the renewed comradeship, the quick beat of the hearts that\r\nremember, the tenderness of those who think upon old sorrows,--all\r\nthese make the day a lovelier and a sadder festival. So men\'s hearts\r\nwere stirred, they knew not why, when they heard the shrill fife and\r\nthe incessant drum along the quiet Barlow road, and saw the handful of\r\nold soldiers marching by. Nobody thought of them as familiar men and\r\nneighbors alone,--they were a part of that army which had saved its\r\ncountry. They had taken their lives in their hands and gone out to\r\nfight for their country, plain John Stover and Jesse Dean and the\r\nrest. No matter if every other day in the year they counted for little\r\nor much, whether they were lame-footed and lagging, whether their\r\nfarms were of poor soil or rich.\r\n\r\nThe little troop went in slender line along the road; the crowded\r\ncountry wagons and all the people who went afoot followed Martin\r\nTighe\'s wagon as if it were a great gathering at a country funeral.\r\nThe route was short, and the long, straggling line marched slowly; it\r\ncould go no faster than the lame men could walk.\r\n\r\nIn one of the houses by the roadside an old woman sat by a window, in\r\nan old-fashioned black gown, and clean white cap with a prim border\r\nwhich bound her thin, sharp features closely. She had been for a long\r\ntime looking out eagerly over the snowberry and cinnamon-rose bushes;\r\nher face was pressed close to the pane, and presently she caught sight\r\nof the great flag as it came down the road.\r\n\r\n"Let me see \'em! I\'ve got to see \'em go by!" she pleaded, trying to\r\nrise from her chair alone when she heard the fife, and the women\r\nhelped her to the door, and held her so that she could stand and wait.\r\nShe had been an old woman when the war began; she had sent sons and\r\ngrandsons to the field; they were all gone now. As the men came by,\r\nshe straightened her bent figure with all the vigor of youth. The fife\r\nand drum stopped suddenly; the colors lowered. She did not heed that,\r\nbut her old eyes flashed and then filled with tears to see the flag\r\ngoing to salute the soldiers\' graves. "Thank ye, boys; thank ye!" she\r\ncried, in her quavering voice, and they all cheered her. The cheer\r\nwent back along the straggling line for old Grandmother Dexter,\r\nstanding there in her front door between the lilacs. It was one of the\r\ngreat moments of the day.\r\n\r\nThe few old people at the poor-house, too, were waiting to see the\r\nshow. The keeper\'s young son, knowing that it was a day of festivity,\r\nand not understanding exactly why, had put his toy flag out of the\r\ngable window, and there it showed against the gray clapboards like a\r\ngay flower. It was the only bit of decoration along the veterans\' way,\r\nand they stopped and saluted it before they broke ranks and went out\r\nto the field corner beyond the poor-farm barn to the bit of ground\r\nthat held the paupers\' unmarked graves. There was a solemn silence\r\nwhile Asa Brown went to the back of Tighe\'s wagon, where such light\r\nfreight was carried, and brought two flags, and he and John Stover\r\nplanted them straight in the green sod. They knew well enough where\r\nthe right graves were, for these had been made in a corner by\r\nthemselves, with unwonted sentiment. And so Eben Munson and John Tighe\r\nwere honored like the rest, both by their flags and by great and\r\nunexpected nosegays of spring flowers, daffies and flowering currant\r\nand red tulips, which lay on the graves already. John Stover and his\r\ncomrade glanced at each other curiously while they stood singing, and\r\nthen laid their own bunches of lilacs down and came away.\r\n\r\nThen something happened that almost none of the people in the wagons\r\nunderstood. Martin Tighe\'s boy, who played the fife, had studied well\r\nhis part, and on his poor short-winded instrument now sounded taps as\r\nwell as he could. He had heard it done once in Alton at a soldier\'s\r\nfuneral. The plaintive notes called sadly over the fields, and echoed\r\nback from the hills. The few veterans could not look at each other;\r\ntheir eyes brimmed up with tears; they could not have spoken. Nothing\r\ncalled back old army days like that. They had a sudden vision of the\r\nVirginian camp, the hillside dotted white with tents, the twinkling\r\nlights in other camps, and far away the glow of smouldering fires.\r\nThey heard the bugle call from post to post; they remembered the\r\nchilly winter night, the wind in the pines, the laughter of the men.\r\nLights out! Martin Tighe\'s boy sounded it again sharply. It seemed as\r\nif poor Eb Munson and John Tighe must hear it too in their narrow\r\ngraves.\r\n\r\nThe procession went on, and stopped here and there at the little\r\ngraveyards on the farms, leaving their bright flags to flutter through\r\nsummer and winter rains and snows, and to bleach in the wind and\r\nsunshine. When they returned to the church, the minister made an\r\naddress about the war, and every one listened with new ears. Most of\r\nwhat he said was familiar enough to his listeners; they were used to\r\nreading those phrases about the results of the war, the glorious\r\nfuture of the South, in their weekly newspapers; but there never had\r\nbeen such a spirit of patriotism and loyalty waked in Barlow as was\r\nwaked that day by the poor parade of the remnant of the Barlow\r\nsoldiers. They sent flags to all the distant graves, and proud were\r\nthose households who claimed kinship with valor, and could drive or\r\nwalk away with their flags held up so that others could see that they,\r\ntoo, were of the elect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt is well that the days are long in the last of May, but John Stover\r\nhad to hurry more than usual with his evening work, and then, having\r\nthe longest distance to walk, he was much the latest comer to the\r\nPlains store, where his two triumphant friends were waiting for him\r\nimpatiently on the bench. They also had made excuse of going to the\r\npost-office and doing an unnecessary errand for their wives, and were\r\ntalking together so busily that they had gathered a group about them\r\nbefore the store. When they saw Stover coming, they rose hastily and\r\ncrossed the road to meet him, as if they were a committee in special\r\nsession. They leaned against the post-and-board fence, after they had\r\nshaken hands with each other solemnly.\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve had a great day, ain\'t we, John?" asked Henry Merrill.\r\n"You did lead off splendid. We\'ve done a grand thing, now, I tell you.\r\nAll the folks say we\'ve got to keep it up every year. Everybody had to\r\nhave a talk about it as I went home. They say they had no idea we\r\nshould make such a show. Lord! I wish we\'d begun while there was more\r\nof us!"\r\n\r\n"That han\'some flag was the great feature," said Asa Brown generously.\r\n"I want to pay my part for hirin\' it. An\' then folks was glad to see\r\npoor old Martin made o\' some consequence."\r\n\r\n"There was half a dozen said to me that another year they was goin\' to\r\nhave flags out, and trim up their places somehow or \'nother. Folks has\r\nfeelin\' enough, but you\'ve got to rouse it," said Merrill.\r\n\r\n"I have thought o\' joinin\' the Grand Army over to Alton time an\'\r\nagain, but it\'s a good ways to go, an\' then the expense has been o\'\r\nsome consideration," Asa continued. "I don\'t know but two or three\r\nover there. You know, most o\' the Alton men nat\'rally went out in the\r\nrigiments t\' other side o\' the State line, an\' they was in other\r\nbattles, an\' never camped nowheres nigh us. Seems to me we ought to\r\nhave home feelin\' enough to do what we can right here."\r\n\r\n"The minister says to me this afternoon that he was goin\' to arrange\r\nan\' have some talks in the meetin\'-house next winter, an\' have some of\r\nus tell where we was in the South; an\' one night \'twill be about camp\r\nlife, an\' one about the long marches, an\' then about the\r\nbattles,--that would take some time,--an\' tell all we could about the\r\nboys that was killed, an\' their record, so they wouldn\'t be forgot. He\r\nsaid some of the folks must have the letters we wrote home from the\r\nfront, an\' we could make out quite a history of us. I call Elder\r\nDallas a very smart man; he\'d planned it all out a\'ready, for the\r\nbenefit o\' the young folks, he said," announced Henry Merrill, in a\r\ntone of approval.\r\n\r\n"I s\'pose there ain\'t none of us but could add a little somethin\',"\r\nanswered John Stover modestly. "\'Twould re\'lly learn the young folks\r\na good deal. I should be scared numb to try an\' speak from the pulpit.\r\nThat ain\'t what the Elder means, is it? Now I was one that had a good\r\nchance to see somethin\' o\' Washin\'ton. I shook hands with President\r\nLincoln, an\' I always think I\'m worth lookin\' at for that, if I ain\'t\r\nfor nothin\' else. \'Twas that time I was just out o\' hospit\'l, an\' able\r\nto crawl about some. I\'ve often told you how \'twas I met him, an\' he\r\nstopped an\' shook hands an\' asked where I\'d been at the front an\' how\r\nI was gettin\' along with my hurts. Well, we\'ll see how \'tis when\r\nwinter comes. I never thought I had no gift for public speakin\', \'less\r\n\'twas for drivin\' cattle or pollin\' the house town-meetin\' days. Here!\r\nI\'ve got somethin\' in mind. You needn\'t speak about it if I tell it to\r\nye," he added suddenly. "You know all them han\'some flowers that was\r\nlaid on to Eb Munson\'s grave an\' Tighe\'s? I mistrusted you thought the\r\nsame thing I did by the way you looked. They come from Marthy Down\'s\r\nfront yard. My woman told me when we got home that she knew \'em in a\r\nminute; there wa\'n\'t nobody in town had that kind o\' red flowers but\r\nher. She must ha\' kind o\' harked back to the days when she was Marthy\r\nPeck. She must have come over with \'em after dark, or else dreadful\r\nearly in the mornin\'."\r\n\r\nHenry Merrill cleared his throat. "There ain\'t nothin\' half-way \'bout\r\nMis\' Down," he said. "I wouldn\'t ha\' spoken \'bout this \'less you had\r\nled right on to it; but I overtook her when I was gittin\' towards home\r\nthis afternoon, an\' I see by her looks she was worked up a good deal;\r\nbut we talked about how well things had gone off, an\' she wanted to\r\nknow what expenses we\'d been put to, an\' I told her; and she said\r\nshe\'d give five dollars any day I\'d stop in for it. An\' then she spoke\r\nright out. \'I\'m alone in the world,\' says she, \'and I\'ve got somethin\'\r\nto do with, an\' I\'d like to have a plain stone put up to Eb Munson\'s\r\ngrave, with the number of his rigiment on it, an\' I\'ll pay the bill.\r\n\'Tain\'t out o\' Mr. Down\'s money,\' she says; \'\'tis mine, an\' I want you\r\nto see to it.\' I said I would, but we\'d made a plot to git some o\'\r\nthem soldiers\' headstones that\'s provided by the government. \'Twas a\r\nshame it had been overlooked so long. \'No,\' says she; \'I\'m goin\' to\r\npay for Eb\'s myself.\' An\' I told her there wouldn\'t be no objection.\r\nDon\'t ary one o\' you speak about it. \'Twouldn\'t be fair. She was real\r\nwell-appearin\'. I never felt to respect Marthy so before."\r\n\r\n"We was kind o\' hard on her sometimes, but folks couldn\'t help it.\r\nI\'ve seen her pass Eb right by in the road an\' never look at him when\r\nhe first come home," said John Stover.\r\n\r\n"If she hadn\'t felt bad, she wouldn\'t have cared one way or t\'other,"\r\ninsisted Henry Merrill. "\'Tain\'t for us to judge. Sometimes folks has\r\nto get along in years before they see things fair. Come; I must be\r\ngoin\' home. I\'m tired as an old dog."\r\n\r\n"It seemed kind o\' natural to be steppin\' out together again. Strange\r\nwe three got through with so little damage, an\' so many dropped round\r\nus," said Asa Brown. "I\'ve never been one mite sorry I went out in old\r\nA Company. I was thinkin\' when I was marchin\' to-day, though, that we\r\nshould all have to take to the wagons before long an\' do our marchin\'\r\non wheels, so many of us felt kind o\' stiff. There\'s one thing,--folks\r\nwon\'t never say again that we can\'t show no public sperit here in old\r\nBarlow."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flight of Betsey Lane\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOne windy morning in May, three old women sat together near an open\r\nwindow in the shed chamber of Byfleet Poor-house. The wind was from\r\nthe northwest, but their window faced the southeast, and they were\r\nonly visited by an occasional pleasant waft of fresh air. They were\r\nclose together, knee to knee, picking over a bushel of beans, and\r\ncommanding a view of the dandelion-starred, green yard below, and of\r\nthe winding, sandy road that led to the village, two miles away. Some\r\ncaptive bees were scolding among the cobwebs of the rafters overhead,\r\nor thumping against the upper panes of glass; two calves were bawling\r\nfrom the barnyard, where some of the men were at work loading a\r\ndump-cart and shouting as if every one were deaf. There was a\r\ncheerful feeling of activity, and even an air of comfort, about the\r\nByfleet Poor-house. Almost every one was possessed of a most\r\ninteresting past, though there was less to be said about the future.\r\nThe inmates were by no means distressed or unhappy; many of them\r\nretired to this shelter only for the winter season, and would go out\r\npresently, some to begin such work as they could still do, others to\r\nlive in their own small houses; old age had impoverished most of them\r\nby limiting their power of endurance; but far from lamenting the fact\r\nthat they were town charges, they rather liked the change and\r\nexcitement of a winter residence on the poor-farm. There was a\r\nsharp-faced, hard-worked young widow with seven children, who was an\r\nexception to the general level of society, because she deplored the\r\nchange in her fortunes. The older women regarded her with suspicion,\r\nand were apt to talk about her in moments like this, when they\r\nhappened to sit together at their work.\r\n\r\nThe three bean-pickers were dressed alike in stout brown ginghams,\r\nchecked by a white line, and all wore great faded aprons of blue\r\ndrilling, with sufficient pockets convenient to the right hand. Miss\r\nPeggy Bond was a very small, belligerent-looking person, who wore a\r\nhuge pair of steel-bowed spectacles, holding her sharp chin well up in\r\nair, as if to supplement an inadequate nose. She was more than half\r\nblind, but the spectacles seemed to face upward instead of square\r\nahead, as if their wearer were always on the sharp lookout for birds.\r\nMiss Bond had suffered much personal damage from time to time, because\r\nshe never took heed where she planted her feet, and so was always\r\ntripping and stubbing her bruised way through the world. She had\r\nfallen down hatchways and cellarways, and stepped composedly into deep\r\nditches and pasture brooks; but she was proud of stating that she was\r\nupsighted, and so was her father before her. At the poor-house, where\r\nan unusual malady was considered a distinction, upsightedness was\r\nlooked upon as a most honorable infirmity. Plain rheumatism, such as\r\nafflicted Aunt Lavina Dow, whose twisted hands found even this light\r\nwork difficult and tiresome,--plain rheumatism was something of\r\nevery-day occurrence, and nobody cared to hear about it. Poor Peggy\r\nwas a meek and friendly soul, who never put herself forward; she was\r\njust like other folks, as she always loved to say, but Mrs. Lavina Dow\r\nwas a different sort of person altogether, of great dignity and,\r\noccasionally, almost aggressive behavior. The time had been when she\r\ncould do a good day\'s work with anybody: but for many years now she\r\nhad not left the town-farm, being too badly crippled to work; she had\r\nno relations or friends to visit, but from an innate love of authority\r\nshe could not submit to being one of those who are forgotten by the\r\nworld. Mrs. Dow was the hostess and social lawgiver here, where she\r\nremembered every inmate and every item of interest for nearly forty\r\nyears, besides an immense amount of town history and biography for\r\nthree or four generations back.\r\n\r\nShe was the dear friend of the third woman, Betsey Lane; together they\r\nled thought and opinion--chiefly opinion--and held sway, not only over\r\nByfleet Poor-farm, but also the selectmen and all others in authority.\r\nBetsey Lane had spent most of her life as aid-in-general to the\r\nrespected household of old General Thornton. She had been much trusted\r\nand valued, and, at the breaking up of that once large and flourishing\r\nfamily, she had been left in good circumstances, what with legacies\r\nand her own comfortable savings; but by sad misfortune and lavish\r\ngenerosity everything had been scattered, and after much illness,\r\nwhich ended in a stiffened arm and more uncertainty, the good soul had\r\nsensibly decided that it was easier for the whole town to support her\r\nthan for a part of it. She had always hoped to see something of the\r\nworld before she died; she came of an adventurous, seafaring stock,\r\nbut had never made a longer journey than to the towns of Danby and\r\nNorthville, thirty miles away.\r\n\r\nThey were all old women; but Betsey Lane, who was sixty-nine, and\r\nlooked much older, was the youngest. Peggy Bond was far on in the\r\nseventies, and Mrs. Dow was at least ten years older. She made a great\r\nsecret of her years; and as she sometimes spoke of events prior to the\r\nRevolution with the assertion of having been an eye-witness, she\r\nnaturally wore an air of vast antiquity. Her tales were an\r\ninexpressible delight to Betsey Lane, who felt younger by twenty years\r\nbecause her friend and comrade was so unconscious of chronological\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\nThe bushel basket of cranberry beans was within easy reach, and each\r\nof the pickers had filled her lap from it again and again. The shed\r\nchamber was not an unpleasant place in which to sit at work, with its\r\ntraces of seed corn hanging from the brown cross-beams, its spare\r\nchurns, and dusty loom, and rickety wool-wheels, and a few bits of old\r\nfurniture. In one far corner was a wide board of dismal use and\r\nsuggestion, and close beside it an old cradle. There was a battered\r\nchest of drawers where the keeper of the poor-house kept his\r\ngarden-seeds, with the withered remains of three seed cucumbers\r\nornamenting the top. Nothing beautiful could be discovered, nothing\r\ninteresting, but there was something usable and homely about the\r\nplace. It was the favorite and untroubled bower of the bean-pickers,\r\nto which they might retreat unmolested from the public apartments of\r\nthis rustic institution.\r\n\r\nBetsey Lane blew away the chaff from her handful of beans. The spring\r\nbreeze blew the chaff back again, and sifted it over her face and\r\nshoulders. She rubbed it out of her eyes impatiently, and happened to\r\nnotice old Peggy holding her own handful high, as if it were an\r\noblation, and turning her queer, up-tilted head this way and that, to\r\nlook at the beans sharply, as if she were first cousin to a hen.\r\n\r\n"There, Miss Bond, \'tis kind of botherin\' work for you, ain\'t it?"\r\nBetsey inquired compassionately.\r\n\r\n"I feel to enjoy it, anything that I can do my own way so," responded\r\nPeggy. "I like to do my part. Ain\'t that old Mis\' Fales comin\' up the\r\nroad? It sounds like her step."\r\n\r\nThe others looked, but they were not far-sighted, and for a moment\r\nPeggy had the advantage. Mrs. Fales was not a favorite.\r\n\r\n"I hope she ain\'t comin\' here to put up this spring. I guess she won\'t\r\nnow, it\'s gettin\' so late," said Betsey Lane. "She likes to go rovin\'\r\nsoon as the roads is settled."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis Mis\' Fales!" said Peggy Bond, listening with solemn anxiety.\r\n"There, do let\'s pray her by!"\r\n\r\n"I guess she\'s headin\' for her cousin\'s folks up Beech Hill way," said\r\nBetsey presently. "If she\'d left her daughter\'s this mornin\', she\'d\r\nhave got just about as far as this. I kind o\' wish she had stepped in\r\njust to pass the time o\' day, long\'s she wa\'n\'t going to make no\r\nstop."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence as to further speech in the shed chamber; and even\r\nthe calves were quiet in the barnyard. The men had all gone away to\r\nthe field where corn-planting was going on. The beans clicked steadily\r\ninto the wooden measure at the pickers\' feet. Betsey Lane began to\r\nsing a hymn, and the others joined in as best they might, like\r\nautumnal crickets; their voices were sharp and cracked, with now and\r\nthen a few low notes of plaintive tone. Betsey herself could sing\r\npretty well, but the others could only make a kind of accompaniment.\r\nTheir voices ceased altogether at the higher notes.\r\n\r\n"Oh my! I wish I had the means to go to the Centennial," mourned\r\nBetsey Lane, stopping so suddenly that the others had to go on\r\ncroaking and shrilling without her for a moment before they could\r\nstop. "It seems to me as if I can\'t die happy \'less I do," she added;\r\n"I ain\'t never seen nothin\' of the world, an\' here I be."\r\n\r\n"What if you was as old as I be?" suggested Mrs. Dow pompously.\r\n"You\'ve got time enough yet, Betsey; don\'t you go an\' despair. I\r\nknowed of a woman that went clean round the world four times when she\r\nwas past eighty, an\' enjoyed herself real well. Her folks followed the\r\nsea; she had three sons an\' a daughter married,--all shipmasters, and\r\nshe\'d been with her own husband when they was young. She was left a\r\nwidder early, and fetched up her family herself,--a real stirrin\',\r\nsmart woman. After they\'d got married off, an\' settled, an\' was doing\r\nwell, she come to be lonesome; and first she tried to stick it out\r\nalone, but she wa\'n\'t one that could; an\' she got a notion she hadn\'t\r\nnothin\' before her but her last sickness, and she wa\'n\'t a person\r\nthat enjoyed havin\' other folks do for her. So one on her boys--I\r\nguess \'twas the oldest--said he was going to take her to sea; there\r\nwas ample room, an\' he was sailin\' a good time o\' year for the Cape o\'\r\nGood Hope an\' way up to some o\' them tea-ports in the Chiny Seas. She\r\nwas all high to go, but it made a sight o\' talk at her age; an\' the\r\nminister made it a subject o\' prayer the last Sunday, and all the\r\nfolks took a last leave; but she said to some she\'d fetch \'em home\r\nsomething real pritty, and so did. An\' then they come home t\'other\r\nway, round the Horn, an\' she done so well, an\' was such a sight o\'\r\ncompany, the other child\'n was jealous, an\' she promised she\'d go a\r\nv\'y\'ge long o\' each on \'em. She was as sprightly a person as ever I\r\nsee; an\' could speak well o\' what she\'d seen."\r\n\r\n"Did she die to sea?" asked Peggy, with interest.\r\n\r\n"No, she died to home between v\'y\'ges, or she\'d gone to sea again. I\r\nwas to her funeral. She liked her son George\'s ship the best; \'twas\r\nthe one she was going on to Callao. They said the men aboard all\r\ncalled her \'gran\'ma\'am,\' an\' she kep\' \'em mended up, an\' would go\r\nbelow and tend to \'em if they was sick. She might \'a\' been alive an\'\r\nenjoyin\' of herself a good many years but for the kick of a cow; \'twas\r\na new cow out of a drove, a dreadful unruly beast."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dow stopped for breath, and reached down for a new supply of\r\nbeans; her empty apron was gray with soft chaff. Betsey Lane, still\r\npondering on the Centennial, began to sing another verse of her hymn,\r\nand again the old women joined her. At this moment some strangers came\r\ndriving round into the yard from the front of the house. The turf was\r\nsoft, and our friends did not hear the horses\' steps. Their voices\r\ncracked and quavered; it was a funny little concert, and a lady in an\r\nopen carriage just below listened with sympathy and amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n"Betsey! Betsey! Miss Lane!" a voice called eagerly at the foot of the\r\nstairs that led up from the shed. "Betsey! There\'s a lady here wants\r\nto see you right away."\r\n\r\nBetsey was dazed with excitement, like a country child who knows the\r\nrare pleasure of being called out of school. "Lor\', I ain\'t fit to go\r\ndown, be I?" she faltered, looking anxiously at her friends; but Peggy\r\nwas gazing even nearer to the zenith than usual, in her excited effort\r\nto see down into the yard, and Mrs. Dow only nodded somewhat\r\njealously, and said that she guessed \'twas nobody would do her any\r\nharm. She rose ponderously, while Betsey hesitated, being, as they\r\nwould have said, all of a twitter. "It is a lady, certain," Mrs. Dow\r\nassured her; "\'tain\'t often there\'s a lady comes here."\r\n\r\n"While there was any of Mis\' Gen\'ral Thornton\'s folks left, I wa\'n\'t\r\nwithout visits from the gentry," said Betsey Lane, turning back\r\nproudly at the head of the stairs, with a touch of old-world pride and\r\nsense of high station. Then she disappeared, and closed the door\r\nbehind her at the stair-foot with a decision quite unwelcome to the\r\nfriends above.\r\n\r\n"She needn\'t \'a\' been so dreadful \'fraid anybody was goin\' to listen.\r\nI guess we\'ve got folks to ride an\' see us, or had once, if we hain\'t\r\nnow," said Miss Peggy Bond, plaintively.\r\n\r\n"I expect \'t was only the wind shoved it to," said Aunt Lavina.\r\n"Betsey is one that gits flustered easier than some. I wish \'twas\r\nsomebody to take her off an\' give her a kind of a good time; she\'s\r\nyoung to settle down \'long of old folks like us. Betsey\'s got a notion\r\no\' rovin\' such as ain\'t my natur\', but I should like to see her\r\nsatisfied. She\'d been a very understandin\' person, if she had the\r\nadvantages that some does."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis so," said Peggy Bond, tilting her chin high. "I suppose you\r\ncan\'t hear nothin\' they\'re saying? I feel my hearin\' ain\'t up to whar\r\nit was. I can hear things close to me well as ever; but there, hearin\'\r\nain\'t everything; \'tain\'t as if we lived where there was more goin\' on\r\nto hear. Seems to me them folks is stoppin\' a good while."\r\n\r\n"They surely be," agreed Lavina Dow.\r\n\r\n"I expect it\'s somethin\' particular. There ain\'t none of the Thornton\r\nfolks left, except one o\' the gran\'darters, an\' I\'ve often heard\r\nBetsey remark that she should never see her more, for she lives to\r\nLondon. Strange how folks feels contented in them strayaway places off\r\nto the ends of the airth."\r\n\r\nThe flies and bees were buzzing against the hot windowpanes; the\r\nhandfuls of beans were clicking into the brown wooden measure. A bird\r\ncame and perched on the windowsill, and then flitted away toward the\r\nblue sky. Below, in the yard, Betsey Lane stood talking with the lady.\r\nShe had put her blue drilling apron over her head, and her face was\r\nshining with delight.\r\n\r\n"Lor\', dear," she said, for at least the third time, "I remember ye\r\nwhen I first see ye; an awful pritty baby you was, an\' they all said\r\nyou looked just like the old gen\'ral. Be you goin\' back to foreign\r\nparts right away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m going back; you know that all my children are there. I wish\r\nI could take you with me for a visit," said the charming young guest.\r\n"I\'m going to carry over some of the pictures and furniture from the\r\nold house; I didn\'t care half so much for them when I was younger as I\r\ndo now. Perhaps next summer we shall all come over for a while. I\r\nshould like to see my girls and boys playing under the pines."\r\n\r\n"I wish you re\'lly was livin\' to the old place," said Betsey Lane. Her\r\nimagination was not swift; she needed time to think over all that was\r\nbeing told her, and she could not fancy the two strange houses across\r\nthe sea. The old Thornton house was to her mind the most delightful\r\nand elegant in the world.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything I can do for you?" asked Mrs. Strafford\r\nkindly,--"anything that I can do for you myself, before I go away? I\r\nshall be writing to you, and sending some pictures of the children,\r\nand you must let me know how you are getting on."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is one thing, darlin\'. If you could stop in the village\r\nan\' pick me out a pritty, little, small lookin\'-glass, that I can keep\r\nfor my own an\' have to remember you by. \'Tain\'t that I want to set me\r\nabove the rest o\' the folks, but I was always used to havin\' my own\r\nwhen I was to your grandma\'s. There\'s very nice folks here, some on\r\n\'em, and I\'m better off than if I was able to keep house; but sence\r\nyou ask me, that\'s the only thing I feel cropin\' about. What be you\r\ngoin\' right back for? ain\'t you goin\' to see the great fair to\r\nPheladelphy, that everybody talks about?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs. Strafford, laughing at this eager and almost\r\nconvicting question. "No; I\'m going back next week. If I were, I\r\nbelieve that I should take you with me. Good-by, dear old Betsey; you\r\nmake me feel as if I were a little girl again; you look just the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\nFor full five minutes the old woman stood out in the sunshine, dazed\r\nwith delight, and majestic with a sense of her own consequence. She\r\nheld something tight in her hand, without thinking what it might be;\r\nbut just as the friendly mistress of the poor-farm came out to hear\r\nthe news, she tucked the roll of money into the bosom of her brown\r\ngingham dress. "\'Twas my dear Mis\' Katy Strafford," she turned to say\r\nproudly. "She come way over from London; she\'s been sick; they thought\r\nthe voyage would do her good. She said most the first thing she had on\r\nher mind was to come an\' find me, and see how I was, an\' if I was\r\ncomfortable; an\' now she\'s goin\' right back. She\'s got two splendid\r\nhouses; an\' said how she wished I was there to look after things,--she\r\nremembered I was always her gran\'ma\'s right hand. Oh, it does so carry\r\nme back, to see her! Seems if all the rest on \'em must be there\r\ntogether to the old house. There, I must go right up an\' tell Mis\' Dow\r\nan\' Peggy."\r\n\r\n"Dinner\'s all ready; I was just goin\' to blow the horn for the\r\nmen-folks," said the keeper\'s wife. "They\'ll be right down. I expect\r\nyou\'ve got along smart with them beans,--all three of you together;"\r\nbut Betsey\'s mind roved so high and so far at that moment that no\r\nachievements of bean-picking could lure it back.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe long table in the great kitchen soon gathered its company of waifs\r\nand strays,--creatures of improvidence and misfortune, and the\r\nirreparable victims of old age. The dinner was satisfactory, and there\r\nwas not much delay for conversation. Peggy Bond and Mrs. Dow and\r\nBetsey Lane always sat together at one end, with an air of putting the\r\nrest of the company below the salt. Betsey was still flushed with\r\nexcitement; in fact, she could not eat as much as usual, and she\r\nlooked up from time to time expectantly, as if she were likely to be\r\nasked to speak of her guest; but everybody was hungry, and even Mrs.\r\nDow broke in upon some attempted confidences by asking inopportunely\r\nfor a second potato. There were nearly twenty at the table, counting\r\nthe keeper and his wife and two children, noisy little persons who had\r\ncome from school with the small flock belonging to the poor widow, who\r\nsat just opposite our friends. She finished her dinner before any one\r\nelse, and pushed her chair back; she always helped with the\r\nhousework,--a thin, sorry, bad-tempered-looking poor soul, whom grief\r\nhad sharpened instead of softening. "I expect you feel too fine to set\r\nwith common folks," she said enviously to Betsey.\r\n\r\n"Here I be a-settin\'," responded Betsey calmly. "I don\' know\'s I\r\nbehave more unbecomin\' than usual." Betsey prided herself upon her\r\ngood and proper manners; but the rest of the company, who would have\r\nliked to hear the bit of morning news, were now defrauded of that\r\npleasure. The wrong note had been struck; there was a silence after\r\nthe clatter of knives and plates, and one by one the cheerful town\r\ncharges disappeared. The bean-picking had been finished, and there was\r\na call for any of the women who felt like planting corn; so Peggy\r\nBond, who could follow the line of hills pretty fairly, and Betsey\r\nherself, who was still equal to anybody at that work, and Mrs. Dow,\r\nall went out to the field together. Aunt Lavina labored slowly up the\r\nyard, carrying a light splint-bottomed kitchen chair and her\r\nknitting-work, and sat near the stone wall on a gentle rise, where she\r\ncould see the pond and the green country, and exchange a word with her\r\nfriends as they came and went up and down the rows. Betsey vouchsafed\r\na word now and then about Mrs. Strafford, but you would have thought\r\nthat she had been suddenly elevated to Mrs. Strafford\'s own cares and\r\nthe responsibilities attending them, and had little in common with her\r\nold associates. Mrs. Dow and Peggy knew well that these high-feeling\r\ntimes never lasted long, and so they waited with as much patience as\r\nthey could muster. They were by no means without that true tact which\r\nis only another word for unselfish sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe strip of corn land ran along the side of a great field; at the\r\nupper end of it was a field-corner thicket of young maples and walnut\r\nsaplings, the children of a great nut-tree that marked the boundary.\r\nOnce, when Betsey Lane found herself alone near this shelter at the\r\nend of her row, the other planters having lagged behind beyond the\r\nrising ground, she looked stealthily about, and then put her hand\r\ninside her gown, and for the first time took out the money that Mrs.\r\nStrafford had given her. She turned it over and over with an\r\nastonished look: there were new bank-bills for a hundred dollars.\r\nBetsey gave a funny little shrug of her shoulders, came out of the\r\nbushes, and took a step or two on the narrow edge of turf, as if she\r\nwere going to dance; then she hastily tucked away her treasure, and\r\nstepped discreetly down into the soft harrowed and hoed land, and\r\nbegan to drop corn again, five kernels to a hill. She had seen the top\r\nof Peggy Bond\'s head over the knoll, and now Peggy herself came\r\nentirely into view, gazing upward to the skies, and stumbling more or\r\nless, but counting the corn by touch and twisting her head about\r\nanxiously to gain advantage over her uncertain vision. Betsey made a\r\nfriendly, inarticulate little sound as they passed; she was thinking\r\nthat somebody said once that Peggy\'s eyesight might be remedied if she\r\ncould go to Boston to the hospital; but that was so remote and\r\nimpossible an undertaking that no one had ever taken the first step.\r\nBetsey Lane\'s brown old face suddenly worked with excitement, but in a\r\nmoment more she regained her usual firm expression, and spoke\r\ncarelessly to Peggy as she turned and came alongside.\r\n\r\nThe high spring wind of the morning had quite fallen; it was a lovely\r\nMay afternoon. The woods about the field to the northward were full of\r\nbirds, and the young leaves scarcely hid the solemn shapes of a\r\ncompany of crows that patiently attended the corn-planting. Two of the\r\nmen had finished their hoeing, and were busy with the construction of\r\na scarecrow; they knelt in the furrows, chuckling, and looking over\r\nsome forlorn, discarded garments. It was a time-honored custom to make\r\nthe scarecrow resemble one of the poor-house family; and this year\r\nthey intended to have Mrs. Lavina Dow protect the field in effigy;\r\nlast year it was the counterfeit of Betsey Lane who stood on guard,\r\nwith an easily recognized quilted hood and the remains of a valued\r\nshawl that one of the calves had found airing on a fence and chewed to\r\npieces. Behind the men was the foundation for this rustic attempt at\r\nstatuary,--an upright stake and bar in the form of a cross. This stood\r\non the highest part of the field; and as the men knelt near it, and\r\nthe quaint figures of the corn-planters went and came, the scene gave\r\na curious suggestion of foreign life. It was not like New England; the\r\npresence of the rude cross appealed strangely to the imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nLife flowed so smoothly, for the most part, at the Byfleet Boor-farm,\r\nthat nobody knew what to make, later in the summer, of a strange\r\ndisappearance. All the elder inmates were familiar with illness and\r\ndeath, and the poor pomp of a town-pauper\'s funeral. The comings and\r\ngoings and the various misfortunes of those who composed this strange\r\nfamily, related only through its disasters, hardly served for the\r\nexcitement and talk of a single day. Now that the June days were at\r\ntheir longest, the old people were sure to wake earlier than ever; but\r\none morning, to the astonishment of every one, Betsey Lane\'s bed was\r\nempty; the sheets and blankets, which were her own, and guarded with\r\njealous care, were carefully folded and placed on a chair not too near\r\nthe window, and Betsey had flown. Nobody had heard her go down the\r\ncreaking stairs. The kitchen door was unlocked, and the old watchdog\r\nlay on the step outside in the early sunshine, wagging his tail and\r\nlooking wise, as if he were left on guard and meant to keep the\r\nfugitive\'s secret.\r\n\r\n"Never knowed her to do nothin\' afore \'thout talking it over a\r\nfortnight, and paradin\' off when we could all see her," ventured a\r\nspiteful voice. "Guess we can wait till night to hear \'bout it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dow looked sorrowful and shook her head. "Betsey had an aunt on\r\nher mother\'s side that went and drownded of herself; she was a\r\npritty-appearing woman as ever you see."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she\'s gone to spend the day with Decker\'s folks," suggested\r\nPeggy Bond. "She always takes an extra early start; she was speakin\'\r\nlately o\' going up their way;" but Mrs. Dow shook her head with a most\r\nmelancholy look. "I\'m impressed that something\'s befell her," she\r\ninsisted. "I heard her a-groanin\' in her sleep. I was wakeful the\r\nforepart o\' the night,--\'tis very unusual with me, too."\r\n\r\n"\'Twa\'n\'t like Betsey not to leave us any word," said the other old\r\nfriend, with more resentment than melancholy. They sat together almost\r\nin silence that morning in the shed chamber. Mrs. Dow was sorting and\r\ncutting rags, and Peggy braided them into long ropes, to be made into\r\nmats at a later date. If they had only known where Betsey Lane had\r\ngone, they might have talked about it until dinner-time at noon; but\r\nfailing this new subject, they could take no interest in any of their\r\nold ones. Out in the field the corn was well up, and the men were\r\nhoeing. It was a hot morning in the shed chamber, and the woolen rags\r\nwere dusty and hot to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nByfleet people knew each other well, and when this mysteriously absent\r\nperson did not return to the town-farm at the end of a week, public\r\ninterest became much excited; and presently it was ascertained that\r\nBetsey Lane was neither making a visit to her friends the Deckers on\r\nBirch Hill, nor to any nearer acquaintances; in fact, she had\r\ndisappeared altogether from her wonted haunts. Nobody remembered to\r\nhave seen her pass, hers had been such an early flitting; and when\r\nsomebody thought of her having gone away by train, he was laughed at\r\nfor forgetting that the earliest morning train from South Byfleet, the\r\nnearest station, did not start until long after eight o\'clock; and if\r\nBetsey had designed to be one of the passengers, she would have\r\nstarted along the road at seven, and been seen and known of all women.\r\nThere was not a kitchen in that part of Byfleet that did not have\r\nwindows toward the road. Conversation rarely left the level of the\r\nneighborhood gossip: to see Betsey Lane, in her best clothes, at that\r\nhour in the morning, would have been the signal for much exercise of\r\nimagination; but as day after day went by without news, the curiosity\r\nof those who knew her best turned slowly into fear, and at last Peggy\r\nBond again gave utterance to the belief that Betsey had either gone\r\nout in the early morning and put an end to her life, or that she had\r\ngone to the Centennial. Some of the people at table were moved to loud\r\nlaughter,--it was at supper-time on a Sunday night,--but others\r\nlistened with great interest.\r\n\r\n"She never\'d put on her good clothes to drownd herself," said the\r\nwidow. "She might have thought \'twas good as takin\' \'em with her,\r\nthough. Old folks has wandered off an\' got lost in the woods afore\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dow and Peggy resented this impertinent remark, but deigned to\r\ntake no notice of the speaker. "She wouldn\'t have wore her best\r\nclothes to the Centennial, would she?" mildly inquired Peggy, bobbing\r\nher head toward the ceiling. "\'Twould be a shame to spoil your best\r\nthings in such a place. An\' I don\'t know of her havin\' any money;\r\nthere\'s the end o\' that."\r\n\r\n"You\'re bad as old Mis\' Bland, that used to live neighbor to our\r\nfolks," said one of the old men. "She was dreadful precise; an\' she so\r\nbegretched to wear a good alapaca dress that was left to her, that it\r\nhung in a press forty year, an\' baited the moths at last."\r\n\r\n"I often seen Mis\' Bland a-goin\' in to meetin\' when I was a young\r\ngirl," said Peggy Bond approvingly. "She was a good-appearin\' woman,\r\nan\' she left property."\r\n\r\n"Wish she\'d left it to me, then," said the poor soul opposite,\r\nglancing at her pathetic row of children: but it was not good manners\r\nat the farm to deplore one\'s situation, and Mrs. Dow and Peggy only\r\nfrowned. "Where do you suppose Betsey can be?" said Mrs. Dow, for the\r\ntwentieth time. "She didn\'t have no money. I know she ain\'t gone far,\r\nif it\'s so that she\'s yet alive. She\'s b\'en real pinched all the\r\nspring."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that lady that come one day give her some," the keeper\'s wife\r\nsuggested mildly.\r\n\r\n"Then Betsey would have told me," said Mrs. Dow, with injured dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of her disappearance, Betsey rose even before the pewee\r\nand the English sparrow, and dressed herself quietly, though with\r\ntrembling hands, and stole out of the kitchen door like a plunderless\r\nthief. The old dog licked her hand and looked at her anxiously; the\r\ntortoise-shell cat rubbed against her best gown, and trotted away up\r\nthe yard, then she turned anxiously and came after the old woman,\r\nfollowing faithfully until she had to be driven back. Betsey was used\r\nto long country excursions afoot. She dearly loved the early morning;\r\nand finding that there was no dew to trouble her, she began to follow\r\npasture paths and short cuts across the fields, surprising here and\r\nthere a flock of sleepy sheep, or a startled calf that rustled out\r\nfrom the bushes. The birds were pecking their breakfast from bush and\r\nturf; and hardly any of the wild inhabitants of that rural world were\r\nenough alarmed by her presence to do more than flutter away if they\r\nchanced to be in her path. She stepped along, light-footed and eager\r\nas a girl, dressed in her neat old straw bonnet and black gown, and\r\ncarrying a few belongings in her best bundle-handkerchief, one that\r\nher only brother had brought home from the East Indies fifty years\r\nbefore. There was an old crow perched as sentinel on a small, dead\r\npine-tree, where he could warn friends who were pulling up the\r\nsprouted corn in a field close by; but he only gave a contemptuous caw\r\nas the adventurer appeared, and she shook her bundle at him in\r\nrevenge, and laughed to see him so clumsy as he tried to keep his\r\nfooting on the twigs.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I be," she assured him. "I\'m a-goin\' to Pheladelphy, to the\r\nCentennial, same\'s other folks. I\'d jest as soon tell ye\'s not, old\r\ncrow;" and Betsey laughed aloud in pleased content with herself and\r\nher daring, as she walked along. She had only two miles to go to the\r\nstation at South Byfleet, and she felt for the money now and then, and\r\nfound it safe enough. She took great pride in the success of her\r\nescape, and especially in the long concealment of her wealth. Not a\r\nnight had passed since Mrs. Strafford\'s visit that she had not slept\r\nwith the roll of money under her pillow by night, and buttoned safe\r\ninside her dress by day. She knew that everybody would offer advice\r\nand even commands about the spending or saving of it; and she brooked\r\nno interference.\r\n\r\nThe last mile of the foot-path to South Byfleet was along the railway\r\ntrack; and Betsey began to feel in haste, though it was still nearly\r\ntwo hours to train time. She looked anxiously forward and back along\r\nthe rails every few minutes, for fear of being run over; and at last\r\nshe caught sight of an engine that was apparently coming toward her,\r\nand took flight into the woods before she could gather courage to\r\nfollow the path again. The freight train proved to be at a standstill,\r\nwaiting at a turnout; and some of the men were straying about, eating\r\ntheir early breakfast comfortably in this time of leisure. As the old\r\nwoman came up to them, she stopped too, for a moment of rest and\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"Where be ye goin\'?" she asked pleasantly; and they told her. It was\r\nto the town where she had to change cars and take the great through\r\ntrain; a point of geography which she had learned from evening talks\r\nbetween the men at the farm.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll ye carry me there for?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t run no passenger cars," said one of the young fellows,\r\nlaughing. "What makes you in such a hurry?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m startin\' for Pheladelphy, an\' it\'s a gre\'t ways to go."\r\n\r\n"So\'t is; but you\'re consid\'able early, if you\'re makin\' for the\r\neight-forty train. See here! you haven\'t got a needle an\' thread \'long\r\nof you in that bundle, have you? If you\'ll sew me on a couple o\'\r\nbuttons, I\'ll give ye a free ride. I\'m in a sight o\' distress, an\'\r\nnone o\' the fellows is provided with as much as a bent pin."\r\n\r\n"You poor boy! I\'ll have you seen to, in half a minute. I\'m troubled\r\nwith a stiff arm, but I\'ll do the best I can."\r\n\r\nThe obliging Betsey seated herself stiffly on the slope of the\r\nembankment, and found her thread and needle with utmost haste. Two of\r\nthe train-men stood by and watched the careful stitches, and even\r\noffered her a place as spare brakeman, so that they might keep her\r\nnear; and Betsey took the offer with considerable seriousness, only\r\nthinking it necessary to assure them that she was getting most too old\r\nto be out in all weathers. An express went by like an earthquake, and\r\nshe was presently hoisted on board an empty box-car by two of her new\r\nand flattering acquaintances, and found herself before noon at the end\r\nof the first stage of her journey, without having spent a cent, and\r\nfurnished with any amount of thrifty advice. One of the young men,\r\nbeing compassionate of her unprotected state as a traveler, advised\r\nher to find out the widow of an uncle of his in Philadelphia, saying\r\ndespairingly that he couldn\'t tell her just how to find the house; but\r\nMiss Betsey Lane said that she had an English tongue in her head, and\r\nshould be sure to find whatever she was looking for. This unexpected\r\nincident of the freight train was the reason why everybody about the\r\nSouth Byfleet station insisted that no such person had taken passage\r\nby the regular train that same morning, and why there were those who\r\npersuaded themselves that Miss Betsey Lane was probably lying at the\r\nbottom of the poor-farm pond.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n"Land sakes!" said Miss Betsey Lane, as she watched a Turkish person\r\nparading by in his red fez, "I call the Centennial somethin\' like the\r\nday o\' judgment! I wish I was goin\' to stop a month, but I dare say\r\n\'twould be the death o\' my poor old bones."\r\n\r\nShe was leaning against the barrier of a patent pop-corn\r\nestablishment, which had given her a sudden reminder of home, and of\r\nthe winter nights when the sharp-kerneled little red and yellow ears\r\nwere brought out, and Old Uncle Eph Flanders sat by the kitchen stove,\r\nand solemnly filled a great wooden chopping-tray for the refreshment\r\nof the company. She had wandered and loitered and looked until her\r\neyes and head had grown numb and unreceptive; but it is only\r\nunimaginative persons who can be really astonished. The imagination\r\ncan always outrun the possible and actual sights and sounds of the\r\nworld; and this plain old body from Byfleet rarely found anything rich\r\nand splendid enough to surprise her. She saw the wonders of the West\r\nand the splendors of the East with equal calmness and satisfaction;\r\nshe had always known that there was an amazing world outside the\r\nboundaries of Byfleet. There was a piece of paper in her pocket on\r\nwhich was marked, in her clumsy handwriting, "If Betsey Lane should\r\nmeet with accident, notify the selectmen of Byfleet;" but having made\r\nthis slight provision for the future, she had thrown herself boldly\r\ninto the sea of strangers, and then had made the joyful discovery that\r\nfriends were to be found at every turn.\r\n\r\nThere was something delightfully companionable about Betsey; she had a\r\nway of suddenly looking up over her big spectacles with a reassuring\r\nand expectant smile, as if you were going to speak to her, and you\r\ngenerally did. She must have found out where hundreds of people came\r\nfrom, and whom they had left at home, and what they thought of the\r\ngreat show, as she sat on a bench to rest, or leaned over the railings\r\nwhere free luncheons were afforded by the makers of hot waffles and\r\nmolasses candy and fried potatoes; and there was not a night when she\r\ndid not return to her lodgings with a pocket crammed with samples of\r\nspool cotton and nobody knows what. She had already collected small\r\npresents for almost everybody she knew at home, and she was such a\r\npleasant, beaming old country body, so unmistakably appreciative and\r\ninterested, that nobody ever thought of wishing that she would move\r\non. Nearly all the busy people of the Exhibition called her either\r\nAunty or Grandma at once, and made little pleasures for her as best\r\nthey could. She was a delightful contrast to the indifferent, stupid\r\ncrowd that drifted along, with eyes fixed at the same level, and\r\nseeing, even on that level, nothing for fifty feet at a time. "What be\r\nyou making here, dear?" Betsey Lane would ask joyfully, and the most\r\nperfunctory guardian hastened to explain. She squandered money as she\r\nhad never had the pleasure of doing before, and this hastened the day\r\nwhen she must return to Byfleet. She was always inquiring if there\r\nwere any spectacle-sellers at hand, and received occasional\r\ndirections; but it was a difficult place for her to find her way about\r\nin, and the very last day of her stay arrived before she found an\r\nexhibitor of the desired sort, an oculist and instrument-maker.\r\n\r\n"I called to get some specs for a friend that\'s upsighted," she\r\ngravely informed the salesman, to his extreme amusement. "She\'s\r\ndreadful troubled, and jerks her head up like a hen a-drinkin\'. She\'s\r\ngot a blur a-growin\' an\' spreadin\', an\' sometimes she can see out to\r\none side on\'t, and more times she can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Cataracts," said a middle-aged gentleman at her side; and Betsey Lane\r\nturned to regard him with approval and curiosity.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis Miss Peggy Bond I was mentioning, of Byfleet Poor-farm," she\r\nexplained. "I count on gettin\' some glasses to relieve her trouble, if\r\nthere\'s any to be found."\r\n\r\n"Glasses won\'t do her any good," said the stranger. "Suppose you come\r\nand sit down on this bench, and tell me all about it. First, where is\r\nByfleet?" and Betsey gave the directions at length.\r\n\r\n"I thought so," said the surgeon. "How old is this friend of yours?"\r\n\r\nBetsey cleared her throat decisively, and smoothed her gown over her\r\nknees as if it were an apron; then she turned to take a good look at\r\nher new acquaintance as they sat on the rustic bench together. "Who be\r\nyou, sir, I should like to know?" she asked, in a friendly tone.\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Dunster."\r\n\r\n"I take it you\'re a doctor," continued Betsey, as if they had\r\novertaken each other walking from Byfleet to South Byfleet on a summer\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a doctor; part of one at least," said he. "I know more or less\r\nabout eyes; and I spend my summers down on the shore at the mouth of\r\nyour river; some day I\'ll come up and look at this person. How old is\r\nshe?"\r\n\r\n"Peggy Bond is one that never tells her age; \'tain\'t come quite up to\r\nwhere she\'ll begin to brag of it, you see," explained Betsey\r\nreluctantly; "but I know her to be nigh to seventy-six, one way or\r\nt\'other. Her an\' Mrs. Mary Ann Chick was same year\'s child\'n, and\r\nPeggy knows I know it, an\' two or three times when we\'ve be\'n in the\r\nburyin\'-ground where Mary Ann lays an\' has her dates right on her\r\nheadstone, I couldn\'t bring Peggy to take no sort o\' notice. I will\r\nsay she makes, at times, a convenience of being upsighted. But there,\r\nI feel for her,--everybody does; it keeps her stubbin\' an\' trippin\'\r\nagainst everything, beakin\' and gazin\' up the way she has to."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said the doctor, whose eyes were twinkling. "I\'ll come and\r\nlook after her, with your town doctor, this summer,--some time in the\r\nlast of July or first of August."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find occupation," said Betsey, not without an air of\r\npatronage. "Most of us to the Byfleet Farm has got our ails, now I\r\ntell ye. You ain\'t got no bitters that\'ll take a dozen years right off\r\nan ol\' lady\'s shoulders?"\r\n\r\nThe busy man smiled pleasantly, and shook his head as he went away.\r\n"Dunster," said Betsey to herself, soberly committing the new name to\r\nher sound memory. "Yes, I mustn\'t forget to speak of him to the\r\ndoctor, as he directed. I do\' know now as Peggy would vally herself\r\nquite so much accordin\' to, if she had her eyes fixed same as other\r\nfolks. I expect there wouldn\'t been a smarter woman in town, though,\r\nif she\'d had a proper chance. Now I\'ve done what I set to do for her,\r\nI do believe, an\' \'twa\'n\'t glasses, neither. I\'ll git her a pritty\r\nlittle shawl with that money I laid aside. Peggy Bond ain\'t got a\r\npritty shawl. I always wanted to have a real good time, an\' now I\'m\r\nhavin\' it."\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days later, two pathetic figures might have been seen\r\ncrossing the slopes of the poor-farm field, toward the low shores of\r\nByfield pond. It was early in the morning, and the stubble of the\r\nlately mown grass was wet with rain and hindering to old feet. Peggy\r\nBond was more blundering and liable to stray in the wrong direction\r\nthan usual; it was one of the days when she could hardly see at all.\r\nAunt Lavina Dow was unusually clumsy of movement, and stiff in the\r\njoints; she had not been so far from the house for three years. The\r\nmorning breeze filled the gathers of her wide gingham skirt, and\r\naggravated the size of her unwieldy figure. She supported herself with\r\na stick, and trusted beside to the fragile support of Peggy\'s arm.\r\nThey were talking together in whispers.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my sakes!" exclaimed Peggy, moving her small head from side to\r\nside. "Hear you wheeze, Mis\' Dow! This may be the death o\' you; there,\r\ndo go slow! You set here on the sidehill, an\' le\' me go try if I can\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"It needs more eyesight than you\'ve got," said Mrs. Dow, panting\r\nbetween the words. "Oh! to think how spry I was in my young days, an\'\r\nhere I be now, the full of a door, an\' all my complaints so aggravated\r\nby my size. \'T is hard! \'tis hard! but I\'m a-doin\' of all this for\r\npore Betsey\'s sake. I know they\'ve all laughed, but I look to see her\r\nris\' to the top o\' the pond this day,--\'tis just nine days since she\r\ndeparted; an\' say what they may, I know she hove herself in. It run in\r\nher family; Betsey had an aunt that done just so, an\' she ain\'t be\'n\r\nlike herself, a-broodin\' an\' hivin\' away alone, an\' nothin\' to say to\r\nyou an\' me that was always sich good company all together. Somethin\'\r\nsprung her mind, now I tell ye, Mis\' Bond."\r\n\r\n"I feel to hope we sha\'n\'t find her, I must say," faltered Peggy. It\r\nwas plain that Mrs. Dow was the captain of this doleful expedition. "I\r\nguess she ain\'t never thought o\' drowndin\' of herself, Mis\' Dow; she\'s\r\ngone off a-visitin\' way over to the other side o\' South Byfleet; some\r\nthinks she\'s gone to the Centennial even now!"\r\n\r\n"She hadn\'t no proper means, I tell ye," wheezed Mrs. Dow indignantly;\r\n"an\' if you prefer that others should find her floatin\' to the top\r\nthis day, instid of us that\'s her best friends, you can step back to\r\nthe house."\r\n\r\nThey walked on in aggrieved silence. Peggy Bond trembled with\r\nexcitement, but her companion\'s firm grasp never wavered, and so they\r\ncame to the narrow, gravelly margin and stood still. Peggy tried in\r\nvain to see the glittering water and the pond-lilies that starred it;\r\nshe knew that they must be there; once, years ago, she had caught\r\nfleeting glimpses of them, and she never forgot what she had once\r\nseen. The clear blue sky overhead, the dark pine-woods beyond the\r\npond, were all clearly pictured in her mind. "Can\'t you see nothin\'?"\r\nshe faltered; "I believe I\'m wuss\'n upsighted this day. I\'m going to\r\nbe blind."\r\n\r\n"No," said Lavina Dow solemnly; "no, there ain\'t nothin\' whatever,\r\nPeggy. I hope to mercy she ain\'t"--\r\n\r\n"Why, whoever\'d expected to find you \'way out here!" exclaimed a brisk\r\nand cheerful voice. There stood Betsey Lane herself, close behind\r\nthem, having just emerged from a thicket of alders that grew close by.\r\nShe was following the short way homeward from the railroad.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter, Mis\' Dow? You ain\'t overdoin\', be ye? an\'\r\nPeggy\'s all of a flutter. What in the name o\' natur\' ails ye?"\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t nothin\' the matter, as I knows on," responded the leader\r\nof this fruitless expedition. "We only thought we\'d take a stroll this\r\npleasant mornin\'," she added, with sublime self-possession. "Where\'ve\r\nyou be\'n, Betsey Lane?"\r\n\r\n"To Pheladelphy, ma\'am," said Betsey, looking quite young and gay, and\r\nwearing a townish and unfamiliar air that upheld her words. "All ought\r\nto go that can; why, you feel\'s if you\'d be\'n all round the world. I\r\nguess I\'ve got enough to think of and tell ye for the rest o\' my days.\r\nI\'ve always wanted to go somewheres. I wish you\'d be\'n there, I do so.\r\nI\'ve talked with folks from Chiny an\' the back o\' Pennsylvany; and I\r\nsee folks way from Australy that \'peared as well as anybody; an\' I see\r\nhow they made spool cotton, an\' sights o\' other things; an\' I spoke\r\nwith a doctor that lives down to the beach in the summer, an\' he\r\noffered to come up \'long in the first of August, an\' see what he can\r\ndo for Peggy\'s eyesight. There was di\'monds there as big as pigeon\'s\r\neggs; an\' I met with Mis\' Abby Fletcher from South Byfleet depot; an\'\r\nthere was hogs there that weighed risin\' thirteen hunderd"--\r\n\r\n"I want to know," said Mrs. Lavina Dow and Peggy Bond, together.\r\n\r\n"Well, \'twas a great exper\'ence for a person," added Lavina, turning\r\nponderously, in spite of herself, to give a last wistful look at the\r\nsmiling waters of the pond.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how soon I be goin\' to settle down," proclaimed the\r\nrustic sister of Sindbad. "What\'s for the good o\' one\'s for the good\r\nof all. You just wait till we\'re setting together up in the old shed\r\nchamber! You know, my dear Mis\' Katy Strafford give me a han\'some\r\npresent o\' money that day she come to see me; and I\'d be\'n a-dreamin\'\r\nby night an\' day o\' seein\' that Centennial; and when I come to think\r\non\'t I felt sure somebody ought to go from this neighborhood, if \'twas\r\nonly for the good o\' the rest; and I thought I\'d better be the one. I\r\nwa\'n\'t goin\' to ask the selec\'men neither. I\'ve come back with\r\none-thirty-five in money, and I see everything there, an\' I fetched ye\r\nall a little somethin\'; but I\'m full o\' dust now, an\' pretty nigh beat\r\nout. I never see a place more friendly than Pheladelphy; but \'t ain\'t\r\nnatural to a Byfleet person to be always walkin\' on a level. There,\r\nnow, Peggy, you take my bundle-handkercher and the basket, and let\r\nMis\' Dow sag on to me. I \'ll git her along twice as easy."\r\n\r\nWith this the small elderly company set forth triumphant toward the\r\npoor-house, across the wide green field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gray Mills of Farley_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mills of Farley were close together by the river, and the gray\r\nhouses that belonged to them stood, tall and bare, alongside. They had\r\nno room for gardens or even for little green side-yards where one\r\nmight spend a summer evening. The Corporation, as this compact village\r\nwas called by those who lived in it, was small but solid; you fancied\r\nyourself in the heart of a large town when you stood mid-way of one of\r\nits short streets, but from the street\'s end you faced a wide green\r\nfarming country. On spring and summer Sundays, groups of the young\r\nfolks of the Corporation would stray out along the country roads, but\r\nit was very seldom that any of the older people went. On the whole, it\r\nseemed as if the closer you lived to the mill-yard gate, the better.\r\nYou had more time to loiter on a summer morning, and there was less\r\ndistance to plod through the winter snows and rains. The last stroke\r\nof the bell saw almost everybody within the mill doors.\r\n\r\nThere were always fluffs of cotton in the air like great white bees\r\ndrifting down out of the picker chimney. They lodged in the cramped\r\nand dingy elms and horse-chestnuts which a former agent had planted\r\nalong the streets, and the English sparrows squabbled over them in\r\neaves-corners and made warm, untidy great nests that would have\r\ncontented an Arctic explorer. Somehow the Corporation homes looked\r\nlike make-believe houses or huge stage-properties, they had so little\r\nindividuality or likeness to the old-fashioned buildings that made\r\nhomes for people out on the farms. There was more homelikeness in the\r\nsparrows\' nests, or even the toylike railroad station at the end of\r\nthe main street, for that was warmed by steam, and the station-master\'s\r\nwife, thriftily taking advantage of the steady heat, brought her\r\nhouse-plants there and kept them all winter on the broad window-sills.\r\n\r\nThe Corporation had followed the usual fortunes of New England\r\nmanufacturing villages. Its operatives were at first eager young men\r\nand women from the farms near by, these being joined quickly by pale\r\nEnglish weavers and spinners, with their hearty-looking wives and rosy\r\nchildren; then came the flock of Irish families, poorer and simpler\r\nthan the others but learning the work sooner, and gayer-hearted; now\r\nthe Canadian-French contingent furnished all the new help, and stood\r\nin long rows before the noisy looms and chattered in their odd,\r\nexcited fashion. They were quicker-fingered, and were willing to work\r\ncheaper than any other workpeople yet.\r\n\r\nThere were remnants of each of these human tides to be found as one\r\nlooked about the mills. Old Henry Dow, the overseer of the cloth-hall,\r\nwas a Lancashire man and some of his grandchildren had risen to wealth\r\nand prominence in another part of the country, while he kept steadily\r\non with his familiar work and authority. A good many elderly Irishmen\r\nand women still kept their places; everybody knew the two old\r\nsweepers, Mary Cassidy and Mrs. Kilpatrick, who were looked upon as\r\npillars of the Corporation. They and their compatriots always held\r\nloyally together and openly resented the incoming of so many French.\r\n\r\nYou would never have thought that the French were for a moment\r\nconscious of being in the least unwelcome. They came gayly into church\r\nand crowded the old parishioners of St. Michael\'s out of their pews,\r\nas on week-days they took their places at the looms. Hardly one of the\r\nold parishioners had not taken occasion to speak of such aggressions\r\nto Father Daley, the priest, but Father Daley continued to look upon\r\nthem all as souls to be saved and took continual pains to rub up the\r\nrusty French which he had nearly forgotten, in order to preach a\r\nspecial sermon every other Sunday. This caused old Mary Cassidy to\r\nshake her head gravely.\r\n\r\n"Mis\' Kilpatrick, ma\'am," she said one morning. "Faix, they ain\'t\r\nfolks at all, \'tis but a pack of images they do be, with all their\r\nchatter like birds in a hedge."\r\n\r\n"Sure then, the holy Saint Francis himself was after saying that the\r\nlittle birds was his sisters," answered Mrs. Kilpatrick, a godly old\r\nwoman who made the stations every morning, and was often seen reading\r\na much-handled book of devotion. She was moreover always ready with a\r\nfriendly joke.\r\n\r\n"They ain\'t the same at all was in them innocent times, when there was\r\nplenty saints living in the world," insisted Mary Cassidy. "Look at\r\nthem thrash, now!"\r\n\r\nThe old sweeping-women were going downstairs with their brooms. It was\r\nalmost twelve o\'clock, and like the old dray-horses in the mill yard\r\nthey slackened work in good season for the noonday bell. Three gay\r\nyoung French girls ran downstairs past them; they were let out for the\r\nafternoon and were hurrying home to dress and catch the 12:40 train to\r\nthe next large town.\r\n\r\n"That little one is Meshell\'s daughter; she\'s a nice child too, very\r\nquiet, and has got more Christian tark than most," said Mrs.\r\nKilpatrick. "They live overhead o\' me. There\'s nine o\' themselves in\r\nthe two rooms; two does be boarders."\r\n\r\n"Those upper rooms bees very large entirely at Fitzgibbon\'s," said\r\nMary Cassidy with unusual indulgence.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis all the company cares about is to get a good rent out of the\r\npay. They\'re asked every little while by honest folks \'on\'t they build\r\na trifle o\' small houses beyond the church up there, but no, they\'d\r\nrather the money and kape us like bees in them old hives. Sure in\r\nwinter we\'re better for having the more fires, but summer is the\r\npinance!"\r\n\r\n"They all says \'why don\'t folks build their own houses\'; they does\r\nalways be talking about Mike Callahan and how well he saved up and\r\nowns a pritty place for himself convanient to his work. You might tell\r\nthem he\'d money left him by a brother in California till you\'d be\r\nblack in the face, they\'d stick to it \'twas in the picker he earnt it\r\nfrom themselves," grumbled Mary Cassidy.\r\n\r\n"Them French spinds all their money on their backs, don\'t they?"\r\nsuggested Mrs. Kilpatrick, as if to divert the conversation from\r\ndangerous channels. "Look at them three girls now, off to Spincer with\r\ntheir fortnight\'s pay in their pocket!"\r\n\r\n"A couple o\' onions and a bag o\' crackers is all they want and a pinch\r\no\' lard to their butter," pronounced Mary Cassidy with scorn. "The\r\nwhole town of \'em \'on\'t be the worse of a dollar for steak the week\r\nround. They all go back and buy land in Canada, they spend no money\r\nhere. See how well they forget their pocketbooks every Sunday for the\r\ncollection. They do be very light too, they\'ve more laugh than\r\nourselves. \'Tis myself\'s getting old anyway, I don\'t laugh much now."\r\n\r\n"I like to see a pritty girl look fine," said Mrs. Kilpatrick. "No,\r\nthey don\'t be young but once--"\r\n\r\nThe mill bell rang, and there was a moment\'s hush of the jarring,\r\nracketing machinery and a sudden noise of many feet trampling across\r\nthe dry, hard pine floors. First came an early flight of boys bursting\r\nout of the different doors, and chasing one another down the winding\r\nstairs two steps at a time. The old sweepers, who had not quite\r\nreached the bottom, stood back against the wall for safety\'s sake\r\nuntil all these had passed, then they kept on their careful way, the\r\ncrowd passing them by as if they were caught in an eddy of the stream.\r\nLast of all they kept sober company with two or three lame persons and\r\na cheerful delayed little group of new doffers, the children who\r\nminded bobbins in the weave-room and who were young enough to be tired\r\nand even timid. One of these doffers, a pale, pleasant-looking child,\r\nwas all fluffy with cotton that had clung to her little dark plaid\r\ndress. When Mrs. Kilpatrick spoke to her she answered in a hoarse\r\nvoice that appealed to one\'s sympathy. You felt that the hot room and\r\ndry cotton were to blame for such hoarseness; it had nothing to do\r\nwith the weather.\r\n\r\n"Where are you living now, Maggie, dear?" the old woman asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m in Callahan\'s yet, but they won\'t keep me after to-day," said the\r\nchild. "There\'s a man wants to get board there, they\'re changing round\r\nin the rooms and they\'ve no place for me. Mis\' Callahan couldn\'t keep\r\nme \'less I\'d get my pay raised."\r\n\r\nMrs. Kilpatrick gave a quick glance at Mary Cassidy. "Come home with\r\nme then, till yez get a bite o\' dinner, and we\'ll talk about it," she\r\nsaid kindly to the child. "I\'d a wish for company the day."\r\n\r\nThe two old companions had locked their brooms into a three-cornered\r\ncloset at the stair-foot and were crossing the mill yard together.\r\nThey were so much slower than the rest that they could only see the\r\nvery last of the crowd of mill people disappearing along the streets\r\nand into the boarding-house doors. It was late autumn, the elms were\r\nbare, one could see the whole village of Farley, all its poverty and\r\nlack of beauty, at one glance. The large houses looked as if they\r\nbelonged to a toy village, and had been carefully put in rows by a\r\nchildish hand; it was easy to lose all sense of size in looking at\r\nthem. A cold wind was blowing bits of waste and paper high into the\r\nair; now and then a snowflake went swiftly by like a courier of\r\nwinter. Mary Cassidy and Mrs. Kilpatrick hugged their old woolen\r\nshawls closer about their round shoulders, and the little girl\r\nfollowed with short steps alongside.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe agent of the mills was a single man, keen and business-like, but\r\nquietly kind to the people under his charge. Sometimes, in times of\r\npeace, when one looks among one\'s neighbors wondering who would make\r\nthe great soldiers and leaders if there came a sudden call to war, one\r\nknows with a flash of recognition the presence of military genius in\r\nsuch a man as he. The agent spent his days in following what seemed\r\nto many observers to be only a dull routine, but all his steadiness of\r\npurpose, all his simple intentness, all his gifts of strategy and\r\npowers of foresight, and of turning an interruption into an\r\nopportunity, were brought to bear upon this dull routine with a keen\r\npleasure. A man in his place must know not only how to lead men, but\r\nhow to make the combination of their force with the machinery take its\r\nplace as a factor in the business of manufacturing. To master workmen\r\nand keep the mills in running order and to sell the goods successfully\r\nin open market is as easy to do badly as it is difficult to do well.\r\n\r\nThe agent\'s father and mother, young people who lived for a short time\r\nin the village, had both died when he was only three years old, and\r\nbetween that time and his ninth year he had learned almost everything\r\nthat poverty could teach, being left like little Maggie to the mercy\r\nof his neighbors. He remembered with a grateful heart those who were\r\ngood to him, and told him of his mother, who had married for love but\r\nunwisely. Mrs. Kilpatrick was one of these old friends, who said that\r\nhis mother was a lady, but even Mrs. Kilpatrick, who was a walking\r\nhistory of the Corporation, had never known his mother\'s maiden name,\r\nmuch less the place of her birth. The first great revelation of life\r\nhad come when the nine-years-old boy had money in his hand to pay his\r\nboard. He was conscious of being looked at with a difference; the very\r\nwoman who had been hardest to him and let him mind her babies all the\r\nmorning when he, careful little soul, was hardly more than a baby\r\nhimself, and then pushed him out into the hungry street at dinner\r\ntime, was the first one who beckoned him now, willing to make the most\r\nof his dollar and a quarter a week. It seemed easy enough to rise from\r\nuttermost poverty and dependence to where one could set his mind upon\r\nthe highest honor in sight, that of being agent of the mills, or to\r\nwork one\'s way steadily to where such an honor was grasped at\r\nthirty-two. Every year the horizon had set its bounds wider and wider,\r\nuntil the mills of Farley held but a small place in the manufacturing\r\nworld. There were offers enough of more salary and higher position\r\nfrom those who came to know the agent, but he was part of Farley\r\nitself, and had come to care deeply about his neighbors, while a\r\nlarger mill and salary were not exactly the things that could tempt\r\nhis ambition. It was but a lonely life for a man in the old agent\'s\r\nquarters where one of the widows of the Corporation, a woman who had\r\nbeen brought up in a gentleman\'s house in the old country, kept house\r\nfor him with a certain show of propriety. Ever since he was a boy his\r\nroom was never without its late evening light, and books and hard\r\nstudy made his chief companionship.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Kilpatrick went home holding little Maggie by the hand that\r\nwindy noon, the agent was sitting in the company\'s counting-room with\r\none of the directors and largest stockholders, and they were just\r\nending a long talk about the mill affairs. The agent was about forty\r\nyears old now and looked fifty. He had a pleasant smile, but one saw\r\nit rarely enough, and just now he looked more serious than usual.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to have had this long talk with you," said the old\r\ndirector. "You do not think of any other recommendations to be made at\r\nthe meeting next week?"\r\n\r\nThe agent grew a trifle paler and glanced behind him to be sure that\r\nthe clerks had gone to dinner.\r\n\r\n"Not in regard to details," he answered gravely. "There is one thing\r\nwhich I see to be very important. You have seen the books, and are\r\nclear that nine per cent. dividend can easily be declared?"\r\n\r\n"Very creditable, very creditable," agreed the director; he had\r\nrecognized the agent\'s ability from the first and always upheld him\r\ngenerously. "I mean to propose a special vote of thanks for your\r\nmanagement. There isn\'t a minor corporation in New England that stands\r\nso well to-day."\r\n\r\nThe agent listened. "We had some advantages, partly by accident and\r\npartly by lucky foresight," he acknowledged. "I am going to ask your\r\nbacking in something that seems to me not only just but important. I\r\nhope that you will not declare above a six per cent. dividend at that\r\ndirectors\' meeting; at the most, seven per cent.," he said.\r\n\r\n"What, what!" exclaimed the listener. "No, sir!"\r\n\r\nThe agent left his desk-chair and stood before the old director as if\r\nhe were pleading for himself. A look of protest and disappointment\r\nchanged the elder man\'s face and hardened it a little, and the agent\r\nsaw it.\r\n\r\n"You know the general condition of the people here," he explained\r\nhumbly. "I have taken great pains to keep hold of the best that have\r\ncome here; we can depend upon them now and upon the quality of their\r\nwork. They made no resistance when we had to cut down wages two years\r\nago; on the contrary, they were surprisingly reasonable, and you know\r\nthat we shut down for several weeks at the time of the alterations. We\r\nhave never put their wages back as we might easily have done, and I\r\nhappen to know that a good many families have been able to save little\r\nor nothing. Some of them have been working here for three generations.\r\nThey know as well as you and I and the books do when the mills are\r\nmaking money. Now I wish that we could give them the ten per cent.\r\nback again, but in view of the general depression perhaps we can\'t do\r\nthat except in the way I mean. I think that next year we\'re going to\r\nhave a very hard pull to get along, but if we can keep back three per\r\ncent., or even two, of this dividend we can not only manage to get on\r\nwithout a shut-down or touching our surplus, which is quite small\r\nenough, but I can have some painting and repairing done in the\r\ntenements. They\'ve needed it for a long time--"\r\n\r\nThe old director sprang to his feet. "Aren\'t the stockholders going to\r\nhave any rights then?" he demanded. "Within fifteen years we have had\r\nthree years when we have passed our dividends, but the operatives\r\nnever can lose a single day\'s pay!"\r\n\r\n"That was before my time," said the agent, quietly. "We have averaged\r\nnearly six and a half per cent. a year taking the last twenty years\r\ntogether, and if you go back farther the average is even larger. This\r\nhas always been a paying property; we\'ve got our new machinery now,\r\nand everything in the mills themselves is just where we want it. I\r\nlook for far better times after this next year, but the market is\r\nglutted with goods of our kind, and nothing is going to be gained by\r\ncut-downs and forcing lower-cost goods into it. Still, I can keep\r\nthings going one way and another, making yarn and so on," he said\r\npleadingly. "I should like to feel that we had this extra surplus. I\r\nbelieve that we owe it to our operatives."\r\n\r\nThe director had walked heavily to the window and put his hands deep\r\ninto his side-pockets. He had an angry sense that the agent\'s hands\r\nwere in his pockets too.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got some pride about that nine per cent., sir," he said loftily\r\nto the agent.\r\n\r\n"So have I," said the agent, and the two men looked each other in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge my duty to the stockholders," said the younger man\r\npresently. "I have tried to remember that duty ever since I took the\r\nmills eight years ago, but we\'ve got an excellent body of operatives,\r\nand we ought to keep them. I want to show them this next year that we\r\nvalue their help. If times aren\'t as bad as we fear we shall still\r\nhave the money--"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense. They think they own the mills now," said the director, but\r\nhe was uncomfortable, in spite of believing he was right. "Where\'s my\r\nhat? I must have my luncheon now, and afterward there\'ll hardly be\r\ntime to go down and look at the new power-house with you--I must be\r\noff on the quarter-to-two train."\r\n\r\nThe agent sighed and led the way. There was no use in saying anything\r\nmore and he knew it. As they walked along they met old Mrs. Kilpatrick\r\nreturning from her brief noonday meal with little Maggie, whose\r\nchildish face was radiant. The old woman recognized one of the\r\ndirectors and dropped him a decent curtsey as she had been taught to\r\nsalute the gentry sixty years before.\r\n\r\nThe director returned the salutation with much politeness. This was\r\nreally a pleasant incident, and he took a silver half dollar from his\r\npocket and gave it to the little girl before he went on.\r\n\r\n"Kape it safe, darlin\'," said the old woman; "you\'ll need it yet.\r\nDon\'t be spending all your money in sweeties; \'tis a very cold world\r\nto them that haves no pince in their pocket."\r\n\r\nThe child looked up at Mrs. Kilpatrick apprehensively; then the\r\nsunshine of hope broke out again through the cloud.\r\n\r\n"I am going to save fine till I buy a house, and you and me\'ll live\r\nthere together, Mrs. Kilpatrick, and have a lovely coal fire all the\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Faix, Maggie, I have always thought some day I\'d kape a pig and live\r\npritty in me own house," said Mrs. Kilpatrick. "But I\'m the old\r\nsweeper yet in Number Two. \'Tis a worrld where some has and more\r\nwants," she added with a sigh. "I got the manes for a good buryin\',\r\nthe Lord be praised, and a bitteen more beside. I wouldn\'t have that\r\nif Father Daley was as croping as some."\r\n\r\n"Mis\' Mullin does always be scolding \'bout Father Daley having all the\r\ncollections," ventured Maggie, somewhat adrift in so great a subject.\r\n\r\n"She\'s no right then!" exclaimed the old woman angrily; "she\'ll get no\r\nluck to be grudging her pince that way. \'Tis hard work anny priest\r\nwould have to kape the likes of hersilf from being haythens\r\naltogether."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a nine per cent. annual dividend declared at the directors\'\r\nmeeting the next week, with considerable applause from the board and\r\nsincere congratulations to the agent. He looked thinner and more sober\r\nthan usual, and several persons present, whose aid he had asked in\r\nprivate, knew very well the reason. After the meeting was over the\r\nsenior director, and largest stockholder, shook hands with him warmly.\r\n\r\n"About that matter you suggested to me the other day," he said, and\r\nthe agent looked up eagerly. "I consulted several of our board in\r\nregard to the propriety of it before we came down, but they all agreed\r\nwith me that it was no use to cross a bridge until you come to it.\r\nTimes look a little better, and the operatives will share in the\r\naccession of credit to a mill that declares nine per cent. this year.\r\nI hope that we shall be able to run the mills with at worst only a\r\nmoderate cut-down, and they may think themselves very fortunate when\r\nso many hands are being turned off everywhere."\r\n\r\nThe agent\'s face grew dark. "I hope that times will take a better\r\nturn," he managed to say.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," answered the director. "Good-bye to you, Mr. Agent! I am\r\nnot sure of seeing you again for some time," he added with unusual\r\nkindliness. "I am an old man now to be hurrying round to board\r\nmeetings and having anything to do with responsibilities like these.\r\nMy sons must take their turn."\r\n\r\nThere was an eager protest from the listeners, and presently the busy\r\ngroup of men disappeared on their way to the train. A nine per cent.\r\ndividend naturally made the Farley Manufacturing Company\'s stock go up\r\na good many points, and word came presently that the largest\r\nstockholder and one or two other men had sold out. Then the stock\r\nceased to rise, and winter came on apace, and the hard times which the\r\nagent had foreseen came also.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nOne noon in early March there were groups of men and women gathering\r\nin the Farley streets. For a wonder, nobody was hurrying toward home\r\nand dinner was growing cold on some of the long boarding-house tables.\r\n\r\n"They might have carried us through the cold weather; there\'s but a\r\nmonth more of it," said one middle-aged man sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be talking to us about economy now, some o\' them big\r\nthinkers; they\'ll say we ought to learn how to save; they always begin\r\nabout that quick as the work stops," said a youngish woman angrily.\r\nShe was better dressed than most of the group about her and had the\r\nkeen, impatient look of a leader. "They\'ll say that manufacturing is\r\ngoing to the dogs, and capital\'s in worse distress than labor--"\r\n\r\n"How is it those big railroads get along? They can\'t shut down,\r\nthere\'s none o\' them stops; they cut down sometimes when they have to,\r\nbut they don\'t turn off their help this way," complained somebody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n"Faith then! they don\'t know what justice is. They talk about their\r\njustice all so fine," said a pale-faced young Irishman--"justice is\r\nnine per cent. last year for the men that had the money and no rise at\r\nall for the men that did the work."\r\n\r\n"They say the shut-down\'s going to last all summer anyway. I\'m going\r\nto pack my kit to-night," said a young fellow who had just married and\r\nundertaken with unusual pride and ambition to keep house. "The likes\r\nof me can\'t be idle. But where to look for any work for a mule\r\nspinner, the Lord only knows!"\r\n\r\nEven the French were sobered for once and talked eagerly among\r\nthemselves. Halfway down the street, in front of the French grocery, a\r\nman was haranguing his compatriots from the top of a packing-box.\r\nEverybody was anxious and excited by the sudden news. No work after a\r\nweek from to-morrow until times were better. There had already been a\r\ncut-down, the mills had not been earning anything all winter. The\r\nagent had hoped to keep on for at least two months longer, and then to\r\nmake some scheme about running at half time in the summer, setting\r\naside the present work for simple yarn-making. He knew well enough\r\nthat the large families were scattered through the mill rooms and that\r\nany pay would be a help. Some of the young men could be put to other\r\nwork for the company; there was a huge tract of woodland farther back\r\namong the hills where some timber could be got ready for shipping. His\r\nmind was full of plans and anxieties and the telegram that morning\r\nstruck him like a blow. He had asked that he might keep the card-room\r\nprices up to where the best men could make at least six dollars and a\r\nhalf a week and was hoping for a straight answer, but the words on the\r\nyellow paper seemed to dance about and make him dizzy. "Shut down\r\nSaturday 9th until times are better!" he repeated to himself. "Shut\r\ndown until times are worse here in Farley!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agent stood at the counting-room window looking out at the\r\npiteous, defenseless groups that passed by. He wished bitterly that\r\nhis own pay stopped with the rest; it did not seem fair that he was\r\nnot thrown out upon the world too.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what they\'re going to do. They shall have the last cent\r\nI\'ve saved before anybody suffers," he said in his heart. But there\r\nwere tears in his eyes when he saw Mrs. Kilpatrick go limping out of\r\nthe gate. She waited a moment for her constant companion, poor little\r\nMaggie the doffer, and they went away up the street toward their poor\r\nlodging holding each other fast by the hand. Maggie\'s father and\r\ngrandfather and great-grandfather had all worked in the Farley mills;\r\nthey had left no heritage but work behind them for this orphan child;\r\nthey had never been able to save so much that a long illness, a\r\nprolonged old age, could not waste their slender hoards away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult for an outsider to understand the sudden\r\nplunge from decent comfort to actual poverty in this small mill town.\r\nStrange to say, it was upon the smaller families that the strain fell\r\nthe worst in Farley, and upon men and women who had nobody to look to\r\nbut themselves. Where a man had a large household of children and\r\nseveral of these were old enough to be at work, and to put aside their\r\nwages or pay for their board; where such a man was of a thrifty and\r\nsaving turn and a ruler of his household like old James Dow in the\r\ncloth-hall, he might feel sure of a comfortable hoard and be fearless\r\nof a rainy day. But with a young man who worked single-handed for his\r\nwife and a little flock, or one who had an invalid to work for, that\r\nheaviest of burdens to the poor, the door seemed to be shut and barred\r\nagainst prosperity, and life became a test of one\'s power of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agent went home late that noon from the counting-room. The street\r\nwas nearly empty, but he had no friendly look or word for anyone whom\r\nhe passed. Those who knew him well only pitied him, but it seemed to\r\nthe tired man as if every eye must look at him with reproach. The long\r\nmill buildings of gray stone with their rows of deep-set windows wore\r\na repellent look of strength and solidity. More than one man felt\r\nbitterly his own personal weakness as he turned to look at them. The\r\nocean of fate seemed to be dashing him against their gray walls--what\r\nuse was it to fight against the Corporation? Two great forces were in\r\nopposition now, and happiness could come only from their serving each\r\nother in harmony.\r\n\r\nThe stronger force of capital had withdrawn from the league; the\r\nweaker one, labor, was turned into an utter helplessness of idleness.\r\nThere was nothing to be done; you cannot rebel against a shut-down,\r\nyou can only submit.\r\n\r\nA week later the great wheel stopped early on the last day of work.\r\nAlmost everyone left his special charge of machinery in good order,\r\noiled and cleaned and slackened with a kind of affectionate lingering\r\ncare, for one person loves his machine as another loves his horse.\r\nEven little Maggie pushed her bobbin-box into a safe place near the\r\noverseer\'s desk and tipped it up and dusted it out with a handful of\r\nwaste. At the foot of the long winding stairs Mrs. Kilpatrick was\r\nputting away her broom, and she sighed as she locked the closet door;\r\nshe had known hard times before. "They\'ll be wanting me with odd jobs;\r\nwe\'ll be after getting along some way," she said with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"March is a long month, so it is--there\'ll be plinty time for change\r\nbefore the ind of it," said Mary Cassidy hopefully. "The agent will be\r\nthinking whatever can he do; sure he\'s very ingenious. Look at him how\r\nwell he persuaded the directors to l\'ave off wit\' making cotton cloth\r\nlike everybody else, and catch a chance wit\' all these new linings and\r\nthings! He\'s done very well, too. There bees no sinse in a shut-down\r\nanny way, the looms and cards all suffers and the bands all slacks if\r\nthey don\'t get stiff. I\'d sooner pay folks to tind their work whatever\r\nit cost."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis true for you," agreed Mrs. Kilpatrick.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll ye do wit\' the shild, now she\'s no chance of pay, any more?"\r\nasked Mary relentlessly, and poor Maggie\'s eyes grew dark with fright\r\nas the conversation abruptly pointed her way. She sometimes waked up\r\nin misery in Mrs. Kilpatrick\'s warm bed, crying for fear that she was\r\ngoing to be sent back to the poorhouse.\r\n\r\n"Maggie an\' me\'s going to kape together awhile yet," said the good old\r\nwoman fondly. "She\'s very handy for me, so she is. We \'on\'t part with\r\n\'ach other whativer befalls, so we \'on\'t," and Maggie looked up with a\r\nwistful smile, only half reassured. To her the shut-down seemed like\r\nthe end of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the French people took time by the forelock and boarded the\r\nmidnight train that very Saturday with all their possessions. A little\r\nlater two or three families departed by the same train, under cover of\r\nthe darkness between two days, without stopping to pay even their\r\nhouse rent. These mysterious flittings, like that of the famous Tartar\r\ntribe, roused a suspicion against their fellow countrymen, but after a\r\nsuccession of such departures almost everybody else thought it far\r\ncheaper to stay among friends. It seemed as if at any moment the great\r\nmill wheels might begin to turn, and the bell begin to ring, but day\r\nafter day the little town was still and the bell tolled the hours one\r\nafter another as if it were Sunday. The mild spring weather came on\r\nand the women sat mending or knitting on the doorsteps. More people\r\nmoved away; there were but few men and girls left now in the quiet\r\nboarding-houses, and the spare tables were stacked one upon another at\r\nthe end of the rooms. When planting-time came, word was passed about\r\nthe Corporation that the agent was going to portion out a field that\r\nbelonged to him a little way out of town on the South road, and let\r\nevery man who had a family take a good-sized piece to plant. He also\r\noffered seed potatoes and garden seeds free to anyone who would come\r\nand ask for them at his house. The poor are very generous to each\r\nother, as a rule, and there was much borrowing and lending from house\r\nto house, and it was wonderful how long the people seemed to continue\r\ntheir usual fashions of life without distress. Almost everybody had\r\nsaved a little bit of money and some had saved more; if one could no\r\nlonger buy beefsteak he could still buy flour and potatoes, and a bit\r\nof pork lent a pleasing flavor, to content an idle man who had nothing\r\nto do but to stroll about town.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nOne night the agent was sitting alone in his large, half-furnished\r\nhouse. Mary Moynahan, his housekeeper, had gone up to the church.\r\nThere was a timid knock at the door.\r\n\r\nThere were two persons waiting, a short, thick-set man and a pale\r\nwoman with dark, bright eyes who was nearly a head taller than her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Ellen; I\'m glad to see you," said the agent. "Have you got\r\nyour wheel-barrow, Mike?" Almost all the would-be planters of the\r\nfield had come under cover of darkness and contrived if possible to\r\navoid each other.\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t the potatoes we\'re after asking, sir," said Ellen. She was\r\nalways spokeswoman, for Mike had an impediment in his speech. "The\r\nchildher come up yisterday and got them while you\'d be down at the\r\ncounting-room. \'Twas Mary Moynahan saw to them. We do be very thankful\r\nto you, sir, for your kindness."\r\n\r\n"Come in," said the agent, seeing there was something of consequence\r\nto be said. Ellen Carroll and he had worked side by side many a long\r\nday when they were young. She had been a noble wife to Mike, whose\r\npoor fortunes she had gladly shared for sake of his good heart, though\r\nMike now and then paid too much respect to his often infirmities.\r\nThere was a slight flavor of whisky now on the evening air, but it was\r\na serious thing to put on your Sunday coat and go up with your wife to\r\nsee the agent.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve come wanting to talk about any chances there might be with the\r\nmill," ventured Ellen timidly, as she stood in the lighted room; then\r\nshe looked at Mike for reassurance. "We\'re very bad off, you see," she\r\nwent on. "Yes, sir, I got them potaties, but I had to bake a little of\r\nthem for supper and more again the day, for our breakfast. I don\'t\r\nknow whatever we\'ll do whin they\'re gone. The poor children does be\r\nentreating me for them, Dan!"\r\n\r\nThe mother\'s eyes were full of tears. It was very seldom now that\r\nanybody called the agent by his Christian name; there was a natural\r\nreserve and dignity about him, and there had come a definite\r\nseparation between him and most of his old friends in the two years\r\nwhile he had managed to go to the School of Technology in Boston.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you let me know it was bad as that?" he asked. "I don\'t\r\nmean that anybody here should suffer while I\'ve got a cent."\r\n\r\n"The folks don\'t like to be begging, sir," said Ellen sorrowfully,\r\n"but there\'s lots of them does be in trouble. They\'d ought to go away\r\nwhen the mills shut down, but for nobody knows where to go. Farley\r\nain\'t like them big towns where a man\'d pick up something else to do.\r\nI says to Mike: \'Come, Mike, let\'s go up after dark and tark to Dan;\r\nhe\'ll help us out if he can,\' says I--"\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Ellen," said the agent kindly, as the poor woman began to\r\ncry. He made her take the armchair which the weave-room girls had\r\ngiven him at Christmas two years before. She sat there covering her\r\nface with her hands, and trying to keep back her sobs and go quietly\r\non with what she had to say. Mike was sitting across the room with his\r\nback to the wall anxiously twirling his hat round and round. "Yis,\r\nwe\'re very bad off," he contrived to say after much futile stammering.\r\n"All the folks in the Corporation, but Mr. Dow, has got great bills\r\nrun up now at the stores, and thim that had money saved has lint to\r\nthim that hadn\'t--\'twill be long enough before anybody\'s free. Whin\r\nthe mills starts up we\'ll have to spind for everything at once. The\r\nchildren is very hard on their clothes and they\'re all dropping to\r\npieces. I thought I\'d have everything new for them this spring, they\r\ndo be growing so. I minds them and patches them the best I can." And\r\nagain Ellen was overcome by tears. "Mike an\' me\'s always been\r\nconthrivin\' how would we get something laid up, so if anny one would\r\ndie or be long sick we\'d be equal to it, but we\'ve had great pride to\r\nsee the little gerrls go looking as well as anny, and we\'ve worked\r\nvery steady, but there\'s so manny of us we\'ve had to pay rint for a\r\nlarge tenement and we\'d only seventeen dollars and a little more when\r\nthe shut-down was. Sure the likes of us has a right to earn more than\r\nour living, ourselves being so willing-hearted. \'Tis a long time now\r\nthat Mike\'s been steady. We always had the pride to hope we\'d own a\r\nhouse ourselves, and a pieceen o\' land, but I\'m thankful now--\'tis as\r\nwell for us; we\'ve no chances to pay taxes now."\r\n\r\nMike made a desperate effort to speak as his wife faltered and began\r\nto cry again, and seeing his distress forgot her own, and supplied the\r\nhalting words. "He wants to know if there\'s army work he could get,\r\nsome place else than Farley. Himself\'s been sixteen years now in the\r\npicker, first he was one of six and now he is one of the four since\r\nyou got the new machines, yourself knows it well."\r\n\r\nThe agent knew about Mike; he looked compassionate as he shook his\r\nhead. "Stay where you are, for a while at any rate. Things may look a\r\nlittle better, it seems to me. We will start up as soon as anyone\r\ndoes. I\'ll allow you twenty dollars a month after this; here are ten\r\nto start with. No, no, I\'ve got no one depending on me and my pay is\r\ngoing on. I\'m glad to share it with my friends. Tell the folks to come\r\nup and see me, Ahern and Sullivan and Michel and your brother Con;\r\ntell anybody you know who is really in distress. You\'ve all stood by\r\nme!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis all the lazy ones \'ould be coming if we told on the poor boy,"\r\nsaid Ellen gratefully, as they hurried home. "Ain\'t he got the good\r\nheart? We\'d ought to be very discrate, Mike!" and Mike agreed by a\r\nmost impatient gesture, but by the time summer had begun to wane the\r\nagent was a far poorer man than when it had begun. Mike and Ellen\r\nCarroll were only the leaders of a sorrowful procession that sought\r\nhis door evening after evening. Some asked for help who might have\r\ndone without it, but others were saved from actual want. There were a\r\nfew men who got work among the farms, but there was little steady\r\nwork. The agent made the most of odd jobs about the mill yards and\r\ncontrived somehow or other to give almost every household a lift. The\r\nvillage looked more and more dull and forlorn, but in August, when a\r\ntraveling show ventured to give a performance in Farley, the\r\nCorporation hall was filled as it seldom was filled in prosperous\r\ntimes. This made the agent wonder, until he followed the crowd of\r\nworkless, sadly idle men and women into the place of entertainment and\r\nlooked at them with a sudden comprehension that they were spending\r\ntheir last cent for a little cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThe agent was going into the counting-room one day when he met old\r\nFather Daley and they stopped for a bit of friendly talk.\r\n\r\n"Could you come in for a few minutes, sir?" asked the younger man.\r\n"There\'s nobody in the counting-room."\r\n\r\nThe busy priest looked up at the weather-beaten clock in the mill\r\ntower.\r\n\r\n"I can," he said. "\'Tis not so late as I thought. We\'ll soon be having\r\nthe mail."\r\n\r\nThe agent led the way and brought one of the directors\' comfortable\r\nchairs from their committee-room. Then he spun his own chair\r\nface-about from before his desk and they sat down. It was a warm day\r\nin the middle of September. The windows were wide open on the side\r\ntoward the river and there was a flicker of light on the ceiling from\r\nthe sunny water. The noise of the fall was loud and incessant in the\r\nroom. Somehow one never noticed it very much when the mills were\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n"How are the Duffys?" asked the agent.\r\n\r\n"Very bad," answered the old priest gravely. "The doctor sent for\r\nme--he couldn\'t get them to take any medicine. He says that it isn\'t\r\ntyphoid; only a low fever among them from bad food and want of care.\r\nThat tenement is very old and bad, the drains from the upper tenement\r\nhave leaked and spoiled the whole west side of the building. I suppose\r\nthey never told you of it?"\r\n\r\n"I did the best I could about it last spring," said the agent. "They\r\nwere afraid of being turned out and they hid it for that reason. The\r\ncompany allowed me something for repairs as usual and I tried to get\r\nmore; you see I spent it all before I knew what a summer was before\r\nus. Whatever I have done since I have paid for, except what they call\r\nlegitimate work and care of property. Last year I put all Maple Street\r\ninto first-rate order--and meant to go right through the Corporation.\r\nI\'ve done the best I could," he protested with a bright spot of color\r\nin his cheeks. "Some of the men have tinkered up their tenements and I\r\nhave counted it toward the rent, but they don\'t all know how to drive\r\na nail."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis true for you; you have done the best you could," said the priest\r\nheartily, and both the men were silent, while the river, which was\r\nolder than they and had seen a whole race of men disappear before they\r\ncame--the river took this opportunity to speak louder than ever.\r\n\r\n"I think that manufacturing prospects look a little brighter," said\r\nthe agent, wishing to be cheerful. "There are some good orders out,\r\nbut of course the buyers can take advantage of our condition. The\r\ntreasurer writes me that we must be firm about not starting up until\r\nwe are sure of business on a good paying margin."\r\n\r\n"Like last year\'s?" asked the priest, who was resting himself in the\r\narmchair. There was a friendly twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Like last year\'s," answered the agent. "I worked like two men, and I\r\npushed the mills hard to make that large profit. I saw there was\r\ntrouble coming, and I told the directors and asked for a special\r\nsurplus, but I had no idea of anything like this."\r\n\r\n"Nine per cent. in these times was too good a prize," said Father\r\nDaley, but the twinkle in his eyes had suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t get your new church for a long time yet," said the agent.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said the old man impatiently. "I have kept the foundations\r\ngoing as well as I could, and the talk, for their own sakes. It gives\r\nthem something to think about. I took the money they gave me in\r\ncollections and let them have it back again for work. \'Tis well to\r\nlead their minds," and he gave a quick glance at the agent. "\'Tis no\r\npride of mine for church-building and no good credit with the bishop\r\nI\'m after. Young men can be satisfied with those things, not an old\r\npriest like me that prays to be a father to his people."\r\n\r\nFather Daley spoke as man speaks to man, straight out of an honest\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"I see many things now that I used to be blind about long ago," he\r\nsaid. "You may take a man who comes over, him and his wife. They fall\r\nupon good wages and their heads are turned with joy. They\'ve been\r\nhungry for generations back and they\'ve always seen those above them\r\nwho dressed fine and lived soft, and they want a taste of luxury too;\r\nthey\'re bound to satisfy themselves. So they\'ll spend and spend and\r\nhave beefsteak for dinner every day just because they never had enough\r\nbefore, but they\'d turn into wild beasts of selfishness, most of \'em,\r\nif they had no check. \'Tis there the church steps in. \'Remember your\r\nMaker and do Him honor in His house of prayer,\' says she. \'Be\r\nself-denying, be thinking of eternity and of what\'s sure to come!\' And\r\nyou will join with me in believing that it\'s never those who have\r\ngiven most to the church who come first to the ground in a hard time\r\nlike this. Show me a good church and I\'ll show you a thrifty people."\r\nFather Daley looked eagerly at the agent for sympathy.\r\n\r\n"You speak the truth, sir," said the agent. "Those that give most are\r\nalways the last to hold out with honest independence and the first to\r\ndo for others."\r\n\r\n"Some priests may have plundered their parishes for pride\'s sake;\r\nthere\'s no saying what is in poor human nature," repeated Father Daley\r\nearnestly. "God forgive us all for unprofitable servants of Him and\r\nHis church. I believe in saying more about prayer and right living,\r\nand less about collections, in God\'s house, but it\'s the giving hand\r\nthat\'s the rich hand all the world over."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Ireland has ever sent us over many misers; Saint\r\nPatrick must have banished them all with the snakes," suggested the\r\nagent with a grim smile. The priest shook his head and laughed a\r\nlittle and then both men were silent again in the counting-room.\r\n\r\nThe mail train whistled noisily up the road and came into the station\r\nat the end of the empty street, then it rang its loud bell and puffed\r\nand whistled away again.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bring your mail over, sir," said the agent, presently. "Sit here\r\nand rest yourself until I come back and we\'ll walk home together."\r\n\r\nThe leather mail-bag looked thin and flat and the leisurely postmaster\r\nhad nearly distributed its contents by the time the agent had crossed\r\nthe street and reached the office. His clerks were both off on a long\r\nholiday; they were brothers and were glad of the chance to take their\r\nvacations together. They had been on lower pay; there was little to\r\ndo in the counting-room--hardly anybody\'s time to keep or even a\r\nletter to write.\r\n\r\nTwo or three loiterers stopped the agent to ask him the usual question\r\nif there were any signs of starting up; an old farmer who sat in his\r\nlong wagon before the post-office asked for news too, and touched his\r\nhat with an awkward sort of military salute.\r\n\r\n"Come out to our place and stop a few days," he said kindly. "You look\r\nkind of pinched up and bleached out, Mr. Agent; you can\'t be needed\r\nmuch here."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could come," said the agent, stopping again and looking up\r\nat the old man with a boyish, expectant face. Nobody had happened to\r\nthink about him in just that way, and he was far from thinking about\r\nhimself. "I\'ve got to keep an eye on the people that are left here;\r\nyou see they\'ve had a pretty hard summer."\r\n\r\n"Not so hard as you have!" said the old man, as the agent went along\r\nthe street. "You\'ve never had a day of rest more than once or twice\r\nsince you were born!"\r\n\r\nThere were two letters and a pamphlet for Father Daley and a thin\r\nhandful of circulars for the company. In busy times there was often\r\nall the mail matter that a clerk could bring. The agent sat down at\r\nhis desk in the counting-room and the priest opened a thick foreign\r\nletter with evident pleasure. "\'Tis from an old friend of mine; he\'s\r\nin a monastery in France," he said. "I only hear from him once a\r\nyear," and Father Daley settled himself in his armchair to read the\r\nclose-written pages. As for the agent of the mills, he had quickly\r\nopened a letter from the treasurer and was not listening to anything\r\nthat was said.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he whirled round in his desk chair and held out the letter to\r\nthe priest. His hand shook and his face was as pale as ashes.\r\n\r\n"What is it? What\'s the matter?" cried the startled old man, who had\r\nhardly followed the first pious salutations of his own letter to their\r\nend. "Read it to me yourself, Dan; is there any trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Orders--I\'ve got orders to start up; we\'re going to start--I wrote\r\nthem last week--"\r\n\r\nBut the agent had to spring up from his chair and go to the window\r\nnext the river before he could steady his voice to speak. He thought\r\nit was the look of the moving water that made him dizzy. "We\'re going\r\nto start up the mills as soon as I can get things ready." He turned to\r\nlook up at the thermometer as if it were the most important thing in\r\nthe world; then the color rushed to his face and he leaned a moment\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" said the old priest devoutly. "Here, come and sit down,\r\nmy boy. Faith, but it\'s good news, and I\'m the first to get it from\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThey shook hands and were cheerful together; the foreign letter was\r\ncrammed into Father Daley\'s pocket, and he reached for his big cane.\r\n\r\n"Tell everybody as you go up the street, sir," said Dan. "I\'ve got a\r\nhurricane of things to see to; I must go the other way down to the\r\nstorehouses. Tell them to pass the good news about town as fast as\r\nthey can; \'twill hearten up the women." All the anxious look had gone\r\nas if by magic from the agent\'s face.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo weeks from that time the old mill bell stopped tolling for the\r\nslow hours of idleness and rang out loud and clear for the\r\nhousekeepers to get up, and rang for breakfast, and later still for\r\nall the people to go in to work. Some of the old hands were gone for\r\ngood and new ones must be broken in in their places, but there were\r\nmany familiar faces to pass the counting-room windows into the mill\r\nyard. There were French families which had reappeared with surprising\r\npromptness, Michel and his pretty daughter were there, and a household\r\nof cousins who had come to the next tenement. The agent stood with his\r\nhands in his pockets and nodded soberly to one group after another. It\r\nseemed to him that he had never felt so happy in his life.\r\n\r\n"Jolly-looking set this morning," said one of the clerks whose desk\r\nwas close beside the window; he was a son of one of the directors, who\r\nhad sent him to the agent to learn something about manufacturing.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve had a bitter hard summer that you know nothing about," said\r\nthe agent slowly.\r\n\r\nJust then Mrs. Kilpatrick and old Mary Cassidy came along, and little\r\nMaggie was with them. She had got back her old chance at doffing and\r\nthe hard times were over. They all smiled with such blissful\r\nsatisfaction that the agent smiled too, and even waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Transcriber\'s Note: This e-book was excerpted from a modern\r\n   reprint of works.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
