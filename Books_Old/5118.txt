CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDILLSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI never could understand why anybody should ever have begun to live\r\nat Dillsborough, or why the population there should have been at any\r\ntime recruited by new comers. That a man with a family should cling\r\nto a house in which he has once established himself is intelligible.\r\nThe butcher who supplied Dillsborough, or the baker, or the\r\nironmonger, though he might not drive what is called a roaring trade,\r\nnevertheless found himself probably able to live, and might well\r\nhesitate before he would encounter the dangers of a more energetic\r\nlocality. But how it came to pass that he first got himself to\r\nDillsborough, or his father, or his grandfather before him, has\r\nalways been a mystery to me. The town has no attractions, and never\r\nhad any. It does not stand on a bed of coal and has no connection\r\nwith iron. It has no water peculiarly adapted for beer, or for\r\ndyeing, or for the cure of maladies. It is not surrounded by beauty\r\nof scenery strong enough to bring tourists and holiday travellers.\r\nThere is no cathedral there to form, with its bishops, prebendaries,\r\nand minor canons, the nucleus of a clerical circle. It manufactures\r\nnothing specially. It has no great horse fair, or cattle fair, or\r\neven pig market of special notoriety. Every Saturday farmers and\r\ngraziers and buyers of corn and sheep do congregate in a sleepy\r\nfashion about the streets, but Dillsborough has no character of its\r\nown, even as a market town. Its chief glory is its parish church,\r\nwhich is ancient and inconvenient, having not as yet received any of\r\nthose modern improvements which have of late become common throughout\r\nEngland; but its parish church, though remarkable, is hardly\r\ncelebrated. The town consists chiefly of one street which is over a\r\nmile long, with a square or market-place in the middle, round which\r\na few lanes with queer old names are congregated, and a second small\r\nopen space among these lanes, in which the church stands. As you\r\npass along the street north-west, away from the railway station and\r\nfrom London, there is a steep hill, beginning to rise just beyond\r\nthe market-place. Up to that point it is the High Street, thence\r\nit is called Bullock\'s Hill. Beyond that you come to Norrington\r\nRoad,--Norrington being the next town, distant from Dillsborough\r\nabout twelve miles. Dillsborough, however, stands in the county of\r\nRufford, whereas at the top of Bullock\'s Hill you enter the county\r\nof Ufford, of which Norrington is the assize town. The Dillsborough\r\npeople are therefore divided, some two thousand five hundred of\r\nthem belonging to Rufford, and the remaining five hundred to the\r\nneighbouring county. This accident has given rise to not a few\r\nfeuds, Ufford being a large county, with pottery, and ribbons,\r\nand watches going on in the farther confines; whereas Rufford is\r\nsmall and thoroughly agricultural. The men at the top of Bullock\'s\r\nHill are therefore disposed to think themselves better than their\r\nfellow-townsfolks, though they are small in number and not specially\r\nthriving in their circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt every interval of ten years, when the census is taken, the\r\npopulation of Dillsborough is always found to have fallen off in some\r\nslight degree. For a few months after the publication of the figures\r\na slight tinge of melancholy comes upon the town. The landlord of the\r\nBush Inn, who is really an enterprising man in his way and who has\r\nlooked about in every direction for new sources of business, becomes\r\ntaciturn for a while and forgets to smile upon comers; Mr. Ribbs,\r\nthe butcher, tells his wife that it is out of the question that she\r\nand the children should take that long-talked-of journey to the\r\nsea-coast; and Mr. Gregory Masters, the well-known old-established\r\nattorney of Dillsborough, whispers to some confidential friend that\r\nhe might as well take down his plate and shut up his house. But in a\r\nmonth or two all that is forgotten, and new hopes spring up even in\r\nDillsborough; Mr. Runciman at the Bush is putting up new stables for\r\nhunting-horses, that being the special trade for which he now finds\r\nthat there is an opening; Mrs. Ribbs is again allowed to suggest\r\nMare-Slocumb; and Mr. Masters goes on as he has done for the last\r\nforty years, making the best he can of a decreasing business.\r\n\r\nDillsborough is built chiefly of brick, and is, in its own way,\r\nsolid enough. The Bush, which in the time of the present landlord\'s\r\nfather was one of the best posting inns on the road, is not only\r\nsubstantial, but almost handsome. A broad coach way, cut through the\r\nmiddle of the house, leads into a spacious, well-kept, clean yard,\r\nand on each side of the coach way there are bay windows looking into\r\nthe street,--the one belonging to the commercial parlour, and the\r\nother to the so-called coffee-room. But the coffee-room has in truth\r\nfallen away from its former purposes, and is now used for a farmer\'s\r\nordinary on market days, and other similar purposes. Travellers who\r\nrequire the use of a public sitting-room must all congregate in the\r\ncommercial parlour at the Bush. So far the interior of the house has\r\nfallen from its past greatness. But the exterior is maintained with\r\nmuch care. The brickwork up to the eaves is well pointed, fresh, and\r\ncomfortable to look at. In front of the carriage-way swings on two\r\nmassive supports the old sign of the Bush, as to which it may be\r\ndoubted whether even Mr. Runciman himself knows that it has swung\r\nthere, or been displayed in some fashion, since it was the custom for\r\nthe landlord to beat up wine to freshen it before it was given to the\r\ncustomers to drink. The church, too, is of brick--though the tower\r\nand chancel are of stone. The attorney\'s house is of brick, which\r\nshall not be more particularly described now as many of the scenes\r\nwhich these pages will have to describe were acted there; and almost\r\nthe entire High Street in the centre of the town was brick also.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable house in Dillsborough was one standing in a\r\nshort thoroughfare called Hobbs Gate, leading down by the side of the\r\nBush Inn from the market-place to Church Square, as it is called. As\r\nyou pass down towards the church this house is on the right hand, and\r\nit occupies with its garden the whole space between the market-place\r\nand Church Square. But though the house enjoys the privilege of a\r\nlarge garden,--so large that the land being in the middle of a town\r\nwould be of great value were it not that Dillsborough is in its\r\ndecadence,--still it stands flush up to the street upon which the\r\nfront door opens. It has an imposing flight of stone steps guarded\r\nby iron rails leading up to it, and on each side of the door there\r\nis a row of three windows, and on the two upper stories rows of\r\nseven windows. Over the door there is a covering, on which there are\r\ngrotesquely-formed, carved wooden faces; and over the centre of each\r\nwindow, let into the brickwork, is a carved stone. There are also\r\nnumerous underground windows, sunk below the earth and protected\r\nby iron railings. Altogether the house is one which cannot fail to\r\nattract attention; and in the brickwork is clearly marked the date,\r\n1701,--not the very best period for English architecture as regards\r\nbeauty, but one in which walls and roofs, ceilings and buttresses,\r\nwere built more substantially than they are to-day. This was the only\r\nhouse in Dillsborough which had a name of its own, and it was called\r\nHoppet Hall, the Dillsborough chronicles telling that it had been\r\noriginally built for and inhabited by the Hoppet family. The only\r\nHoppet now left in Dillsborough is old Joe Hoppet, the ostler at the\r\nBush; and the house, as was well known, had belonged to some member\r\nof the Morton family for the last hundred years at least. The garden\r\nand ground it stands upon comprise three acres, all of which are\r\nsurrounded by a high brick wall, which is supposed to be coeval\r\nwith the house. The best Ribston pippins,--some people say the only\r\nreal Ribston pippins,--in all Rufford are to be found here, and its\r\nBurgundy pears and walnuts are almost equally celebrated. There are\r\nrumours also that its roses beat everything in the way of roses for\r\nten miles round. But in these days very few strangers are admitted\r\nto see the Hoppet Hall roses. The pears and apples do make their way\r\nout, and are distributed either by Mrs. Masters, the attorney\'s wife,\r\nor Mr. Runciman, the innkeeper. The present occupier of the house\r\nis a certain Mr. Reginald Morton, with whom we shall also be much\r\nconcerned in these pages, but whose introduction to the reader shall\r\nbe postponed for awhile.\r\n\r\nThe land around Dillsborough is chiefly owned by two landlords, of\r\nwhom the greatest and richest is Lord Rufford. He, however, does not\r\nlive near the town, but away at the other side of the county, and is\r\nnot much seen in these parts unless when the hounds bring him here,\r\nor when, with two or three friends, he will sometimes stay for a few\r\ndays at the Bush Inn for the sake of shooting the coverts. He is much\r\nliked by all sporting men, but is not otherwise very popular with\r\nthe people round Dillsborough. A landlord if he wishes to be popular\r\nshould be seen frequently. If he lives among his farmers they will\r\nswear by him, even though he raises his rental every ten or twelve\r\nyears and never puts a new roof to a barn for them. Lord Rufford is\r\na rich man who thinks of nothing but sport in all its various shapes,\r\nfrom pigeon-shooting at Hurlingham to the slaughter of elephants in\r\nAfrica; and though he is lenient in all his dealings, is not much\r\nthought of in the Dillsborough side of the county, except by those\r\nwho go out with the hounds. At Rufford, where he generally has a full\r\nhouse for three months in the year and spends a vast amount of money,\r\nhe is more highly considered.\r\n\r\nThe other extensive landlord is Mr. John Morton, a young man, who, in\r\nspite of his position as squire of Bragton, owner of Bragton Park,\r\nand landlord of the entire parishes of Bragton and Mallingham,--the\r\nlatter of which comes close up to the confines of Dillsborough,--was\r\nat the time at which our story begins, Secretary of Legation at\r\nWashington. As he had been an absentee since he came of age,--soon\r\nafter which time he inherited the property,--he had been almost\r\nless liked in the neighbourhood than the lord. Indeed, no one in\r\nDillsborough knew much about him, although Bragton Hall was but four\r\nmiles from the town, and the Mortons had possessed the property\r\nand lived on it for the last three centuries. But there had been\r\nextravagance, as will hereafter have to be told, and there had been\r\nno continuous residence at Bragton since the death of old Reginald\r\nMorton, who had been the best known and the best loved of all the\r\nsquires in Rufford, and had for many years been master of the\r\nRufford hounds. He had lived to a very great age, and, though the\r\ngreat-grandfather of the present man, had not been dead above twenty\r\nyears. He was the man of whom the older inhabitants of Dillsborough\r\nand the neighbourhood still thought and still spoke when they gave\r\nvent to their feelings in favour of gentlemen. And yet the old\r\nsquire in his latter days had been able to do little or nothing\r\nfor them,--being sometimes backward as to the payment of money he\r\nowed among them. But he had lived all his days at Bragton Park,\r\nand his figure had been familiar to all eyes in the High Street of\r\nDillsborough and at the front entrance of the Bush. People still\r\nspoke of old Mr. Reginald Morton as though his death had been a sore\r\nloss to the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAnd there were in the country round sundry yeomen, as they ought\r\nto be called,--gentlemen-farmers as they now like to style\r\nthemselves,--men who owned some acres of land, and farmed these acres\r\nthemselves. Of these we may specially mention Mr. Lawrence Twentyman,\r\nwho was quite the gentleman-farmer. He possessed over three hundred\r\nacres of land, on which his father had built an excellent house. The\r\npresent Mr. Twentyman,--Lawrence Twentyman, Esquire, as he was called\r\nby everybody,--was by no means unpopular in the neighbourhood. He not\r\nonly rode well to hounds but paid twenty-five pounds annually to the\r\nhunt, which entitled him to feel quite at home in his red coat. He\r\ngenerally owned a racing colt or two, and attended meetings; but was\r\nsupposed to know what he was about, and to have kept safely the five\r\nor six thousand pounds which his father had left him. And his farming\r\nwas well done; for though he was, out-and-out, a gentleman-farmer,\r\nhe knew how to get the full worth in work done for the fourteen\r\nshillings a week which he paid to his labourers,--a deficiency in\r\nwhich knowledge is the cause why gentlemen in general find farming so\r\nexpensive an amusement. He was a handsome, good-looking man of about\r\nthirty, and would have been a happy man had he not been too ambitious\r\nin his aspirations after gentry. He had been at school for three\r\nyears at Cheltenham College, which, together with his money and\r\nappearance and undoubted freehold property, should, he thought, have\r\nmade his position quite secure to him; but, though he sometimes\r\ncalled young Hampton of Hampton Wick "Hampton," and the son of the\r\nrector of Dillsborough "Mainwaring," and always called the rich young\r\nbrewers from Norrington "Botsey,"--partners in the well-known firm of\r\nBillbrook & Botsey; and though they in return called him "Larry" and\r\nadmitted the intimacy, still he did not get into their houses. And\r\nLord Rufford, when he came into the neighbourhood, never asked him to\r\ndine at the Bush. And--worst of all,--some of the sporting men and\r\nothers in the neighbourhood, who decidedly were not gentlemen, also\r\ncalled him "Larry." Mr. Runciman always did so. Twenty or twenty-five\r\nyears ago Runciman had been his father\'s special friend,--before\r\nthe house had been built and before the days at Cheltenham College.\r\nRemembering this Lawrence was too good a fellow to rebuke Runciman;\r\nbut to younger men of that class he would sometimes make himself\r\nobjectionable. There was another keeper of hunting stables, a younger\r\nman, named Stubbings, living at Stanton Corner, a great hunting\r\nrendezvous about four miles from Dillsborough; and not long since\r\nTwentyman had threatened to lay his whip across Stubbings\' shoulders\r\nif Stubbings ever called him "Larry" again. Stubbings, who was a\r\nlittle man and rode races, only laughed at Mr. Twentyman who was six\r\nfeet high, and told the story round to all the hunt. Mr. Twentyman\r\nwas more laughed at than perhaps he deserved. A man should not have\r\nhis Christian name used by every Tom and Dick without his sanction.\r\nBut the difficulty is one to which men in the position of Mr.\r\nLawrence Twentyman are often subject.\r\n\r\nThose whom I have named, together with Mr. Mainwaring the rector,\r\nand Mr. Surtees his curate, made up the very sparse aristocracy of\r\nDillsborough. The Hamptons of Hampton Wick were Ufford men, and\r\nbelonged rather to Norrington than Dillsborough. The Botseys, also\r\nfrom Norrington, were members of the U. R. U., or Ufford and Rufford\r\nUnited Hunt Club; but they did not much affect Dillsborough as a\r\ntown. Mr. Mainwaring, who has been mentioned, lived in another brick\r\nhouse behind the church,--the old parsonage of St. John\'s. There\r\nwas also a Mrs. Mainwaring, but she was an invalid. Their family\r\nconsisted of one son, who was at Brasenose at this time. He always\r\nhad a horse during the Christmas vacation, and if rumour did not\r\nbelie him, kept two or three up at Oxford. Mr. Surtees, the curate,\r\nlived in lodgings in the town. He was a painstaking, eager, clever\r\nyoung man, with aspirations in church matters, which were always\r\nbeing checked by his rector. Quieta non movere was the motto by which\r\nthe rector governed his life, and he certainly was not at all the man\r\nto allow his curate to drive him into activity.\r\n\r\nSuch, at the time of our story, was the little town of Dillsborough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE MORTON FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can hardly describe accurately the exact position of the Masters\r\nfamily without first telling all that I know about the Morton family;\r\nand it is absolutely essential that the reader should know all the\r\nMasters family intimately. Mr. Masters, as I have said in the last\r\nchapter, was the attorney in Dillsborough, and the Mortons had been\r\nfor centuries past the squires of Bragton.\r\n\r\nI need not take the reader back farther than old Reginald Morton.\r\nHe had come to the throne of his family as a young man, and had sat\r\nupon it for more than half a century. He had been a squire of the old\r\ntimes, having no inclination for London seasons, never wishing to\r\nkeep up a second house, quite content with his position as squire of\r\nBragton, but with considerable pride about him as to that position.\r\nHe had always liked to have his house full, and had hated petty\r\noeconomies. He had for many years hunted the county at his own\r\nexpense,--the amusement at first not having been so expensive as it\r\nafterwards became. When he began the work, it had been considered\r\nsufficient to hunt twice a week. Now the Rufford and Ufford\r\nhounds have four days, and sometimes a bye. It went much against\r\nMr. Reginald Morton\'s pride when he was first driven to take a\r\nsubscription.\r\n\r\nBut the temporary distress into which the family fell was caused not\r\nso much by his own extravagance as by that of two sons, and by his\r\nindulgence in regard to them. He had three children, none of whom\r\nwere very fortunate in life. The eldest, John, married the daughter\r\nof a peer, stood for Parliament, had one son, and died before he was\r\nforty, owing something over L20,000. The estate was then worth L7,000\r\na year. Certain lands not lying either in Bragton or Mallingham were\r\nsold, and that difficulty was surmounted, not without a considerable\r\ndiminution of income. In process of time the grandson, who was a\r\nsecond John Morton, grew up and married, and became the father of a\r\nthird John Morton, the young man who afterwards became owner of the\r\nproperty and Secretary of Legation at Washington. But the old squire\r\noutlived his son and his grandson, and when he died had three or\r\nfour great-grandchildren playing about the lawns of Bragton Park.\r\nThe peer\'s daughter had lived, and had for many years drawn a dower\r\nfrom the Bragton property, and had been altogether a very heavy\r\nincumbrance.\r\n\r\nBut the great trial of the old man\'s life, as also the great romance,\r\nhad arisen from the career of his second son, Reginald. Of all his\r\nchildren, Reginald had been the dearest to him. He went to Oxford,\r\nand had there spent much money; not as young men now spend money,\r\nbut still to an extent that had been grievous to the old squire. But\r\neverything was always paid for Reginald. It was necessary, of course,\r\nthat he should have a profession, and he took a commission in the\r\narmy. As a young man he went to Canada. This was in 1829, when all\r\nthe world was at peace, and his only achievement in Canada was to\r\nmarry a young woman who is reported to have been pretty and good, but\r\nwho had no advantages either of fortune or birth. She was, indeed,\r\nthe daughter of a bankrupt innkeeper in Montreal. Soon after this\r\nhe sold out and brought his wife home to Bragton. It was at this\r\nperiod of the squire\'s life that the romance spoken of occurred. John\r\nMorton, the brother with the aristocratic wife, was ten or twelve\r\nyears older than Reginald, and at this time lived chiefly at Bragton\r\nwhen he was not in town. He was, perhaps, justified in regarding\r\nBragton as almost belonging to him, knowing as he did that it must\r\nbelong to him after his father\'s lifetime, and to his son after him.\r\nHis anger against his brother was hot, and that of his wife still\r\nhotter. He himself had squandered thousands, but then he was the\r\nheir. Reginald, who was only a younger brother, had sold his\r\ncommission. And then he had done so much more than this! He had\r\nmarried a woman who was not a lady! John was clearly of opinion\r\nthat at any rate the wife should not be admitted into Bragton House.\r\nThe old squire in those days was not a happy man; he had never been\r\nvery strong-minded, but now he was strong enough to declare that\r\nhis house-door should not be shut against a son of his,--or a son\'s\r\nwife, as long as she was honest. Hereupon the Honourable Mrs. Morton\r\ntook her departure, and was never seen at Bragton again in the old\r\nsquire\'s time. Reginald Morton came to the house, and soon afterwards\r\nanother little Reginald was born at Bragton Park. This happened as\r\nlong ago as 1835, twenty years before the death of the old squire.\r\n\r\nBut there had been another child, a daughter, who had come between\r\nthe two sons, still living in these days, who will become known to\r\nany reader who will have patience to follow these pages to the end.\r\nShe married, not very early in life, a certain Sir William Ushant,\r\nwho was employed by his country in India and elsewhere, but who\r\nfound, soon after his marriage, that the service of his country\r\nrequired that he should generally leave his wife at Bragton. As her\r\nfather had been for many years a widower, Lady Ushant became the\r\nmistress of the house.\r\n\r\nBut death was very busy with the Mortons. Almost every one died,\r\nexcept the squire himself and his daughter, and that honourable\r\ndowager, with her income and her pride who could certainly very well\r\nhave been spared. When at last, in 1855, the old squire went, full of\r\nyears, full of respect, but laden also with debts and money troubles,\r\nnot only had his son John, and his grandson John, gone before him,\r\nbut Reginald and his wife were both lying in Bragton Churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe elder branch of the family, John the great-grandson, and\r\nhis little sisters, were at once taken away from Bragton by the\r\nhonourable grandmother. John, who was then about seven years old,\r\nwas of course the young squire, and was the owner of the property.\r\nThe dowager, therefore, did not undertake an altogether unprofitable\r\nburden. Lady Ushant was left at the house, and with Lady Ushant, or\r\nrather immediately subject to her care, young Reginald Morton, who\r\nwas then nineteen years of age, and who was about to go to Oxford.\r\nBut there immediately sprang up family lawsuits, instigated by the\r\nhonourable lady on behalf of her grandchildren, of which Reginald\r\nMorton was the object. The old man had left certain outlying\r\nproperties to his grandson Reginald, of which Hoppet Hall was a part.\r\nFor eight or ten years the lawsuit was continued, and much money was\r\nexpended. Reginald was at last successful, and became the undoubted\r\nowner of Hoppet Hall; but in the meantime he went to Germany for his\r\neducation, instead of to Oxford, and remained abroad even after the\r\nmatter was decided,--living, no one but Lady Ushant knew where, or\r\nafter what fashion.\r\n\r\nWhen the old squire died the children were taken away, and Bragton\r\nwas nearly deserted. The young heir was brought up with every\r\ncaution, and, under the auspices of his grandmother and her family,\r\nbehaved himself very unlike the old Mortons. He was educated at\r\nEton, after leaving which he was at once examined for Foreign Office\r\nemployment, and commenced his career with great eclat. He had been\r\nmade to understand clearly that it would be better that he should not\r\nenter in upon his squirearchy early in life. The estate when he came\r\nof age had already had some years to recover itself, and as he went\r\nfrom capital to capital, he was quite content to draw from it an\r\nincome which enabled him to shine with peculiar brilliance among his\r\nbrethren. He had visited Bragton once since the old squire\'s death,\r\nand had found the place very dull and uninviting. He had no ambition\r\nwhatever to be master of the U. R. U.; but did look forward to a time\r\nwhen he might be Minister Plenipotentiary at some foreign court.\r\n\r\nFor many years after the old man\'s death, Lady Ushant, who was then a\r\nwidow, was allowed to live at Bragton. She was herself childless, and\r\nbeing now robbed of her great-nephews and nieces, took a little girl\r\nto live with her, named Mary Masters. It was a very desolate house\r\nin those days, but the old lady was careful as to the education of\r\nthe child, and did her best to make the home happy for her. Some two\r\nor three years before the commencement of this story there arose a\r\ndifference between the manager of the property and Lady Ushant, and\r\nshe was made to understand, after some half-courteous manner, that\r\nBragton house and park would do better without her. There would\r\nbe no longer any cows kept, and painters must come into the house,\r\nand there were difficulties about fuel. She was not turned out\r\nexactly; but she went and established herself in lonely lodgings at\r\nCheltenham. Then Mary Masters, who had lived for more than a dozen\r\nyears at Bragton, went back to her father\'s house in Dillsborough.\r\n\r\nAny reader with an aptitude for family pedigrees will now understand\r\nthat Reginald, Master of Hoppet Hall, was first cousin to the father\r\nof the Foreign Office paragon, and that he is therefore the paragon\'s\r\nfirst cousin once removed. The relationship is not very distant, but\r\nthe two men, one of whom was a dozen years older than the other, had\r\nnot seen each other for more than twenty years,--at a time when one\r\nof them was a big boy, and the other a very little one; and during\r\nthe greater part of that time a lawsuit had been carried on between\r\nthem in a very rigorous manner. It had done much to injure both, and\r\nhad created such a feeling of hostility that no intercourse of any\r\nkind now existed between them.\r\n\r\nIt does not much concern us to know how far back should be dated the\r\nbeginning of the connection between the Morton family and that of\r\nMr. Masters, the attorney; but it is certain that the first attorney\r\nof that name in Dillsborough became learned in the law through the\r\npatronage of some former Morton. The father of the present Gregory\r\nMasters, and the grandfather, had been thoroughly trusted and\r\nemployed by old Reginald Morton, and the former of the two had made\r\nhis will. Very much of the stewardship and management of the property\r\nhad been in their hands, and they had thriven as honest men, but\r\nas men with a tolerably sharp eye to their own interests. The late\r\nMr. Masters had died a few years before the squire, and the present\r\nattorney had seemed to succeed to these family blessings. But the\r\nwhole order of things became changed. Within a few weeks of the\r\nsquire\'s death Mr. Masters found that he was to be entrusted no\r\nfurther with the affairs of the property, but that, in lieu of such\r\ncare, was thrown upon him the task of defending the will which he\r\nhad made against the owner of the estate. His father and grandfather\r\nhad contrived between them to establish a fairly good business,\r\nindependently of Bragton, which business, of course, was now his. As\r\nfar as reading went, and knowledge, he was probably a better lawyer\r\nthan either of them; but he lacked their enterprise and special\r\ngenius, and the thing had dwindled with him. It seemed to him,\r\nperhaps not unnaturally, that he had been robbed of an inheritance.\r\nHe had no title deeds, as had the owners of the property; but his\r\nancestors before him, from generation to generation, had lived by\r\nmanaging the Bragton property. They had drawn the leases, and made\r\nthe wills, and collected the rents, and had taught themselves to\r\nbelieve that a Morton could not live on his land without a Masters.\r\nNow there was a Morton who did not live on his land, but spent his\r\nrents elsewhere without the aid of any Masters, and it seemed to the\r\nold lawyer that all the good things of the world had passed away. He\r\nhad married twice, his first wife having, before her marriage, been\r\nwell known at Bragton Park. When she had died, and Mr. Masters had\r\nbrought a second wife home, Lady Ushant took the only child of the\r\nmother, whom she had known as a girl, into her own keeping, till\r\nshe also had been compelled to leave Bragton. Then Mary Masters had\r\nreturned to her father and stepmother.\r\n\r\nThe Bragton Park residence is a large, old-fashioned, comfortable\r\nhouse, but by no means a magnificent mansion. The greater part of it\r\nwas built one hundred and fifty years ago, and the rooms are small\r\nand low. In the palmy days of his reign, which is now more than half\r\na century since, the old squire made alterations, and built new\r\nstables and kennels, and put up a conservatory; but what he did then\r\nhas already become almost old-fashioned now. What he added he added\r\nin stone, but the old house was brick. He was much abused at the time\r\nfor his want of taste, and heard a good deal about putting new cloth\r\nas patches on old rents; but, as the shrubs and ivy have grown up, a\r\ncertain picturesqueness has come upon the place, which is greatly due\r\nto the difference of material. The place is somewhat sombre, as there\r\nis no garden close to the house. There is a lawn, at the back, with\r\ngravel walks round it; but it is only a small lawn; and then divided\r\nfrom the lawn by a ha-ha fence, is the park. The place, too, has that\r\nsad look which always comes to a house from the want of a tenant.\r\nPoor Lady Ushant, when she was there, could do little or nothing.\r\nA gardener was kept, but there should have been three or four\r\ngardeners. The man grew cabbages and onions, which he sold, but cared\r\nnothing for the walks or borders. Whatever it may have been in the\r\nold time, Bragton Park was certainly not a cheerful place when Lady\r\nUshant lived there. In the squire\'s time the park itself had always\r\nbeen occupied by deer. Even when distress came he would not allow the\r\ndeer to be sold. But after his death they went very soon, and from\r\nthat day to the time of which I am writing, the park has been leased\r\nto some butchers or graziers from Dillsborough.\r\n\r\nThe ground hereabouts is nearly level, but it falls away a little\r\nand becomes broken and pretty where the river Dill runs through\r\nthe park, about half a mile from the house. There is a walk called\r\nthe Pleasance, passing down through shrubs to the river, and then\r\ncrossing the stream by a foot-bridge, and leading across the fields\r\ntowards Dillsborough. This bridge is, perhaps, the prettiest spot in\r\nBragton, or, for that matter, anywhere in the county round; but even\r\nhere there is not much of beauty to be praised. It is here, on the\r\nside of the river away from the house, that the home meet of the\r\nhounds used to be held; and still the meet at Bragton Bridge is\r\npopular in the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MASTERS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock one November evening, Mr. Masters, the attorney, was\r\nsitting at home with his family in the large parlour of his house,\r\nhis office being on the other side of the passage which cut the house\r\nin two and was formally called the hall. Upstairs, over the parlour,\r\nwas a drawing-room; but this chamber, which was supposed to be\r\nelegantly furnished, was very rarely used. Mr. and Mrs. Masters\r\ndid not see much company, and for family purposes the elegance of\r\nthe drawing-room made it unfit. It added, however, not a little to\r\nthe glory of Mrs. Masters\' life. The house itself was a low brick\r\nbuilding in the High Street, at the corner where the High Street runs\r\ninto the market-place, and therefore, nearly opposite to the Bush.\r\nIt had none of the elaborate grandeur of the inn nor of the simple\r\nstateliness of Hoppet Hall, but, nevertheless, it maintained the\r\ncharacter of the town and was old, substantial, respectable, and\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n"I think it a very spirited thing of him to do, then," said Mrs.\r\nMasters.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, my dear. Perhaps it is only revenge."\r\n\r\n"What have you to do with that? What can it matter to a lawyer\r\nwhether it\'s revenge or anything else? He\'s got the means, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, my dear."\r\n\r\n"What does Nickem say?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he has the means," said Mr. Masters, who was aware that if\r\nhe told his wife a fib on the matter, she would learn the truth from\r\nhis senior clerk, Mr. Samuel Nickem. Among the professional gifts\r\nwhich Mr. Masters possessed, had not been that great gift of being\r\nable to keep his office and his family distinct from each other.\r\nHis wife always knew what was going on, and was very free with her\r\nadvice; generally tendering it on that side on which money was to be\r\nmade, and doing so with much feminine darkness as to right or wrong.\r\nHis clerk, Nickem, who was afflicted with no such darkness, but who\r\nridiculed the idea of scruple in an attorney, often took part against\r\nhim. It was the wish of his heart to get rid of Nickem; but Nickem\r\nwould have carried business with him and gone over to some enemy,\r\nor, perhaps have set up in some irregular manner on his own bottom;\r\nand his wife would have given him no peace had he done so, for she\r\nregarded Nickem as the mainstay of the house.\r\n\r\n"What is Lord Rufford to you?" asked Mrs. Masters.\r\n\r\n"He has always been very friendly."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see it at all. You have never had any of his money. I don\'t\r\nknow that you are a pound richer by him."\r\n\r\n"I have always gone with the gentry of the county."\r\n\r\n"Fiddlesticks! Gentry! Gentry are very well as long as you can make a\r\nliving out of them. You could afford to stick up for gentry till you\r\nlost the Bragton property." This was a subject that was always sore\r\nbetween Mr. Masters and his wife. The former Mrs. Masters had been a\r\nlady--the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman; and had been much\r\nconsidered by the family at Bragton. The present Mrs. Masters was the\r\ndaughter of an ironmonger at Norrington, who had brought a thousand\r\npounds with her, which had been very useful. No doubt Mr. Masters\'\r\npractice had been considerably affected by the lowliness of his\r\nsecond marriage. People who used to know the first Mrs. Masters, such\r\nas Mrs. Mainwaring, and the doctor\'s wife, and old Mrs. Cooper, the\r\nwife of the vicar of Mallingham, would not call on the second Mrs.\r\nMasters. As Mrs. Masters was too high-spirited to run after people\r\nwho did not want her, she took to hating gentry instead.\r\n\r\n"We have always been on the other side," said the old attorney,--"I\r\nand my father and grandfather before me."\r\n\r\n"They lived on it and you can\'t. If you are going to say that you\r\nwon\'t have any client that isn\'t a gentleman, you might as well put\r\nup your shutters at once."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said so. Isn\'t Runciman my client?"\r\n\r\n"He always goes with the gentry. He a\'most thinks he\'s one of them\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"And old Nobbs, the greengrocer. But it\'s all nonsense. Any man is my\r\nclient, or any woman, who can come and pay me for business that is\r\nfit for me to do."\r\n\r\n"Why isn\'t this fit to be done? If the man\'s been damaged, why\r\nshouldn\'t he be paid?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s had money offered him."\r\n\r\n"If he thinks it ain\'t enough, who\'s to say that it is,--unless a\r\njury?" said Mrs. Masters, becoming quite eloquent. "And how\'s a\r\npoor man to get a jury to say that, unless he comes to a lawyer? Of\r\ncourse, if you won\'t have it, he\'ll go to Bearside. Bearside won\'t\r\nturn him away." Bearside was another attorney, an interloper of about\r\nten years\' standing, whose name was odious to Mr. Masters.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know anything about it, my dear," said he, aroused at last\r\nto anger.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'re letting anybody who likes take the bread out of the\r\nchildren\'s mouths." The children, so called, were sitting round the\r\ntable and could not but take an interest in the matter. The eldest\r\nwas that Mary Masters, the daughter of the former wife, whom Lady\r\nUshant had befriended, a tall girl, with dark brown hair, so dark as\r\nalmost to be black, and large, soft, thoughtful grey eyes. We shall\r\nhave much to say of Mary Masters, and can hardly stop to give an\r\nadequate description of her here. The others were Dolly and Kate,\r\ntwo girls aged sixteen and fifteen. The two younger "children" were\r\neating bread and butter and jam in a very healthy manner, but still\r\nhad their ears wide open to the conversation that was being held. The\r\ntwo younger girls sympathised strongly with their mother. Mary, who\r\nhad known much about the Mortons, and was old enough to understand\r\nthe position which her grandfather had held in reference to the\r\nfamily, of course leaned in her heart to her father\'s side. But\r\nshe was wiser than her father, and knew that in such discussions\r\nher mother often showed a worldly wisdom which, in their present\r\ncircumstances, they could hardly afford to disregard, unpalatable\r\nthough it might be.\r\n\r\nMr. Masters disliked these discussions altogether, but he disliked\r\nthem most of all in presence of his children. He looked round upon\r\nthem in a deprecatory manner, making a slight motion with his hand\r\nand bringing his head down on one side, and then he gave a long sigh.\r\nIf it was his intention to convey some subtle warning to his wife,\r\nsome caution that she alone should understand, he was deceived. The\r\n"children" all knew what he meant quite as well as did their mother.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go out, mamma?" asked Dolly.\r\n\r\n"Finish your teas, my dears," said Mr. Masters, who wished to stop\r\nthe discussion rather than to carry it on before a more select\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to make up your mind to-night," said Mrs. Masters, "and\r\nyou\'ll be going over to the Bush at eight."\r\n\r\n"No, I needn\'t. He is to come on Monday. I told Nickem I wouldn\'t see\r\nhim to-night; nor, of course, to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Then he\'ll go to Bearside."\r\n\r\n"He may go to Bearside and be ----! Oh, Lord! I do wish you\'d let me\r\ndrop the business for a few minutes when I am in here. You don\'t know\r\nanything about it. How should you?"\r\n\r\n"I know that if I didn\'t speak you\'d let everything slip through your\r\nfingers. There\'s Mr. Twentyman. Kate, open the door."\r\n\r\nKate, who was fond of Mr. Twentyman, rushed up and opened the front\r\ndoor at once. In saying so much of Kate, I do not mean it to be\r\nunderstood that any precocious ideas of love were troubling that\r\nyoung lady\'s bosom. Kate Masters was a jolly bouncing schoolgirl of\r\nfifteen, who was not too proud to eat toffy, and thought herself\r\nstill a child. But she was very fond of Lawrence Twentyman, who\r\nhad a pony that she could ride, and who was always good-natured to\r\nher. All the family liked Mr. Twentyman,--unless it might be Mary,\r\nwho was the one that he specially liked himself. And Mary was not\r\naltogether averse to him, knowing him to be good-natured, manly,\r\nand straightforward. But Mr. Twentyman had proposed to her, and she\r\nhad--certainly not accepted him. This, however, had broken none of\r\nthe family friendship. Every one in the house, unless it might be\r\nMary herself, hoped that Mr. Twentyman might prevail at last. The\r\nman was worth six or seven hundred a year, and had a good house, and\r\nowed no one a shilling. He was handsome, and about the best-tempered\r\nfellow known. Of course they all desired that he should prevail with\r\nMary. "I wish that I were old enough, Larry, that\'s all!" Kate had\r\nsaid to him once, laughing. "I wouldn\'t have you, if you were ever\r\nso old," Larry had replied; "you\'d want to be out hunting every day."\r\nThat will show the sort of terms that Larry was on with his friend\r\nKate. He called at the house every Saturday with the declared object\r\nof going over to the club that was held that evening in the parlour\r\nat the Bush, whither Mr. Masters also always went. It was understood\r\nat home that Mr. Masters should attend this club every Saturday from\r\neight till eleven, but that he was not at any other time to give way\r\nto the fascinations of the Bush. On this occasion, and we may say on\r\nalmost every Saturday night, Mr. Twentyman arrived a full hour before\r\nthe appointed time. The reason of his doing so was of course well\r\nunderstood, and was quite approved by Mrs. Masters. She was not, at\r\nany rate as yet, a cruel stepmother; but still, if the girl could be\r\ntransferred to so eligible a home as that which Mr. Twentyman could\r\ngive her, it would be well for all parties.\r\n\r\nWhen he took his seat he did not address himself specially to the\r\nlady of his love. I don\'t know how a gentleman is to do so in the\r\npresence of her father, and mother, and sisters. Saturday after\r\nSaturday he probably thought that some occasion would arise; but, if\r\nhis words could have been counted, it would have been found that he\r\naddressed fewer to her than to any one in the room.\r\n\r\n"Larry," said his special friend Kate, "am I to have the pony at the\r\nBridge meet?"\r\n\r\n"How very free you are, Miss!" said her mother.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that," said Larry. "When is there to be a meet at\r\nthe Bridge? I haven\'t heard."\r\n\r\n"But I have. Tony Tuppett told me that they would be there this day\r\nfortnight." Tony Tuppett was the huntsman of the U. R. U.\r\n\r\n"That\'s more than Tony can know. He may have guessed it."\r\n\r\n"Shall I have the pony if he has guessed right?"\r\n\r\nThen the pony was promised; and Kate, trusting in Tony Tuppett\'s\r\nsagacity, was happy.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard of all this about Dillsborough Wood?" asked Mrs.\r\nMasters. The attorney shrank at the question, and shook himself\r\nuneasily in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'ve heard about it," said Larry.\r\n\r\n"And what do you think about it? I don\'t see why Lord Rufford is to\r\nride over everybody because he\'s a lord." Mr. Twentyman scratched\r\nhis head. Though a keen sportsman himself, he did not specially like\r\nLord Rufford,--a fact which had been very well known to Mrs. Masters.\r\nBut, nevertheless, this threatened action against the nobleman was\r\ndistasteful to him. It was not a hunting affair, or Mr. Twentyman\r\ncould not have doubted for a moment. It was a shooting difficulty,\r\nand as Mr. Twentyman had never been asked to fire a gun on the\r\nRufford preserves, it was no great sorrow to him that there should be\r\nsuch a difficulty. But the thing threatened was an attack upon the\r\ncountry gentry and their amusements, and Mr. Twentyman was a country\r\ngentleman who followed sport. Upon the whole his sympathies were with\r\nLord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"The man is an utter blackguard, you know," said Larry. "Last year he\r\nthreatened to shoot the foxes in Dillsborough Wood."\r\n\r\n"No!" said Kate, quite horrified.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he\'s a bad sort of fellow all round," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why he shouldn\'t claim what he thinks due to him," said\r\nMrs. Masters.\r\n\r\n"I\'m told that his lordship offered him seven-and-six an acre for the\r\nwhole of the two fields," said the gentleman-farmer.\r\n\r\n"Goarly declares," said Mrs. Masters, "that the pheasants didn\'t\r\nleave him four bushels of wheat to the acre."\r\n\r\nGoarly was the man who had proposed himself as a client to Mr.\r\nMasters, and who was desirous of claiming damages to the amount of\r\nforty shillings an acre for injury done to the crops on two fields\r\nbelonging to himself which lay adjacent to Dillsborough Wood, a\r\ncovert belonging to Lord Rufford, about four miles from the town, in\r\nwhich both pheasants and foxes were preserved with great care.\r\n\r\n"Has Goarly been to you?" asked Twentyman.\r\n\r\nMr. Masters nodded his head. "That\'s just it," said Mrs. Masters. "I\r\ndon\'t see why a man isn\'t to go to law if he pleases--that is, if he\r\ncan afford to pay for it. I have nothing to say against gentlemen\'s\r\nsport; but I do say that they should run the same chance as others.\r\nAnd I say it\'s a shame if they\'re to band themselves together and\r\nmake the county too hot to hold any one as doesn\'t like to have his\r\nthings ridden over, and his crops devoured, and his fences knocked to\r\nJericho. I think there\'s a deal of selfishness in sport and a deal of\r\ntyranny."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Masters!" exclaimed Larry.\r\n\r\n"Well, I do. And if a poor man,--or a man whether he\'s poor or no,"\r\nadded Mrs. Masters, correcting herself, as she thought of the money\r\nwhich this man ought to have in order that he might pay for his\r\nlawsuit,--"thinks hisself injured, it\'s nonsense to tell me that\r\nnobody should take up his case. It\'s just as though the butcher\r\nwouldn\'t sell a man a leg of mutton because Lord Rufford had a spite\r\nagainst him. Who\'s Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"Everybody knows that I care very little for his lordship," said Mr.\r\nTwentyman.\r\n\r\n"Nor I; and I don\'t see why Gregory should. If Goarly isn\'t entitled\r\nto what he wants he won\'t get it; that\'s all. But let it be tried\r\nfairly."\r\n\r\nHereupon Mr. Masters took up his hat and left the room, and Mr.\r\nTwentyman followed him, not having yet expressed any positive opinion\r\non the delicate matter submitted to his judgment. Of course, Goarly\r\nwas a brute. Had he not threatened to shoot foxes? But, then, an\r\nattorney must live by lawsuits, and it seemed to Mr. Twentyman that\r\nan attorney should not stop to inquire whether a new client is a\r\nbrute or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE DILLSBOROUGH CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe club, so called at Dillsborough, was held every Saturday evening\r\nin a back parlour at the Bush, and was attended generally by seven\r\nor eight members. It was a very easy club. There was no balloting,\r\nand no other expense attending it other than that of paying for the\r\nliquor which each man chose to drink. Sometimes, about ten o\'clock,\r\nthere was a little supper, the cost of which was defrayed by\r\nsubscription among those who partook of it. It was one rule of the\r\nclub, or a habit, rather, which had grown to be a rule, that Mr.\r\nRunciman might introduce into it any one he pleased. I do not know\r\nthat a similar privilege was denied to any one else; but as Mr.\r\nRunciman had a direct pecuniary advantage in promoting the club, the\r\nnew-comers were generally ushered in by him. When the attorney and\r\nTwentyman entered the room Mr. Runciman was seated as usual in an\r\narm-chair at the corner of the fire nearest to the door, with the\r\nbell at his right hand. He was a hale, good-looking man about fifty,\r\nwith black hair, now turning grey at the edges, and a clean-shorn\r\nchin. He had a pronounced strong face of his own, one capable of\r\nevincing anger and determination when necessary, but equally apt for\r\nsmiles or, on occasion, for genuine laughter. He was a masterful but\r\na pleasant man, very civil to customers and to his friends generally\r\nwhile they took him the right way; but one who could be a Tartar if\r\nhe were offended, holding an opinion that his position as landlord\r\nof an inn was one requiring masterdom. And his wife was like him in\r\neverything,--except in this, that she always submitted to him. He was\r\na temperate man in the main; but on Saturday nights he would become\r\njovial, and sometimes a little quarrelsome. When this occurred\r\nthe club would generally break itself up and go home to bed, not\r\nin the least offended. Indeed Mr. Runciman was the tyrant of the\r\nclub, though it was held at his house expressly with the view of\r\nputting money into his pocket. Opposite to his seat was another\r\narm-chair,--not so big as Mr. Runciman\'s, but still a soft and easy\r\nchair,--which was always left for the attorney. For Mr. Masters was\r\na man much respected through all Dillsborough, partly on his own\r\naccount, but more perhaps for the sake of his father and grandfather.\r\nHe was a round-faced, clean-shorn man, with straggling grey hair, who\r\nalways wore black clothes and a white cravat. There was something in\r\nhis appearance which recommended him among his neighbours, who were\r\ndisposed to say he "looked the gentleman;" but a stranger might have\r\nthought his cheeks to be flabby and his mouth to be weak.\r\n\r\nMaking a circle, or the beginning of a circle, round the fire, were\r\nNupper, the doctor,--a sporting old bachelor doctor who had the\r\nreputation of riding after the hounds in order that he might be\r\nready for broken bones and minor accidents; next to him, in another\r\narm-chair, facing the fire, was Ned Botsey, the younger of the two\r\nbrewers from Norrington, who was in the habit during the hunting\r\nseason of stopping from Saturday to Monday at the Bush, partly\r\nbecause the Rufford hounds hunted on Saturday and Monday and on\r\nthose days seldom met in the Norrington direction, and partly because\r\nhe liked the sporting conversation of the Dillsborough Club. He\r\nwas a little man, very neat in his attire, who liked to be above\r\nhis company, and fancied that he was so in Mr. Runciman\'s parlour.\r\nBetween him and the attorney\'s chair was Harry Stubbings, from\r\nStanton Corner, the man who let out hunters, and whom Twentyman had\r\nthreatened to thrash. His introduction to the club had taken place\r\nlately, not without some opposition; but Runciman had set his foot\r\nupon that, saying that it was "all d---- nonsense." He had prevailed,\r\nand Twentyman had consented to meet the man; but there was no great\r\nfriendship between them. Seated back on the sofa was Mr. Ribbs, the\r\nbutcher, who was allowed into the society as being a specially modest\r\nman. His modesty, perhaps, did not hinder him in an affair of sheep\r\nor bullocks, nor yet in the collection of his debts; but at the club\r\nhe understood his position, and rarely opened his mouth to speak.\r\nWhen Twentyman followed the attorney into the room there was a vacant\r\nchair between Mr. Botsey and Harry Stubbings; but he would not get\r\ninto it, preferring to seat himself on the table at Botsey\'s right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"So Goarly was with you, Mr. Masters," Mr. Runciman began as soon as\r\nthe attorney was seated. It was clear that they had all been talking\r\nabout Goarly and his law-suit, and that Goarly and the law-suit would\r\nbe talked about very generally in Dillsborough.\r\n\r\n"He was over at my place this evening," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"You are not going to take his case up for him, Mr. Masters?" said\r\nyoung Botsey. "We expect something better from you than that."\r\n\r\nNow Ned Botsey was rather an impudent young man, and Mr. Masters,\r\nthough he was mild enough at home, did not like impudence from the\r\nworld at large. "I suppose, Mr. Botsey," said he, "that if Goarly\r\nwere to go to you for a barrel of beer you\'d sell it to him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether I should or not. I dare say my people would.\r\nBut that\'s a different thing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see any difference at all. You\'re not very particular as\r\nto your customers, and I don\'t ask you any questions about them.\r\nRing the bell, Runciman, please." The bell was rung, and the two\r\nnew-comers ordered their liquor.\r\n\r\nIt was quite right that Ned Botsey should be put down. Every one in\r\nthe room felt that. But there was something in the attorney\'s tone\r\nwhich made the assembled company feel that he had undertaken Goarly\'s\r\ncase; whereas, in the opinion of the company, Goarly was a scoundrel\r\nwith whom Mr. Masters should have had nothing to do. The attorney\r\nhad never been a sporting man himself, but he had always been, as it\r\nwere, on that side.\r\n\r\n"Goarly is a great fool for his pains," said the doctor. "He has had\r\na very fair offer made him, and, first or last, it\'ll cost him forty\r\npounds."\r\n\r\n"He has got it into his head," said the landlord, "that he can sue\r\nLord Rufford for his fences. Lord Rufford is not answerable for his\r\nfences."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the loss of crop he\'s going for," said Twentyman.\r\n\r\n"How can there be pheasants to that amount in Dillsborough Wood,"\r\ncontinued the landlord, "when everybody knows that foxes breed there\r\nevery year? There isn\'t a surer find for a fox in the whole county.\r\nEverybody knows that Lord Rufford never lets his game stand in the\r\nway of foxes."\r\n\r\nLord Rufford was Mr. Runciman\'s great friend and patron and best\r\ncustomer, and not a word against Lord Rufford was allowed in that\r\nroom, though elsewhere in Dillsborough ill-natured things were\r\nsometimes said of his lordship. Then there came on that well-worn\r\ndispute among sportsmen, whether foxes and pheasants are or are not\r\npleasant companions to each other. Every one was agreed that, if not,\r\nthen the pheasants should suffer, and that any country gentleman who\r\nallowed his gamekeeper to entrench on the privileges of foxes in\r\norder that pheasants might be more abundant, was a "brute" and a\r\n"beast," and altogether unworthy to live in England. Larry Twentyman\r\nand Ned Botsey expressed an opinion that pheasants were predominant\r\nin Dillsborough Wood, while Mr. Runciman, the doctor, and Harry\r\nStubbings declared loudly that everything that foxes could desire was\r\ndone for them in that Elysium of sport.\r\n\r\n"We drew the wood blank last time we were there," said Larry. "Don\'t\r\nyou remember, Mr. Runciman, about the end of last March?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I remember," said the landlord. "Just the end of the\r\nseason, when two vixens had litters in the wood! You don\'t suppose\r\nBean was going to let that old butcher, Tony, find a fox in\r\nDillsborough at that time." Bean was his lordship\'s head gamekeeper\r\nin that part of the country. "How many foxes had we found there\r\nduring the season?"\r\n\r\n"Two or three," suggested Botsey.\r\n\r\n"Seven!" said the energetic landlord; "seven, including\r\ncub-hunting,--and killed four! If you kill four foxes out of an\r\neighty-acre wood, and have two litters at the end of the season, I\r\ndon\'t think you have much to complain of."\r\n\r\n"If they all did as well as Lord Rufford, you\'d have more foxes than\r\nyou\'d know what to do with," said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThen this branch of the conversation was ended by a bet of a new\r\nhat between Botsey and the landlord as to the finding of a fox in\r\nDillsborough Wood when it should next be drawn; as to which, when the\r\nspeculation was completed, Harry Stubbings offered Mr. Runciman ten\r\nshillings down for his side of the bargain.\r\n\r\nBut all this did not divert the general attention from the important\r\nmatter of Goarly\'s attack. "Let it be how it will," said Mr.\r\nRunciman, "a fellow like that should be put down." He did not address\r\nhimself specially to Mr. Masters, but that gentleman felt that he was\r\nbeing talked at.\r\n\r\n"Certainly he ought," said Dr. Nupper. "If he didn\'t feel satisfied\r\nwith what his lordship offered him, why couldn\'t he ask his lordship\r\nto refer the matter to a couple of farmers who understood it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the spirit of the thing," said Mr. Ribbs, from his place on the\r\nsofa. "It\'s a hodious spirit."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it, Mr. Ribbs," said Harry Stubbings. "It\'s all meant\r\nfor opposition. Whether it\'s shooting or whether it\'s hunting, it\'s\r\nall one. Such a chap oughtn\'t to be allowed to have land. I\'d take it\r\naway from him by Act of Parliament. It\'s such as him as is destroying\r\nthe country."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t many of them hereabouts, thank God!" said the landlord.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Twentyman," said Stubbings, who was anxious to make friends\r\nwith the gentleman-farmer, "you know what land can do, and what land\r\nhas done, as well as any man. What would you say was the real damage\r\ndone to them two wheat-fields by his lordship\'s game last autumn? You\r\nsaw the crops as they were growing, and you know what came off the\r\nland."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t like to say."\r\n\r\n"But if you were on your oath, Mr. Twentyman? Was there more than\r\nseven-and-sixpence an acre lost?"\r\n\r\n"No, nor five shillings," said Runciman.\r\n\r\n"I think Goarly ought to take his lordship\'s offer--if you mean\r\nthat," said Twentyman.\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause, during which more drink was brought in, and\r\npipes were re-lighted. Everybody wished that Mr. Masters might be\r\ngot to say that he would not take the case, but there was a delicacy\r\nabout asking him. "If I remember right he was in Rufford Gaol once,"\r\nsaid Runciman.\r\n\r\n"He was let out on bail and then the matter was hushed up somehow,"\r\nsaid the attorney.\r\n\r\n"It was something about a woman," continued Runciman. "I know that on\r\nthat occasion he came out an awful scoundrel."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember," asked Botsey, "how he used to walk up and down\r\nthe covert-side with a gun, two years ago, swearing he would shoot\r\nthe fox if he broke over his land?"\r\n\r\n"I heard him say it, Botsey," said Twentyman.\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t have been the first fox he\'s murdered," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Not by many," said the landlord.\r\n\r\n"You remember that old woman near my place?" said Stubbings. "It was\r\nhe that put her up to tell all them lies about her turkeys. I ran it\r\nhome to him! A blackguard like that! Nobody ought to take him up."\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t, Mr. Masters," said the doctor. The doctor was as\r\nold as the attorney, and had known him for many years. No one else\r\ncould dare to ask the question.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose I shall, Nupper," said the attorney from his chair.\r\nIt was the first word he had spoken since he had put down young\r\nBotsey. "It wouldn\'t just suit me; but a man has to judge of those\r\nthings for himself."\r\n\r\nThen there was a general rejoicing, and Mr. Runciman stood broiled\r\nbones, and ham and eggs, and bottled stout for the entire club;\r\none unfortunate effect of which unwonted conviviality was that Mr.\r\nMasters did not get home till near twelve o\'clock. That was sure to\r\ncause discomfort; and then he had pledged himself to decline Goarly\'s\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nREGINALD MORTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now go back to Hoppet Hall and its inhabitants. When the old\r\nsquire died he left by his will Hoppet Hall and certain other houses\r\nin Dillsborough, which was all that he could leave, to his grandson\r\nReginald Morton. Then there arose a question whether this property\r\nalso was not entailed. The former Mr. Masters, and our friend of the\r\npresent day, had been quite certain of the squire\'s power to do what\r\nhe liked with it; but others had been equally certain on the other\r\nside, and there had been a lawsuit. During that time Reginald Morton\r\nhad been forced to live on a very small allowance. His aunt, Lady\r\nUshant, had done what little she could for him, but it had been felt\r\nto be impossible that he should remain at Bragton, which was the\r\nproperty of the cousin who was at law with him. From the moment\r\nof his birth the Honourable Mrs. Morton, who was also his aunt by\r\nmarriage, had been his bitter enemy. He was the son of an innkeeper\'s\r\ndaughter, and according to her theory of life, should never even have\r\nbeen noticed by the real Mortons. And this honourable old lady was\r\nalmost equally adverse to Lady Ushant, whose husband had simply been\r\na knight, and who had left nothing behind him. Thus Reginald Morton\r\nhad been friendless since his grandfather died, and had lived in\r\nGermany, nobody quite knew how. During the entire period of this\r\nlaw-suit Hoppet Hall had remained untenanted.\r\n\r\nWhen the property was finally declared to belong to Reginald Morton,\r\nthe Hall, before it could be used, required considerable repair. But\r\nthere was other property. The Bush Inn belonged to Reginald Morton,\r\nas did the house in which Mr. Masters lived, and sundry other smaller\r\ntenements in the vicinity. There was an income from these of about\r\nfive hundred pounds a year. Reginald, who was then nearly thirty\r\nyears of age, came over to England, and stayed for a month or two at\r\nBragton with his aunt, to the infinite chagrin of the old dowager.\r\nThe management of the town property was entrusted to Mr. Masters, and\r\nHoppet Hall was repaired. At this period Mr. Mainwaring had just come\r\nto Dillsborough, and having a wife with some money and perhaps quite\r\nas much pretension, had found the rectory too small, and had taken\r\nthe Hall on a lease for seven years. When this was arranged Reginald\r\nMorton again went to Germany, and did not return till the lease had\r\nrun out. By that time Mr. Mainwaring, having spent a little money,\r\nfound that the rectory would be large enough for his small family.\r\nThen the Hall was again untenanted for awhile, till, quite suddenly,\r\nReginald Morton returned to Dillsborough, and took up his permanent\r\nresidence in his own house.\r\n\r\nIt soon became known that the new-comer would not add much to the\r\ngaiety of the place. The only people whom he knew in Dillsborough\r\nwere his own tenants, Mr. Runciman and Mr. Masters, and the\r\nattorney\'s eldest daughter. During those months which he had spent\r\nwith Lady Ushant at Bragton, Mary had been living there, then a child\r\nof twelve years old; and, as a child, had become his fast friend.\r\nWith his aunt he had continually corresponded, and partly at her\r\ninstigation, and partly from feelings of his own, he had at once\r\ngone to the attorney\'s house. This was now two years since, and\r\nhe had found in his old playmate a beautiful young woman, in his\r\nopinion very unlike the people with whom she lived. For the first\r\ntwelvemonths he saw her occasionally,--though not indeed very often.\r\nOnce or twice he had drunk tea at the attorney\'s house, on which\r\noccasions the drawing-room upstairs had been almost as grand as it\r\nwas uncomfortable. Then the attentions of Larry Twentyman began to\r\nmake themselves visible, infinitely to Reginald Morton\'s disgust. Up\r\nto that time he had no idea of falling in love with the girl himself.\r\nSince he had begun to think on such subjects at all he had made up\r\nhis mind that he would not marry. He was almost the more proud of his\r\nbirth by his father\'s side, because he had been made to hear so much\r\nof his mother\'s low position. He had told himself a hundred times\r\nthat under no circumstances could he marry any other than a lady of\r\ngood birth. But his own fortune was small, and he knew himself well\r\nenough to be sure that he would not marry for money. He was now\r\nnearly forty years of age and had never yet been thrown into the\r\nsociety of any one that had attracted him. He was sure that he would\r\nnot marry. And yet when he saw that Mr. Twentyman was made much of\r\nand flattered by the whole Masters family, apparently because he was\r\nregarded as an eligible husband for Mary, Reginald Morton was not\r\nonly disgusted, but personally offended. Being a most unreasonable\r\nman he conceived a bitter dislike to poor Larry, who, at any rate,\r\nwas truly in love, and was not looking too high in desiring to marry\r\nthe portionless daughter of the attorney. But Morton thought that the\r\nman ought to be kicked and horsewhipped, or, at any rate, banished\r\ninto some speechless exile for his presumption.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Runciman he had dealings, and in some sort friendship. There\r\nwere two meadows attached to Hoppet Hall,--fields lying close to\r\nthe town, which were very suitable for the landlord\'s purposes. Mr.\r\nMainwaring had held them in his own hands, taking them up from Mr.\r\nRunciman, who had occupied them while the house was untenanted, in a\r\nmanner which induced Mr. Runciman to feel that it was useless to go\r\nto church to hear such sermons as those preached by the rector. But\r\nMorton had restored the fields, giving them rent free, on condition\r\nthat he should be supplied with milk and butter. Mr. Runciman, no\r\ndoubt, had the best of the bargain, as he generally had in all\r\nbargains; but he was a man who liked to be generous when generously\r\ntreated. Consequently he almost overdid his neighbour with butter and\r\ncream, and occasionally sent in quarters of lamb and sweetbreads to\r\nmake up the weight. I don\'t know that the offerings were particularly\r\nvalued; but friendship was engendered. Runciman, too, had his grounds\r\nfor quarrelling with those who had taken up the management of the\r\nBragton property after the squire\'s death, and had his own antipathy\r\nto the Honourable Mrs. Morton and her grandson, the Secretary of\r\nLegation. When the law-suit was going on he had been altogether on\r\nReginald Morton\'s side. It was an affair of sides, and quite natural\r\nthat Runciman and the attorney should be friendly with the new-comer\r\nat Hoppet Hall, though there were very few points of personal\r\nsympathy between them.\r\n\r\nReginald Morton was no sportsman, nor was he at all likely to become\r\na member of the Dillsborough Club. It was currently reported of him\r\nin the town that he had never sat on a horse or fired off a gun. As\r\nhe had been brought up as a boy by the old squire this was probably\r\nan exaggeration, but it is certain that at this period of his life\r\nhe had given up any aptitudes in that direction for which his early\r\ntraining might have suited him. He had brought back with him to\r\nHoppet Hall many cases of books which the ignorance of Dillsborough\r\nhad magnified into an enormous library, and he was certainly a\r\nsedentary, reading man. There was already a report in the town that\r\nhe was engaged in some stupendous literary work, and the men and\r\nwomen generally looked upon him as a disagreeable marvel of learning.\r\nDillsborough of itself was not bookish, and would have regarded\r\nany one known to have written an article in a magazine almost as a\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nHe seldom went to church, much to the sorrow of Mr. Surtees, who\r\nventured to call at the house and remonstrate with him. He never\r\ncalled again. And though it was the habit of Mr. Surtees\' life to\r\nspeak as little ill as possible of any one, he was not able to say\r\nany good of Mr. Morton. Mr. Mainwaring, who would never have troubled\r\nhimself though his parishioner had not entered a place of worship\r\nonce in a twelvemonth, did say many severe things against his former\r\nlandlord. He hated people who were unsocial and averse to dining out,\r\nand who departed from the ways of living common among English country\r\ngentlemen. Mr. Mainwaring was, upon the whole, prepared to take the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nReginald Morton, though he was now nearly forty, was a young-looking,\r\nhandsome man, with fair hair, cut short, and a light beard, which was\r\nalways clipped. Though his mother had been an innkeeper\'s daughter in\r\nMontreal he had the Morton blue eyes and the handsome well-cut Morton\r\nnose. He was nearly six feet high, and strongly made, and was known\r\nto be a much finer man than the Secretary of Legation, who was rather\r\nsmall, and supposed to be not very robust.\r\n\r\nOur lonely man was a great walker, and had investigated every lane\r\nand pathway, and almost every hedge within ten miles of Dillsborough\r\nbefore he had resided there two years; but his favourite rambles\r\nwere all in the neighbourhood of Bragton. As there was no one living\r\nin the house,--no one but the old housekeeper who had lived there\r\nalways,--he was able to wander about the place as he pleased. On the\r\nTuesday afternoon, after the meeting of the Dillsborough Club which\r\nhas been recorded, he was seated, about three o\'clock, on the rail of\r\nthe foot-bridge over the Dill, with a long German pipe hanging from\r\nhis mouth. He was noted throughout the whole country for this pipe,\r\nor for others like it, such a one usually being in his mouth as he\r\nwandered about. The amount of tobacco which he had smoked since his\r\nreturn to these parts, exactly in that spot, was considerable, for\r\nthere he might have been found at some period of the afternoon at\r\nleast three times a week. He would sit on this rail for half an hour\r\nlooking down at the sluggish waters of the little river, rolling the\r\nsmoke out of his mouth at long intervals, and thinking perhaps of\r\nthe great book which he was supposed to be writing. As he sat there\r\nnow, he suddenly heard voices and laughter, and presently three girls\r\ncame round the corner of the hedge, which, at this spot, hid the\r\nDillsborough path,--and he saw the attorney\'s three daughters.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Mr. Morton," said Dolly in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"He\'s always walking about Bragton," said Kate in another whisper.\r\n"Tony Tuppett says that he\'s the Bragton ghost."\r\n\r\n"Kate," said Mary, also in a low voice, "you shouldn\'t talk so much\r\nabout what you hear from Tony Tuppett."\r\n\r\n"Bosh!" said Kate, who knew that she could not be scolded in the\r\npresence of Mr. Morton.\r\n\r\nHe came forward and shook hands with them all, and took off his hat\r\nto Mary. "You\'ve walked a long way, Miss Masters," he said.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t think it far. I like sometimes to come and look at the old\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"And so do I. I wonder whether you remember how often I\'ve sat you on\r\nthis rail and threatened to throw you into the river?"\r\n\r\n"I remember very well that you did threaten me once, and that I\r\nalmost believed that you would throw me in."\r\n\r\n"What had she done that was naughty, Mr. Morton?" asked Kate.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she ever did anything naughty in those days. I don\'t\r\nknow whether she has changed for the worse since."\r\n\r\n"Mary is never naughty now," said Dolly. "Kate and I are naughty, and\r\nit\'s very much better fun than being good."\r\n\r\n"The world has found out that long ago, Miss Dolly; only the world is\r\nnot quite so candid in owning it as you are. Will you come and walk\r\nround the house, Miss Masters? I never go in, but I have no scruples\r\nabout the paths and park."\r\n\r\nAt the end of the bridge leading into the shrubbery there was a\r\nstile, high indeed, but made commodiously with steps, almost like a\r\ndouble staircase, so that ladies could pass it without trouble. Mary\r\nhad given her assent to the proposed walk, and was in the act of\r\nputting out her hand to be helped over the stile, when Mr. Twentyman\r\nappeared at the other side of it.\r\n\r\n"If here isn\'t Larry!" said Kate.\r\n\r\nMorton\'s face turned as black as thunder, but he immediately went\r\nback across the bridge, leading Mary with him. The other girls, who\r\nhad followed him on to the bridge, had of course to go back also.\r\nMary was made very unhappy by the meeting. Mr. Morton would of course\r\nthink that it had been planned, whereas by Mary herself it had been\r\naltogether unexpected. Kate, when the bridge was free, rushed over it\r\nand whispered something to Larry. The meeting had indeed been planned\r\nbetween her and Dolly and the lover, and this special walk had been\r\ntaken at the request of the two younger girls.\r\n\r\nMorton stood stock still, as though he expected that Twentyman would\r\npass by. Larry hurried over the bridge, feeling sure that the meeting\r\nwith Morton had been accidental and thinking that he would pass on\r\ntowards the house.\r\n\r\nLarry was not at all ashamed of his purpose, nor was he inclined\r\nto give way and pass on. He came up boldly to his love, and shook\r\nhands with her with a pleasant smile. "If you are walking back to\r\nDillsborough," he said, "maybe you\'ll let me go a little way with\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I was going round the house with Mr. Morton," she said timidly.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I can join you?" said he, bobbing his head at the other man.\r\n\r\n"If you intended to walk back with Mr. Twentyman--," began Morton.\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t," said the poor girl, who in truth understood more of\r\nit all than did either of the two men. "I didn\'t expect him, and I\r\ndidn\'t expect you. It\'s a pity I can\'t go both ways, isn\'t it?" she\r\nadded, attempting to appear cheerful.\r\n\r\n"Come back, Mary," said Kate; "we\'ve had walking enough, and shall be\r\nawfully tired before we get home."\r\n\r\nMary had thought that she would like extremely to go round the house\r\nwith her old friend and have a hundred incidents of her early life\r\ncalled to her memory. The meeting with Reginald Morton had been\r\naltogether pleasant to her. She had often felt how much she would\r\nhave liked it had the chance of her life enabled her to see more\r\nfrequently one whom as a child she had so intimately known. But at\r\nthe moment she lacked the courage to walk boldly across the bridge,\r\nand thus to rid herself of Lawrence Twentyman. She had already\r\nperceived that Morton\'s manner had rendered it impossible that her\r\nlover should follow them. "I am afraid I must go home," she said.\r\nIt was the very thing she did not want to do,--this going home\r\nwith Lawrence Twentyman; and yet she herself said that she must do\r\nit,--driven to say so by a nervous dread of showing herself to be\r\nfond of the other man\'s company.\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon to you," said Morton very gloomily, waving his hat\r\nand stalking across the bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nNOT IN LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nReginald Morton, as he walked across the bridge towards the house,\r\nwas thoroughly disgusted with all the world. He was very angry with\r\nhimself, feeling that he had altogether made a fool of himself by\r\nhis manner. He had shown himself to be offended, not only by Mr.\r\nTwentyman, but by Miss Masters also, and he was well aware, as he\r\nthought of it all, that neither of them had given him any cause of\r\noffence. If she chose to make an appointment for a walk with Mr.\r\nLawrence Twentyman and to keep it, what was that to him? His anger\r\nwas altogether irrational, and he knew that it was so. What right had\r\nhe to have an opinion about it if Mary Masters should choose to like\r\nthe society of Mr. Twentyman? It was an affair between her and her\r\nfather and mother in which he could have no interest; and yet he had\r\nnot only taken offence, but was well aware that he had shown his\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as to the girl herself, he could not argue himself out\r\nof his anger. It was grievous to him that he should have gone out of\r\nhis way to ask her to walk with him just at the moment when she was\r\nexpecting this vulgar lover,--for that she had expected him he felt\r\nno doubt. Yet he had heard her disclaim any intention of walking\r\nwith the man! But girls are sly, especially when their lovers are\r\nconcerned. It made him sore at heart to feel that this girl should be\r\nsly, and doubly sore to think that she should have been able to love\r\nsuch a one as Lawrence Twentyman.\r\n\r\nAs he roamed about among the grounds this idea troubled him much. He\r\nassured himself that he was not in love with her himself, and that he\r\nhad no idea of falling in love with her; but it sickened him to think\r\nthat a girl who had been brought up by his aunt, who had been loved\r\nat Bragton, whom he had liked, who looked so like a lady, should put\r\nherself on a par with such a wretch as that. In all this he was most\r\nunjust to both of them. He was specially unjust to poor Larry, who\r\nwas by no means a wretch. His costume was not that to which Morton\r\nhad been accustomed in Germany, nor would it have passed without\r\nnotice in Bond Street. But it was rational and clean. When he came\r\nto the bridge to meet his sweetheart he had on a dark-green shooting\r\ncoat, a billicock hat, brown breeches, and gaiters nearly up to his\r\nknees. I don\'t know that a young man in the country could wear more\r\nsuitable attire. And he was a well-made man,--just such a one as,\r\nin this dress, would take the eye of a country girl. There was a\r\nlittle bit of dash about him,--just a touch of swagger,--which better\r\nbreeding might have prevented. But it was not enough to make him\r\nodious to an unprejudiced observer. I could fancy that an old lady\r\nfrom London, with an eye in her head for manly symmetry, would have\r\nliked to look at Larry, and would have thought that a girl in Mary\'s\r\nposition would be happy in having such a lover, providing that his\r\ncharacter was good and his means adequate. But Reginald Morton was\r\nnot an old woman, and to his eyes the smart young farmer with his\r\nbillicock hat, not quite straight on his head, was an odious thing\r\nto behold. He exaggerated the swagger, and took no notice whatever\r\nof the well-made limbs. And then this man had proposed to accompany\r\nhim, had wanted to join his party, had thought it possible that a\r\nflirtation might be carried on in his presence! He sincerely hated\r\nthe man. But what was he to think of such a girl as Mary Masters when\r\nshe could bring herself to like the attentions of such a lover?\r\n\r\nHe was very cross with himself because he knew how unreasonable\r\nwas his anger. Of one thing only could he assure himself,--that he\r\nwould never again willingly put himself in Mary\'s company. What was\r\nDillsborough and the ways of its inhabitants to him? Why should he\r\nso far leave the old fashions of his life as to fret himself about\r\nan attorney\'s daughter in a little English town? And yet he did fret\r\nhimself, walking rapidly, and smoking his pipe a great deal quicker\r\nthan was his custom.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about to return home he passed the front of the house,\r\nand there, standing at the open door, he saw Mrs. Hopkins, the\r\nhousekeeper, who had in truth been waiting for him. He said a\r\ngood-natured word to her, intending to make his way on without\r\nstopping, but she called him back. "Have you heard the news, Mr.\r\nReginald?" she said.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t heard any news this twelvemonth," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Laws, that is so like you, Mr. Reginald. The young squire is to be\r\nhere next week."\r\n\r\n"Who is the young squire? I didn\'t know there was any squire now."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Reginald!"\r\n\r\n"A squire as I take it, Mrs. Hopkins, is a country gentleman who\r\nlives on his own property. Since my grandfather\'s time no such\r\ngentleman has lived at Bragton."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, too, Mr. Reginald. Any way Mr. Morton is coming down\r\nnext week."\r\n\r\n"I thought he was in America."\r\n\r\n"He has come home, for a turn like,--and is staying up in town with\r\nthe old lady." The old lady always meant the Honourable Mrs. Morton.\r\n\r\n"And is the old lady coming down with him?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy she is, Mr. Reginald. He didn\'t say as much, but only\r\nthat there would be three or four,--a couple of ladies he said,\r\nand perhaps more. So I am getting the east bedroom, with the\r\ndressing-room, and the blue room for her ladyship." People about\r\nBragton had been accustomed to call Mrs. Morton her ladyship.\r\n"That\'s where she always used to be. Would you come in and see, Mr.\r\nReginald?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, Mrs. Hopkins. If you were asking me into a house of\r\nyour own, I would go in and see all the rooms and chat with you for\r\nan hour; but I don\'t suppose I shall ever go into this house again\r\nunless things change very much indeed."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m sure I hope they will change, Mr. Reginald." Mrs. Hopkins\r\nhad known Reginald Morton as a boy growing up into manhood,--had\r\nalmost been present at his birth, and had renewed her friendship\r\nwhile he was staying with Lady Ushant; but of the present squire, as\r\nshe called him, she had seen almost nothing, and what she had once\r\nremembered of him had now been obliterated by an absence of twenty\r\nyears. Of course she was on Reginald\'s side in the family quarrel,\r\nalthough she was the paid servant of the Foreign Office paragon.\r\n\r\n"And they are to be here next week. What day next week, Mrs.\r\nHopkins?" Mrs. Hopkins didn\'t know on what day she was to expect\r\nthe visitors, nor how long they intended to stay. Mr. John Morton\r\nhad said in his letter that he would send his own man down two days\r\nbefore his arrival, and that was nearly all that he had said.\r\n\r\nThen Morton started on his return walk to Dillsborough, again taking\r\nthe path across the bridge. "Ah!" he said to himself with a shudder\r\nas he crossed the stile, thinking of his own softened feelings as he\r\nhad held out his hand to help Mary Masters, and then of his revulsion\r\nof feeling when she declared her purpose of walking home with Mr.\r\nTwentyman. And he struck the rail of the bridge with his stick as\r\nthough he were angry with the place altogether. And he thought to\r\nhimself that he would never come there any more, that he hated the\r\nplace, and that he would never cross that bridge again.\r\n\r\nThen his mind reverted to the tidings he had heard from Mrs. Hopkins.\r\nWhat ought he to do when his cousin arrived? Though there had been a\r\nlong lawsuit, there had been no actual declared quarrel between him\r\nand the heir. He had, indeed, never seen the heir for the last twenty\r\nyears, nor had they ever interchanged letters. There had been no\r\ncommunication whatever between them, and therefore there could hardly\r\nbe a quarrel. He disliked his cousin; nay, almost hated him; he\r\nwas quite aware of that. And he was sure also that he hated that\r\nHonourable old woman worse than any one else in the world, and that\r\nhe always would do so. He knew that the Honourable old woman had\r\nattempted to drive his own mother from Bragton, and of course he\r\nhated her. But that was no reason why he should not call on his\r\ncousin. He was anxious to do what was right. He was specially anxious\r\nthat blame should not be attributed to him. What he would like best\r\nwould be that he might call, might find nobody at home,--and that\r\nthen John Morton should not return the courtesy. He did not want to\r\ngo to Bragton as a guest; he did not wish to be in the wrong himself;\r\nbut he was by no means equally anxious that his cousin should keep\r\nhimself free from reproach.\r\n\r\nThe bridge path came out on the Dillsborough road just two miles from\r\nthe town, and Morton, as he got over the last stile, saw Lawrence\r\nTwentyman coming towards him on the road. The man, no doubt, had gone\r\nall the way into Dillsborough with the girls, and was now returning\r\nhome. The parish of Bragton lies to the left of the high road as you\r\ngo into the town from Rufford and the direction of London, whereas\r\nChowton Farm, the property of Mr. Twentyman, is on the right of\r\nthe road, but in the large parish of St. John\'s, Dillsborough.\r\nDillsborough Wood lies at the back of Larry Twentyman\'s land, and\r\njoining on to Larry\'s land and also to the wood is the patch of\r\nground owned by "that scoundrel Goarly." Chowton Farm gate opens on\r\nto the high road, so that Larry was now on his direct way home. As\r\nsoon as he saw Morton he made up his mind to speak to him. He was\r\nquite sure from what had passed between him and the girls, on the\r\nroad home, that he had done something wrong. He was convinced that he\r\nhad interfered in some ill-bred way, though he did not at all know\r\nhow. Of Reginald Morton he was not in the least jealous. He, too, was\r\nof a jealous temperament, but it had never occurred to him to join\r\nReginald Morton and Mary Masters together. He was very much in love\r\nwith Mary, but had no idea that she was in any way above the position\r\nwhich she might naturally hold as daughter of the Dillsborough\r\nattorney. But of Reginald Morton\'s attributes and scholarship and\r\ngeneral standing he had a mystified appreciation which saved him\r\nfrom the pain of thinking that such a man could be in love with his\r\nsweetheart. As he certainly did not wish to quarrel with Morton,\r\nhaving always taken Reginald\'s side in the family disputes, he\r\nthought that he would say a civil word in passing, and, if possible,\r\napologise. When Morton came up he raised his hand to his head and did\r\nopen his mouth, though not pronouncing any word very clearly. Morton\r\nlooked at him as grim as death, just raised his hand, and then passed\r\non with a quick step. Larry was displeased; but the other was so\r\nthoroughly a gentleman,--one of the Mortons, and a man of property in\r\nthe county,--that he didn\'t even yet wish to quarrel with him. "What\r\nthe deuce have I done?" said he to himself as he walked on--"I didn\'t\r\ntell her not to go up to the house. If I offered to walk with her\r\nwhat was that to him?" It must be remembered that Lawrence Twentyman\r\nwas twelve years younger than Reginald Morton, and that a man of\r\ntwenty-eight is apt to regard a man of forty as very much too old for\r\nfalling in love. It is a mistake which it will take him fully ten\r\nyears to rectify, and then he will make a similar mistake as to men\r\nof fifty. With his awe for Morton\'s combined learning and age, it\r\nnever occurred to him to be jealous.\r\n\r\nMorton passed on rapidly, almost feeling that he had been a brute.\r\nBut what business had the objectionable man to address him? He tried\r\nto excuse himself, but yet he felt that he had been a brute,--and had\r\nso demeaned himself in reference to the daughter of the Dillsborough\r\nattorney! He would teach himself to do all he could to promote the\r\nmarriage. He would give sage advice to Mary Masters as to the wisdom\r\nof establishing herself,--having not an hour since made up his mind\r\nthat he would never see her again! He would congratulate the attorney\r\nand Mrs. Masters. He would conquer the absurd feeling which at\r\npresent was making him wretched. He would cultivate some sort of\r\nacquaintance with the man, and make the happy pair a wedding present.\r\nBut, yet, what "a beast" the man was, with that billicock hat on one\r\nside of his head, and those tight leather gaiters!\r\n\r\nAs he passed through the town towards his own house, he saw Mr.\r\nRunciman standing in front of the hotel. His road took him up Hobbs\r\ngate, by the corner of the Bush; but Runciman came a little out of\r\nthe way to meet him. "You have heard the news?" said the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n"I have heard one piece of news."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Come,--you tell me yours first."\r\n\r\n"The young squire is coming down to Bragton next week."\r\n\r\n"That\'s my news too. It is not likely that there should be two\r\nmatters of interest in Dillsborough on the same day."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why Dillsborough should be worse off than any other\r\nplace, Mr. Morton; but at any rate the squire\'s coming."\r\n\r\n"So Mrs. Hopkins told me. Has he written to you?"\r\n\r\n"His coachman or his groom has; or perhaps he keeps what they call an\r\nekkery. He\'s much too big a swell to write to the likes of me. Lord\r\nbless me,--when I think of it, I wonder how many dozen of orders I\'ve\r\nhad from Lord Rufford under his own hand. \'Dear Runciman, dinner at\r\neight; ten of us; won\'t wait a moment. Yours R.\' I suppose Mr. Morton\r\nwould think that his lordship had let himself down by anything of\r\nthat sort?"\r\n\r\n"What does my cousin want?"\r\n\r\n"Two pair of horses,--for a week certain, and perhaps longer, and\r\ntwo carriages. How am I to let anyone have two pair of horses for a\r\nweek certain,--and perhaps longer? What are other customers to do? I\r\ncan supply a gentleman by the month and buy horses to suit; or I can\r\nsupply him by the job. But I guess Mr. Morton don\'t well know how\r\nthings are managed in this country. He\'ll have to learn."\r\n\r\n"What day does he come?"\r\n\r\n"They haven\'t told me that yet, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE WALK HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Masters, when Reginald Morton had turned his back upon her\r\nat the bridge, was angry with herself and with him, which was\r\nreasonable; and very angry also with Larry Twentyman, which was\r\nunreasonable. As she had at once acceded to Morton\'s proposal that\r\nthey should walk round the house together, surely he should not have\r\ndeserted her so soon. It had not been her fault that the other man\r\nhad come up. She had not wanted him. But she was aware that when the\r\noption had in some sort been left to herself, she had elected to walk\r\nback with Larry. She knew her own motives and her own feelings, but\r\nneither of the men would understand them. Because she preferred the\r\ncompany of Mr. Morton, and had at the moment feared that her sisters\r\nwould have deserted her had she followed him, therefore she had\r\ndeclared her purpose of going back to Dillsborough, in doing which\r\nshe knew that Larry and the girls would accompany her. But of course\r\nMr. Morton would think that she had preferred the company of her\r\nrecognised admirer. It was pretty well known in Dillsborough that\r\nLarry was her lover. Her stepmother had spoken of it very freely; and\r\nLarry himself was a man who did not keep his lights hidden under a\r\nbushel. "I hope I\'ve not been in the way, Mary," said Mr. Twentyman,\r\nas soon as Morton was out of hearing.\r\n\r\n"In the way of what?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think there was any harm in offering to go up to the house\r\nwith you if you were going."\r\n\r\n"Who has said there was any harm?" The path was only broad enough for\r\none and she was walking first. Larry was following her and the girls\r\nwere behind him.\r\n\r\n"I think that Mr. Morton is a very stuck-up fellow," said Kate, who\r\nwas the last.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, Kate," said Mary. "You don\'t know what you are\r\ntalking about."\r\n\r\n"I know as well as any one when a person is good-natured. What made\r\nhim go off in that hoity-toity fashion? Nobody had said anything to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"He always looks as though he were going to eat somebody," said\r\nDolly.\r\n\r\n"He shan\'t eat me," said Kate.\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause, during which they all went along quickly,\r\nMary leading the way. Larry felt that he was wasting his opportunity;\r\nand yet hardly knew how to use it, feeling that the girl was angry\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d say, Mary, whether you think that I did anything\r\nwrong?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing wrong to me, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"Did I do anything wrong to him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how far you may be acquainted with him. He was\r\nproposing to go somewhere, and you offered to go with him."\r\n\r\n"I offered to go with you," said Larry sturdily. "I suppose I\'m\r\nsufficiently acquainted with you."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Why should he be so proud? I never said an uncivil word to him.\r\nHe\'s nothing to me. If he can do without me, I\'m sure that I can do\r\nwithout him."\r\n\r\n"Very well indeed, I should think."\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Mary--"\r\n\r\n"There has been quite enough said about it, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Mary, I came on purpose to have a word with you."\r\nHearing this, Kate rushed on and pulled Larry by the tail of his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n"How did you know I was to be there?" demanded Mary sharply.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know. I had reason to think you perhaps might be there. The\r\ngirls I knew had been asking you to come as far as the bridge. At any\r\nrate I took my chance. I\'d seen him some time before, and then I saw\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"If I\'m to be watched about in that way," said Mary angrily, "I won\'t\r\ngo out at all."\r\n\r\n"Of course I want to see you. Why shouldn\'t I? I\'m all fair and above\r\nboard;--ain\'t I? Your father and mother know all about it. It isn\'t\r\nas though I were doing anything clandestine." He paused for a reply,\r\nbut Mary walked on in silence. She knew quite well that he was\r\nwarranted in seeking her, and that nothing but a very positive\r\ndecision on her part could put an end to his courtship. At the\r\npresent moment she was inclined to be very positive, but he had\r\nhardly as yet given her an opportunity of speaking out. "I think you\r\nknow, Mary, what it is that I want." They were now at a rough stile\r\nwhich enabled him to come close up to her and help her. She tripped\r\nover the stile with a light step and again walked on rapidly. The\r\nfield they were in enabled him to get up to her side, and now if ever\r\nwas his opportunity. It was a long straggling meadow which he knew\r\nwell, with the Dill running by it all the way,--or rather two meadows\r\nwith an open space where there had once been a gate. He had ridden\r\nthrough the gap a score of times, and knew that at the further side\r\nof the second meadow they would come upon the high road. The fields\r\nwere certainly much better for his purpose than the road. "Don\'t you\r\nthink, Mary, you could say a kind word to me?"\r\n\r\n"I never said anything unkind."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t think ill of me for loving you better than all the world."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think ill of you at all. I think very well of you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s kind."\r\n\r\n"So I do. How can I help thinking well of you, when I\'ve never heard\r\nanything but good of you?"\r\n\r\n"Then why shouldn\'t you say at once that you\'ll have me, and make me\r\nthe happiest man in all the county?"\r\n\r\n"Because--"\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"I told you before, Mr. Twentyman, and that ought to have been\r\nenough. A young woman doesn\'t fall in love with every man that she\r\nthinks well of. I should like you as well as all the rest of the\r\nfamily if you would only marry some other girl."\r\n\r\n"I shall never do that."\r\n\r\n"Yes you will;--some day."\r\n\r\n"Never. I\'ve set my heart upon it, and I mean to stick to it. I\'m not\r\nthe fellow to turn about from one girl to another. What I want is the\r\ngirl I love. I\'ve money enough and all that kind of thing of my own."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you\'re disinterested, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am. Ever since you\'ve been home from Bragton it has been the\r\nsame thing, and when I felt that it was so, I spoke up to your father\r\nhonestly. I haven\'t been beating about the bush, and I haven\'t done\r\nanything that wasn\'t honourable." They were very near the last stile\r\nnow. "Come, Mary, if you won\'t make me a promise, say that you\'ll\r\nthink of it."\r\n\r\n"I have thought of it, Mr. Twentyman, and I can\'t make you any other\r\nanswer. I dare say I\'m very foolish."\r\n\r\n"I wish you were more foolish. Perhaps then you wouldn\'t be so hard\r\nto please."\r\n\r\n"Whether I\'m wise or foolish, indeed, indeed, it\'s no good your going\r\non. Now we\'re on the road. Pray go back home, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be getting dark in a little time."\r\n\r\n"Not before we\'re in Dillsborough. If it were ever so dark we could\r\nfind our way home by ourselves. Come along, Dolly."\r\n\r\nOver the last stile he had stayed a moment to help the younger girl,\r\nand as he did so Kate whispered a word in his ear. "She\'s angry\r\nbecause she couldn\'t go up to the house with that stuck-up fellow."\r\nIt was a foolish word; but then Kate Masters had not had much\r\nexperience in the world.\r\n\r\nWhether overcome by Mary\'s resolute mode of speaking, or aware that\r\nthe high road would not suit his purpose, he did turn back as soon\r\nas he had seen them a little way on their return towards the town.\r\nHe had not gone half a mile before he met Morton, and had been\r\nhalf-minded to make some apology to him. But Morton had denied him\r\nthe opportunity, and he had walked on to his own house,--low in\r\nspirits indeed, but still with none of that sorest of agony which\r\ncomes to a lover from the feeling that his love loves some one else.\r\nMary had been very decided with him,--more so he feared than before;\r\nbut still he saw no reason why he should not succeed at last. Mrs.\r\nMasters had told him that Mary would certainly give a little trouble\r\nin winning, but would be the more worth the winner\'s trouble when\r\nwon. And she had certainly shown no preference for any other young\r\nman about the town. There had been a moment when he had much dreaded\r\nMr. Surtees. Young clergymen are apt to be formidable rivals, and\r\nMr. Surtees had certainly made some overtures of friendship to Mary\r\nMasters. But Larry had thought that he had seen that these overtures\r\nhad not led to much, and then that fear had gone from him. He did\r\nbelieve that Mary was now angry because she had not been allowed\r\nto walk about Bragton with her old friend Mr. Morton. It had been\r\nnatural that she should like to do so. It was the pride of Mary\'s\r\nlife that she had been befriended by the Mortons and Lady Ushant.\r\nBut it did not occur to him that he ought to be jealous of Mr.\r\nMorton,--though it had occurred to Kate Masters.\r\n\r\nThere was very little said between the sisters on their way back to\r\nthe town. Mary was pretty sure now that the two girls had made the\r\nappointment with Larry, but she was unwilling to question them on the\r\nsubject. Immediately on their arrival at home they heard the great\r\nnews. John Morton was coming to Bragton with a party of ladies and\r\ngentlemen. Mrs. Hopkins had spoken of four persons. Mrs. Masters told\r\nMary that there were to be a dozen at least, and that four or five\r\npairs of horses and half a dozen carriages had been ordered from Mr.\r\nRunciman. "He means to cut a dash when he does begin," said Mrs.\r\nMasters.\r\n\r\n"Is he going to stay, mother?"\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t come down in that way if it was only for a few days I\r\nsuppose. But what they will do for furniture I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"There\'s plenty of furniture, mother."\r\n\r\n"A thousand years old. Or for wine, or fruit, or plate."\r\n\r\n"The old plate was there when Lady Ushant left."\r\n\r\n"People do things now in a very different way from what they used. A\r\ncouple of dozen silver forks made quite a show on the old squire\'s\r\ntable. Now they change the things so often that ten dozen is nothing.\r\nI don\'t suppose there\'s a bottle of wine in the cellar."\r\n\r\n"They can get wine from Cobbold, mother."\r\n\r\n"Cobbold\'s wine won\'t go down with them I fancy. I wonder what\r\nservants they\'re bringing."\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Masters came in from his office the news was corroborated.\r\nMr. John Morton was certainly coming to Bragton. The attorney had\r\nstill a small unsettled and disputed claim against the owner of the\r\nproperty, and he had now received by the day mail an answer to a\r\nletter which he had written to Mr. Morton, saying that that gentleman\r\nwould see him in the course of the next fortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PARAGON\'S PARTY AT BRAGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was certainly a great deal of fuss made about John Morton\'s\r\nreturn to the home of his ancestors,--made altogether by himself and\r\nthose about him, and not by those who were to receive him. On the\r\nThursday in the week following that of which we have been speaking,\r\ntwo carriages from the Bush met the party at the Railway Station and\r\ntook them to Bragton. Mr. Runciman, after due consideration, put up\r\nwith the inconsiderate nature of the order given, and supplied the\r\ncoaches and horses as required,--consoling himself no doubt with\r\nthe reflection that he could charge for the unreasonableness of the\r\ndemand in the bill. The coachman and butler had come down two days\r\nbefore their master, so that things might be in order. Mrs. Hopkins\r\nlearned from the butler that though the party would at first consist\r\nonly of three, two other very august persons were to follow on the\r\nSaturday,--no less than Lady Augustus Trefoil and her daughter\r\nArabella. And Mrs. Hopkins was soon led to imagine, though no\r\npositive information was given to her on the subject, that Miss\r\nTrefoil was engaged to be married to their master. "Will he live here\r\naltogether, Mr. Tankard?" Mrs. Hopkins asked. To this question Mr.\r\nTankard was able to give a very definite answer. He was quite sure\r\nthat Mr. Morton would not live anywhere altogether. According to Mr.\r\nTankard\'s ideas, the whole foreign policy of England depended on Mr.\r\nJohn Morton\'s presence in some capital, either in Europe, Asia, or\r\nAmerica,--upon Mr. Morton\'s presence, and of course upon his own\r\nalso. Mr. Tankard thought it not improbable that they might soon be\r\nwanted at Hong Kong, or some very distant place,--but in the meantime\r\nthey were bound to be back at Washington very shortly. Tankard\r\nhad himself been at Washington, and also before that at Lisbon,\r\nand could tell Mrs. Hopkins how utterly unimportant had been the\r\nactual ministers at those places, and how the welfare of England had\r\ndepended altogether on the discretion and general omniscience of his\r\nyoung master,--and of himself. He, Tankard, had been the only person\r\nin Washington who had really known in what order Americans should go\r\nout to dinner one after another. Mr. Elias Gotobed, who was coming,\r\nwas perhaps the most distinguished American of the day, and was\r\nSenator for Mickewa.\r\n\r\n"Mickey war!" said poor Mrs. Hopkins,--"that\'s been one of them\r\nterrible American wars we used to hear of." Then Tankard explained to\r\nher that Mickewa was one of the Western States and Mr. Elias Gotobed\r\nwas a great Republican, who had very advanced opinions of his own\r\nrespecting government, liberty, and public institutions in general.\r\nWith Mr. Morton and the Senator was coming the Honourable Mrs.\r\nMorton. The lady had her lady\'s maid,--and Mr. Morton had his own\r\nman; so that there would be a great influx of persons.\r\n\r\nOf course there was very much perturbation of spirit. Mrs. Hopkins,\r\nafter that first letter, the contents of which she had communicated\r\nto Reginald Morton, had received various despatches and been asked\r\nvarious questions. Could she find a cook? Could she find two\r\nhousemaids? And all these were only wanted for a time. In her\r\ndistress she went to Mrs. Runciman, and did get assistance. "I\r\nsuppose he thinks he\'s to have the cook out of my kitchen?" Runciman\r\nhad said. Somebody, however, was found who said she could cook, and\r\ntwo girls who professed that they knew how to make beds. And in this\r\nway an establishment was ready before the arrival of the Secretary\r\nof Legation and the great American Senator. Those other questions of\r\nwine and plate and vegetables had, no doubt, settled themselves after\r\nsome fashion.\r\n\r\nJohn Morton had come over to England on leave of absence for four\r\nmonths, and had brought with him the Senator from Mickewa. The\r\nSenator had never been in England before and was especially anxious\r\nto study the British Constitution and to see the ways of Britons with\r\nhis own eyes. He had only been a fortnight in London before this\r\njourney down to the county had been planned. Mr. Gotobed wished\r\nto see English country life and thought that he could not on his\r\nfirst arrival have a better opportunity. It must be explained also\r\nthat there was another motive for this English rural sojourn. Lady\r\nAugustus Trefoil, who was an adventurous lady, had been travelling in\r\nthe United States with her daughter, and had there fallen in with Mr.\r\nJohn Morton. Arabella Trefoil was a beauty, and a woman of fashion,\r\nand had captivated the Paragon. An engagement had been made, subject\r\nto various stipulations; the consent of Lord Augustus in the first\r\nplace,--as to which John Morton who only understood foreign affairs\r\nwas not aware, as he would have been had he lived in England, that\r\nLord Augustus was nobody. Lady Augustus had spoken freely as to\r\nsettlements, value of property, life insurance and such matters; and\r\nhad spoken firmly, as well as freely, expressing doubt as to the\r\nexpediency of such an engagement;--all of which had surprised Mr.\r\nMorton considerably, for the young lady had at first been left in\r\nhis hands with almost American freedom. And now Lady Augustus and\r\nher daughter were coming down on a visit of inspection. They had\r\nbeen told, as had the Senator, that things would be in the rough.\r\nThe house had not been properly inhabited for nearly a quarter of\r\na century. The Senator had expressed himself quite contented. Lady\r\nAugustus had only hoped that everything would be made as comfortable\r\nas possible for her daughter. I don\'t know what more could have\r\nbeen done at so short a notice than to order two carriages, two\r\nhousemaids, and a cook.\r\n\r\nA word or two must also be said of the old lady who made one of the\r\nparty. The Honourable Mrs. Morton was now seventy, but no old lady\r\never showed less signs of advanced age. It is not to be understood\r\nfrom this that she was beautiful;--but that she was very strong.\r\nWhat might be the colour of her hair, or whether she had any, no man\r\nhad known for many years. But she wore so perfect a front that some\r\npeople were absolutely deluded. She was very much wrinkled;--but as\r\nthere are wrinkles which seem to come from the decay of those muscles\r\nwhich should uphold the skin, so are there others which seem to\r\ndenote that the owner has simply got rid of the watery weaknesses\r\nof juvenility. Mrs. Morton\'s wrinkles were strong wrinkles. She was\r\nthin, but always carried herself bolt upright, and would never even\r\nlean back in her chair. She had a great idea of her duty, and hated\r\neverybody who differed from her with her whole heart. She was the\r\ndaughter of a Viscount, a fact which she never forgot for a single\r\nmoment, and which she thought gave her positive superiority to all\r\nwomen who were not the daughters of Dukes or Marquises, or of Earls.\r\nTherefore, as she did not live much in the fashionable world, she\r\nrarely met any one above herself. Her own fortune on her marriage had\r\nbeen small, but now she was a rich woman. Her husband had been dead\r\nnearly half a century and during the whole of that time she had been\r\nsaving money. To two charities she gave annually L5 per annum each.\r\nDuty demanded it, and the money was given. Beyond that she had never\r\nbeen known to spend a penny in charity. Duty, she had said more than\r\nonce, required of her that she do something to repair the ravages\r\nmade on the Morton property by the preposterous extravagance of the\r\nold squire in regard to the younger son, and that son\'s--child. In\r\nher anger she had not hesitated on different occasions to call the\r\npresent Reginald a bastard, though the expression was a wicked\r\ncalumny for which there was no excuse. Without any aid of hers the\r\nMorton property had repaired itself. There had been a minority of\r\nthirteen or fourteen years, and since that time the present owner\r\nhad not spent his income. But John Morton was not himself averse to\r\nmoney, and had always been careful to maintain good relations with\r\nhis grandmother. She had now been asked down to Bragton in order that\r\nshe might approve, if possible, of the proposed wife. It was not\r\nlikely that she should approve absolutely of anything; but to have\r\nmarried without an appeal to her would have been to have sent the\r\nmoney flying into the hands of some of her poor paternal cousins.\r\nArabella Trefoil was the granddaughter of a duke, and a step had so\r\nfar been made in the right direction. But Mrs. Morton knew that Lord\r\nAugustus was nobody, that there would be no money, and that Lady\r\nAugustus had been the daughter of a banker, and that her fortune had\r\nbeen nearly squandered.\r\n\r\nThe Paragon was not in the least afraid of his American visitor,\r\nnor, as far as the comforts of his house were concerned, of his\r\ngrandmother. Of the beauty and her mother he did stand in awe;--but\r\nhe had two days in which to look to things before they would come.\r\nThe train reached the Dillsborough Station at half-past three, and\r\nthe two carriages were there to meet them. "You will understand, Mr.\r\nGotobed," said the old lady, "that my grandson has nothing of his own\r\nestablished here as yet." This little excuse was produced by certain\r\npatches and tears in the cushions and linings of the carriages.\r\nMr. Gotobed smiled and bowed and declared that everything was\r\n"fixed convenient." Then the Senator followed the old lady into one\r\ncarriage; Mr. Morton followed alone into the other; and they were\r\ndriven away to Bragton.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Hopkins had taken the old lady up to her room Mr. Morton\r\nasked the Senator to walk round the grounds. Mr. Gotobed, lighting\r\nan enormous cigar of which he put half down his throat for more\r\ncommodious and quick consumption, walked on to the middle of the\r\ndrive, and turning back looked up at the house, "Quite a pile," he\r\nsaid, observing that the offices and outhouses extended a long way to\r\nthe left till they almost joined other buildings in which were the\r\nstables and coach-house.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good-sized house,"--said the owner;--"nothing very\r\nparticular, as houses are built now-a-days."\r\n\r\n"Damp; I should say?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. I have never lived here much myself; but I have not\r\nheard that it is considered so."\r\n\r\n"I guess it\'s damp. Very lonely;--isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"We like to have our society inside, among ourselves, in the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"Keep a sort of hotel--like?" suggested Mr. Gotobed. "Well, I don\'t\r\ndislike hotel life, especially when there are no charges. How many\r\nservants do you want to keep up such a house as that?"\r\n\r\nMr. Morton explained that at present he knew very little about it\r\nhimself, then led him away by the path over the bridge, and turning\r\nto the left showed him the building which had once been the kennels\r\nof the Rufford hounds. "All that for dogs!" exclaimed Mr. Gotobed.\r\n\r\n"All for dogs," said Morton. "Hounds, we generally call them."\r\n\r\n"Hounds are they? Well;--I\'ll remember; though \'dogs\' seems to me\r\nmore civil. How many used there to be?"\r\n\r\n"About fifty couple, I think."\r\n\r\n"A hundred dogs! No wonder your country gentlemen burst up so often.\r\nWouldn\'t half-a-dozen do as well,--except for the show of the thing?"\r\n\r\n"Half-a-dozen hounds couldn\'t hunt a fox, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"I guess half-a-dozen would do just as well, only for the show. What\r\nstrikes me, Mr. Morton, on visiting this old country is that so much\r\nis done for show."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to New York, Mr. Gotobed?"\r\n\r\n"There certainly are a couple of hundred fools in New York, who,\r\nhaving more money than brains, amuse themselves by imitating European\r\nfollies. But you won\'t find that through the country, Mr. Morton. You\r\nwon\'t find a hundred dogs at an American planter\'s house when ten or\r\ntwelve would do as well."\r\n\r\n"Hunting is not one of your amusements."\r\n\r\n"Yes it is. I\'ve been a hunter myself. I\'ve had nothing to eat but\r\nwhat I killed for a month together. That\'s more than any of your\r\nhunters can say. A hundred dogs to kill one fox!"\r\n\r\n"Not all at the same time, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"And you have got none now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t hunt myself."\r\n\r\n"And does nobody hunt the foxes about here at present?" Then Morton\r\nexplained that on the Saturday following the U. R. U. hounds, under\r\nthe mastership of that celebrated sportsman Captain Glomax, would\r\nmeet at eleven o\'clock exactly at the spot on which they were then\r\nstanding, and that if Mr. Gotobed would walk out after breakfast he\r\nshould see the whole paraphernalia, including about half a hundred\r\n"dogs," and perhaps a couple of hundred men on horseback. "I shall\r\nbe delighted to see any institution of this great country," said Mr.\r\nGotobed, "however much opposed it may be to my opinion either of\r\nutility or rational recreation." Then, having nearly eaten up one\r\ncigar, he lit another preparatory to eating it, and sauntered back to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner that evening there were a few words between the Paragon\r\nand his grandmother. "I\'m afraid you won\'t like my American friend,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n"He is all very well, John. Of course an American member of Congress\r\ncan\'t be an English gentleman. You, in your position, have to be\r\ncivil to such people. I dare say I shall get on very well with Mr.\r\nGotobed."\r\n\r\n"I must get somebody to meet him."\r\n\r\n"Lady Augustus and her daughter are coming."\r\n\r\n"They knew each other in Washington. And there will be so many\r\nladies."\r\n\r\n"You could ask the Coopers from Mallingham," suggested the lady.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they would dine out. He\'s getting very old."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m told the Mainwarings at Dillsborough are very nice people,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Morton, who knew that Mr. Mainwaring at any rate came from\r\na good family.\r\n\r\n"I suppose they ought to call first. I never saw them in my life.\r\nReginald Morton, you know, is living at Hoppet Hall in Dillsborough."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you wish to ask him to this house?"\r\n\r\n"I think I ought. Why should I take upon myself to quarrel with a man\r\nI have not seen since I was a child, and who certainly is my cousin?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know that he is your cousin;--nor do you."\r\n\r\nJohn Morton passed by the calumny which he had heard before, and\r\nwhich he knew that it was no good for him to attempt to subvert. "He\r\nwas received here as one of the family, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"I know he was;--and with what result?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that I ought to turn my back upon him because my\r\ngreat-grandfather left property away from me to him. It would give me\r\na bad name in the county. It would be against me when I settle down\r\nto live here. I think quarrelling is the most foolish thing a man can\r\ndo,--especially with his own relations."\r\n\r\n"I can only say this, John;--let me know if he is coming, so that\r\nI may not be called upon to meet him. I will not eat at table with\r\nReginald Morton." So saying the old lady, in a stately fashion,\r\nstalked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD KENNELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Mrs. Morton asked her grandson what he meant to\r\ndo with reference to his suggested invitation to Reginald. "As you\r\nwill not meet him of course I have given up the idea," he said.\r\nThe "of course" had been far from true. He had debated the matter\r\nvery much with himself. He was an obstinate man, with something of\r\nindependence in his spirit. He liked money, but he liked having his\r\nown way too. The old lady looked as though she might live to be a\r\nhundred,--and though she might last only for ten years longer, was it\r\nworth his while to be a slave for that time? And he was by no means\r\nsure of her money, though he should be a slave. He almost made up his\r\nmind that he would ask Reginald Morton. But then the old lady would\r\nbe in her tantrums, and there would be the disagreeable necessity\r\nof making an explanation to that inquisitive gentleman Mr. Elias\r\nGotobed.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t have met him, John; I couldn\'t indeed. I remember so well\r\nall that occurred when your poor infatuated old great-grandfather\r\nwould have that woman into the house! I was forced to have my meals\r\nin my bedroom, and to get myself taken away as soon as I could get a\r\ncarriage and horses. After all that I ought not to be asked to meet\r\nthe child."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of asking old Mr. Cooper on Monday. I know she\r\ndoesn\'t go out. And perhaps Mr. Mainwaring wouldn\'t take it amiss.\r\nMr. Puttock, I know, isn\'t at home; but if he were, he couldn\'t\r\ncome." Mr. Puttock was the rector of Bragton, a very rich living, but\r\nwas unfortunately afflicted with asthma.\r\n\r\n"Poor man. I heard of that; and he\'s only been here about six years.\r\nI don\'t see why Mr. Mainwaring should take it amiss at all. You can\r\nexplain that you are only here a few days. I like to meet clergymen.\r\nI think that it is the duty of a country gentleman to ask them to his\r\nhouse. It shows a proper regard for religion. By-the-bye, John, I\r\nhope that you\'ll see that they have a fire in the church on Sunday."\r\nThe Honourable Mrs. Morton always went to church, and had no doubt of\r\nher own sincerity when she reiterated her prayer that as she forgave\r\nothers their trespasses, so might she be forgiven hers. As Reginald\r\nMorton had certainly never trespassed against her perhaps there was\r\nno reason why her thoughts should be carried to the necessity of\r\nforgiving him.\r\n\r\nThe Paragon wrote two very diplomatic notes, explaining his temporary\r\nresidence and expressing his great desire to become acquainted with\r\nhis neighbours. Neither of the two clergymen were offended, and both\r\nof them promised to eat his dinner on Monday. Mr. Mainwaring was very\r\nfond of dining out, and would have gone almost to any gentleman\'s\r\nhouse. Mr. Cooper had been enough in the neighbourhood to have\r\nknown the old squire, and wrote an affectionate note expressing his\r\ngratification at the prospect of renewing his acquaintance with the\r\nlittle boy whom he remembered. So the party was made up for Monday.\r\nJohn Morton was very nervous on the matter, fearing that Lady\r\nAugustus would think the land to be barren.\r\n\r\nThe Friday passed by without much difficulty. The Senator was driven\r\nabout, and everything was inquired into. One or two farm-houses were\r\nvisited, and the farmers\' wives were much disturbed by the questions\r\nasked them. "I don\'t think they\'d get a living in the States," was\r\nthe Senator\'s remark after leaving one of the homesteads in which\r\nneither the farmer nor his wife had shown much power of conversation.\r\n"Then they\'re right to stay where they are," replied Mr. Morton, who\r\nin spite of his diplomacy could not save himself from being nettled.\r\n"They seem to get a very good living here, and they pay their rent\r\npunctually."\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday morning the hounds met at the "Old Kennels," as the\r\nmeet was always called, and here was an excellent opportunity of\r\nshowing to Mr. Gotobed one of the great institutions of the country.\r\nIt was close to the house and therefore could be reached without any\r\ntrouble, and as it was held on Morton\'s own ground, he could do more\r\ntowards making his visitor understand the thing than might have been\r\npossible elsewhere. When the hounds moved the carriage would be ready\r\nto take them about the roads, and show them as much as could be seen\r\non wheels.\r\n\r\nPunctually at eleven John Morton and his American guest were on the\r\nbridge, and Tony Tuppett was already occupying his wonted place,\r\nseated on a strong grey mare that had done a great deal of work, but\r\nwould live,--as Tony used to say,--to do a great deal more. Round him\r\nthe hounds were clustered,--twenty-three couple in all,--some seated\r\non their haunches, some standing obediently still, while a few moved\r\nabout restlessly, subject to the voices and on one or two occasions\r\nto a gentle administration of thong from the attendant whips. Four or\r\nfive horsemen were clustering round, most of them farmers, and were\r\ntalking to Tony. Our friend Mr. Twentyman was the only man in a red\r\ncoat who had yet arrived, and with him, on her brown pony, was Kate\r\nMasters, who was listening with all her ears to every word that Tony\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"That, I guess, is the Captain you spoke of," said the Senator\r\npointing to Tony Tuppett.\r\n\r\n"Oh no;--that\'s the huntsman. Those three men in caps are the\r\nservants who do the work."\r\n\r\n"The dogs can\'t be brought out without servants to mind them! They\'re\r\nwhat you call gamekeepers." Morton was explaining that the men were\r\nnot gamekeepers when Captain Glomax himself arrived, driving a\r\ntandem. There was no road up to the spot, but on hunt mornings,--or\r\nat any rate when the meet was at the old kennels,--the park-gates\r\nwere open so that vehicles could come up on the green sward.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Captain Glomax, I suppose," said Morton. "I don\'t know him,\r\nbut from the way he\'s talking to the huntsman you may be sure of it."\r\n\r\n"He is the great man, is he? All these dogs belong to him?"\r\n\r\n"Either to him or the hunt."\r\n\r\n"And he pays for those servants?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"He is a very rich man, I suppose." Then Mr. Morton endeavoured to\r\nexplain the position of Captain Glomax. He was not rich. He was no\r\none in particular--except that he was Captain Glomax; and his one\r\nattribute was a knowledge of hunting. He didn\'t keep the "dogs" out\r\nof his own pocket. He received L2,000 a year from the gentlemen of\r\nthe county, and he himself only paid anything which the hounds and\r\nhorses might cost over that. "He\'s a sort of upper servant then?"\r\nasked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"Not at all. He\'s the greatest man in the county on hunting days."\r\n\r\n"Does he live out of it?"\r\n\r\n"I should think not."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a deal of trouble, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Full work for an active man\'s time, I should say." A great many more\r\nquestions were asked and answered, at the end of which the Senator\r\ndeclared that he did not quite understand it, but that as far as he\r\nsaw he did not think very much of Captain Glomax.\r\n\r\n"If he could make a living out of it I should respect him," said the\r\nSenator;--"though it\'s like knife-grinding or handling arsenic,--an\r\nunwholesome sort of profession."\r\n\r\n"I think they look very nice," said Morton, as one or two\r\nwell-turned-out young men rode up to the place.\r\n\r\n"They seem to me to have thought more about their breeches than\r\nanything else," said the Senator. "But if they\'re going to hunt why\r\ndon\'t they hunt? Have they got a fox with them?" Then there was a\r\nfurther explanation.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a murmur as of a great coming arrival, and\r\nthen an open carriage with four post-horses was brought at a quick\r\ntrot into the open space. There were four men dressed for hunting\r\ninside, and two others on the box. They were all smoking, and all\r\ntalking. It was easy to see that they did not consider themselves the\r\nleast among those who were gathered together on this occasion. The\r\ncarriage was immediately surrounded by grooms and horses, and the\r\nceremony of disencumbering themselves of great coats and aprons, of\r\nputting on spurs and fastening hat-strings was commenced. Then there\r\nwere whispered communications from the grooms, and long faces under\r\nsome of the hats. This horse hadn\'t been fit since last Monday\'s run,\r\nand that man\'s hack wasn\'t as it should be. A muttered curse might\r\nhave been heard from one gentleman as he was told, on jumping from\r\nthe box, that Harry Stubbings hadn\'t sent him any second horse to\r\nride. "I didn\'t hear nothing about it till yesterday, Captain," said\r\nHarry Stubbings, "and every foot I had fit to come out was bespoke."\r\nThe groom, however, who heard this was quite aware that Mr. Stubbings\r\ndid not wish to give unlimited credit to the Captain, and he knew\r\nalso that the second horse was to have carried his master the whole\r\nday, as the animal which was brought to the meet had been ridden\r\nhard on the previous Wednesday. At all this the Senator looked with\r\ncurious eyes, thinking that he had never in his life seen brought\r\ntogether a set of more useless human beings.\r\n\r\n"That is Lord Rufford," said Morton, pointing to a stout,\r\nruddy-faced, handsome man of about thirty, who was the owner of the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a lord. Do the lords hunt generally?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s as they like it."\r\n\r\n"Senators with us wouldn\'t have time for that," said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"But you are paid to do your work."\r\n\r\n"Everybody from whom work is expected should be paid. Then the work\r\nwill be done, or those who pay will know the reason why."\r\n\r\n"I must speak to Lord Rufford," said Morton. "If you\'ll come with me,\r\nI\'ll introduce you." The Senator followed willingly enough and the\r\nintroduction was made while his lordship was still standing by his\r\nhorse. The two men had known each other in London, and it was natural\r\nthat Morton, as owner of the ground, should come out and speak to the\r\nonly man who knew him. It soon was spread about that the gentleman\r\ntalking to Lord Rufford was John Morton, and many who lived in the\r\ncounty came up to shake hands with him. To some of these the Senator\r\nwas introduced and the conversation for a few minutes seemed to\r\ninterrupt the business on hand. "I am sorry you should be on foot,\r\nMr. Gotobed," said the lord.\r\n\r\n"And I am sorry that I cannot mount him," said Mr. Morton.\r\n\r\n"We can soon get over that difficulty if he will allow me to offer\r\nhim a horse."\r\n\r\nThe Senator looked as though he would almost like it, but he didn\'t\r\nquite like it. "Perhaps your horse might kick me off, my lord."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t answer for that; but he isn\'t given to kicking, and there he\r\nis, if you\'ll get on him." But the Senator felt that the exhibition\r\nwould suit neither his age nor position, and refused.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better be moving," said Captain Glomax. "I suppose, Lord\r\nRufford, we might as well trot over to Dillsborough Wood at once. I\r\nsaw Bean as I came along and he seemed to wish we should draw the\r\nwood first." Then there was a little whispering between his lordship\r\nand the Master and Tony Tuppett. His lordship thought that as Mr.\r\nMorton was there the hounds might as well be run through the Bragton\r\nspinnies. Tony made a wry face and shook his head. He knew that\r\nthough the Old Kennels might be a very good place for meeting there\r\nwas no chance of finding a fox at Bragton. And Captain Glomax, who,\r\nbeing an itinerary master, had no respect whatever for a country\r\ngentleman who didn\'t preserve, also made a long face and also shook\r\nhis head. But Lord Rufford, who knew the wisdom of reconciling a\r\nnewcomer in the county to foxhunting, prevailed and the hounds and\r\nmen were taken round a part of Bragton Park.\r\n\r\n"What \'d t\' old squire \'ve said if he\'d \'ve known there hadn\'t been\r\na fox at Bragton for more nor ten year?" This remark was made by\r\nTuppett to Mr. Runciman who was riding by him. Mr. Runciman replied\r\nthat there was a great difference in people. "You may say that, Mr.\r\nRunciman. It\'s all changes. His lordship\'s father couldn\'t bear the\r\nsight of a hound nor a horse and saddle. Well;--I suppose I needn\'t\r\ngammon any furder. We\'ll just trot across to the wood at once."\r\n\r\n"They haven\'t begun yet as far as I can see," said Mr. Gotobed\r\nstanding up in the carriage.\r\n\r\n"They haven\'t found as yet," replied Morton.\r\n\r\n"They must go on till they find a fox? They never bring him with\r\nthem?" Then there was an explanation as to bagged foxes, Morton not\r\nbeing very conversant with the subject he had to explain. "And if\r\nthey shouldn\'t find one all day?"\r\n\r\n"Then it\'ll be a blank."\r\n\r\n"And these hundred gentlemen will go home quite satisfied with\r\nthemselves?"\r\n\r\n"No;--they\'ll go home quite dissatisfied."\r\n\r\n"And have paid their money and given their time for nothing? Do you\r\nknow it doesn\'t seem to me the most heart-stirring thing in the\r\nworld. Don\'t they ride faster than that?" At this moment Tony with\r\nthe hounds at his heels was trotting across the park at a huntsman\'s\r\nusual pace from covert to covert. The Senator was certainly\r\nungracious. Nothing that he saw produced from him a single word\r\nexpressive of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLess than a mile brought them to the gate and road leading up to\r\nChowton Farm. They passed close by Larry Twentyman\'s door, and not\r\na few, though it was not yet more than half-past eleven, stopped\r\nto have a glass of Larry\'s beer. When the hounds were in the\r\nneighbourhood Larry\'s beer was always ready. But Tony and his\r\nattendants trotted by with eyes averted, as though no thought of beer\r\nwas in their minds. Nothing had been done, and a huntsman is not\r\nentitled to beer till he has found a fox. Captain Glomax followed\r\nwith Lord Rufford and a host of others. There was plenty of way here\r\nfor carriages, and half a dozen vehicles passed through Larry\'s\r\nfarmyard. Immediately behind the house was a meadow, and at the\r\nbottom of the meadow a stubble field, next to which was the ditch\r\nand bank which formed the bounds of Dillsborough Wood. Just at this\r\nside of the gate leading into the stubble-field there was already a\r\nconcourse of people when Tony arrived near it with the hounds, and\r\nimmediately there was a holloaing and loud screeching of directions,\r\nwhich was soon understood to mean that the hounds were at once to be\r\ntaken away! The Captain rode on rapidly, and then sharply gave his\r\norders. Tony was to take the hounds back to Mr. Twentyman\'s farmyard\r\nas fast as he could, and shut them up in a barn. The whips were put\r\ninto violent commotion. Tony was eagerly at work. Not a hound was\r\nto be allowed near the gate. And then, as the crowd of horsemen and\r\ncarriages came on, the word "poison" was passed among them from mouth\r\nto mouth!\r\n\r\n"What does all this mean?" said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t at all know. I\'m afraid there\'s something wrong," replied\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\n"I heard that man say \'poison.\' They have taken the dogs back again."\r\nThen the Senator and Morton got out of the carriage and made their\r\nway into the crowd. The riders who had grooms on second horses were\r\nsoon on foot, and a circle was made, inside which there was some\r\nobject of intense interest. In the meantime the hounds had been\r\nsecured in one of Mr. Twentyman\'s barns.\r\n\r\nWhat was that object of interest shall be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nGOARLY\'S REVENGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senator and Morton followed close on the steps of Lord Rufford\r\nand Captain Glomax and were thus able to make their way into the\r\ncentre of the crowd. There, on a clean sward of grass, laid out as\r\ncarefully as though he were a royal child prepared for burial, was--a\r\ndead fox. "It\'s pi\'son, my lord; it\'s pi\'son to a moral," said Bean,\r\nwho as keeper of the wood was bound to vindicate himself, and his\r\nmaster, and the wood. "Feel of him, how stiff he is." A good many did\r\nfeel, but Lord Rufford stood still and looked at the poor victim in\r\nsilence. "It\'s easy knowing how he come by it," said Bean.\r\n\r\nThe men around gazed into each other\'s faces with a sad tragic air,\r\nas though the occasion were one which at the first blush was too\r\nmelancholy for many words. There was whispering here and there\r\nand one young farmer\'s son gave a deep sigh, like a steam-engine\r\nbeginning to work, and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand.\r\n"There ain\'t nothin\' too bad,--nothin\'," said another,--leaving his\r\naudience to imagine whether he were alluding to the wretchedness\r\nof the world in general or to the punishment which was due to the\r\nperpetrator of this nefarious act. The dreadful word "vulpecide" was\r\nheard from various lips with an oath or two before it. "It makes me\r\nsick of my own land, to think it should be done so near," said Larry\r\nTwentyman, who had just come up. Mr. Runciman declared that they must\r\nset their wits to work not only to find the criminal but to prove the\r\ncrime against him, and offered to subscribe a couple of sovereigns on\r\nthe spot to a common fund to be raised for the purpose. "I don\'t know\r\nwhat is to be done with a country like this," said Captain Glomax,\r\nwho, as an itinerant, was not averse to cast a slur upon the land of\r\nhis present sojourn.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember anything like it on my property before," said the\r\nlord, standing up for his own estate and the county at large.\r\n\r\n"Nor in the hunt," said young Hampton. "Of course such a thing may\r\nhappen anywhere. They had foxes poisoned in the Pytchley last year."\r\n\r\n"It shows a d---- bad feeling somewhere," said the Master.\r\n\r\n"We know very well where the feeling is," said Bean who had by this\r\ntime taken up the fox, determined not to allow it to pass into any\r\nhands less careful than his own.\r\n\r\n"It\'s that scoundrel, Goarly," said one of the Botseys. Then there\r\nwas an indignant murmur heard, first of all from two or three and\r\nthen running among the whole crowd. Everybody knew as well as though\r\nhe had seen it that Goarly had baited meat with strychnine and put\r\nit down in the wood. "Might have pi\'soned half the pack!" said Tony\r\nTuppett, who had come up on foot from the barn where the hounds were\r\nstill imprisoned, and had caught hold in an affectionate manner of\r\na fore pad of the fox which Bean had clutched by the two hind legs.\r\nPoor Tony Tuppett almost shed tears as he looked at the dead animal,\r\nand thought what might have been the fate of the pack. "It\'s him,\r\nmy lord," he said, "as we run through Littleton gorse Monday after\r\nChristmas last, and up to Impington Park where he got away from us\r\nin a hollow tree. He\'s four year old," added Tony, looking at the\r\nanimal\'s mouth, "and there warn\'t a finer dog fox in the county."\r\n\r\n"Do they know all the foxes?" asked the Senator. In answer to this,\r\nMorton only shook his head, not feeling quite sure himself how far a\r\nhuntsman\'s acquaintance in that line might go, and being also too\r\nmuch impressed by the occasion for speculative conversation.\r\n\r\n"It\'s that scoundrel Goarly" had been repeated again and again; and\r\nthen on a sudden Goarly himself was seen standing on the further\r\nhedge of Larry\'s field with a gun in his hand. He was not at this\r\ntime above two hundred yards from them, and was declared by one of\r\nthe young farmers to be grinning with delight. The next field was\r\nGoarly\'s, but the hedge and ditch belonged to Twentyman. Larry rushed\r\nforward as though determined to thrash the man, and two or three\r\nfollowed him. But Lord Rufford galloped on and stopped them. "Don\'t\r\nget into a row with a fellow like that," he said to Twentyman.\r\n\r\n"He\'s on my land, my lord," said Larry impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I\'m on my own now, and let me see who\'ll dare to touch me," said\r\nGoarly jumping down.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve put poison down in that wood," said Larry.\r\n\r\n"No I didn\'t;--but I knows who did. It ain\'t I as am afeard for\r\nmy young turkeys." Now it was well known that old Mrs. Twentyman,\r\nLarry\'s mother, was fond of young turkeys, and that her poultry-yard\r\nhad suffered. Larry, in his determination to be a gentleman, had\r\nalways laughed at his mother\'s losses. But now to be accused in this\r\nway was terrible to his feelings! He made a rush as though to jump\r\nover the hedge, but Lord Rufford again intercepted him. "I didn\'t\r\nthink, Mr. Twentyman, that you\'d care for what such a fellow as that\r\nmight say." By this time Lord Rufford was off his horse, and had\r\ntaken hold of Larry.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you all what it is," screamed Goarly, standing just at the\r\nedge of his own field,--"if a hound comes out of the wood on to my\r\nland, I\'ll shoot him. I don\'t know nothing about p\'isoning, though I\r\ndare say Mr. Twentyman does. But if a hound comes on my land, I\'ll\r\nshoot him,--open, before you all." There was, however, no danger of\r\nsuch a threat being executed on this day, as of course no hound would\r\nbe allowed to go into Dillsborough Wood.\r\n\r\nTwentyman was reluctantly brought back into the meadow where the\r\nhorses were standing, and then a consultation was held as to what\r\nthey should do next. There were some who thought that the hounds\r\nshould be taken home for the day. It was as though some special\r\nfriend of the U. R. U. had died that morning, and that the spirits of\r\nthe sportsmen were too dejected for their sport. Others, with prudent\r\nforesight, suggested that the hounds might run back from some distant\r\ncovert to Dillsborough, and that there should be no hunting till the\r\nwood had been thoroughly searched. But the strangers, especially\r\nthose who had hired horses, would not hear of this; and after\r\nconsiderable delay it was arranged that the hounds should be trotted\r\noff as quickly as possible to Impington Gorse, which was on the other\r\nside of Impington Park, and fully five miles distant. And so they\r\nstarted, leaving the dead fox in the hands of Bean the gamekeeper.\r\n\r\n"Is this the sort of thing that occurs every day?" asked the Senator\r\nas he got back into the carriage.\r\n\r\n"I should fancy not," answered Morton. "Somebody has poisoned a fox,\r\nand I don\'t think that that is very often done about here."\r\n\r\n"Why did he poison him?"\r\n\r\n"To save his fowls I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t he poison him if the fox takes his fowls? Fowls are\r\nbetter than foxes."\r\n\r\n"Not in this country," said Morton.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m very glad I don\'t live here," said Mr. Gotobed. "These\r\nfriends of yours are dressed very nicely and look very well,--but\r\na fox is a nasty animal. It was that man standing up on the\r\nbank;--wasn\'t it?" continued the Senator, who was determined to\r\nunderstand it all to the very bottom, in reference to certain\r\nlectures which he intended to give on his return to the States,--and\r\nperhaps also in the old country before he left it.\r\n\r\n"They suspect him."\r\n\r\n"That man with the gun! One man against two hundred! Now I respect\r\nthat man;--I do with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better not say so here, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"I know how full of prejudice you all air\',--but I do respect him. If\r\nI comprehend the matter rightly, he was on his own land when we saw\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that was his own field."\r\n\r\n"And they meant to ride across it whether he liked it or no?"\r\n\r\n"Everybody rides across everybody\'s land out hunting."\r\n\r\n"Would they ride across your park, Mr. Morton, if you didn\'t let\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly they would,--and break down all my gates if I had them\r\nlocked, and pull down my park palings to let the hounds through."\r\n\r\n"And you could get no compensation?"\r\n\r\n"Practically I could get none. And certainly I should not try. The\r\ngreatest enemy to hunting in the whole county would not be foolish\r\nenough to make the attempt."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"He would get no satisfaction, and everybody would hate him."\r\n\r\n"Then I respect that man the more. What is that man\'s name?" Morton\r\nhadn\'t heard the name, or had forgotten it. "I shall find that man\r\nout, and have some conversation with him, Mr. Morton. I respect that\r\nman, Mr. Morton. He\'s one against two hundred, and he insists upon\r\nhis rights. Those men standing round and wiping their eyes, and\r\nstifled with grief because a fox had been poisoned, as though some\r\ngreat patriot had died among them in the service of his country,\r\nformed one of the most remarkable phenomena, sir, that ever I beheld\r\nin any country. When I get among my own people in Mickewa and tell\r\nthem that,--they won\'t believe me, sir."\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the cavalcade was hurrying away to Impington Gorse,\r\nand John Morton, feeling that he had not had an opportunity as yet of\r\nshowing his American friend the best side of hunting, went with them.\r\nThe five miles were five long miles, and as the pace was not above\r\nseven miles an hour, nearly an hour was occupied. There was therefore\r\nplenty of opportunity for the Senator to inquire whether the\r\ngentlemen around him were as yet enjoying their sport. There was an\r\nair of triumph about him as to the misfortunes of the day, joined to\r\na battery of continued raillery, which made it almost impossible for\r\nMorton to keep his temper. He asked whether it was not at any rate\r\nbetter than trotting a pair of horses backwards and forwards over the\r\nsame mile of road for half the day, as is the custom in the States.\r\nBut the Senator, though he did not quite approve of trotting matches,\r\nargued that there was infinitely more of skill and ingenuity in\r\nthe American pastime. "Everybody is so gloomy," said the Senator,\r\nlighting his third cigar. "I\'ve been watching that young man in pink\r\nboots for the last half hour, and he hasn\'t spoken a word to any\r\none."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he\'s a stranger," said Morton.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s the way you treat him!"\r\n\r\nIt was past two when the hounds were put into the gorse, and\r\ncertainly no one was in a very good humour. A trot of five miles is\r\ndisagreeable, and two o\'clock in November is late for finding a first\r\nfox; and then poisoning is a vice that may grow into a habit! There\r\nwas a general feeling that Goarly ought to be extinguished, but\r\nan idea that it might be difficult to extinguish him. The whips,\r\nnevertheless, cantered on to the corner of the covert, and Tony put\r\nin his hounds with a cheery voice. The Senator remarked that the\r\ngorse was a very little place,--for as they were on the side of an\r\nopposite hill they could see it all. Lord Rufford, who was standing\r\nby the carriage, explained to him that it was a favourite resort of\r\nfoxes, and difficult to draw as being very close. "Perhaps they\'ve\r\npoisoned him too," said the Senator. It was evident from his voice\r\nthat had such been the case, he would not have been among the\r\nmourners. "The blackguards are not yet thick enough in our country\r\nfor that," said Lord Rufford, meaning to be sarcastic.\r\n\r\nThen a whimper was heard from a hound,--at first very low, and then\r\ngrowing into a fuller sound. "There he is," said young Hampton. "For\r\nheaven\'s sake get those fellows away from that side, Glomax." This\r\nwas uttered with so much vehemence that the Senator looked up in\r\nsurprise. Then the Captain galloped round the side of the covert,\r\nand, making use of some strong language, stopped the ardour of\r\ncertain gentlemen who were in a hurry to get away on what they\r\nconsidered good terms. Lord Rufford, Hampton, Larry Twentyman and\r\nothers sat stock-still on their horses, watching the gorse. Ned\r\nBotsey urged himself a little forward down the hill, and was creeping\r\non when Captain Glomax asked him whether he would be so ---- ----\r\nobliging kind as to remain where he was for half a minute. Ned took\r\nthe observations in good part and stopped his horse. "Does he do all\r\nthat cursing and swearing for the L2,000?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\nThe fox traversed the gorse back from side to side and from corner to\r\ncorner again and again. There were two sides certainly at which he\r\nmight break, but though he came out more than once he could not be\r\ngot to go away.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll kill him now before he breaks," said the elder Botsey.\r\n\r\n"Brute!" exclaimed his brother.\r\n\r\n"They\'re hot on him now," said Hampton. At this time the whole side\r\nof the hill was ringing with the music of the hounds.\r\n\r\n"He was out then, but Dick turned him," said Larry. Dick was one of\r\nthe whips.\r\n\r\n"Will you be so kind, Mr. Morton," asked the Senator, "as to tell me\r\nwhether they\'re hunting yet? They\'ve been at it for three hours and a\r\nhalf, and I should like to know when they begin to amuse themselves."\r\n\r\nJust as he had spoken there came from Dick a cry that he was away.\r\nTony, who had been down at the side of the gorse, at once jumped into\r\nit, knowing the passage through. Lord Rufford, who for the last five\r\nor six minutes had sat perfectly still on his horse, started down the\r\nhill as though he had been thrown from a catapult. There was a little\r\nhand-gate through which it was expedient to pass, and in a minute\r\na score of men were jostling for the way, among whom were the two\r\nBotseys, our friend Runciman, and Larry Twentyman, with Kate Masters\r\non the pony close behind him. Young Hampton jumped a very nasty fence\r\nby the side of the wicket, and Lord Rufford followed him. A score of\r\nelderly men, with some young men among them too, turned back into a\r\nlane behind them, having watched long enough to see that they were to\r\ntake the lane to the left, and not the lane to the right. After all\r\nthere was time enough, for when the men had got through the hand-gate\r\nthe hounds were hardly free of the covert, and Tony, riding up the\r\nside of the hill opposite, was still blowing his horn. But they were\r\noff at last, and the bulk of the field got away on good terms with\r\nthe hounds. "Now they are hunting," said Mr. Morton to the Senator.\r\n\r\n"They all seemed to be very angry with each other at that narrow\r\ngate."\r\n\r\n"They were in a hurry, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Two of them jumped over the hedge. Why didn\'t they all jump? How\r\nlong will it be now before they catch him?"\r\n\r\n"Very probably they may not catch him at all."\r\n\r\n"Not catch him after all that! Then the man was certainly right to\r\npoison that other fox in the wood. How long will they go on?"\r\n\r\n"Half an hour perhaps."\r\n\r\n"And you call that hunting! Is it worth the while of all those men to\r\nexpend all that energy for such a result? Upon the whole, Mr. Morton,\r\nI should say that it is one of the most incomprehensible things that\r\nI have ever seen in the course of a rather long and varied life.\r\nShooting I can understand, for you have your birds. Fishing I can\r\nunderstand, as you have your fish. Here you get a fox to begin with,\r\nand are all broken-hearted. Then you come across another, after\r\nriding about all day, and the chances are you can\'t catch him!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose," said Mr. Morton angrily, "the habits of one country\r\nare incomprehensible to the people of another. When I see Americans\r\nloafing about in the bar-room of an hotel, I am lost in amazement."\r\n\r\n"There is not a man you see who couldn\'t give a reason for his being\r\nthere. He has an object in view,--though perhaps it may be no better\r\nthan to rob his neighbour. But here there seems to be no possible\r\nmotive."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFROM IMPINGTON GORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fox ran straight from the covert through his well-known haunts\r\nto Impington Park, and as the hounds were astray there for two or\r\nthree minutes there was a general idea that he too had got up into a\r\ntree,--which would have amused the Senator very much had the Senator\r\nbeen there. But neither had the country nor the pace been adapted to\r\nwheels, and the Senator and the Paragon were now returning along the\r\nroad towards Bragton. The fox had tried his old earths at Impington\r\nHigh wood, and had then skulked back along the outside of the covert.\r\nHad not one of the whips seen him he would have been troubled no\r\nfurther on that day,--a fact, which if it could have been explained\r\nto the Senator in all its bearings, would greatly have added to his\r\ndelight. But Dick viewed him; and with many holloas and much blowing\r\nof horns, and prayers from Captain Glomax that gentlemen would only\r\nbe so good as to hold their tongues, and a full-tongued volley of\r\nabuse from half the field against an unfortunate gentleman who rode\r\nafter the escaping fox before a hound was out of the covert, they\r\nsettled again to their business. It was pretty to see the quiet ease\r\nand apparent nonchalance and almost affected absence of bustle of\r\nthose who knew their work,--among whom were especially to be named\r\nyoung Hampton, and the elder Botsey, and Lord Rufford, and, above\r\nall, a dark-visaged, long-whiskered, sombre, military man who had\r\nbeen in the carriage with Lord Rufford, and who had hardly spoken\r\na word to any one the whole day. This was the celebrated Major\r\nCaneback, known to all the world as one of the dullest men and best\r\nriders across country that England had ever produced. But he was not\r\nso dull but that he knew how to make use of his accomplishment, so\r\nas always to be able to get a mount on a friend\'s horses. If a man\r\nwanted to make a horse, or to try a horse, or to sell a horse, or to\r\nbuy a horse, he delighted to put Major Caneback up. The Major was\r\nsympathetic and made his friend\'s horses, and tried them, and sold\r\nthem. Then he would take his two bottles of wine,--of course from\r\nhis friend\'s cellar,--and when asked about the day\'s sport would be\r\noracular in two words, "Rather slow," "Quick spurt," "Goodish thing,"\r\n"Regularly mulled," and such like. Nevertheless it was a great thing\r\nto have Major Caneback with you. To the list of those who rode well\r\nand quietly must in justice be added our friend Larry Twentyman, who\r\nwas in truth a good horseman. And he had three things to do which it\r\nwas difficult enough to combine. He had a young horse which he would\r\nhave liked to sell; he had to coach Kate Masters on his pony;--and he\r\ndesired to ride like Major Caneback.\r\n\r\nFrom Impington Park they went in a straight line to Littleton Gorse\r\nskirting certain small woods which the fox disdained to enter. Here\r\nthe pace was very good, and the country was all grass. It was the\r\nvery cream of the U. R. U.; and could the Senator have read the\r\nfeelings of the dozen leading men in the run, he would have owned\r\nthat they were for the time satisfied with their amusement. Could he\r\nhave read Kate Masters\' feelings he would have had to own that she\r\nwas in an earthly Paradise. When the pony paused at the big brook,\r\nbrought his four legs steadily down on the brink as though he were\r\ngoing to bathe, then with a bend of his back leaped to the other\r\nside, dropping his hind legs in and instantly recovering them, and\r\nwhen she saw that Larry had waited just a moment for her, watching to\r\nsee what might be her fate, she was in heaven. "Wasn\'t it a big one,\r\nLarry?" she asked in her triumph. "He did go in behind!" "Those cats\r\nof things always do it somehow," Larry replied darting forward again\r\nand keeping the Major well in his eye. The brook had stopped one or\r\ntwo, and tidings came up that Ned Botsey had broken his horse\'s back.\r\nThe knowledge of the brook had sent some round by the road,--steady\r\nriding men such as Mr. Runciman and Doctor Nupper. Captain Glomax had\r\ngot into it and came up afterwards wet through, with temper by no\r\nmeans improved. But the glory of the day had been the way in which\r\nLord Rufford\'s young bay mare, who had never seen a brook before,\r\nhad flown over it with the Major on her back, taking it, as Larry\r\nafterwards described, "just in her stride, without condescending to\r\nlook at it. I was just behind the Major, and saw her do it." Larry\r\nunderstood that a man should never talk of his own place in a run,\r\nbut he didn\'t quite understand that neither should he talk of having\r\nbeen close to another man who was supposed to have had the best\r\nof it. Lord Rufford, who didn\'t talk much of these things, quite\r\nunderstood that he had received full value for his billet and mount\r\nin the improved character of his mare.\r\n\r\nThen there was a little difficulty at the boundary fence of Impington\r\nHall Farm. The Major who didn\'t know the ground, tried it at an\r\nimpracticable place, and brought his mare down. But she fell at the\r\nright side, and he was quick enough in getting away from her, not to\r\nfall under her in the ditch. Tony Tuppet, who knew every foot of that\r\ndouble ditch and bank, and every foot in the hedge above, kept well\r\nto the left and crept through a spot where one ditch ran into the\r\nother, intersecting of the fence. Tony, like a knowing huntsman as\r\nhe was, rode always for the finish and not for immediate glory. Both\r\nLord Rufford and Hampton, who in spite of their affected nonchalance\r\nwere in truth rather riding against one another, took it all in\r\na fly, choosing a lighter spot than that which the Major had\r\nencountered. Larry had longed to follow them, or rather to take it\r\nalongside of them, but was mindful at last of Kate and hurried down\r\nthe ditch to the spot which Tony had chosen and which was now crowded\r\nby horsemen. "He would have done it as well as the best of them,"\r\nsaid Kate, panting for breath.\r\n\r\n"We\'re all right," said Larry. "Follow me. Don\'t let them hustle you\r\nout. Now, Mat, can\'t you make way for a lady half a minute?" Mat\r\ngrowled, quite understanding the use which was being made of Kate\r\nMasters; but he did give way and was rewarded with a gracious smile.\r\n"You are going uncommon well, Miss Kate," said Mat, "and I won\'t stop\r\nyou." "I am so much obliged to you, Mr. Ruggles," said Kate, not\r\nscrupling for a moment to take the advantage offered her. The fox had\r\nturned a little to the left, which was in Larry\'s favour, and the\r\nMajor was now close to him, covered on one side with mud, but still\r\nlooking as though the mud were all right. There are some men who can\r\ncrush their hats, have their boots and breeches full of water, and be\r\ncovered with dirt from their faces downwards, and yet look as though\r\nnothing were amiss, while, with others, the marks of a fall are\r\nalways provocative either of pity or ridicule. "I hope you\'re not\r\nhurt, Major Caneback," said Larry, glad of the occasion to speak\r\nto so distinguished an individual. The Major grunted as he rode on,\r\nfinding no necessity here even for his customary two words. Little\r\naccidents, such as that, were the price he paid for his day\'s\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nAs they got within view of Littleton Gorse Hampton, Lord Rufford, and\r\nTony had the best of it, though two or three farmers were very close\r\nto them. At this moment Tony\'s mind was much disturbed, and he looked\r\nround more than once for Captain Glomax. Captain Glomax had got into\r\nthe brook, and had then ridden down to the high road which ran here\r\nnear to them and which, as he knew, ran within one field of the\r\ngorse. He had lost his place and had got a ducking and was a little\r\nout of humour with things in general. It had not been his purpose to\r\ngo to Impington on this day, and he was still, in his mind, saying\r\nevil things of the U. R. U. respecting that poisoned fox. Perhaps\r\nhe was thinking, as itinerant masters often must think, that it was\r\nvery hard to have to bear so many unpleasant things for a poor L2,000\r\na year, and meditating, as he had done for the last two seasons, a\r\nthreat that unless the money were increased, he wouldn\'t hunt the\r\ncountry more than three times a week. As Tony got near to the gorse\r\nand also near to the road he managed with infinite skill to get the\r\nhounds off the scent, and to make a fictitious cast to the left as\r\nthough he thought the fox had traversed that way. Tony knew well\r\nenough that the fox was at that moment in Littleton Gorse;--but he\r\nknew also that the gorse was only six acres, that such a fox as he\r\nhad before him wouldn\'t stay there two minutes after the first hound\r\nwas in it, and that Dillsborough Wood,--which to his imagination was\r\nfull of poison,--would then be only a mile and a half before him.\r\nTony, whose fault was a tendency to mystery,--as is the fault of most\r\nhuntsmen,--having accomplished his object in stopping the hounds,\r\npretended to cast about with great diligence. He crossed the road and\r\nwas down one side of a field and along another, looking anxiously\r\nfor the Captain. "The fox has gone on to the gorse," said the elder\r\nBotsey; "what a stupid old pig he is;"--meaning that Tony Tuppett was\r\nthe pig.\r\n\r\n"He was seen going on," said Larry, who had come across a man mending\r\na drain.\r\n\r\n"It would be his run of course," said Hampton, who was generally\r\nup to Tony\'s wiles, but who was now as much in the dark as others.\r\nThen four or five rode up to the huntsman and told him that the fox\r\nhad been seen heading for the gorse. Tony said not a word but bit\r\nhis lips and scratched his head and bethought himself what fools\r\nmen might be even though they did ride well to hounds. One word of\r\nexplanation would have settled it all, but he would not speak that\r\nword till he whispered it to Captain Glomax.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there was a crowd in the road waiting to see the\r\nresult of Tony\'s manoeuvres. And then, as is usual on such occasions,\r\na little mild repartee went about,--what the sportsmen themselves\r\nwould have called "chaff." Ned Botsey came up, not having broken\r\nhis horse\'s back as had been rumoured, but having had to drag the\r\nbrute out of the brook with the help of two countrymen, and the\r\nMajor was asked about his fall till he was forced to open his mouth.\r\n"Double ditch;--mare fell;--matter of course." And then he got\r\nhimself out of the crowd, disgusted with the littleness of mankind.\r\nLord Rufford had been riding a very big chestnut horse, and had\r\nwatched the anxious struggles of Kate Masters to hold her place.\r\nKate, though fifteen, and quite up to that age in intelligence and\r\nimpudence, was small and looked almost a child. "That\'s a nice pony\r\nof yours, my dear," said the Lord. Kate, who didn\'t quite like being\r\ncalled "my dear," but who knew that a lord has privileges, said that\r\nit was a very good pony. "Suppose we change," said his lordship.\r\n"Could you ride my horse?" "He\'s very big," said Kate. "You\'d look\r\nlike a tom-tit on a haystack," said his lordship. "And if you got on\r\nmy pony, you\'d look like a haystack on a tom-tit," said Kate. Then it\r\nwas felt that Kate Masters had had the best of that little encounter.\r\n"Yes;--I got one there," said Lord Rufford, while his friends were\r\nlaughing at him.\r\n\r\nAt length Captain Glomax was seen in the road and Tony was with him\r\nat once, whispering in his ear that the hounds if allowed to go\r\non would certainly run into Dillsborough Wood. "D---- the hounds,"\r\nmuttered the Captain; but he knew too well what he was about to\r\nface--so terrible a danger. "They\'re going home," he said as soon as\r\nhe had joined Lord Rufford and the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Going home!" exclaimed a pink-coated young rider of a hired horse\r\nwhich had been going well with him; and as he said so he looked at\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\n"Unless you particularly wish me to take the hounds to some covert\r\ntwenty miles off," answered the sarcastic Master.\r\n\r\n"The fox certainly went on to Littleton," said the elder Botsey.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said the Captain, "I can tell you where the fox\r\nwent quite as well as you can tell me. Do allow a man to know what\r\nhe\'s about some times."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t generally the custom here to take the hounds off a running\r\nfox," continued Botsey, who subscribed L50, and did not like being\r\nsnubbed.\r\n\r\n"And it isn\'t generally the custom to have fox-coverts poisoned,"\r\nsaid the Captain, assuming to himself the credit due to Tony\'s\r\nsagacity. "If you wish to be Master of these hounds I haven\'t the\r\nslightest objection, but while I\'m responsible you must allow me\r\nto do my work according to my own judgment." Then the thing was\r\nunderstood and Captain Glomax was allowed to carry off the hounds\r\nand his ill-humour without another word.\r\n\r\nBut just at that moment, while the hounds and the master, and Lord\r\nRufford and his friends, were turning back in their own direction,\r\nJohn Morton came up with his carriage and the Senator. "Is it all\r\nover?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"All over for to-day," said Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"Did you catch the animal?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Gotobed; we couldn\'t catch him. To tell the truth we didn\'t\r\ntry; but we had a nice little skurry for four or five miles."\r\n\r\n"Some of you look very wet." Captain Glomax and Ned Botsey were\r\nstanding near the carriage; but the Captain as soon as he heard this,\r\nbroke into a trot and followed the hounds.\r\n\r\n"Some of us are very wet," said Ned. "That\'s part of the fun."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--that\'s part of the fun. You found one fox dead and you didn\'t\r\nkill another because you didn\'t try. Well; Mr. Morton, I don\'t think\r\nI shall take to fox hunting even though they should introduce it in\r\nMickewa. What\'s become of the rest of the men?"\r\n\r\n"Most of them are in the brook," said Ned Botsey as he rode on\r\ntowards Dillsborough.\r\n\r\nMr. Runciman was also there and trotted on homewards with Botsey,\r\nLarry, and Kate Masters. "I think I\'ve won my bet," said the\r\nhotel-keeper.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that at all. We didn\'t find in Dillsborough Wood."\r\n\r\n"I say we did find in Dillsborough Wood. We found a fox though\r\nunfortunately the poor brute was dead."\r\n\r\n"The bet\'s off I should say. What do you say, Larry?"\r\n\r\nThen Runciman argued his case at great length and with much ability.\r\nIt had been intended that the bet should be governed by the fact\r\nwhether Dillsborough Wood did or did not contain a fox on that\r\nmorning. He himself had backed the wood, and Botsey had been strong\r\nin his opinion against the wood. Which of them had been practically\r\nright? Had not the presence of the poisoned fox shown that he was\r\nright? "I think you ought to pay," said Larry.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Botsey riding on, and telling himself that that was\r\nwhat came from making a bet with a man who was not a gentleman.\r\n\r\n"He\'s as unhappy about that hat," said Runciman, "as though beer had\r\ngone down a penny a gallon."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nARABELLA TREFOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday the party from Bragton went to the parish church,--and\r\nfound it very cold. The duty was done by a young curate who lived in\r\nDillsborough, there being no house in Bragton for him. The rector\r\nhimself had not been in the church for the last six months, being\r\nan invalid. At present he and his wife were away in London, but the\r\nvicarage was kept up for his use. The service was certainly not\r\nalluring. It was a very wet morning and the curate had ridden over\r\nfrom Dillsborough on a little pony which the rector kept for him in\r\naddition to the L100 per annum paid for his services. That he should\r\nhave got over his service quickly was not a matter of surprise,--nor\r\nwas it wonderful that there should have been no soul-stirring matter\r\nin his discourse as he had two sermons to preach every week and to\r\nperform single-handed all the other clerical duties of a parish lying\r\nfour miles distant from his lodgings. Perhaps had he expected the\r\npresence of so distinguished a critic as the Senator from Mickewa\r\nhe might have done better. As it was, being nearly wet through and\r\nmuddy up to his knees, he did not do the work very well. When Morton\r\nand his friends left the church and got into the carriage for their\r\nhalf-mile drive home across the park, Mrs. Morton was the first to\r\nspeak. "John," she said, "that church is enough to give any woman her\r\ndeath. I won\'t go there any more."\r\n\r\n"They don\'t understand warming a church in the country," said John\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n"Is it not a little too large for the congregation?" asked the\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\nThe church was large and straggling and ill arranged, and on this\r\nparticular Sunday had been almost empty. There was in it an harmonium\r\nwhich Mrs. Puttock played when she was at home, but in her absence\r\nthe attempt made by a few rustics to sing the hymns had not been\r\na musical success. The whole affair had been very sad, and so the\r\nParagon had felt it who knew,--and was remembering through the whole\r\nservice,--how these things are done in transatlantic cities.\r\n\r\n"The weather kept the people away I suppose," said Morton.\r\n\r\n"Does that gentleman generally draw large congregations?" asked the\r\npersistent Senator.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t go in for drawing congregations here." Under the\r\ncross-examination of his guest the Secretary of Legation almost lost\r\nhis diplomatic good temper. "We have a church in every parish for\r\nthose who choose to attend it."\r\n\r\n"And very few do choose," said the Senator. "I can\'t say that they\'re\r\nwrong." There seemed at the moment to be no necessity to carry the\r\ndisagreeable conversation any further as they had now reached the\r\nhouse. Mrs. Morton immediately went up-stairs, and the two gentlemen\r\ntook themselves to the fire in the so-called library, which room was\r\nbeing used as more commodious than the big drawing-room. Mr. Gotobed\r\nplaced himself on the rug with his back to the fire and immediately\r\nreverted to the Church. "That gentleman is paid by tithes I suppose."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not the rector. He\'s a curate."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--just so. He looked like a curate. Doesn\'t the rector do\r\nanything?" Then Morton, who was by this time heartily sick of\r\nexplaining, explained the unfortunate state of Mr. Puttock\'s health,\r\nand the conversation was carried on till gradually the Senator\r\nlearned that Mr. Puttock received L800 a year and a house for doing\r\nnothing, and that he paid his deputy L100 a year with the use of a\r\npony. "And how long will that be allowed to go on, Mr. Morton?" asked\r\nthe Senator.\r\n\r\nTo all these inquiries Morton found himself compelled not only\r\nto answer, but to answer the truth. Any prevarication or attempt\r\nat mystification fell to the ground at once under the Senator\'s\r\ntremendous powers of inquiry. It had been going on for four years,\r\nand would probably go on now till Mr. Puttock died. "A man of his age\r\nwith the asthma may live for twenty years," said the Senator who had\r\nalready learned that Mr. Puttock was only fifty. Then he ascertained\r\nthat Mr. Puttock had not been presented to, or selected for the\r\nliving on account of any peculiar fitness;--but that he had been\r\na fellow of Rufford at Oxford till he was forty-five, when he had\r\nthought it well to marry and take a living. "But he must have been\r\nasthmatic then?" said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"He may have had all the ailments endured by the human race for\r\nanything I know," said the unhappy host.\r\n\r\n"And for anything the bishop cared as far as I can see," said the\r\nSenator. "Well now, I guess, that couldn\'t occur in our country. A\r\nminister may turn out badly with us as well as with you. But we don\'t\r\nappoint a man without inquiry as to his fitness,--and if a man can\'t\r\ndo his duty he has to give way to some one who can. If the sick\r\ngentleman took the small portion of the stipend and the working man\r\nthe larger, would not better justice be done, and the people better\r\nserved?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Puttock has a freehold in the parish."\r\n\r\n"A freehold possession of men\'s souls! The fact is, Mr. Morton, that\r\nthe spirit of conservatism in this country is so strong that you\r\ncannot bear to part with a shred of the barbarism of the middle ages.\r\nAnd when a rag is sent to the winds you shriek with agony at the\r\ndisruption, and think that the wound will be mortal." As Mr. Gotobed\r\nsaid this he extended his right hand and laid his left on his breast\r\nas though he were addressing the Senate from his own chair. Morton,\r\nwho had offered to entertain the gentleman for ten days, sincerely\r\nwished that he were doing so.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday afternoon the Trefoils arrived. Mr. Morton, with his\r\ngrandmother and both the carriages, went down to receive them,--with\r\na cart also for the luggage, which was fortunate, as Arabella\r\nTrefoil\'s big box was very big indeed, and Lady Augustus, though\r\nshe was economical in most things, had brought a comfortable amount\r\nof clothes. Each of them had her own lady\'s maid, so that the two\r\ncarriages were necessary. How it was that these ladies lived so\r\nluxuriously was a mystery to their friends, as for some time past\r\nthey had enjoyed no particular income of their own. Lord Augustus had\r\nspent everything that came to his hand, and the family owned no house\r\nat all. Nevertheless Arabella Trefoil was to be seen at all parties\r\nmagnificently dressed, and never stirred anywhere without her own\r\nmaid. It would have been as grievous to her to be called on to live\r\nwithout food as to go without this necessary appendage. She was a\r\nbig, fair girl whose copious hair was managed after such a fashion\r\nthat no one could guess what was her own and what was purchased. She\r\ncertainly had fine eyes, though I could never imagine how any one\r\ncould look at them and think it possible that she should be in love.\r\nThey were very large, beautifully blue, but never bright; and the\r\neyebrows over them were perfect. Her cheeks were somewhat too long\r\nand the distance from her well-formed nose to her upper lip too\r\ngreat. Her mouth was small and her teeth excellent. But the charm of\r\nwhich men spoke the most was the brilliance of her complexion. If, as\r\nthe ladies said, it was all paint, she, or her maid, must have been\r\na great artist. It never betrayed itself to be paint. But the beauty\r\non which she prided herself was the grace of her motion. Though she\r\nwas tall and big she never allowed an awkward movement to escape from\r\nher. She certainly did it very well. No young woman could walk across\r\nan archery ground with a finer step, or manage a train with more\r\nperfect ease, or sit upon her horse with a more complete look of\r\nbeing at home there. No doubt she was slow, but though slow she never\r\nseemed to drag. Now she was, after a certain fashion, engaged to\r\nmarry John Morton and perhaps she was one of the most unhappy young\r\npersons in England.\r\n\r\nShe had long known that it was her duty to marry, and especially her\r\nduty to marry well. Between her and her mother there had been no\r\nreticence on this subject. With worldly people in general, though the\r\nworldliness is manifest enough and is taught by plain lessons from\r\nparents to their children, yet there is generally some thin veil even\r\namong themselves, some transparent tissue of lies, which, though\r\nthey never quite hope to deceive each other, does produce among them\r\nsomething of the comfort of deceit. But between Lady Augustus and\r\nher daughter there had for many years been nothing of the kind. The\r\ndaughter herself had been too honest for it. "As for caring about\r\nhim, mamma," she had once said, speaking of a suitor, "of course I\r\ndon\'t. He is nasty, and odious in every way. But I have got to do the\r\nbest I can, and what is the use of talking about such trash as that?"\r\nThen there had been no more trash between them.\r\n\r\nIt was not John Morton whom Arabella Trefoil had called nasty and\r\nodious. She had had many lovers, and had been engaged to not a few,\r\nand perhaps she liked John Morton as well as any of them,--except\r\none. He was quiet, and looked like a gentleman, and was reputed for\r\nno vices. Nor did she quarrel with her fate in that he himself was\r\nnot addicted to any pleasures. She herself did not care much for\r\npleasure. But she did care to be a great lady,--one who would be\r\nallowed to swim out of rooms before others, one who could snub\r\nothers, one who could show real diamonds when others wore paste, one\r\nwho might be sure to be asked everywhere even by the people who hated\r\nher. She rather liked being hated by women and did not want any man\r\nto be in love with her,--except as far as might be sufficient for the\r\npurpose of marriage. The real diamonds and the high rank would not be\r\nhers with John Morton. She would have to be content with such rank\r\nas is accorded to Ministers at the Courts at which they are employed.\r\nThe fall would be great from what she had once expected,--and\r\ntherefore she was miserable. There had been a young man, of immense\r\nwealth, of great rank, whom at one time she really had fancied that\r\nshe had loved;--but just as she was landing her prey, the prey had\r\nbeen rescued from her by powerful friends, and she had been all but\r\nbroken-hearted. Mr. Morton\'s fortune was in her eyes small, and\r\nshe was beginning to learn that he knew how to take care of his\r\nown money. Already there had been difficulties as to settlements,\r\ndifficulties as to pin-money, difficulties as to residence, Lady\r\nAugustus having been very urgent. John Morton, who had really been\r\ncaptivated by the beauty of Arabella, was quite in earnest; but there\r\nwere subjects on which he would not give way. He was anxious to put\r\nhis best leg foremost so that the beauty might be satisfied and might\r\nbecome his own, but there was a limit beyond which he would not go.\r\nLady Augustus had more than once said to her daughter that it would\r\nnot do;--and then there would be all the weary work to do again!\r\n\r\nNobody seeing the meeting on the platform would have imagined that\r\nMr. Morton and Miss Trefoil were lovers,--and as for Lady Augustus it\r\nwould have been thought that she was in some special degree offended\r\nwith the gentleman who had come to meet her. She just gave him the\r\ntip of her fingers and then turned away to her maid and called for\r\nthe porters and made herself particular and disagreeable. Arabella\r\nvouchsafed a cold smile, but then her smiles were always cold. After\r\nthat she stood still and shivered. "Are you cold?" asked Morton. She\r\nshook her head and shivered again. "Perhaps you are tired?" Then she\r\nnodded her head. When her maid came to her in some trouble about the\r\nluggage, she begged that she might not be "bothered;" saying that\r\nno doubt her mother knew all about it. "Can I do anything?" asked\r\nMorton. "Nothing at all I should think," said Miss Trefoil. In the\r\nmeantime old Mrs. Morton was standing by as black as thunder--for the\r\nTrefoil ladies had hardly noticed her.\r\n\r\nThe luggage turned up all right at last,--as luggage always does,\r\nand was stowed away in the cart. Then came the carriage arrangement.\r\nMorton had intended that the two elder ladies should go together with\r\none of the maids, and that he should put his love into the other,\r\nwhich having a seat behind, could accommodate the second girl without\r\ndisturbing them in the carriage. But Lady Augustus had made some\r\nexception to this and had begged that her daughter might be seated\r\nwith herself. It was a point which Morton could not contest out there\r\namong the porters and drivers, so that at last he and his grandmother\r\nhad the phaeton together with the two maids in the rumble. "I never\r\nsaw such manners in all my life," said the Honourable Mrs. Morton,\r\nalmost bursting with passion.\r\n\r\n"They are cold and tired, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"No lady should be too cold or too tired to conduct herself with\r\npropriety. No real lady is ever so."\r\n\r\n"The place is strange to them, you know."\r\n\r\n"I hope with all my heart that it may never be otherwise than strange\r\nto them."\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the house the strangers were carried into the\r\nlibrary and tea was of course brought to them. The American Senator\r\nwas there, but the greetings were very cold. Mrs. Morton took her\r\nplace and offered her hospitality in the most frigid manner. There\r\nhad not been the smallest spark of love\'s flame shown as yet, nor did\r\nthe girl as she sat sipping her tea seem to think that any such spark\r\nwas wanted. Morton did get a seat beside her and managed to take away\r\nher muff and one of her shawls, but she gave them to him almost as\r\nshe might have done to a servant. She smiled indeed,--but she smiled\r\nas some women smile at everybody who has any intercourse with them.\r\n"I think perhaps Mrs. Morton will let us go up-stairs," said Lady\r\nAugustus. Mrs. Morton immediately rang the bell and prepared to\r\nprecede the ladies to their chambers. Let them be as insolent as\r\nthey would she would do what she conceived to be her duty. Then Lady\r\nAugustus stalked out of the room and her daughter swum after her.\r\n"They don\'t seem to be quite the same as they were in Washington,"\r\nsaid the Senator.\r\n\r\nJohn Morton got up and left the room without making any reply. He was\r\nthoroughly unhappy. What was he to do for a week with such a houseful\r\nof people? And then, what was he to do for all his life if the\r\npresiding spirit of the house was to be such a one as this? She was\r\nvery beautiful,--certainly. So he told himself; and yet as he walked\r\nround the park he almost repented of what he had done. But after\r\ntwenty minutes\' fast walking he was able to convince himself that all\r\nthe fault on this occasion lay with the mother. Lady Augustus had\r\nbeen fatigued with her journey and had therefore made everybody near\r\nher miserable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAT BRAGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies went up-stairs the afternoon was not half over and\r\nthey did not dine till past seven. As Morton returned to the house in\r\nthe dusk he thought that perhaps Arabella might make some attempt to\r\nthrow herself in his way. She had often done so when they were not\r\nengaged, and surely she might do so now. There was nothing to prevent\r\nher coming down to the library when she had got rid of her travelling\r\nclothes, and in this hope he looked into the room. As soon as the\r\ndoor was open the Senator, who was preparing his lecture in his mind,\r\nat once asked whether no one in England had an apparatus for warming\r\nrooms such as was to be found in every well-built house in the\r\nStates. The Paragon hardly vouchsafed him a word of reply, but\r\nescaped up-stairs, trusting that he might meet Miss Trefoil on the\r\nway. He was a bold man and even ventured to knock at her door;--but\r\nthere was no reply, and, fearing the Senator, he had to betake\r\nhimself to his own privacy. Miss Trefoil had migrated to her mother\'s\r\nroom, and there, over the fire, was holding a little domestic\r\nconversation. "I never saw such a barrack in my life," said Lady\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n"Of course, mamma, we knew that we should find the house such as it\r\nwas left a hundred years ago. He told us that himself."\r\n\r\n"He should have put something in it to make it at any rate decent\r\nbefore we came in."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use if he\'s to live always at foreign courts?"\r\n\r\n"He intends to come home sometimes, I suppose, and, if he didn\'t, you\r\nwould." Lady Augustus was not going to let her daughter marry a man\r\nwho could not give her a home for at any rate a part of the year. "Of\r\ncourse he must furnish the place and have an immense deal done before\r\nhe can marry. I think it is a piece of impudence to bring one to such\r\na place as this."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, mamma, because he told us all about it."\r\n\r\n"The more I see of it all, Arabella, the more sure I am that it won\'t\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"It must do, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Twelve hundred a year is all that he offers, and his lawyer says\r\nthat he will make no stipulation whatever as to an allowance."\r\n\r\n"Really, mamma, you might leave that to me."\r\n\r\n"I like to have everything fixed, my dear,--and certain."\r\n\r\n"Nothing really ever is certain. While there is anything to get you\r\nmay be sure that I shall have my share. As far as money goes I\'m not\r\na bit afraid of having the worst of it,--only there will be so very\r\nlittle between us."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt about the property, mamma."\r\n\r\n"A nasty beggarly place!"\r\n\r\n"And from what everybody says he\'s sure to be a minister or\r\nambassador or something of that sort."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt he will. And where\'ll he have to go to? To Brazil, or\r\nthe West Indies, or some British Colony," said her ladyship showing\r\nher ignorance of the Foreign Office service. "That might be very\r\nwell. You could stay at home. Only where would you live? He wouldn\'t\r\nkeep a house in town for you. Is this the sort of place you\'d like?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it makes any difference where one is," said Arabella\r\ndisgusted.\r\n\r\n"But I do,--a very great difference. It seems to me that he\'s\r\naltogether under the control of that hideous old termagant. Arabella,\r\nI think you\'d better make up your mind that it won\'t do."\r\n\r\n"It must do," said Arabella.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very fond of him it seems."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, how you do delight to torture me;--as if my life weren\'t bad\r\nenough without your making it worse."\r\n\r\n"I tell you, my dear, what I\'m bound to tell you--as your mother. I\r\nhave my duty to do whether it\'s painful or not."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, mamma. You know it is. That might have been all\r\nvery well ten years ago."\r\n\r\n"You were almost in your cradle, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Psha! cradle! I\'ll tell you what it is, mamma. I\'ve been at it till\r\nI\'m nearly broken down. I must settle somewhere;--or else die;--or\r\nelse run away. I can\'t stand this any longer and I won\'t. Talk of\r\nwork,--men\'s work! What man ever has to work as I do?" I wonder which\r\nwas the hardest part of that work, the hairdressing and painting\r\nand companionship of the lady\'s maid or the continual smiling upon\r\nunmarried men to whom she had nothing to say and for whom she did not\r\nin the least care! "I can\'t do it any more, and I won\'t. As for Mr.\r\nMorton, I don\'t care that for him. You know I don\'t. I never cared\r\nmuch for anybody, and shall never again care at all."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find that will come all right after you are married."\r\n\r\n"Like you and papa, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I had no mother to take care of me, or I shouldn\'t have\r\nmarried your father."\r\n\r\n"I wish you hadn\'t, because then I shouldn\'t be going to marry Mr.\r\nMorton. But, as I have got so far, for heaven\'s sake let it go on.\r\nIf you break with him I\'ll tell him everything and throw myself into\r\nhis hands." Lady Augustus sighed deeply. "I will, mamma. It was you\r\nspotted this man, and when you said that you thought it would do, I\r\ngave way. He was the last man in the world I should have thought of\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"We had heard so much about Bragton!"\r\n\r\n"And Bragton is here. The estate is not out of elbows."\r\n\r\n"My dear, my opinion is that we\'ve made a mistake. He\'s not the sort\r\nof man I took him to be. He\'s as hard as a file."\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me, mamma."\r\n\r\n"You are determined then?"\r\n\r\n"I think I am. At any rate let me look about me. Don\'t give him an\r\nopportunity of breaking off till I have made up my mind. I can always\r\nbreak off if I like it. No one in London has heard of the engagement\r\nyet. Just leave me alone for this week to see what I think about it."\r\nThen Lady Augustus threw herself back in her chair and went to sleep,\r\nor pretended to do so.\r\n\r\nA little after half-past seven she and her daughter, dressed for\r\ndinner, went down to the library together. The other guests were\r\nassembled there, and Mrs. Morton was already plainly expressing her\r\nanger at the tardiness of her son\'s guests. The Senator had got hold\r\nof Mr. Mainwaring and was asking pressing questions as to church\r\npatronage,--a subject not very agreeable to the rector of St. John\'s,\r\nas his living had been bought for him with his wife\'s money during\r\nthe incumbency of an old gentleman of seventy-eight. Mr. Cooper,\r\nwho was himself nearly that age and who was vicar of Mallingham, a\r\nparish which ran into Dillsborough and comprehended a part of its\r\npopulation, was listening to these queries with awe,--and perhaps\r\nwith some little gratification, as he had been presented to his\r\nliving by the bishop after a curacy of many years. "This kind of\r\nthings, I believe, can be bought and sold in the market," said the\r\nSenator, speaking every word with absolute distinctness. But as he\r\npaused for an answer the two ladies came in and the conversation was\r\nchanged. Both the clergymen were introduced to Lady Augustus and her\r\ndaughter, and Mr. Mainwaring at once took refuge under the shadow of\r\nthe ladies\' title.\r\n\r\nArabella did not sit down, so that Morton had an opportunity of\r\nstanding near to his love. "I suppose you are very tired," he said.\r\n\r\n"Not in the least." She smiled her sweetest as she answered him,--but\r\nyet it was not very sweet. "Of course we were tired and cross when we\r\ngot out of the train. People always are; aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps ladies are."\r\n\r\n"We were. But all that about the carriages, Mr. Morton, wasn\'t my\r\ndoing. Mamma had been talking to me so much that I didn\'t know\r\nwhether I was on my head or my heels. It was very good of you to come\r\nand meet us, and I ought to have been more gracious." In this way she\r\nmade her peace, and as she was quite in earnest,--doing a portion of\r\nthe hard work of her life,--she continued to smile as sweetly as she\r\ncould. Perhaps he liked it;--but any man endowed with that power of\r\nappreciation which we call sympathy, would have felt it to be as cold\r\nas though it had come from a figure on a glass window.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was announced. Mr. Morton was honoured with the hand of\r\nLady Augustus. The Senator handed the old lady into the dining-room\r\nand Mr. Mainwaring the younger lady,--so that Arabella was sitting\r\nnext to her lover. It had all been planned by Morton and acceded to\r\nby his grandmother. Mr. Gotobed throughout the dinner had the best of\r\nthe conversation, though Lady Augustus had power enough to snub him\r\non more than one occasion. "Suppose we were to allow at once," she\r\nsaid, "that everything is better in the United States than anywhere\r\nelse, shouldn\'t we get along easier?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that getting along easy is what we have particularly\r\ngot in view," said Mr. Gotobed, who was certainly in quest of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n"But it is what I have in view, Mr. Gotobed;--so if you please we\'ll\r\ntake the pre-eminence of your country for granted." Then she turned\r\nto Mr. Mainwaring on the other side. Upon this the Senator addressed\r\nhimself for a while to the table at large and had soon forgotten\r\naltogether the expression of the lady\'s wishes.\r\n\r\n"I believe you have a good many churches about here," said Lady\r\nAugustus trying to make conversation to her neighbour.\r\n\r\n"One in every parish, I fancy," said Mr. Mainwaring, who preferred\r\nall subjects to clerical subjects. "I suppose London is quite empty\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"We came direct from the Duke\'s," said Lady Augustus,--"and did not\r\neven sleep in town;--but it is empty." The Duke was the brother of\r\nLord Augustus, and a compromise had been made with Lady Augustus,\r\nby which she and her daughter should be allowed a fortnight every\r\nyear at the Duke\'s place in the country, and a certain amount of\r\nentertainment in town.\r\n\r\n"I remember the Duke at Christchurch," said the parson. "He and I\r\nwere of the same par. He was Lord Mistletoe then. Dear me, that was\r\na long time ago. I wonder whether he remembers being upset out of a\r\ntrap with me one day after dinner. I suppose we had dined in earnest.\r\nHe has gone his way, and I have gone mine, and I\'ve never seen him\r\nsince. Pray remember me to him." Lady Augustus said she would,\r\nand did entertain some little increased respect for the clergyman\r\nwho could boast that he had been tipsy in company with her worthy\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Cooper did not get on very well with Mrs. Morton. All his\r\nremembrances of the old squire were eulogistic and affectionate.\r\nHers were just the reverse. He had a good word to say for Reginald\r\nMorton,--to which she would not even listen. She was willing enough\r\nto ask questions about the Mallingham tenants;--but Mr. Cooper would\r\nrevert back to the old days, and so conversation was at an end.\r\n\r\nMorton tried to make himself agreeable to his left-hand\r\nneighbour,--trying also very hard to make himself believe that he was\r\nhappy in his immediate position. How often in the various amusements\r\nof the world is one tempted to pause a moment and ask oneself whether\r\none really likes it! He was conscious that he was working hard,\r\nstruggling to be happy, painfully anxious to be sure that he\r\nwas enjoying the luxury of being in love. But he was not at all\r\ncontented. There she was, and very beautiful she looked; and he\r\nthought that he could be proud of her if she sat at the end of his\r\ntable;--and he knew that she was engaged to be his wife. But he\r\ndoubted whether she was in love with him; and he almost doubted\r\nsometimes whether he was very much in love with her. He asked her in\r\nso many words what he should do to amuse her. Would she like to ride\r\nwith him, as if so he would endeavour to get saddle-horses. Would\r\nshe like to go out hunting? Would she be taken round to see the\r\nneighbouring towns, Rufford and Norrington? "Lord Rufford lives\r\nsomewhere near Rufford?" she asked. Yes;--he lived at Rufford Hall,\r\nthree or four miles from the town. Did Lord Rufford hunt? Morton\r\nbelieved that he was greatly given to hunting. Then he asked Arabella\r\nwhether she knew the young lord. She had just met him, she said, and\r\nhad only asked the question because of the name. "He is one of my\r\nneighbours down here," said Morton;--"but being always away of course\r\nI see nothing of him." After that Arabella consented to be taken\r\nout on horseback to see a meet of the hounds although she could not\r\nhunt. "We must see what we can do about horses," he said. She however\r\nprofessed her readiness to go in the carriage if a saddle-horse could\r\nnot be found.\r\n\r\nThe dinner party I fear was very dull. Mr. Mainwaring perhaps liked\r\nit because he was fond of dining anywhere away from home. Mr. Cooper\r\nwas glad once more to see his late old friend\'s old dining-room. Mr.\r\nGotobed perhaps obtained some information. But otherwise the affair\r\nwas dull. "Are we to have a week of this?" said Lady Augustus when\r\nshe found herself up-stairs.\r\n\r\n"You must, mamma, if we are to stay till we go to the Gores. Lord\r\nRufford is here in the neighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"But they don\'t know each other."\r\n\r\n"Yes they do;--slightly. I am to go to the meet some day and he\'ll be\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"It might be dangerous."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, mamma! And after all you\'ve been saying about dropping Mr.\r\nMorton!"\r\n\r\n"But there is nothing so bad as a useless flirtation."\r\n\r\n"Do I ever flirt? Oh, mamma, that after so many years you shouldn\'t\r\nknow me! Did you ever see me yet making myself happy in any way? What\r\nnonsense you talk!" Then without waiting for, or making, any apology,\r\nshe walked off to her own room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE DILLSBOROUGH FEUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n"It\'s that nasty, beastly, drunken club," said Mrs. Masters to her\r\nunfortunate husband on the Wednesday morning. It may perhaps be\r\nremembered that the poisoned fox was found on the Saturday, and it\r\nmay be imagined that Mr. Goarly had risen in importance since that\r\nday. On the Saturday Bean with a couple of men employed by Lord\r\nRufford, had searched the wood, and found four or five red herrings\r\npoisoned with strychnine. There had been no doubt about the magnitude\r\nof the offence. On the Monday a detective policeman, dressed of\r\ncourse in rustic disguise but not the less known to every one in the\r\nplace, was wandering about between Dillsborough and Dillsborough Wood\r\nand making futile inquiries as to the purchase of strychnine,--and\r\nalso as to the purchase of red herrings. But every one knew, and such\r\nleading people as Runciman and Dr. Nupper were not slow to declare,\r\nthat Dillsborough was the only place in England in which one might be\r\nsure that those articles had not been purchased. And on the Tuesday\r\nit began to be understood that Goarly had applied to Bearside, the\r\nother attorney, in reference to his claim against Lord Rufford\'s\r\npheasants. He had contemptuously refused the 7_s._ 6_d._ an acre\r\noffered him, and put his demand at 40_s._ As to the poisoned fox and\r\nthe herrings and the strychnine Goarly declared that he didn\'t care\r\nif there were twenty detectives in the place. He stated it to be his\r\nopinion that Larry Twentyman had put down the poison. It was all very\r\nwell, Goarly said, for Larry to be fond of gentlemen and to ride to\r\nhounds, and make pretences;--but Larry liked his turkeys as well\r\nas anybody else, and Larry had put down the poison. In this matter\r\nGoarly overreached himself. No one in Dillsborough could be brought\r\nto believe that. Even Harry Stubbings was ready to swear that\r\nhe should suspect himself as soon. But nothing was clearer than\r\nthis,--that Goarly was going to make a stand against the hunt and\r\nespecially against Lord Rufford. He had gone to Bearside and Bearside\r\nhad taken up the matter in a serious way. Then it became known very\r\nquickly that Bearside had already received money, and it was surmised\r\nthat Goarly had some one at his back. Lord Rufford had lately ejected\r\nfrom a house of his on the other side of the county a discontented\r\nlitigious retired grocer from Rufford, who had made some money\r\nand had set himself up in a pretty little residence with a few\r\nacres of land. The man had made himself objectionable and had been\r\ndispossessed. The man\'s name was Scrobby; and hence had come these\r\nsorrows. This was the story that had already made itself known in\r\nDillsborough on the Tuesday evening. But up to that time not a tittle\r\nof evidence had come to light as to the purchase of the red herrings\r\nor the strychnine. All that was known was the fact that had not Tony\r\nTuppett stopped the hounds before they reached the wood, there must\r\nhave been a terrible mortality. "It\'s that nasty, beastly, drunken\r\nclub," said Mrs. Masters to her husband. Of course it was at this\r\ntime known to the lady that her husband had thrown away Goarly\'s\r\nbusiness and that it had been transferred to Bearside. It was also\r\nsurmised by her, as it was by the town in general, that Goarly\'s\r\nbusiness would come to considerable dimensions;--just the sort of\r\ncase as would have been sure to bring popularity if carried through,\r\nas Nickem, the senior clerk, would have carried it. And as soon as\r\nScrobby\'s name was heard by Mrs. Masters, there was no end to the\r\nmoney in the lady\'s imagination to which this very case might not\r\nhave amounted.\r\n\r\n"The club had nothing to do with it, my dear."\r\n\r\n"What time did you come home on Saturday night;--or Sunday morning\r\nI mean? Do you mean to tell me you didn\'t settle it there?"\r\n\r\n"There was no nastiness, and no beastliness, and no drunkenness about\r\nit. I told you before I went that I wouldn\'t take it."\r\n\r\n"No;--you didn\'t. How on earth are you to go on if you chuck the\r\nchildren\'s bread out of their mouths in that way?"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t believe me. Do you ask Twentyman what sort of a man Goarly\r\nis." The attorney knew that Larry was in great favour with his wife\r\nas being the favoured suitor for Mary\'s hand, and had thought that\r\nthis argument would be very strong.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want Mr. Twentyman to teach me what is proper for my\r\nfamily,--nor yet to teach you your business. Mr. Twentyman has his\r\nown way of living. He brought home Kate the other day with hardly a\r\nrag of her sister\'s habit left. She don\'t go out hunting any more."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Indeed for the matter of that I don\'t see how any of them are to do\r\nanything. What\'ll Lord Rufford do for you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want Lord Rufford to do anything for me." The attorney was\r\nbeginning to have his spirit stirred within him.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want anybody to do anything, and yet you will do nothing\r\nyourself,--just because a set of drinking fellows in a tap-room,\r\nwhich you call a club--"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t a tap-room."\r\n\r\n"It\'s worse, because nobody can see what you\'re doing. I know how it\r\nwas. You hadn\'t the pluck to hold to your own when Runciman told you\r\nnot." There was a spice of truth in this which made it all the more\r\nbitter. "Runciman knows on which side his bread is buttered. He can\r\nmake his money out of these swearing-tearing fellows. He can send in\r\nhis bills, and get them paid too. And it\'s all very well for Larry\r\nTwentyman to be hobbing and nobbing with the likes of them Botseys.\r\nBut for a father of a family like you to be put off his business by\r\nwhat Mr. Runciman says is a shame."\r\n\r\n"I shall manage my business as I think fit," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"And when we\'re all in the poor-house what\'ll you do then?" said\r\nMrs. Masters,--with her handkerchief out at the spur of the moment.\r\nWhenever she roused her husband to a state of bellicose ire by her\r\ntaunts she could always reduce him again by her tears. Being well\r\naware of this he would bear the taunts as long as he could, knowing\r\nthat the tears would be still worse. He was so soft-hearted that when\r\nshe affected to be miserable, he could not maintain the sternness\r\nof his demeanour and leave her in her misery. "When everything has\r\ngone away from us, what are we to do? My little bit of money has\r\ndisappeared ever so long." Then she sat herself down in her chair and\r\nhad a great cry. It was useless for him to remind her that hitherto\r\nshe had never wanted anything for herself or her children. She was\r\nresolved that everything was going to the dogs because Goarly\'s case\r\nhad been refused. "And what will all those sporting men do for you?"\r\nshe repeated. "I hate the very name of a gentleman;--so I do. I wish\r\nGoarly had killed all the foxes in the county. Nasty vermin! What\r\ngood are the likes of them?"\r\n\r\nNickem, the senior clerk, was at first made almost as unhappy as Mrs.\r\nMasters by the weak decision to which his employer had come, and had\r\nin the first flush of his anger resolved to leave the office. He\r\nwas sure that the case was one which would just have suited him. He\r\nwould have got up the evidence as to the fertility of the land, the\r\nenormous promise of crop, and the ultimate absolute barrenness, to a\r\nmarvel. He would have proved clouds of pheasants. And then Goarly\'s\r\nhumble position, futile industry, and general poverty might have been\r\ncontrasted beautifully with Lord Rufford\'s wealth, idleness, and\r\ndevotion to sport. Anything above the 7_s._ 6_d._ an acre obtained\r\nagainst the lord would have been a triumph, and he thought that if\r\nthe thing had been well managed, they might probably have got 15_s._\r\nAnd then, in such a case, Lord Rufford could hardly have taxed the\r\ncosts. It was really suicide for an attorney to throw away business\r\nso excellent as this. And now it had gone to Bearside whom Nickem\r\nremembered as a junior to himself when they were both young\r\nhobbledehoys at Norrington,--a dirty, blear-eyed, pimply-faced\r\nboy who was suspected of purloining halfpence out of coat-pockets.\r\nThe thing was very trying to Nat Nickem. But suddenly, before that\r\nWednesday was over, another idea had occurred to him, and he was\r\nalmost content. He knew Goarly, and he had heard of Scrobby and\r\nScrobby\'s history in regard to the tenement at Rufford. As he could\r\nnot get Goarly\'s case why should he not make something of the case\r\nagainst Goarly? That detective was merely eking out his time and\r\nhaving an idle week among the public-houses. If he could set himself\r\nup as an amateur detective he thought that he might perhaps get to\r\nthe bottom of it all. It is not a bad thing to be concerned on the\r\nsame side with a lord when the lord is in earnest. Lord Rufford was\r\nvery angry about the poison in the covert and would probably be ready\r\nto pay very handsomely for having the criminal found and punished.\r\nThe criminal of course was Goarly. Nickem did not doubt that for a\r\nmoment, and would not have doubted it whichever side he might have\r\ntaken. Nickem did not suppose that any one for a moment really\r\ndoubted Goarly\'s guilt. But to his eyes such certainty amounted to\r\nnothing, if evidence of the crime were not forthcoming. He probably\r\nfelt within his own bosom that the last judgment of all would depend\r\nin some way on terrestrial evidence, and was quite sure that it was\r\nby such that a man\'s conscience should be affected. If Goarly had so\r\ndone the deed as to be beyond the possibility of detection, Nickem\r\ncould not have brought himself to regard Goarly as a sinner. As it\r\nwas he had considerable respect for Goarly;--but might it not be\r\npossible to drop down upon Scrobby? Bearside with his case against\r\nthe lord would be nowhere, if Goarly could be got to own that he had\r\nbeen suborned by Scrobby to put down the poison. Or, if in default\r\nof this, any close communication could be proved between Goarly and\r\nScrobby,--Scrobby\'s injury and spirit of revenge being patent,--then\r\ntoo Bearside would not have much of a case. A jury would look at that\r\nquestion of damages with a very different eye if Scrobby\'s spirit of\r\nrevenge could be proved at the trial, and also the poisoning, and\r\nalso machinations between Scrobby and Goarly.\r\n\r\nNickem was a little red-haired man about forty, who wrote a good\r\nflourishing hand, could endure an immense amount of work, and drink a\r\nlarge amount of alcohol without being drunk. His nose and face were\r\nall over blotches, and he looked to be dissipated and disreputable.\r\nBut, as he often boasted, no one could say that "black was the white\r\nof his eye;"--by which he meant to insinuate that he had not been\r\ndetected in anything dishonest and that he was never too tipsy to do\r\nhis work. He was a married man and did not keep his wife and children\r\nin absolute comfort; but they lived, and Mr. Nickem in some fashion\r\npaid his way.\r\n\r\nThere was another clerk in the office, a very much younger man, named\r\nSundown, and Nickem could not make his proposition to Mr. Masters\r\ntill Sundown had left the office. Nickem himself had only matured\r\nhis plans at dinner time and was obliged to be reticent, till at six\r\no\'clock Sundown took himself off. Mr. Masters was, at the moment,\r\nlocking his own desk, when Nickem winked at him to stay. Mr. Masters\r\ndid stay, and Sundown did at last leave the office.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t let me leave home for three days?" said Nickem. "There\r\nain\'t much a doing."\r\n\r\n"What do you want it for?"\r\n\r\n"That Goarly is a great blackguard, Mr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. Do you know anything about him?"\r\n\r\nNickem scratched his head and rubbed his chin. "I think I could\r\nmanage to know something."\r\n\r\n"In what way?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I\'m quite prepared to say, sir. I shouldn\'t use your\r\nname of course. But they\'re down upon Lord Rufford, and if you could\r\nlend me a trifle of 30_s._, sir, I think I could get to the bottom of\r\nit. His lordship would be awful obliged to any one who could hit it\r\noff."\r\n\r\nMr. Masters did give his clerk leave for three days, and did advance\r\nhim the required money. And when he suggested in a whisper that\r\nperhaps the circumstance need not be mentioned to Mrs. Masters,\r\nNickem winked again and put his fore-finger to the side of his big\r\ncarbuncled nose.\r\n\r\nThat evening Larry Twentyman came in, but was not received with any\r\ngreat favour by Mrs. Masters. There was growing up at this moment in\r\nDillsborough the bitterness of real warfare between the friends and\r\nenemies of sport in general, and Mrs. Masters was ranking herself\r\nthereby among the enemies. Larry was of course one of the friends.\r\nBut unhappily there was a slight difference of sentiment even in\r\nLarry\'s own house, and on this very morning old Mrs. Twentyman had\r\nexpressed to Mrs. Masters a feeling of wrong which had gradually\r\nrisen from the annual demolition of her pet broods of turkeys. She\r\ndeclared that for the last three years every turkey poult had gone,\r\nand that at last she was beginning to feel it. "It\'s over a hundred\r\nof \'em they\'ve had, and it is wearing," said the old woman. Larry had\r\ntwenty times begged her to give up the rearing turkeys, but her heart\r\nhad been too high for that. "I don\'t know why Lord Rufford\'s foxes\r\nare to be thought of always, and nobody is to think about your poor\r\nmother\'s poultry," said Mrs. Masters, lugging the subject in neck and\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n"Has she been talking to you, Mrs. Masters, about her turkeys?"\r\n\r\n"Your mother may speak to me I suppose if she likes it, without\r\noffence to Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford has got nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"The wood belongs to him," said Mrs. Masters.\r\n\r\n"Foxes are much better than turkeys anyway," said Kate Masters.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t hold your tongue, miss, you\'ll be sent to bed. The wood\r\nbelongs to his lordship, and the foxes are a nuisance."\r\n\r\n"He keeps the foxes for the county, and where would the county be\r\nwithout them?" began Larry. "What is it brings money into such a\r\nplace as this?"\r\n\r\n"To Runciman\'s stables and Harry Stubbings and the like of them. What\r\nmoney does it bring in to steady honest people?"\r\n\r\n"Look at all the grooms," said Larry.\r\n\r\n"The impudentest set of young vipers about the place," said the lady.\r\n\r\n"Look at Grice\'s business." Grice was the saddler.\r\n\r\n"Grice indeed! What\'s Grice?"\r\n\r\n"And the price of horses?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--making everything dear that ought to be cheap. I don\'t see\r\nand I never shall see and I never will see any good in extravagant\r\nidleness. As for Kate she shall never go out hunting again. She has\r\ntorn Mary\'s habit to pieces. And shooting is worse. Why is a man to\r\nhave a flock of voracious cormorants come down upon his corn fields?\r\nI\'m all in favour of Goarly, and so I tell you, Mr. Twentyman." After\r\nthis poor Larry went away, finding that he had no opportunity for\r\nsaying a word to Mary Masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nA FIT COMPANION,--FOR ME AND MY SISTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that same Wednesday Reginald Morton had called at the attorney\'s\r\nhouse, had asked for Miss Masters, and had found her alone. Mrs.\r\nMasters at the time had been out, picking up intelligence about the\r\ngreat case, and the two younger girls had been at school. Reginald,\r\nas he walked home from Bragton all alone on that occasion when Larry\r\nhad returned with Mary, was quite sure that he would never willingly\r\ngo into Mary\'s presence again. Why should he disturb his mind about\r\nsuch a girl,--one who could rush into the arms of such a man as Larry\r\nTwentyman? Or, indeed, why disturb his mind about any girl? That\r\nwas not the manner of life which he planned for himself. After that\r\nhe shut himself up for a few days and was not much seen by any of\r\nthe Dillsborough folk. But on this Wednesday he received a letter,\r\nand,--as he told himself, merely in consequence of that letter,--he\r\ncalled at the attorney\'s house and asked for Miss Masters.\r\n\r\nHe was shown up into the beautiful drawing-room, and in a few minutes\r\nMary came to him. "I have brought you a letter from my aunt," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"From Lady Ushant? I am so glad."\r\n\r\n"She was writing to me and she put this under cover. I know what it\r\ncontains. She wants you to go to her at Cheltenham for a month."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Morton!"\r\n\r\n"Would you like to go?"\r\n\r\n"How should I not like to go? Lady Ushant is my dearest, dearest\r\nfriend. It is so very good of her to think of me."\r\n\r\n"She talks of the first week in December and wants you to be there\r\nfor Christmas."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t at all know that I can go, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"Why not go?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid mamma will not spare me." There were many reasons. She\r\ncould hardly go on such a visit without some renewal of her scanty\r\nwardrobe, which perhaps the family funds would not permit. And, as\r\nshe knew very well, Mrs. Masters was not at all favourable to Lady\r\nUshant. If the old lady had altogether kept Mary it might have been\r\nvery well; but she had not done so and Mrs. Masters had more than\r\nonce said that that kind of thing must be all over;--meaning that\r\nMary was to drop her intimacy with high-born people that were of no\r\nreal use. And then there was Mr. Twentyman and his suit. Mary had for\r\nsome time felt that her step-mother intended her to understand that\r\nher only escape from home would be by becoming Mrs. Twentyman. "I\r\ndon\'t think it will be possible, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"My aunt will be very sorry."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--how sorry shall I be! It is like having another little bit of\r\nheaven before me."\r\n\r\nThen he said what he certainly should not have said. "I thought, Miss\r\nMasters, that your heaven was all here."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that, Mr. Morton?" she asked blushing up to her\r\nhair. Of course she knew what he meant, and of course she was angry\r\nwith him. Ever since that walk her mind had been troubled by ideas as\r\nto what he would think about her, and now he was telling her what he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"I fancied that you were happy here without going to see an old woman\r\nwho after all has not much amusement to offer to you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any amusement."\r\n\r\n"At any rate you will answer Lady Ushant?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall answer her."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you can let me know. She wishes me to take you to\r\nCheltenham. I shall go for a couple of days, but I shall not stay\r\nlonger. If you are going perhaps you would allow me to travel with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Of course it would be very kind; but I don\'t suppose that I shall\r\ngo. I am sure Lady Ushant won\'t believe that I am kept away from her\r\nby any pleasure of my own here. I can explain it all to her and she\r\nwill understand me." She hardly meant to reproach him. She did not\r\nmean to assume an intimacy sufficient for reproach. But he felt that\r\nshe had reproached him. "I love Lady Ushant so dearly that I would go\r\nanywhere to see her if I could."\r\n\r\n"Then I think it could be managed. Your father--"\r\n\r\n"Papa does not attend much to us girls. It is mamma that manages all\r\nthat. At any rate, I will write to Lady Ushant, and will ask papa to\r\nlet you know."\r\n\r\nThen it seemed as though there were nothing else for him but to\r\ngo;--and yet he wanted to say some other word. If he had been cruel\r\nin throwing Mr. Twentyman in her teeth, surely he ought to apologize.\r\n"I did not mean to say anything to offend you."\r\n\r\n"You have not offended me at all, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"If I did think that,--that--"\r\n\r\n"It does not signify in the least. I only want Lady Ushant to\r\nunderstand that if I could possibly go to her I would rather do that\r\nthan anything else in the world. Because Lady Ushant is kind to me I\r\nneedn\'t expect other people to be so." Reginald Morton was of course\r\nthe "other people."\r\n\r\nThen he paused a moment. "I did so long," he said, "to walk round the\r\nold place with you the other day before these people came there, and\r\nI was so disappointed when you would not come with me."\r\n\r\n"I was coming."\r\n\r\n"But you went back with--that other man."\r\n\r\n"Of course I did when you showed so plainly that you didn\'t want\r\nhim to join you. What was I to do? I couldn\'t send him away. Mr.\r\nTwentyman is a very intimate friend of ours, and very kind to Dolly\r\nand Kate."\r\n\r\n"I wished so much to talk to you about the old days."\r\n\r\n"And I wish to go to your aunt, Mr. Morton; but we can\'t all of us\r\nhave what we wish. Of course I saw that you were very angry, but I\r\ncouldn\'t help that. Perhaps it was wrong in Mr. Twentyman to offer to\r\nwalk with you."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say so at all."\r\n\r\n"You looked it at any rate, Mr. Morton. And as Mr. Twentyman is a\r\nfriend of ours--"\r\n\r\n"You were angry with me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that. But as you were too grand for our friend of course\r\nyou were too grand for us."\r\n\r\n"That is a very unkind way of putting it. I don\'t think I am grand.\r\nA man may wish to have a little conversation with a very old friend\r\nwithout being interrupted, and yet not be grand. I dare say Mr.\r\nTwentyman is just as good as I am."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think that, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"I believe him to be a great deal better, for he earns his bread,\r\nand takes care of his mother, and as far as I know does his duty\r\nthoroughly."\r\n\r\n"I know the difference, Mr. Morton, and of course I know how you feel\r\nit. I don\'t suppose that Mr. Twentyman is a fit companion for any of\r\nthe Mortons, but for all that he may be a fit companion for me,--and\r\nmy sisters." Surely she must have said this with the express object\r\nof declaring to him that in spite of the advantages of her education\r\nshe chose to put herself in the ranks of the Twentymans, Runcimans\r\nand such like. He had come there ardently wishing that she might\r\nbe allowed to go to his aunt, and resolved that he would take her\r\nhimself if it were possible. But now he almost thought that she had\r\nbetter not go. If she had made her election, she must be allowed to\r\nabide by it. If she meant to marry Mr. Twentyman what good could\r\nshe get by associating with his aunt or with him? And had she not\r\nas good as told him that she meant to marry Mr. Twentyman? She had\r\nat any rate very plainly declared that she regarded Mr. Twentyman\r\nas her equal in rank. Then he took his leave without any further\r\nexplanation. Even if she did go to Cheltenham he would not take her.\r\n\r\nAfter that he walked straight out to Bragton. He was of course\r\naltogether unconscious what grand things his cousin John had intended\r\nto do by him, had not the Honourable old lady interfered; but he had\r\nmade up his mind that duty required him to call at the house. So he\r\nwalked by the path across the bridge and when he came out on the\r\ngravel road near the front door he found a gentleman smoking a cigar\r\nand looking around him. It was Mr. Gotobed who had just returned\r\nfrom a visit which he had made, the circumstances of which must be\r\nnarrated in the next chapter. The Senator lifted his hat and remarked\r\nthat it was a very fine afternoon. Reginald lifted his hat and\r\nassented. "Mr. Morton, sir, I think is out with the ladies, taking a\r\ndrive."\r\n\r\n"I will leave a card then."\r\n\r\n"The old lady is at home, sir, if you wish to see her," continued the\r\nSenator following Reginald up to the door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Reginald, is that you?" said old Mrs. Hopkins taking the\r\ncard. "They are all out,--except herself." As he certainly did not\r\nwish to see "herself," he greeted the old woman and left his card.\r\n\r\n"You live in these parts, sir?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"In the town yonder."\r\n\r\n"Because Mr. Morton\'s housekeeper seems to know you."\r\n\r\n"She knows me very well as I was brought up in this house. Good\r\nmorning to you."\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon to you, sir. Perhaps you can tell me who lives in\r\nthat country residence,--what you call a farm-house,--on the other\r\nside of the road." Reginald said that he presumed the gentleman was\r\nalluding to Mr. Twentyman\'s house.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes,--I dare say. That was the name I heard up there. You are\r\nnot Mr. Twentyman, sir?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Morton."\r\n\r\n"Morton, is it;--perhaps my friend\'s;--ah--ah,--yes." He didn\'t like\r\nto say uncle because Reginald didn\'t look old enough, and he knew he\r\nought not to say brother, because the elder brother in England would\r\ncertainly have had the property.\r\n\r\n"I am Mr. John Morton\'s cousin."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--Mr. Morton\'s cousin. I asked whether you were the owner of that\r\nfarm-house because I intruded just now by passing through the yards,\r\nand I would have apologized. Good afternoon to you, sir." Then\r\nReginald having thus done his duty returned home.\r\n\r\nMary Masters when she was alone was again very angry with herself.\r\nShe knew thoroughly how perverse she had been when she declared\r\nthat Larry Twentyman was a fit companion for herself, and that she\r\nhad said it on purpose to punish the man who was talking to her.\r\nNot a day passed, or hardly an hour of a day, in which she did not\r\ntell herself that the education she had received and the early\r\nassociations of her life had made her unfit for the marriage which\r\nher friends were urging upon her. It was the one great sorrow of her\r\nlife. She even repented of the good things of her early days because\r\nthey had given her a distaste for what might have otherwise been\r\nhappiness and good fortune. There had been moments in which she\r\nhad told herself that she ought to marry Larry Twentyman and adapt\r\nherself to the surroundings of her life. Since she had seen Reginald\r\nMorton frequently, she had been less prone to tell herself so than\r\nbefore;--and yet to this very man she had declared her fitness for\r\nLarry\'s companionship!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMR. GOTOBED\'S PHILANTHROPY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gotobed, when the persecutions of Goarly were described to him at\r\nthe scene of the dead fox, had expressed considerable admiration for\r\nthe man\'s character as portrayed by what he then heard. The man,--a\r\npoor man too and despised in the land,--was standing up for his\r\nrights, all alone, against the aristocracy and plutocracy of the\r\ncounty. He had killed the demon whom the aristocracy and plutocracy\r\nworshipped, and had appeared there in arms ready to defend his\r\nown territory,--one against so many, and so poor a man against\r\nmen so rich! The Senator had at once said that he would call upon\r\nMr. Goarly, and the Senator was a man who always carried out his\r\npurposes. Afterwards, from John Morton, and from others who knew the\r\ncountry better than Morton, he learned further particulars. On the\r\nMonday and Tuesday he fathomed,--or nearly fathomed,--that matter of\r\nthe 7_s._ 6_d._ an acre. He learned at any rate that the owner of the\r\nwood admitted a damage done by him to the corn and had then, himself,\r\nassessed the damage without consultation with the injured party; and\r\nhe was informed also that Goarly was going to law with the lord for\r\na fuller compensation. He liked Goarly for killing the fox, and he\r\nliked him more for going to law with Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\nHe declared openly at Bragton his sympathy with the man and his\r\nintention of expressing it. Morton was annoyed and endeavoured to\r\npersuade him to leave the man alone; but in vain. No doubt had he\r\nexpressed himself decisively and told his friend that he should be\r\nannoyed by a guest from his house taking part in such a matter, the\r\nSenator would have abstained and would merely have made one more note\r\nas to English peculiarities and English ideas of justice; but Morton\r\ncould not bring himself to do this. "The feeling of the country will\r\nbe altogether against you," he had said, hoping to deter the Senator.\r\nThe Senator had replied that though the feeling of that little bit of\r\nthe country might be against him he did not believe that such would\r\nbe the case with the feeling of England generally. The ladies had all\r\nbecome a little afraid of Mr. Gotobed and hardly dared to express an\r\nopinion. Lady Augustus did say that she supposed that Goarly was a\r\nlow vulgar fellow, which of course strengthened the Senator in his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe Senator on Wednesday would not wait for lunch but started a\r\nlittle before one with a crust of bread in his pocket to find his\r\nway to Goarly\'s house. There was no difficulty in this as he could\r\nsee the wood as soon as he had got upon the high road. He found\r\nTwentyman\'s gate and followed directly the route which the hunting\r\nparty had taken, till he came to the spot on which the crowd had\r\nbeen assembled. Close to this there was a hand-gate leading into\r\nDillsborough wood, and standing in the gateway was a man. The Senator\r\nthought that this might not improbably be Goarly himself, and asked\r\nthe question, "Might your name be Mr. Goarly, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Me Goarly!" said the man in infinite disgust. "I ain\'t nothing of\r\nthe kind,--and you knows it."\r\n\r\nThat the man should have been annoyed at being taken for\r\nGoarly,--that man being Bean the gamekeeper who would willingly have\r\nhung Goarly if he could, and would have thought it quite proper that\r\na law should be now passed for hanging him at once,--was natural\r\nenough. But why he should have told the Senator that the Senator knew\r\nhe was not Goarly it might be difficult to explain. He probably at\r\nonce regarded the Senator as an enemy, as a man on the other side,\r\nand therefore as a cunning knave who would be sure to come creeping\r\nabout on false pretences. Bean, who had already heard of Bearside and\r\nhad heard of Scrobby in connection with this matter, looked at the\r\nSenator very hard. He knew Bearside. The man certainly was not the\r\nattorney, and from what he had heard of Scrobby he didn\'t think he\r\nwas Scrobby. The man was not like what in his imagination Scrobby\r\nwould be. He did not know what to make of Mr. Gotobed,--who was a\r\nperson of an imposing appearance, tall and thin, with a long nose\r\nand look of great acuteness, dressed in black from head to foot, but\r\nyet not looking quite like an English gentleman. He was a man to\r\nwhom Bean in an ordinary way would have been civil,--civil in a cold\r\nguarded way; but how was he to be civil to anybody who addressed him\r\nas Goarly?\r\n\r\n"I did not know it," said the Senator. "As Goarly lives near here I\r\nthought you might be Goarly. When I saw Goarly he had a gun, and you\r\nhave a gun. Can you tell me where Goarly lives?"\r\n\r\n"Tother side of the wood," said Bean pointing back with his thumb.\r\n"He never had a gun like this in his hand in all his born days."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, my friend. I can go through the wood I guess;" for\r\nBean had pointed exactly over the gateway.\r\n\r\n"I guess you can\'t then," said Bean. The man who, like other\r\ngamekeepers, lived much in the company of gentlemen, was ordinarily\r\na civil courteous fellow, who knew how to smile and make things\r\npleasant. But at this moment he was very much put out. His covert had\r\nbeen found full of red herrings and strychnine, and his fox had been\r\npoisoned. He had lost his guinea on the day of the hunt,--the guinea\r\nwhich would have been his perquisite had they found a live fox in his\r\nwood. And all this was being done by such a fellow as Goarly! And now\r\nthis abandoned wretch was bringing an action against his Lordship and\r\nwas leagued with such men as Scrobby and Bearside! It was a dreadful\r\nstate of things! How was it likely that he should give a passage\r\nthrough the wood to anybody coming after Goarly? "You\'re on Mr.\r\nTwentyman\'s land now, as I dare say you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about it."\r\n\r\n"Well;--that wood is Lord Rufford\'s wood."\r\n\r\n"I did know as much as that, certainly."\r\n\r\n"And you can\'t go into it."\r\n\r\n"How shall I find Mr. Goarly\'s house?"\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll get over that there ditch you\'ll be on Mister Goarly\'s\r\nland and that\'s all about it." Bean as he said this put a strongly\r\nironical emphasis on the term of respect and then turned back into\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\nThe Senator made his way down the fence to the bank on which Goarly\r\nhad stood with his gun, then over into Goarly\'s field, and so round\r\nthe back of the wood till he saw a small red brick house standing\r\nperhaps four hundred yards from the covert, just on the elbow of a\r\nlane. It was a miserable-looking place with a pigsty and a dung-heap\r\nand a small horse-pond or duck-puddle all close around it. The stack\r\nof chimneys seemed to threaten to fall, and as he approached from\r\nbehind he could see that the two windows opening that way were\r\nstuffed with rags. There was a little cabbage garden which now seemed\r\nto be all stalks, and a single goose waddling about the duck-puddle.\r\nThe Senator went to the door, and having knocked, was investigated by\r\na woman from behind it. Yes, this was Goarly\'s house. What did the\r\ngentleman want? Goarly was at work in the field. Then she came out,\r\nthe Senator having signified his friendly intentions, and summoned\r\nGoarly to the spot.\r\n\r\n"I hope I see you well, sir," said the Senator putting out his hand\r\nas Goarly came up dragging a dung-fork behind him.\r\n\r\nGoarly rubbed his hand on his breeches before he gave it to be shaken\r\nand declared himself to be "pretty tidy, considering."\r\n\r\n"I was present the other day, Mr. Goarly, when that dead fox was\r\nexposed to view."\r\n\r\n"Was you, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I was given to understand that you had destroyed the brute."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe a word on it then," said the woman interposing.\r\n"He didn\'t do nothing of the kind. Who ever seed him a\' buying of red\r\nherrings and p\'ison?"\r\n\r\n"Hold your jaw," said Goarly,--familiarly. "Let \'em prove it. I don\'t\r\nknow who you are, sir; but let \'em prove it."\r\n\r\n"My name, Mr. Goarly, is Elias Gotobed. I am an American citizen, and\r\nSenator for the State of Mickewa." Mr. and Mrs. Goarly shook their\r\nheads at every separate item of information tendered to them. "I am\r\non a visit to this country and am at present staying at the house of\r\nmy friend, Mr. John Morton."\r\n\r\n"He\'s the gentl\'man from Bragton, Dan."\r\n\r\n"Hold your jaw, can\'t you?" said the husband. Then he touched his hat\r\nto the Senator intending to signify that the Senator might, if he\r\npleased, continue his narrative.\r\n\r\n"If you did kill that fox, Mr. Goarly, I think you were quite right\r\nto kill him." Then Goarly winked at him. "I cannot imagine that even\r\nthe laws of England could justify a man in perpetuating a breed of\r\nwild animals that are destructive to his neighbours\' property."\r\n\r\n"I could shoot \'un; not a doubt about that, Mister. I could shoot\r\n\'un;--and I wull."\r\n\r\n"Have a care, Dan," whispered Mrs. Goarly.\r\n\r\n"Hold your jaw,--will ye? I could shoot \'un, Mister. I don\'t rightly\r\nknow about p\'ison."\r\n\r\n"That fox we saw was poisoned I suppose," said the Senator,\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n"Have a care, Dan;--have a care!" whispered the wife.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to assure both of you," said the Senator, "that you need\r\nfear nothing from me. I have come quite as a friend."\r\n\r\n"Thank \'ee, sir," said Goarly again touching his hat.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said the Senator, "that in this matter a great many\r\nmen are leagued together against you."\r\n\r\n"You may say that, sir. I didn\'t just catch your name, sir."\r\n\r\n"My name is Gotobed;--Gotobed; Elias Gotobed, Senator from the State\r\nof Mickewa to the United States Congress." Mrs. Goarly who understood\r\nnothing of all these titles, and who had all along doubted, dropped a\r\nsuspicious curtsey. Goarly, who understood a little now, took his hat\r\naltogether off. He was very much puzzled but inclined to think that\r\nif he managed matters rightly, profit might be got out of this very\r\nstrange meeting. "In my country, Mr. Goarly, all men are free and\r\nequal."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a fine thing, sir."\r\n\r\n"It is a fine thing, my friend, if properly understood and properly\r\nused. Coming from such a country I was shocked to see so many rich\r\nmen banded together against one who I suppose is not rich."\r\n\r\n"Very far from it," said the woman.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my own land, you know," said Goarly who was proud of his\r\nposition as a landowner. "No one can\'t touch me on it, as long as the\r\nrates is paid. I\'m as good a man here,"--and he stamped his foot on\r\nthe ground,--"as his Lordship is in that there wood."\r\n\r\nThis was the first word spoken by the Goarlys that had pleased the\r\nSenator, and this set him off again. "Just so;--and I admire a man\r\nthat will stand up for his own rights. I am told that you have found\r\nhis Lordship\'s pheasants destructive to your corn."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t leave him hardly a grain last August," said Mrs. Goarly.\r\n\r\n"Will you hold your jaw, woman, or will you not?" said the man,\r\nturning round fiercely at her. "I\'m going to have the law of his\r\nLordship, sir. What\'s seven and six an acre? There\'s that quantity\r\nof pheasants in that wood as\'d eat up any mortal thing as ever was\r\ngrowed. Seven and six!"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you propose arbitration?"\r\n\r\n"I never didn\'t propose nothin\'. I\'ve axed two pound, and my lawyer\r\nsays as how I\'ll get it. What I sold come off that other bit of\r\nground down there. Wonderful crop! And this \'d\'ve been the same. His\r\nLordship ain\'t nothin\' to me, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t approve of hunting, Mr. Goarly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I approves if they\'d pay a poor man for what harm they does\r\nhim. Look at that there goose." Mr. Gotobed did look at the goose.\r\n"There\'s nine and twenty they\'ve tuk from me, and only left un\r\nthat." Now Mrs. Goarly\'s goose was well known in those parts. It was\r\ndeclared that she was more than a match for any fox in the county,\r\nbut that Mrs. Goarly for the last two years had never owned any goose\r\nbut this one.\r\n\r\n"The foxes have eaten them all?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"Every mortal one."\r\n\r\n"And the gentlemen of the hunt have paid you nothing."\r\n\r\n"I had four half-crowns once," said the woman.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t send the heads you don\'t get it," said the man, "and\r\nthen they\'ll keep you waiting months and months, just for their\r\npleasures. Who\'s a going to put up with that? I ain\'t."\r\n\r\n"And now you\'re going to law?"\r\n\r\n"I am,--like a man. His Lordship ain\'t nothin\' to me. I ain\'t afeard\r\nof his Lordship."\r\n\r\n"Will it cost you much?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what it will do, sir," said the woman.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you, hold your jaw?"\r\n\r\n"The gentl\'man was going to offer to help us a little, Dan."\r\n\r\n"I was going to say that I am interested in the case, and that you\r\nhave all my good wishes. I do not like to offer pecuniary help."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very good, sir; very good. This bit of land is mine; not a\r\ndoubt of it;--but we\'re poor, sir."\r\n\r\n"Indeed we is," said the woman. "What with taxes and rates, and them\r\nfoxes as won\'t let me rear a head of poultry and them brutes of birds\r\nas eats up the corn, I often tells him he\'d better sell the bit o\'\r\nland and just set up for a public."\r\n\r\n"It belonged to my feyther and grandfeyther," said Goarly.\r\n\r\nThen the Senator\'s heart was softened again and he explained at great\r\nlength that he would watch the case and if he saw his way clearly,\r\nbefriend it with substantial aid. He asked about the attorney and\r\ntook down Bearside\'s address. After that he shook hands with both of\r\nthem, and then made his way back to Bragton through Mr. Twentyman\'s\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Goarly were left in a state of great perturbation of\r\nmind. They could not in the least make out among themselves who the\r\ngentleman was, or whether he had come for good or evil. That he\r\ncalled himself Gotobed Goarly did remember, and also that he had said\r\nthat he was an American. All that which had referred to senatorial\r\nhonours and the State of Mickewa had been lost upon Goarly. The\r\nquestion of course arose whether he was not a spy sent out by Lord\r\nRufford\'s man of business, and Mrs. Goarly was clearly of opinion\r\nthat such had been the nature of his employment. Had he really been a\r\nfriend, she suggested, he would have left a sovereign behind him. "He\r\ndidn\'t get no information from me," said Goarly.\r\n\r\n"Only about Mr. Bearside."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the odds of that? They all knows that. Bearside! Why should\r\nI be ashamed of Bearside? I\'ll do a deal better with Bearside than\r\nI would with that old woman, Masters."\r\n\r\n"But he took it down in writing, Dan."\r\n\r\n"What the d----\'s the odds in that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it when they puts it down in writing."\r\n\r\n"Hold your jaw," said Goarly as he slowly shouldered the dung-fork to\r\ntake it back to his work. But as they again discussed the matter that\r\nnight the opinion gained ground upon them that the Senator had been\r\nan emissary from the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nLORD RUFFORD\'S INVITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that same Wednesday afternoon when Morton returned with the ladies\r\nin the carriage he found that a mounted servant had arrived from\r\nRufford Hall with a letter and had been instructed to wait for an\r\nanswer. The man was now refreshing himself in the servants\' hall.\r\nMorton, when he had read the letter, found that it required some\r\nconsideration before he could answer it. It was to the following\r\npurport. Lord Rufford had a party of ladies and gentlemen at Rufford\r\nHall, as his sister, Lady Penwether, was staying with him. Would Mr.\r\nMorton and his guests come over to Rufford Hall on Monday and stay\r\ntill Wednesday? On Tuesday there was to be a dance for the people of\r\nthe neighbourhood. Then he specified, as the guests invited, Lady\r\nAugustus and her daughter and Mr. Gotobed,--omitting the honourable\r\nMrs. Morton of whose sojourn in the county he might have been\r\nignorant. His Lordship went on to say that he trusted the abruptness\r\nof the invitation might be excused on account of the nearness of\r\ntheir neighbourhood and the old friendship which had existed between\r\ntheir families. He had had, he said, the pleasure of being acquainted\r\nwith Lady Augustus and her daughter in London and would be proud to\r\nsee Mr. Gotobed at his house during his sojourn in the county. Then\r\nhe added in a postscript that the hounds met at Rufford Hall on\r\nTuesday and that he had a horse that carried a lady well if Miss\r\nTrefoil would like to ride him. He could also put up a horse for Mr.\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\nThis was all very civil, but there was something in it that was\r\nalmost too civil. There came upon Morton a suspicion, which he did\r\nnot even define to himself, that the invitation was due to Arabella\'s\r\ncharms. There were many reasons why he did not wish to accept it.\r\nHis grandmother was left out and he feared that she would be angry.\r\nHe did not feel inclined to take the American Senator to the lord\'s\r\nhouse, knowing as he did that the American Senator was interfering in\r\na ridiculous manner on behalf of Goarly. And he did not particularly\r\nwish to be present at Rufford Hall with the Trefoil ladies. Hitherto\r\nhe had received very little satisfaction from their visit to\r\nBragton,--so little that he had been more than once on the verge\r\nof asking Arabella whether she wished to be relieved from her\r\nengagement. She had never quite given him the opportunity. She\r\nhad always been gracious to him in a cold, disagreeable, glassy\r\nmanner,--in a manner that irked his spirit but still did not justify\r\nhim in expressing anger. Lady Augustus was almost uncivil to him, and\r\nfrom time to time said little things which were hard to bear; but\r\nhe was not going to marry Lady Augustus, and could revenge himself\r\nagainst her by resolving in his own breast that he would have as\r\nlittle as possible to do with her after his marriage. That was the\r\ncondition of his mind towards them, and in that condition he did not\r\nwant to take them to Lord Rufford\'s house. Their visit to him would\r\nbe over on Monday, and it would he thought be better for him that\r\nthey should then go on their way to the Gores as they had proposed.\r\n\r\nBut he did not like to answer the letter by a refusal without saying\r\na word to his guests on the subject. He would not object to ignore\r\nthe Senator, but he was afraid that if nothing were to be said to\r\nArabella she would hear of it hereafter and would complain of such\r\ntreatment. He therefore directed that the man might be kept waiting\r\nwhile he consulted the lady of his choice. It was with difficulty\r\nthat he found himself alone with her,--and then only by sending\r\nher maid in quest of her. He did get her at last into his own\r\nsitting-room and then, having placed her in a chair near the fire,\r\ngave her Lord Rufford\'s letter to read. "What can it be," said she\r\nlooking up into his face with her great inexpressive eyes, "that has\r\nrequired all this solemnity?" She still looked up at him and did not\r\neven open the letter.\r\n\r\n"I did not like to answer that without showing it to you. I don\'t\r\nsuppose you would care to go."\r\n\r\n"Go where?"\r\n\r\n"It is from Lord Rufford,--for Monday."\r\n\r\n"From Lord Rufford!"\r\n\r\n"It would break up all your plans and your mother\'s, and would\r\nprobably be a great bore."\r\n\r\nThen she did read the letter, very carefully and very slowly,\r\nweighing every word of it as she read it. Did it mean more than it\r\nsaid? But though she read it slowly and carefully and was long before\r\nshe made him any answer, she had very quickly resolved that the\r\ninvitation should be accepted. It would suit her very well to know\r\nLady Penwether. It might possibly suit her still better to become\r\nintimate with Lord Rufford. She was delighted at the idea of riding\r\nLord Rufford\'s horse. As her eyes dwelt on the paper she, too, began\r\nto think that the invitation had been chiefly given on her account.\r\nAt any rate she would go. She had understood perfectly well from the\r\nfirst tone of her lover\'s voice that he did not wish to subject her\r\nto the allurements of Rufford Hall. She was clever enough, and could\r\nread it all. But she did not mean to throw away a chance for the sake\r\nof pleasing him. She must not at once displease him by declaring her\r\npurpose strongly, and therefore, as she slowly continued her reading,\r\nshe resolved that she would throw the burden upon her mother. "Had I\r\nnot better show this to mamma?" she said.\r\n\r\n"You can if you please. You are going to the Gores on Monday."\r\n\r\n"We could not go earlier; but we might put it off for a couple of\r\ndays if we pleased. Would it bore you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind about myself. I\'m not a very great man for dances."\r\n\r\n"You\'d sooner write a report,--wouldn\'t you,--about the products of\r\nthe country?"\r\n\r\n"A great deal sooner," said the Paragon.\r\n\r\n"But you see we haven\'t all of us got products to write about. I\r\ndon\'t care very much about it myself;--but if you don\'t mind I\'ll ask\r\nmamma." Of course he was obliged to consent, and merely informed her\r\nas she went off with the letter that a servant was waiting for an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"To go to Lord Rufford\'s!" said Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\n"From Monday till Wednesday, mamma. Of course we must go."\r\n\r\n"I promised poor Mrs. Gore."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, mamma! The Gores can do very well without us. That was\r\nonly to be a week and we can still stay out our time. Of course this\r\nhas only been sent because we are here."\r\n\r\n"I should say so. I don\'t suppose Lord Rufford would care to know Mr.\r\nMorton. Lady Penwether goes everywhere; doesn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"Everywhere. It would suit me to a \'t\' to get on to Lady Penwether\'s\r\nbooks. But, mamma, of course it\'s not that. If Lord Rufford should\r\nsay a word it is so much easier to manage down in the country than up\r\nin London. He has L40,000 a year, if he has a penny."\r\n\r\n"How many girls have tried the same thing with him! But I don\'t mind.\r\nI\'ve always said that John Morton and Bragton would not do."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; you haven\'t. You were the first to say they would do."\r\n\r\n"I only said that if there were nothing else--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, how can you say such things! Nothing else,--as if he were\r\nthe last man! You said distinctly that Bragton was L7,000 a year, and\r\nthat it would do very well. You may change your mind if you like; but\r\nit\'s no good trying to back out of your own doings."\r\n\r\n"Then I have changed my mind."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--without thinking what I have to go through. I\'m not going\r\nto throw myself at Lord Rufford\'s head so as to lose my chance\r\nhere;--but we\'ll go and see how the land lies. Of course you\'ll go,\r\nmamma."\r\n\r\n"If you think it is for your advantage, my dear."\r\n\r\n"My advantage! It\'s part of the work to be done and we may as well do\r\nit. At any rate I\'ll tell him to accept. We shall have this odious\r\nAmerican with us, but that can\'t be helped."\r\n\r\n"And the old woman?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford doesn\'t say anything about her. I don\'t suppose he\'s\r\nsuch a muff but what he can leave his grandmother behind for a couple\r\nof days." Then she went back to Morton and told him that her mother\r\nwas particularly anxious to make the acquaintance of Lady Penwether\r\nand that she had decided upon going to Rufford Hall. "It will be a\r\nvery nice opportunity," said she, "for you to become acquainted with\r\nLord Rufford."\r\n\r\nThen he was almost angry. "I can make plenty of such opportunities\r\nfor myself, when I want them," he said. "Of course if you and Lady\r\nAugustus like it, we will go. But let it stand on its right bottom."\r\n\r\n"It may stand on any bottom you please."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to ride the man\'s horse?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do. I never refuse a good offer. Why shouldn\'t I ride\r\nthe man\'s horse? Did you never hear before of a young lady borrowing\r\na gentleman\'s horse?"\r\n\r\n"No lady belonging to me will ever do so,--unless the gentleman be a\r\nvery close friend indeed."\r\n\r\n"The lady in this case does not belong to you, Mr. Morton, and\r\ntherefore, if you have no other objection, she will ride Lord\r\nRufford\'s horse. Perhaps you will not think it too much trouble to\r\nsignify the lady\'s acceptance of the mount in your letter." Then she\r\nswam out of the room knowing that she left him in anger. After that\r\nhe had to find Mr. Gotobed. The going was now decided on as far as he\r\nwas concerned, and it would make very little difference whether the\r\nAmerican went or not,--except that his letter would have been easier\r\nto him in accepting the invitation for three persons than for four.\r\nBut the Senator was of course willing. It was the Senator\'s object to\r\nsee England, and Lord Rufford\'s house would be an additional bit of\r\nEngland. The Senator would be delighted to have an opportunity of\r\nsaying what he thought about Goarly at Lord Rufford\'s table. After\r\nthat, before this weary letter could be written, he was compelled to\r\nsee his grandmother and explain to her that she had been omitted.\r\n\r\n"Of course, ma\'am, they did not know that you were at Bragton, as you\r\nwere not in the carriage at the \'meet.\'"\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, John. Did Lord Rufford suppose that you were\r\nentertaining ladies here without some one to be mistress of the\r\nhouse? Of course he knew that I was here. I shouldn\'t have gone;--you\r\nmay be sure of that. I\'m not in the habit of going to the houses of\r\npeople I don\'t know. Indeed I think it\'s an impertinence in them\r\nto ask in that way. I\'m surprised that you would go on such an\r\ninvitation."\r\n\r\n"The Trefoils knew them."\r\n\r\n"If Lady Penwether knew them why could not Lady Penwether ask\r\nthem independently of us? I don\'t believe they ever spoke to Lady\r\nPenwether in their lives. Lord Rufford and Miss Trefoil may very\r\nlikely be London acquaintances. He may admire her and therefore\r\nchoose to have her at his ball. I know nothing about that. As far as\r\nI am concerned he\'s quite welcome to keep her."\r\n\r\nAll this was not very pleasant to John Morton. He knew already that\r\nhis grandmother and Lady Augustus hated each other, and said spiteful\r\nthings not only behind each other\'s backs, but openly to each other\'s\r\nfaces. But now he had been told by the girl who was engaged to be his\r\nwife that she did not belong to him; and by his grandmother,--who\r\nstood to him in the place of his mother,--that she wished that this\r\ngirl belonged to some one else! He was not quite sure that he did\r\nnot wish it himself. But, even were it to be so, and should there be\r\nreason for him to be gratified at the escape, still he did not relish\r\nthe idea of taking the girl himself to the other man\'s house. He\r\nwrote the letter, however, and dispatched it. But even the writing\r\nof it was difficult and disagreeable. When various details of\r\nhospitality have been offered by a comparative stranger a man hardly\r\nlikes to accept them all. But in this case he had to do it. He would\r\nbe delighted, he said, to stay at Rufford Hall from the Monday\r\nto the Wednesday;--Lady Augustus and Miss Trefoil would also be\r\ndelighted;--and so also would Mr. Gotobed be delighted. And Miss\r\nTrefoil would be further delighted to accept Lord Rufford\'s offer of\r\na horse for the Tuesday. As for himself, if he rode at all, a horse\r\nwould come for him to the meet. Then he wrote another note to Mr.\r\nHarry Stubbings, bespeaking a mount for the occasion.\r\n\r\nOn that evening the party at Bragton was not a very pleasant one. "No\r\ndoubt you are intimate with Lady Penwether, Lady Augustus," said Mrs.\r\nMorton. Now Lady Penwether was a very fashionable woman whom to know\r\nwas considered an honour.\r\n\r\n"What makes you ask, ma\'am?" said Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\n"Only as you were taking your daughter to her brother\'s house, and as\r\nhe is a bachelor."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Morton, really you may leave me to take care of myself\r\nand of my daughter too. You have lived so much out of the world for\r\nthe last thirty years that it is quite amusing."\r\n\r\n"There are some persons\' worlds that it is a great deal better for a\r\nlady to be out of," said Mrs. Morton. Then Lady Augustus put up her\r\nhands, and turned round, and affected to laugh, of all which things\r\nMr. Gotobed, who was studying English society, made notes in his own\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"What sort of position does that man Goarly occupy here?" the Senator\r\nasked immediately after dinner.\r\n\r\n"No position at all," said Morton.\r\n\r\n"Every man created holds some position as I take it. The land is his\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"He has I believe about fifty acres."\r\n\r\n"And yet he seems to be in the lowest depth of poverty and\r\nignorance."\r\n\r\n"Of course he mismanages his property and probably drinks."\r\n\r\n"I dare say, Mr. Morton. He is proud of his rights, and talked of his\r\nfather and his grandfather, and yet I doubt whether you would find a\r\nman so squalid and so ignorant in all the States. I suppose he is\r\ninjured by having a lord so near him."\r\n\r\n"Quite the contrary if he would be amenable."\r\n\r\n"You mean if he would be a creature of the lord\'s. And why was that\r\nother man so uncivil to me;--the man who was the lord\'s gamekeeper?"\r\n\r\n"Because you went there as a friend of Goarly."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s his idea of English fair play?" asked the Senator with a\r\njeer.\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Mr. Gotobed," said Morton endeavouring to explain it\r\nall, "you see a part only and not the whole. That man Goarly is a\r\nrascal."\r\n\r\n"So everybody says."\r\n\r\n"And why can\'t you believe everybody?"\r\n\r\n"So everybody says on the lord\'s side. But before I\'m done I\'ll find\r\nout what people say on the other side. I can see that he is ignorant\r\nand squalid; but that very probably is the lord\'s fault. It may be\r\nthat he is a rascal and that the lord is to blame for that too. But\r\nif the lord\'s pheasants have eaten up Goarly\'s corn, the lord ought\r\nto pay for the corn whether Goarly be a rascal or not." Then John\r\nMorton made up his mind that he would never ask another American\r\nSenator to his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTORNEY\'S FAMILY IS DISTURBED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that Wednesday evening Mary Masters said nothing to any of her\r\nfamily as to the invitation from Lady Ushant. She very much wished\r\nto accept it. Latterly, for the last month or two, her distaste to\r\nthe kind of life for which her stepmother was preparing her, had\r\nincreased upon her greatly. There had been days in which she had\r\ndoubted whether it might not be expedient that she should accept Mr.\r\nTwentyman\'s offer. She believed no ill of him. She thought him to be\r\na fine manly young fellow with a good heart and high principles. She\r\nnever asked herself whether he were or were not a gentleman. She had\r\nnever even inquired of herself whether she herself were or were not\r\nespecially a lady. But with all her efforts to like the man,--because\r\nshe thought that by doing so she would relieve and please her\r\nfather,--yet he was distasteful to her; and now, since that walk\r\nhome with him from Bragton Bridge, he was more distasteful than ever.\r\nShe did not tell herself that a short visit, say for a month, to\r\nCheltenham, would prevent his further attentions, but she felt that\r\nthere would be a temporary escape. I do not think that she dwelt much\r\non the suggestion that Reginald Morton should be her companion on the\r\njourney,--but the idea of such companionship, even for a short time,\r\nwas pleasant to her. If he did this surely then he would forgive her\r\nfor having left him at the bridge. She had much to think of before\r\nshe could resolve how she should tell her tidings. Should she show\r\nthe letter first to her stepmother or to her father? In the ordinary\r\ncourse of things in that house the former course would be expected.\r\nIt was Mrs. Masters who managed everything affecting the family.\r\nIt was she who gave permission or denied permission for every\r\nindulgence. She was generally fair to the three girls, taking special\r\npride to herself for doing her duty by her stepdaughter;--but on this\r\nvery account she was the more likely to be angry if Mary passed her\r\nby on such an occasion as this and went to her father. But should her\r\nstepmother have once refused her permission, then the matter would\r\nhave been decided against her. It would be quite useless to appeal\r\nfrom her stepmother to her father;--nor would such an appeal come\r\nwithin the scope of her own principles. The Mortons, and especially\r\nLady Ushant, had been her father\'s friends in old days and she\r\nthought that perhaps she might prevail in this case if she could\r\nspeak to her father first. She knew well what would be the great, or\r\nrather the real objection. Her mother would not wish that she should\r\nbe removed so long from Larry Twentyman. There might be difficulties\r\nabout her clothes, but her father, she knew would be kind to her.\r\n\r\nAt last she made up her mind that she would ask her father. He was\r\nalways at his office-desk for half an hour in the morning, before\r\nthe clerks had come, and on the following day, a minute or two after\r\nhe had taken his seat, she knocked at the door. He was busy reading\r\na letter from Lord Rufford\'s man of business, asking him certain\r\nquestions about Goarly and almost employing him to get up the case\r\non Lord Rufford\'s behalf. There was a certain triumph to him in\r\nthis. It was not by his means that tidings had reached Lord Rufford\r\nof his refusal to undertake Goarly\'s case. But Runciman, who was\r\noften allowed by his lordship to say a few words to him in the\r\nhunting-field, had mentioned the circumstance. "A man like Mr.\r\nMasters is better without such a blackguard as that," the Lord had\r\nsaid. Then Runciman had replied, "No doubt, my Lord; no doubt. But\r\nDillsborough is a poor place, and business is business, my Lord."\r\nThen Lord Rufford had remembered it, and the letter which the\r\nattorney was somewhat triumphantly reading had been the consequence.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Mary? What can I do for you, my love?"\r\n\r\n"Papa, I want you to read this." Then Mr. Masters read the letter.\r\n"I should so like to go."\r\n\r\n"Should you, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! Lady Ushant has been so kind to me,--all my life! And I do\r\nso love her!"\r\n\r\n"What does mamma say?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t asked mamma."\r\n\r\n"Is there any reason why you shouldn\'t go?"\r\n\r\nOf that one reason,--as to Larry Twentyman,--of course she would\r\nsay nothing. She must leave him to discuss that with her mother.\r\n"I should want some clothes, papa; a dress, and some boots, and a\r\nnew hat, and there would be money for the journey and a few other\r\nthings." The attorney winced, but at the same time remembered that\r\nsomething was due to his eldest child in the way of garments and\r\nrelaxation. "I never like to be an expense, papa."\r\n\r\n"You are very good about that, my dear. I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t\r\ngo. It\'s very kind of Lady Ushant. I\'ll talk to mamma." Then Mary\r\nwent away to get the breakfast, fearing that before long there would\r\nbe black looks in the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Masters at once went up to his wife,--having given himself a\r\nminute or two to calculate that he would let Mary have twenty pounds\r\nfor the occasion,--and made his proposition. "I never heard of such\r\nnonsense in my life," said Mrs. Masters.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense,--my dear! Why should it be nonsense?"\r\n\r\n"Cocking her up with Lady Ushant! What good will Lady Ushant do her?\r\nShe\'s not going to live with ladies of quality all her life."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t she live with ladies?"\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean, Gregory. The Mortons have dropped you, for any\r\nuse they were to you, long ago, and you may as well make up your mind\r\nto drop them. You\'ll go on hankering after gentlefolks till you\'ve\r\nabout ruined yourself."\r\n\r\nWhen he remembered that he had that very morning received a\r\ncommission from Lord Rufford he thought that this was a little too\r\nbad. But he was not now in a humour to make known to her this piece\r\nof good news. "I like to feel that she has got friends," he said,\r\ngoing back to Mary\'s proposed visit.\r\n\r\n"Of course she has got friends, if she\'ll only take up with them as\r\nshe ought to do. Why does she go on shilly-shallying with that young\r\nman, instead of closing upon it at once? If she did that she wouldn\'t\r\nwant such friends as Lady Ushant. Why did the girl come to you with\r\nall this instead of asking me?"\r\n\r\n"There would be a little money wanted."\r\n\r\n"Money! Yes, I dare say. It\'s very easy to want money but very hard\r\nto get it. If you send clients away out of the office with a flea in\r\ntheir ear I don\'t see how she\'s to have all manner of luxuries. She\r\nought to have come to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that at all, my dear."\r\n\r\n"If I\'m to look after her she shall be said by me;--that\'s all. I\'ve\r\ndone for her just as I have for my own and I\'m not going to have\r\nher turn up her nose at me directly she wants anything for herself.\r\nI know what\'s fit for Mary, and it ain\'t fit that she should go\r\ntrapesing away to Cheltenham, doing nothing in that old woman\'s\r\nparlour, and losing her chances for life. Who is to suppose that\r\nLarry Twentyman will go on dangling after her in this way, month\r\nafter month? The young man wants a wife, and of course he\'ll get\r\none."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t make her marry the man if she don\'t like him."\r\n\r\n"Like him! She ought to be made to like him. A young man well off as\r\nhe is, and she without a shilling! All that comes from Ushanting." It\r\nnever occurred to Mrs. Masters that perhaps the very qualities that\r\nhad made poor Larry so vehemently in love with Mary had come from her\r\nintercourse with Lady Ushant. "If I\'m to have my way she won\'t go a\r\nyard on the way to Cheltenham."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told her she may go," said Mr. Masters, whose mind was\r\nwandering back to old days,--to his first wife, and to the time when\r\nhe used to be an occasional guest in the big parlour at Bragton. He\r\nwas always ready to acknowledge to himself that his present wife\r\nwas a good and helpful companion to him and a careful mother to his\r\nchildren; but there were moments in which he would remember with soft\r\nregret a different phase of his life. Just at present he was somewhat\r\nangry, and resolving in his own mind that in this case he would have\r\nhis own way.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall tell her she mayn\'t," said Mrs. Masters, with a look of\r\ndogged determination.\r\n\r\n"I hope you will do nothing of the kind, my dear. I\'ve told her that\r\nshe shall have a few pounds to get what she wants, and I won\'t have\r\nher disappointed." After that Mrs. Masters bounced out of the room,\r\nand made herself very disagreeable indeed over the tea-things.\r\n\r\nThe whole household was much disturbed that day. Mrs. Masters said\r\nnothing to Mary about Lady Ushant all the morning, but said a great\r\ndeal about other things. Poor Mary was asked whether she was not\r\nashamed to treat a young man as she was treating Mr. Twentyman. Then\r\nagain it was demanded of her whether she thought it right that all\r\nthe house should be knocked about for her. At dinner Mrs. Masters\r\nwould hardly speak to her husband but addressed herself exclusively\r\nto Dolly and Kate. Mr. Masters was not a man who could, usually,\r\nstand this kind of thing very long and was accustomed to give up in\r\ndespair and then take himself off to the solace of his office-chair.\r\nBut on the present occasion he went through his meal like a Spartan,\r\nand retired from the room without a sign of surrender. In the\r\nafternoon about five o\'clock Mary watched her opportunity and found\r\nhim again alone. It was incumbent on her to reply to Lady Ushant.\r\nWould it not be better that she should write and say how sorry she\r\nwas that she could not come? "But I want you to go," said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa;--I cannot bear to cause trouble."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; no; and I\'m sure I don\'t like trouble myself. But in\r\nthis case I think you ought to go. What day has she named?" Then Mary\r\ndeclared that she could not possibly go so soon as Lady Ushant had\r\nsuggested, but that she could be ready by the 18th of December. "Then\r\nwrite and tell her so, my dear, and I will let your mother know that\r\nit is fixed." But Mary still hesitated, desiring to know whether she\r\nhad not better speak to her mother first. "I think you had better\r\nwrite your letter first,"--and then he absolutely made her write it\r\nin the office and give it to him to be posted. After that he promised\r\nto communicate to Reginald Morton what had been done.\r\n\r\nThe household was very much disturbed the whole of that evening. Poor\r\nMary never remembered such a state of things, and when there had been\r\nany difference of opinion, she had hitherto never been the cause of\r\nit. Now it was all owing to her! And things were said so terrible\r\nthat she hardly knew how to bear them. Her father had promised her\r\nthe twenty pounds, and it was insinuated that all the comforts of\r\nthe family must be stopped because of this lavish extravagance. Her\r\nfather sat still and bore it, almost without a word. Both Dolly\r\nand Kate were silent and wretched. Mrs. Masters every now and then\r\ngurgled in her throat, and three or four times wiped her eyes. "I\'m\r\nbetter out of the way altogether," she said at last, jumping up\r\nand walking towards the door as though she were going to leave the\r\nroom,--and the house, for ever.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said Mary, rising from her seat, "I won\'t go. I\'ll write and\r\ntell Lady Ushant that I can\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not to mind me," said Mrs. Masters. "You\'re to do what your\r\npapa tells you. Everything that I\'ve been striving at is to be thrown\r\naway. I\'m to be nobody, and it\'s quite right that your papa should\r\ntell you so."\r\n\r\n"Dear mamma, don\'t talk like that," said Mary, clinging hold of her\r\nstepmother.\r\n\r\n"Your papa sits there and won\'t say a word," said Mrs. Masters,\r\nstamping her foot.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good of speaking when you go on like that before the\r\nchildren?" said Mr. Masters, getting up from his chair. "I say that\r\nit\'s a proper thing that the girl should go to see the old friend who\r\nbrought her up and has been always kind to her,--and she shall go."\r\nMrs. Masters seated herself on the nearest chair and leaning her\r\nhead against the wall, began to go into hysterics. "Your letter has\r\nalready gone, Mary; and I desire you will write no other without\r\nletting me know." Then he left the room and the house,--and\r\nabsolutely went over to the Bush. This latter proceeding was,\r\nhowever, hardly more than a bravado; for he merely took the\r\nopportunity of asking Mrs. Runciman a question at the bar, and then\r\nwalked back to his own house, and shut himself up in the office.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning he called on Reginald Morton and told him that\r\nhis daughter had accepted Lady Ushant\'s invitation, but could not\r\ngo till the 18th. "I shall be proud to take charge of her," said\r\nReginald. "And as for the change in the day it will suit me all the\r\nbetter." So that was settled.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, Friday, Mrs. Masters did not come down to breakfast,\r\nbut was waited upon upstairs by her own daughters. This with her was\r\na most unusual circumstance. The two maids were of opinion that such\r\na thing had never occurred before, and that therefore Masters must\r\nhave been out half the night at the public-house although they had\r\nnot known it. To Mary she would hardly speak a word. She appeared\r\nat dinner and called her husband Mr. Masters when she helped him to\r\nstew. All the afternoon she averred that her head was splitting, but\r\nmanaged to say many very bitter things about gentlemen in general,\r\nand expressed a vehement hope that that poor man Goarly would get at\r\nleast a hundred pounds. It must be owned, however, that at this time\r\nshe had heard nothing of Lord Rufford\'s commission to her husband.\r\nIn the evening Larry came in and was at once told the terrible news.\r\n"Larry," said Kate, "Mary is going away for a month."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going, Mary?" asked the lover eagerly.\r\n\r\n"To Lady Ushant\'s, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"For a month!"\r\n\r\n"She has asked me for a month," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a regular fool\'s errand," said Mrs. Masters. "It\'s not done\r\nwith my consent, Mr. Twentyman. I don\'t think she ought to stir from\r\nhome till things are more settled."\r\n\r\n"They can be settled this moment as far as I am concerned," said\r\nLarry standing up.\r\n\r\n"There now," said Mrs. Masters. At this time Mr. Masters was not in\r\nthe room. "If you can make it straight with Mr. Twentyman I won\'t say\r\na word against your going away for a month."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, you shouldn\'t!" exclaimed Mary.\r\n\r\n"I hate such nonsense. Mr. Twentyman is behaving honest and genteel.\r\nWhat more would you have? Give him an answer like a sensible girl."\r\n\r\n"I have given him an answer and I cannot say anything more," said\r\nMary as she left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n"WHO VALUED THE GEESE?"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the time had come for the visit to Rufford Hall Mr. Gotobed\r\nhad called upon Bearside the attorney and had learned as much as\r\nMr. Bearside chose to tell him of the facts of the case. This took\r\nplace on the Saturday morning and the interview was on the whole\r\nsatisfactory to the Senator. But then having a theory of his own\r\nin his head, and being fond of ventilating his own theories, he\r\nexplained thoroughly to the man the story which he wished to hear\r\nbefore the man was called upon to tell his story. Mr. Bearside of\r\ncourse told it accordingly. Goarly was a very poor man, and very\r\nignorant; was perhaps not altogether so good a member of society as\r\nhe might have been; but no doubt he had a strong case against the\r\nlord. The lord, so said Mr. Bearside, had fallen into a way of paying\r\na certain recompense in certain cases for crops damaged by game;--and\r\nhaving in this way laid down a rule for himself did not choose to\r\nhave that rule disturbed. "Just feudalism!" said the indignant\r\nSenator. "No better, nor yet no worse than that, sir," said the\r\nattorney who did not in the least know what feudalism was. "The\r\nstrong hand backed by the strong rank and the strong purse determined\r\nto have its own way!" continued the Senator. "A most determined man\r\nis his lordship," said the attorney. Then the Senator expressed his\r\nhope that Mr. Bearside would be able to see the poor man through it,\r\nand Mr. Bearside explained to the Senator that the poor man was a\r\nvery poor man indeed, who had been so unfortunate with his land that\r\nhe was hardly able to provide bread for himself and his children. He\r\nwent so far as to insinuate that he was taking up this matter himself\r\nsolely on the score of charity, adding that as he could not of course\r\nafford to be money out of pocket for expenses of witnesses, &c.,\r\nhe did not quite see how he was to proceed. Then the Senator made\r\ncertain promises. He was, he said, going back to London in the course\r\nof next week, but he did not mind making himself responsible to the\r\nextent of fifty dollars if the thing were carried on, bona fide, to\r\na conclusion. Mr. Bearside declared that it would of course be bona\r\nfide, and asked the Senator for his address. Would Mr. Gotobed object\r\nto putting his name to a little docket certifying to the amount\r\npromised? Mr. Gotobed gave an address, but thought that in such a\r\nmatter as that his word might be trusted. If it were not trusted then\r\nthe offer might fall to the ground. Mr. Bearside was profuse in his\r\napologies and declared that the gentleman\'s word was as good as his\r\nbond.\r\n\r\nMr. Gotobed made no secret of his doings. Perhaps he had a feeling\r\nthat he could not justify himself in so strange a proceeding without\r\nabsolute candour. He saw Mr. Mainwaring in the street as he left\r\nBearside\'s office and told him all about it. "I just want, sir, to\r\nsee what\'ll come of it."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll lose your fifty dollars, Mr. Gotobed, and only cause a little\r\nvexation to a high-spirited young nobleman."\r\n\r\n"Very likely, sir. But neither the loss of my dollars, nor Lord\r\nRufford\'s slight vexation will in the least disturb my rest. I\'m\r\nnot a rich man, sir, but I should like to watch the way in which\r\nsuch a question will be tried and brought to a conclusion in this\r\naristocratic country. I don\'t quite know what your laws may be, Mr.\r\nMainwaring."\r\n\r\n"Just the same as your own, Mr. Gotobed, I take it."\r\n\r\n"We have no game laws, sir. As I was saying I don\'t understand your\r\nlaws, but justice is the same everywhere. If this great lord\'s game\r\nhas eaten up the poor man\'s wheat the great lord ought to pay for\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"The owners of game pay for the damage they do three times over,"\r\nsaid the parson, who was very strongly on that side of the question.\r\n"Do you think that such men as Goarly would be better off if the\r\ngentry were never to come into the country at all?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, Mr. Mainwaring, I may think that there would be no Goarlys\r\nif there were no Ruffords. That, however, is a great question which\r\ncannot be argued on this case. All we can hope here is that one poor\r\nman may have an act of justice done him though in seeking for it he\r\nhas to struggle against so wealthy a magnate as Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"What I hope is that he may be found out," replied Mr. Mainwaring\r\nwith equal enthusiasm, "and then he will be in Rufford gaol before\r\nlong. That\'s the justice I look for. Who do you think put down the\r\npoison in Dillsborough wood?"\r\n\r\n"How was it that the poor woman lost all her geese?" asked the\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\n"She was paid for a great many more than she lost, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t touch upon the injustice of the proceeding. Who\r\nassessed the loss, sir? Who valued the geese? Am I to keep a pet\r\ntiger in my garden, and give you a couple of dollars when he destroys\r\nyour pet dog, and think myself justified because dogs as a rule are\r\nnot worth more than two dollars each? She has a right to her own\r\ngeese on her own ground."\r\n\r\n"And Lord Rufford, sir, as I take it," said Runciman, who had been\r\nallowed to come up and hear the end of the conversation, "has a right\r\nto his own foxes in his own coverts."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--if he could keep them there, my friend. But as it is the\r\nnature of foxes to wander away and to be thieves, he has no such\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Of course, sir, begging your pardon," said Runciman, "I was speaking\r\nof England." Runciman had heard of the Senator Gotobed, as indeed had\r\nall Dillsborough by this time.\r\n\r\n"And I am speaking of justice all the world over," said the Senator\r\nslapping his hand upon his thigh. "But I only want to see. It may be\r\nthat England is a country in which a poor man should not attempt to\r\nhold a few acres of land."\r\n\r\nOn that night the Dillsborough club met as usual and, as a matter\r\nof course, Goarly and the American Senator were the subjects\r\nchiefly discussed. Everybody in the room knew,--or thought that he\r\nknew,--that Goarly was a cheating fraudulent knave, and that Lord\r\nRufford was, at any rate, in this case acting properly. They all\r\nunderstood the old goose, and were aware, nearly to a bushel, of the\r\namount of wheat which the man had sold off those two fields. Runciman\r\nknew that the interest on the mortgage had been paid, and could only\r\nhave been paid out of the produce; and Larry Twentyman knew that if\r\nGoarly took his 7_s._ 6_d._ an acre he would be better off than if\r\nthe wood had not been there. But yet among them all they didn\'t quite\r\nsee how they were to confute the Senator\'s logic. They could not\r\nanswer it satisfactorily, even among themselves; but they felt that\r\nif Goarly could be detected in some offence, that would confute\r\nthe Senator. Among themselves it was sufficient to repeat the\r\nwell-known fact that Goarly was a rascal; but with reference to this\r\naggravating, interfering, and most obnoxious American it would be\r\nnecessary to prove it.\r\n\r\n"His Lordship has put it into Masters\'s hands, I\'m told," said the\r\ndoctor. At this time neither the attorney nor Larry Twentyman was in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t have done better," said Runciman, speaking from behind a\r\nlong clay pipe.\r\n\r\n"All the same he was nibbling at Goarly," said Ned Botsey.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he was nibbling at Goarly at all, Mr. Botsey,"\r\nsaid the landlord. "Goarly came to him, and Goarly was refused. What\r\nmore would you have?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all one to me," said Botsey; "only I do think that in a\r\nsporting county like this the place ought to be made too hot to hold\r\na blackguard like that. If he comes out at me with his gun I\'ll ride\r\nover him. And I wouldn\'t mind riding over that American too."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what would suit Goarly\'s book," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Exactly what Goarly would like," said Harry Stubbings.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Masters and Larry entered the room. On that evening two\r\nthings had occurred to the attorney. Nickem had returned, and had\r\nasked for and received an additional week\'s leave of absence. He\r\nhad declined to explain accurately what he was doing but gave the\r\nattorney to understand that he thought that he was on the way to\r\nthe bottom of the whole thing. Then, after Nickem had left him, Mr.\r\nMasters had a letter of instructions from Lord Rufford\'s steward.\r\nWhen he received it, and found that his paid services had been\r\nabsolutely employed on behalf of his Lordship, he almost regretted\r\nthe encouragement he had given to Nickem. In the first place he might\r\nwant Nickem. And then he felt that in his present position he ought\r\nnot to be a party to anything underhand. But Nickem was gone, and he\r\nwas obliged to console himself by thinking that Nickem was at any\r\nrate employing his intellect on the right side. When he left his\r\nhouse with Larry Twentyman he had told his wife nothing about Lord\r\nRufford. Up to this time he and his wife had not as yet reconciled\r\ntheir difference, and poor Mary was still living in misery. Larry,\r\nthough he had called for the attorney, had not sat down in the\r\nparlour, and had barely spoken to Mary. "For gracious sake, Mr.\r\nTwentyman, don\'t let him stay in that place there half the night,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Masters. "It ain\'t fit for a father of a family."\r\n\r\n"Father never does stay half the night," said Kate, who took more\r\nliberties in that house than any one else.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, miss. I don\'t know whether it wouldn\'t be better\r\nfor you, Mr. Twentyman, if you were not there so often yourself."\r\nPoor Larry felt this to be hard. He was not even engaged as yet, and\r\nas far as he could see was not on the way to be engaged. In such\r\ncondition surely his possible mother-in-law could have no right to\r\ninterfere with him. He condescended to make no reply, but crossed the\r\npassage and carried the attorney off with him.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve heard what that American gentleman has been about, Mr.\r\nMasters?" asked the landlord.\r\n\r\n"I\'m told he\'s been with Bearside."\r\n\r\n"And has offered to pay his bill for him if he\'ll carry on the\r\nbusiness for Goarly. Whoever heard the like of that?"\r\n\r\n"What sort of a man is he?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"A great man in his own country everybody says," answered Runciman.\r\n"I wish he\'d stayed there. He comes over here and thinks he\r\nunderstands everything just as though he had lived here all his life.\r\nDid you say gin cold, Larry;--and rum for you, Mr. Masters?" Then the\r\nlandlord gave the orders to the girl who had answered the bell.\r\n\r\n"But they say he\'s actually going to Lord Rufford\'s," said young\r\nBotsey who would have given one of his fingers to be asked to the\r\nlord\'s house.\r\n\r\n"They are all going from Bragton," said Runciman.\r\n\r\n"The young squire is going to ride one of my horses," said Harry\r\nStubbings.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be an easy three pounds in your pockets, Harry," said the\r\ndoctor. In answer to which Harry remarked that he took all that as it\r\ncame, the heavies and lights together, and that there was not much\r\nchange to be got out of three sovereigns when some gentlemen had had\r\na horse out for the day,--particularly when a gentleman didn\'t pay\r\nperhaps for twelve months.\r\n\r\n"The whole party is going," continued the landlord. "How he is to\r\nhave the cheek to go into his Lordship\'s house after what he is doing\r\nis more than I can understand."\r\n\r\n"What business is it of his?" said Larry angrily. "That\'s what I want\r\nto know. What\'d he think if we went and interfered over there? I\r\nshouldn\'t be surprised if he got a little rough usage before he\'s out\r\nof the county. I\'m told he came across Bean when he was ferretting\r\nabout the other day, and that Bean gave him quite as good as he\r\nbrought."\r\n\r\n"I say he\'s a spy," said Ribbs the butcher from his seat on the sofa.\r\n"I hates a spy."\r\n\r\nSoon after that Mr. Masters left the room and Larry Twentyman\r\nfollowed him. There was something almost ridiculous in the way\r\nthe young man would follow the attorney about on these Saturday\r\nevenings,--as though he could make love to the girl by talking to the\r\nfather. But on this occasion he had something special to say. "So\r\nMary\'s going to Cheltenham, Mr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is. You don\'t see any objection to that, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, Mr. Masters. I wish she might go anywhere to enjoy\r\nherself. And from all I\'ve heard Lady Ushant is a very good sort of\r\nlady."\r\n\r\n"A very good sort of lady. She won\'t do Mary any harm, Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose she will. But there\'s one thing I should like to\r\nknow. Why shouldn\'t she tell me before she goes that she\'ll have me?"\r\n\r\n"I wish she would with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Masters is all on my side."\r\n\r\n"Quite so."\r\n\r\n"And the girls have always been my friends."\r\n\r\n"I think we are all your friends, Twentyman. I\'m sure Mary is. But\r\nthat isn\'t marrying;--is it?"\r\n\r\n"If you would speak to her, Mr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"What would you have me say? I couldn\'t bid my girl to have one man\r\nor another. I could only tell her what I think, and that she knows\r\nalready."\r\n\r\n"If you were to say that you wished it! She thinks so much about\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t tell her that I wished it in a manner that would drive\r\nher into it. Of course it would be a very good match. But I have only\r\nto think of her happiness and I must leave her to judge what will\r\nmake her happy."\r\n\r\n"I should like to have it fixed some way before she starts," said\r\nLarry in an altered tone.\r\n\r\n"Of course you are your own master, Twentyman. And you have behaved\r\nvery well."\r\n\r\n"This is a kind of thing that a man can\'t stand," said the young\r\nfarmer sulkily. "Good night, Mr. Masters." Then he walked off home\r\nto Chowton Farm meditating on his own condition and trying to make\r\nup his mind to leave the scornful girl and become a free man. But\r\nhe couldn\'t do it. He couldn\'t even quite make up his mind that he\r\nwould try to do it. There was a bitterness within as he thought\r\nof permanent fixed failure which he could not digest. There was a\r\ncraving in his heart which he did not himself quite understand, but\r\nwhich made him think that the world would be unfit to be lived in if\r\nhe were to be altogether separated from Mary Masters. He couldn\'t\r\nseparate himself from her. It was all very well thinking of it,\r\ntalking of it, threatening it; but in truth he couldn\'t do it. There\r\nmight of course be an emergency in which he must do it. She might\r\ndeclare that she loved some one else and she might marry that other\r\nperson. In that event he saw no other alternative but,--as he\r\nexpressed it to himself,--"to run a mucker." Whether the "mucker"\r\nshould be run against Mary, or against the fortunate lover, or\r\nagainst himself, he did not at present resolve.\r\n\r\nBut he did resolve as he reached his own hall-door that he would make\r\none more passionate appeal to Mary herself before she started for\r\nCheltenham, and that he would not make it out on a public path, or in\r\nthe Masters\' family parlour before all the Masters\' family;--but that\r\nhe would have her secluded, by herself, so that he might speak out\r\nall that was in him, to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHERE ARE CONVENANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the Monday came the party to Rufford Hall had become quite a\r\nsettled thing and had been very much discussed. On the Saturday the\r\nSenator had been driven to the meet, a distance of about ten miles,\r\non purpose that he might see Lord Rufford and explain his views about\r\nGoarly. Lord Rufford had bowed and stared, and laughed, and had then\r\ntold the Senator that he thought he would "find himself in the wrong\r\nbox." "That\'s quite possible, my Lord. I guess, it won\'t be the first\r\ntime I\'ve been in the wrong box, my Lord. Sometimes I do get right.\r\nBut I thought I would not enter your lordship\'s house as a guest\r\nwithout telling you what I was doing." Then Lord Rufford assured him\r\nthat this little affair about Goarly would make no difference in that\r\nrespect. Mr. Gotobed again scrutinised the hounds and Tony Tuppett,\r\nlaughed in his sleeve because a fox wasn\'t found in the first quarter\r\nof an hour, and after that was driven back to Bragton.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday was a day of preparation for the Trefoils. Of course they\r\ndidn\'t go to church. Arabella indeed was never up in time for church\r\nand Lady Augustus only went when her going would be duly registered\r\namong fashionable people. Mr. Gotobed laughed when he was invited\r\nand asked whether anybody was ever known to go to church two Sundays\r\nrunning at Bragton. "People have been known to refuse with less\r\nacrimony," said Morton. "I always speak my mind, sir," replied the\r\nSenator. Poor John Morton, therefore, went to his parish church\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThere were many things to be considered by the Trefoils. There was\r\nthe question of dress. If any good was to be done by Arabella at\r\nRufford it must be done with great despatch. There would be the\r\ndinner on Monday, the hunting on Tuesday, the ball, and then the\r\ninteresting moment of departure. No girl could make better use of\r\nher time; but then, think of her difficulties! All that she did\r\nwould have to be done under the very eyes of the man to whom she\r\nwas engaged, and to whom she wished to remain engaged,--unless, as\r\nshe said to herself, she could "pull off the other event." A great\r\ndeal must depend on appearance. As she and her mother were out on a\r\nlengthened cruise among long-suffering acquaintances, going to the De\r\nBrownes after the Gores, and the Smijthes after the De Brownes, with\r\nas many holes to run to afterwards as a four-year-old fox,--though\r\nwith the same probability of finding them stopped,--of course she had\r\nher wardrobe with her. To see her night after night one would think\r\nthat it was supplied with all that wealth would give. But there were\r\ndeficiencies and there were make-shifts, very well known to herself\r\nand well understood by her maid. She could generally supply herself\r\nwith gloves by bets, as to which she had never any scruple in taking\r\neither what she did win or did not, and in dunning any who might\r\nchance to be defaulters. On occasions too, when not afraid of\r\nthe bystanders, she would venture on a hat, and though there was\r\ndifficulty as to the payment, not being able to give her number as\r\nshe did with gloves, so that the tradesmen could send the article,\r\nstill she would manage to get the hat,--and the trimmings. It was\r\nsaid of her that she once offered to lay an Ulster to a sealskin\r\njacket, but that the young man had coolly said that a sealskin jacket\r\nwas beyond a joke and had asked her whether she was ready to "put\r\ndown" her Ulster. These were little difficulties from which she\r\nusually knew how to extricate herself without embarrassment; but she\r\nhad not expected to have to marshal her forces against such an enemy\r\nas Lord Rufford, or to sit down for the besieging of such a city this\r\ncampaign. There were little things which required to be done, and the\r\nlady\'s-maid certainly had not time to go to church on Sunday.\r\n\r\nBut there were other things which troubled her even more than her\r\nclothes. She did not much like Bragton, and at Bragton, in his own\r\nhouse, she did not very much like her proposed husband. At Washington\r\nhe had been somebody. She had met him everywhere then, and had heard\r\nhim much talked about. At Washington he had been a popular man and\r\nhad had the reputation of being a rich man also;--but here, at home,\r\nin the country he seemed to her to fall off in importance, and he\r\ncertainly had not made himself pleasant. Whether any man could be\r\npleasant to her in the retirement of a country house,--any man whom\r\nshe would have no interest in running down,--she did not ask herself.\r\nAn engagement to her must under any circumstances be a humdrum\r\nthing,--to be brightened only by wealth. But here she saw no signs\r\nof wealth. Nevertheless she was not prepared to shove away the\r\nplank from below her feet, till she was sure that she had a more\r\nsubstantial board on which to step. Her mother, who perhaps did not\r\nsee in the character of Morton all the charms which she would wish to\r\nfind in a son-in-law, was anxious to shake off the Bragton alliance;\r\nbut Arabella, as she said so often both to herself and to her mother,\r\nwas sick of the dust of the battle and conscious of fading strength.\r\nShe would make this one more attempt, but must make it with great\r\ncare. When last in town this young lord had whispered a word or two\r\nto her, which then had set her hoping for a couple of days; and now,\r\nwhen chance had brought her into his neighbourhood, he had gone out\r\nof his way,--very much out of his way,--to renew his acquaintance\r\nwith her. She would be mad not to give herself the chance;--but yet\r\nshe could not afford to let the plank go from under her feet.\r\n\r\nBut the part she had to play was one which even she felt to be almost\r\nbeyond her powers. She could perceive that Morton was beginning to\r\nbe jealous,--and that his jealousy was not of that nature which\r\nstrengthens a tie but which is apt to break it altogether. His\r\njealousy, if fairly aroused, would not be appeased by a final return\r\nto himself. She had already given him occasion to declare himself\r\noff, and if thoroughly angered he would no doubt use it. Day by day,\r\nand almost hour by hour, he was becoming more sombre and hard, and\r\nshe was well aware that there was reason for it. It did not suit her\r\nto walk about alone with him through the shrubberies. It did not suit\r\nher to be seen with his arm round her waist. Of course the people\r\nof Bragton would talk of the engagement, but she would prefer that\r\nthey should talk of it with doubt. Even her own maid had declared to\r\nMrs. Hopkins that she did not know whether there was or was not an\r\nengagement,--her own maid being at the time almost in her confidence.\r\nVery few of the comforts of a lover had been vouchsafed to John\r\nMorton during this sojourn at Bragton and very little had been done\r\nin accordance with his wishes. Even this visit to Rufford, as she\r\nwell knew, was being made in opposition to him. She hoped that her\r\nlover would not attempt to ride to hounds on the Tuesday, so that\r\nshe might be near the lord unseen by him,--and that he would leave\r\nRufford on the Wednesday before herself and her mother. At the ball\r\nof course she could dance with Lord Rufford, and could keep her eye\r\non her lover at the same time.\r\n\r\nShe hardly saw Morton on the Sunday afternoon, and she was again\r\ncloseted on the Monday till lunch. They were to start at four and\r\nthere would not be much more than time after lunch for her to put on\r\nher travelling gear. Then, as they all felt, there was a difficulty\r\nabout the carriages. Who was to go with whom? Arabella, after lunch,\r\ntook the bull by the horns. "I suppose," she said as Morton followed\r\nher out into the hall, "mamma and I had better go in the phaeton."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking that Lady Augustus might consent to travel with Mr.\r\nGotobed and that you and I might have the phaeton."\r\n\r\n"Of course it would be very pleasant," she answered smiling.\r\n\r\n"Then why not let it be so?"\r\n\r\n"There are convenances."\r\n\r\n"How would it be if you and I were going without anybody else? Do you\r\nmean to say that in that case we might not sit in the same carriage?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to say that in that case I should not go at all. It isn\'t\r\ndone in England. You have been in the States so long that you forget\r\nall our old-fashioned ways."\r\n\r\n"I do think that is nonsense." She only smiled and shook her head.\r\n"Then the Senator shall go in the phaeton, and I will go with you and\r\nyour mother."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--and quarrel with mamma all the time as you always do. Let me\r\nhave it my own way this time."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I believe you are ashamed of me," he said leaning back\r\nupon the hall table. He had shut the dining-room door and she was\r\nstanding close to him.\r\n\r\n"What nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"You have only got to say so, Arabella, and let there be an end of it\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"If you wish it, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"You know I don\'t wish it. You know I am ready to marry you\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"You have made ever so many difficulties as far as I can understand."\r\n\r\n"You have unreasonable people acting for you, Arabella, and of course\r\nI don\'t mean to give way to them."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t talk to me about money. I know nothing about it and have\r\ntaken no part in the matter. I suppose there must be settlements?"\r\n\r\n"Of course there must."\r\n\r\n"And I can only do what other people tell me. You at any rate have\r\nsomething to do with it all, and I have absolutely nothing."\r\n\r\n"That is no reason you shouldn\'t go in the same carriage with me to\r\nRufford."\r\n\r\n"Are you coming back to that,--just like a big child? Do let us\r\nconsider that as settled. I\'m sure you\'ll let mamma and me have the\r\nuse of the phaeton." Of course the little contest was ended in the\r\nmanner proposed by Arabella.\r\n\r\n"I do think," said Arabella, when she and her mother were seated in\r\nthe carriage, "that we have treated him very badly."\r\n\r\n"Quite as well as he deserves! What a house to bring us to;--and what\r\npeople! Did you ever come across such an old woman before! And she\r\nhas him completely under her thumb. Are you prepared to live with\r\nthat harridan?"\r\n\r\n"You may let me alone, mamma, for all that. She won\'t be in my way\r\nafter I\'m married, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have something to do then."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t a bit afraid of her."\r\n\r\n"And to ask us to meet such people as this American!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s going back to Washington and it suited him to have him. I don\'t\r\nquarrel with him for that. I wish I were married to him and back in\r\nthe States."\r\n\r\n"You do?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"You have given it all up about Lord Rufford then?"\r\n\r\n"No;--that\'s just where it is. I haven\'t given it up, and I still see\r\ntrouble upon trouble before me. But I know how it will be. He doesn\'t\r\nmean anything. He\'s only amusing himself."\r\n\r\n"If he\'d once say the word he couldn\'t get back again. The Duke would\r\ninterfere then."\r\n\r\n"What would he care for the Duke? The Duke is no more than anybody\r\nelse nowadays. I shall just fall to the ground between two stools.\r\nI know it as well as if it were done already. And then I shall have\r\nto begin again! If it comes to that I shall do something terrible.\r\nI know I shall." Then they turned in at Lord Rufford\'s gates; and as\r\nthey were driven up beneath the oaks, through the gloom, both mother\r\nand daughter thought how charming it would be to be the mistress of\r\nsuch a park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EVENING AT RUFFORD HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phaeton arrived the first, the driver having been especially\r\ntold by Arabella that he need not delay on the road for the other\r\ncarriage. She had calculated that she might make her entrance with\r\nbetter effect alone with her mother than in company with Morton and\r\nthe Senator. It would have been worth the while of any one who had\r\nwitnessed her troubles on that morning to watch the bland serenity\r\nand happy ease with which she entered the room. Her mother was fond\r\nof a prominent place but was quite contented on this occasion to\r\nplay a second fiddle for her daughter. She had seen at a glance that\r\nRufford Hall was a delightful house. Oh,--if it might become the\r\nhome of her child and her grandchildren,--and possibly a retreat\r\nfor herself! Arabella was certainly very handsome at this moment.\r\nNever did she look better than when got up with care for travelling,\r\nespecially as seen by an evening light. Her slow motions were adapted\r\nto heavy wraps, and however she might procure her large sealskin\r\njacket she graced it well when she had it. Lord Rufford came to the\r\ndoor to meet them and immediately introduced them to his sister.\r\nThere were six or seven people in the room, mostly ladies, and tea\r\nwas offered to the new-comers. Lady Penwether was largely made,\r\nlike her brother; but was a languidly lovely woman, not altogether\r\nunlike Arabella herself in her figure and movements, but with a more\r\nexpressive face, with less colour, and much more positive assurance\r\nof high breeding. Lady Penwether was said to be haughty, but it was\r\nadmitted by all people that when Lady Penwether had said a thing\r\nor had done a thing, it might be taken for granted that the way in\r\nwhich she had done or said that thing was the right way. The only\r\nother gentleman there was Major Caneback, who had just come in from\r\nhunting with some distant pack and who had been brought into the room\r\nby Lord Rufford that he might give some account of the doings of\r\nthe day. According to Caneback, they had been talking in the Brake\r\ncountry about nothing but Goarly and the enormities which had been\r\nperpetrated in the U. R. U. "By-the-bye, Miss Trefoil," said Lord\r\nRufford, "what have you done with your Senator?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s on the road, Lord Rufford, examining English institutions as he\r\ncomes along. He\'ll be here by midnight."\r\n\r\n"Imagine the man coming to me and telling me that he was a friend of\r\nGoarly\'s. I rather liked him for it. There was a thorough pluck about\r\nit. They say he\'s going to find all the money."\r\n\r\n"I thought Mr. Scrobby was to do that?" said Lady Penwether.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Scrobby will not have the slightest objection to have that part\r\nof the work done for him. If all we hear is true Miss Trefoil\'s\r\nSenator may have to defend both Scrobby and Goarly."\r\n\r\n"My Senator as you call him will be quite up to the occasion."\r\n\r\n"You knew him in America, Miss Trefoil?" asked Lady Penwether.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. We used to meet him and Mrs. Gotobed everywhere. But we\r\ndidn\'t exactly bring him over with us;--though our party down to\r\nBragton was made up in Washington," she added, feeling that she might\r\nin this way account in some degree for her own presence in John\r\nMorton\'s house. "It was mamma and Mr. Morton arranged it all."\r\n\r\n"Oh my dear it was you and the Senator," said Lady Augustus, ready\r\nfor the occasion.\r\n\r\n"Miss Trefoil," said the lord, "let us have it all out at once. Are\r\nyou taking Goarly\'s part?"\r\n\r\n"Taking Goarly\'s part!" ejaculated the Major.\r\n\r\nArabella affected to give a little start, as though frightened by\r\nthe Major\'s enthusiasm. "For heaven\'s sake let us know our foes,"\r\ncontinued Lord Rufford. "You see the effect such an announcement had\r\nupon Major Caneback. Have you made an appointment before dawn with\r\nMr. Scrobby under the elms? Now I look at you I believe in my heart\r\nyou\'re a Goarlyite,--only without the Senator\'s courage to tell me\r\nthe truth beforehand."\r\n\r\n"I really am very much obliged to Goarly," said Arabella, "because it\r\nis so nice to have something to talk about."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I think, Miss Trefoil," declared a young lady, Miss\r\nPenge, who was a friend of Lady Penwether. "The gentlemen have so\r\nmuch to say about hunting which nobody can understand! But now this\r\ndelightful man has scattered poison all over the country there is\r\nsomething that comes home to our understanding. I declare myself\r\na Goarlyite at once, Lord Rufford, and shall put myself under the\r\nSenator\'s leading directly he comes."\r\n\r\nDuring all this time not a word had been said of John Morton, the\r\nmaster of Bragton, the man to whose party these new-comers belonged.\r\nLady Augustus and Arabella clearly understood that John Morton was\r\nonly a peg on which the invitation to them had been hung. The feeling\r\nthat it was so grew upon them with every word that was spoken,--and\r\nalso the conviction that he must be treated like a peg at Rufford.\r\nThe sight of the hangings of the room, so different to the\r\nold-fashioned dingy curtains at Bragton, the brilliancy of the\r\nmirrors, all the decorations of the place, the very blaze from the\r\nbig grate, forced upon the girl\'s feelings a conviction that this was\r\nher proper sphere. Here she was, being made much of as a new-comer,\r\nand here if possible she must remain. Everything smiled on her with\r\ngilded dimples, and these were the smiles she valued. As the softness\r\nof the cushions sank into her heart, and mellow nothingnesses from\r\nwell-trained voices greeted her ears, and the air of wealth and\r\nidleness floated about her cheeks, her imagination rose within her\r\nand assured her that she could secure something better than Bragton.\r\nThe cautions with which she had armed herself faded away. This,--this\r\nwas the kind of thing for which she had been striving. As a girl of\r\nspirit was it not worth her while to make another effort even though\r\nthere might be danger? Aut Caesar aut nihil. She knew nothing about\r\nCaesar; but before the tardy wheels which brought the Senator and Mr.\r\nMorton had stopped at the door she had declared to herself that she\r\nwould be Lady Rufford. The fresh party was of course brought into the\r\ndrawing-room and tea was offered; but Arabella hardly spoke to them,\r\nand Lady Augustus did not speak to them at all, and they were shown\r\nup to their bedrooms with very little preliminary conversation.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard to put Mr. Gotobed down; or it might be more\r\ncorrectly said,--as there was no effort to put him down,--that it\r\nwas not often that he failed in coming to the surface. He took Lady\r\nPenwether out to dinner and was soon explaining to her that this\r\nlittle experiment of his in regard to Goarly was being tried simply\r\nwith the view of examining the institutions of the country. "We don\'t\r\nmind it from you," said Lady Penwether, "because you are in a certain\r\ndegree a foreigner." The Senator declared himself flattered by being\r\nregarded as a foreigner only "in a certain degree." "You see you\r\nspeak our language, Mr. Gotobed, and we can\'t help thinking you are\r\nhalf-English."\r\n\r\n"We are two-thirds English, my lady," said Mr. Gotobed; "but then we\r\nthink the other third is an improvement."\r\n\r\n"Very likely."\r\n\r\n"We have nothing so nice as this;" as he spoke he waved his right\r\nhand to the different corners of the room. "Such a dinner-table as\r\nI am sitting down to now couldn\'t be fixed in all the United States\r\nthough a man might spend three times as many dollars on it as his\r\nlordship does."\r\n\r\n"That is very often done, I should think."\r\n\r\n"But then as we have nothing so well done as a house like this, so\r\nalso have we nothing so ill done as the houses of your poor people."\r\n\r\n"Wages are higher with you, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"And public spirit, and the philanthropy of the age, and the\r\nenlightenment of the people, and the institutions of the country all\r\nround. They are all higher."\r\n\r\n"Canvas-back ducks," said the Major, who was sitting two or three off\r\non the other side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, we have canvas-back ducks."\r\n\r\n"Make up for a great many faults," said the Major.\r\n\r\n"Of course, sir, when a man\'s stomach rises above his intelligence\r\nhe\'ll have to argue accordingly," said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"Caneback, what are you going to ride to-morrow?" asked the lord who\r\nsaw the necessity of changing the conversation, as far at least as\r\nthe Major was concerned.\r\n\r\n"Jemima;--mare of Purefoy\'s; have my neck broken, they tell me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not improbable," said Sir John Purefoy who was sitting at Lady\r\nPenwether\'s left hand. "Nobody ever could ride her yet."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of asking you to let Miss Trefoil try her," said Lord\r\nRufford. Arabella was sitting between Sir John Purefoy and the Major.\r\n\r\n"Miss Trefoil is quite welcome," said Sir John. "It isn\'t a bad idea.\r\nPerhaps she may carry a lady, because she has never been tried. I\r\nknow that she objects strongly to carry a man."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Lady Augustus, "you shan\'t do anything of the kind."\r\nAnd Lady Augustus pretended to be frightened.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, you don\'t suppose Lord Rufford wants to kill me at once."\r\n\r\n"You shall either ride her, Miss Trefoil, or my little horse Jack.\r\nBut I warn you beforehand that as Jack is the easiest ridden horse in\r\nthe country, and can scramble over anything, and never came down in\r\nhis life, you won\'t get any honour and glory; but on Jemima you might\r\nmake a character that would stick to you till your dying day."\r\n\r\n"But if I ride Jemima that dying day might be to-morrow. I think I\'ll\r\ntake Jack, Lord Rufford, and let Major Caneback have the honour. Is\r\nJack fast?" In this way the anger arising between the Senator and the\r\nMajor was assuaged. The Senator still held his own, and, before the\r\nquestion was settled between Jack and Jemima, had told the company\r\nthat no Englishman knew how to ride, and that the only seat fit for a\r\nman on horseback was that suited for the pacing horses of California\r\nand Mexico. Then he assured Sir John Purefoy that eighty miles a\r\nday was no great journey for a pacing horse, with a man of fourteen\r\nstone and a saddle and accoutrements weighing four more. The Major\'s\r\ncountenance, when the Senator declared that no Englishman could ride,\r\nwas a sight worth seeing.\r\n\r\nThat evening, even in the drawing-room, the conversation was chiefly\r\nabout horses and hunting, and those terrible enemies Goarly and\r\nScrobby. Lady Penwether and Miss Penge who didn\'t hunt were distantly\r\ncivil to Lady Augustus of whom of course a woman so much in the world\r\nas Lady Penwether knew something. Lady Penwether had shrugged her\r\nshoulders when consulted as to these special guests and had expressed\r\na hope that Rufford "wasn\'t going to make a goose of himself." But\r\nshe was fond of her brother and as both Lady Purefoy and Miss Penge\r\nwere special friends of hers, and as she had also been allowed to\r\ninvite a couple of Godolphin\'s girls to whom she wished to be civil,\r\nshe did as she was asked. The girl, she said to Miss Penge that\r\nevening, was handsome, but penniless and a flirt. The mother she\r\ndeclared to be a regular old soldier. As to Lady Augustus she was\r\nright; but she had perhaps failed to read Arabella\'s character\r\ncorrectly. Arabella Trefoil was certainly not a flirt. In all the\r\nhorsey conversation Arabella joined, and her low, clear, slow voice\r\ncould be heard now and then as though she were really animated\r\nwith the subject. At Bragton she had never once spoken as though\r\nany matter had interested her. During this time Morton fell into\r\nconversation first with Lady Purefoy and then with the two Miss\r\nGodolphins, and afterwards for a few minutes with Lady Penwether\r\nwho knew that he was a county gentleman and a respectable member of\r\nthe diplomatic profession. But during the whole evening his ear was\r\nintent on the notes of Arabella\'s voice; and also, during the whole\r\nevening, her eye was watching him. She would not lose her chance with\r\nLord Rufford for want of any effort on her own part. If aught were\r\nrequired from her in her present task that might be offensive to Mr.\r\nMorton,--anything that was peremptorily demanded for the effort,--she\r\nwould not scruple to offend the man. But if it might be done without\r\noffence, so much the better. Once he came across the room and said a\r\nword to her as she was talking to Lord Rufford and the Purefoys. "You\r\nare really in earnest about riding to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes. Why shouldn\'t I be in earnest?"\r\n\r\n"You are coming out yourself I hope," said the Lord.\r\n\r\n"I have no horses here of my own, but I have told that man Stubbings\r\nto send me something, and as I haven\'t been at Bragton for the last\r\nseven years I have nothing proper to wear. I shan\'t be called a\r\nGoarlyite I hope if I appear in trowsers."\r\n\r\n"Not unless you have a basket of red herrings on your arm," said Lord\r\nRufford. Then Morton retired back to the Miss Godolphins finding that\r\nhe had nothing more to say to Arabella.\r\n\r\nHe was very angry,--though he hardly knew why or with whom. A girl\r\nwhen she is engaged is not supposed to talk to no one but her\r\nrecognised lover in a mixed party of ladies and gentlemen, and she\r\nis especially absolved from such a duty when they chance to meet in\r\nthe house of a comparative stranger. In such a house and among such\r\npeople it was natural that the talk should be about hunting, and as\r\nthe girl had accepted the loan of a horse it was natural that she\r\nshould join in such conversation. She had never sat for a moment\r\napart with Lord Rufford. It was impossible to say that she had\r\nflirted with the man,--and yet Morton felt that he was neglected,\r\nand felt also that he was only there because this pleasure-seeking\r\nyoung Lord had liked to have in his house the handsome girl whom he,\r\nMorton, intended to marry. He felt thoroughly ashamed of being there\r\nas it were in the train of Miss Trefoil. He was almost disposed to\r\nget up and declare that the girl was engaged to marry him. He thought\r\nthat he could put an end to the engagement without breaking his\r\nheart;--but if the engagement was an engagement he could not submit\r\nto treatment such as this, either from her or from others. He\r\nwould see her for the last time in the country at the ball on the\r\nfollowing evening,--as of course he would not be near her during the\r\nhunting,--and then he would make her understand that she must be\r\naltogether his or altogether cease to be his. And so resolving he\r\nwent to bed, refusing to join the gentlemen in the smoking-room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma," Arabella said to her mother that evening, "I do so wish\r\nI could break my arm to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Break your arm, my dear!"\r\n\r\n"Or my leg would be better. I wish I could have the courage to chuck\r\nmyself off going over some gate. If I could be laid up here now with\r\na broken limb I really think I could do it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nJEMIMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the meet on the next morning was in the park the party at Rufford\r\nHall was able to enjoy the luxury of an easy morning together with\r\nthe pleasures of the field. There was no getting up at eight o\'clock,\r\nno hurry and scurry to do twenty miles and yet be in time, no\r\nnecessity for the tardy dressers to swallow their breakfasts while\r\ntheir more energetic companions were raving at them for compromising\r\nthe chances of the day by their delay. There was a public breakfast\r\ndown-stairs, at which all the hunting farmers of the country were to\r\nbe seen, and some who only pretended to be hunting farmers on such\r\noccasions. But up-stairs there was a private breakfast for the ladies\r\nand such of the gentlemen as preferred tea to champagne and cherry\r\nbrandy. Lord Rufford was in and out of both rooms, making himself\r\ngenerally agreeable. In the public room there was a great deal\r\nsaid about Goarly, to all of which the Senator listened with eager\r\nears,--for the Senator preferred the public breakfast as offering\r\nanother institution to his notice. "He\'ll swing on a gallows afore\r\nhe\'s dead," said one energetic farmer who was sitting next to Mr.\r\nGotobed,--a fat man with a round head, and a bullock\'s neck, dressed\r\nin a black coat with breeches and top-boots. John Runce was not a\r\nriding man. He was too heavy and short-winded;--too fond of his beer\r\nand port wine; but he was a hunting man all over, one who always had\r\na fox in the springs at the bottom of his big meadows, one to whom it\r\nwas the very breath of his nostrils to shake hands with the hunting\r\ngentry and to be known as a staunch friend to the U. R. U. A man did\r\nnot live in the county more respected than John Runce, or who was\r\nbetter able to pay his way. To his thinking an animal more injurious\r\nthan Goarly to the best interests of civilisation could not have been\r\nproduced by all the evil influences of the world combined. "Do you\r\nreally think," said the Senator calmly, "that a man should be hanged\r\nfor killing a fox?" John Runce, who was not very ready, turned round\r\nand stared at him. "I haven\'t heard of any other harm that he has\r\ndone, and perhaps he had some provocation for that." Words were\r\nwanting to Mr. Runce, but not indignation. He collected together his\r\nplate and knife and fork and his two glasses and his lump of bread,\r\nand, looking the Senator full in the face, slowly pushed back his\r\nchair and, carrying his provisions with him, toddled off to the other\r\nend of the room. When he reached a spot where place was made for him\r\nhe had hardly breath left to speak. "Well," he said, "I never--!" He\r\nsat a minute in silence shaking his head, and continued to shake his\r\nhead and look round upon his neighbours as he devoured his food.\r\n\r\nUp-stairs there was a very cosy party who came in by degrees. Lady\r\nPenwether was there soon after ten with Miss Penge and some of the\r\ngentlemen, including Morton, who was the only man seen in that room\r\nin black. Young Hampton, who was intimate in the house, made his\r\nway up there and Sir John Purefoy joined the party. Sir John was a\r\nhunting man who lived in the county and was an old friend of the\r\nfamily. Lady Purefoy hunted also, and came in later. Arabella was the\r\nlast,--not from laziness, but aware that in this way the effect might\r\nbe the best. Lord Rufford was in the room when she entered it and\r\nof course she addressed herself to him. "Which is it to be, Lord\r\nRufford, Jack or Jemima?"\r\n\r\n"Which ever you like."\r\n\r\n"I am quite indifferent. If you\'ll put me on the mare I\'ll ride\r\nher,--or try."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you won\'t," said Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\n"Mamma knows nothing about it, Lord Rufford. I believe I could do\r\njust as well as Major Caneback."\r\n\r\n"She never had a lady on her in her life," said Sir John.\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s time for her to begin. But at any rate I must have some\r\nbreakfast first." Then Lord Rufford brought her a cup of tea and Sir\r\nJohn gave her a cutlet, and she felt herself to be happy. She was\r\nquite content with her hat, and though her habit was not exactly a\r\nhunting habit, it fitted her well. Morton had never before seen her\r\nin a riding dress and acknowledged that it became her. He struggled\r\nto think of something special to say to her, but there was nothing.\r\nHe was not at home on such an occasion. His long trowsers weighed him\r\ndown, and his ordinary morning coat cowed him. He knew in his heart\r\nthat she thought nothing of him as he was now. But she said a word to\r\nhim,--with that usual smile of hers. "Of course, Mr. Morton, you are\r\ncoming with us."\r\n\r\n"A little way perhaps."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find that any horse from Stubbings can go," said Lord\r\nRufford. "I wish I could say as much of all mine."\r\n\r\n"Jack can go, I hope, Lord Rufford." Lord Rufford nodded his head.\r\n"And I shall expect you to give me a lead." To this he assented,\r\nthough it was perhaps more than he had intended. But on such an\r\noccasion it is almost impossible to refuse such a request.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven they were all out in the park, and Tony was elate\r\nas a prince having been regaled with a tumbler of champagne. But the\r\ngreat interest of the immediate moment were the frantic efforts made\r\nby Jemima to get rid of her rider. Once or twice Sir John asked the\r\nMajor to give it up, but the Major swore that the mare was a good\r\nmare and only wanted riding. She kicked and squealed and backed and\r\nwent round the park with him at a full gallop. In the park there was\r\na rail with a ha-ha ditch, and the Major rode her at it in a gallop.\r\nShe went through the timber, fell in the ditch, and then was brought\r\nup again without giving the man a fall. He at once put her back\r\nat the same fence, and she took it, almost in her stride, without\r\ntouching it. "Have her like a spaniel before the day\'s over," said\r\nthe Major, who thoroughly enjoyed these little encounters.\r\n\r\nAmong the laurels at the bottom of the park a fox was found, and then\r\nthere was a great deal of riding about the grounds. All this was\r\nmuch enjoyed by the ladies who were on foot,--and by the Senator who\r\nwandered about the place alone. A gentleman\'s park is not always\r\nthe happiest place for finding a fox. The animal has usually many\r\nresources there and does not like to leave it. And when he does go\r\naway it is not always easy to get after him. But ladies in a carriage\r\nor on foot on such occasions have their turn of the sport. On this\r\noccasion it was nearly one before the fox allowed himself to be\r\nkilled, and then he had hardly been outside the park palings. There\r\nwas a good deal of sherry drank before the party got away and hunting\r\nmen such as Major Caneback began to think that the day was to be\r\nthrown away. As they started off for Shugborough Springs, the little\r\ncovert on John Runce\'s farm which was about four miles from Rufford\r\nHall, Sir John asked the Major to get on another animal. "You\'ve had\r\ntrouble enough with her for one day, and given her enough to do." But\r\nthe Major was not of that way of thinking. "Let her have the day\'s\r\nwork," said the Major. "Do her good. Remember what she\'s learned."\r\nAnd so they trotted off to Shugborough.\r\n\r\nWhile they were riding about the park Morton had kept near to Miss\r\nTrefoil. Lord Rufford, being on his own place and among his own\r\ncoverts, had had cares on his hand and been unable to devote himself\r\nto the young lady. She had never for a moment looked up at her lover,\r\nor tried to escape from him. She had answered all his questions,\r\nsaying, however, very little, and had bided her time. The more\r\ngracious she was to Morton now the less ground would he have for\r\ncomplaining of her when she should leave him by-and-by. As they were\r\ntrotting along the road Lord Rufford came up and apologized. "I\'m\r\nafraid I\'ve been very inattentive, Miss Trefoil; but I dare say\r\nyou\'ve been in better hands."\r\n\r\n"There hasn\'t been much to do,--has there?"\r\n\r\n"Very little. I suppose a man isn\'t responsible for having foxes that\r\nwon\'t break. Did you see the Senator? He seemed to think it was all\r\nright. Did you hear of John Runce?" Then he told the story of John\r\nRunce, which had been told to him.\r\n\r\n"What a fine old fellow! I should forgive him his rent."\r\n\r\n"He is much better able to pay me double. Your Senator, Mr. Morton,\r\nis a very peculiar man."\r\n\r\n"He is peculiar," said Morton, "and I am sorry to say can make\r\nhimself very disagreeable."\r\n\r\n"We might as well trot on as Shugborough is a small place, and a fox\r\nalways goes away from it at once. John Runce knows how to train them\r\nbetter than I do." Then they made their way on through the straggling\r\nhorses, and John Morton, not wishing to seem to be afraid of his\r\nrival, remained alone. "I wish Caneback had left that mare behind,"\r\nsaid the lord as they went. "It isn\'t the country for her, and she is\r\ngoing very nastily with him. Are you fond of hunting, Miss Trefoil?"\r\n\r\n"Very fond of it," said Arabella who had been out two or three times\r\nin her life.\r\n\r\n"I like a girl to ride to hounds," said his lordship. "I don\'t think\r\nshe ever looks so well." Then Arabella determined that come what\r\nmight she would ride to hounds.\r\n\r\nAt Shugborough Springs a fox was found before half the field was up,\r\nand he broke almost as soon as he was found. "Follow me through the\r\nhandgates," said the lord, "and from the third field out it\'s fair\r\nriding. Let him have his head, and remember he hangs a moment as he\r\ncomes to his fence. You won\'t be left behind unless there\'s something\r\nout of the way to stop us." Arabella\'s heart was in her mouth, but\r\nshe was quite resolved. Where he went she would follow. As for being\r\nleft behind she would not care the least for that if he were left\r\nbehind with her. They got well away, having to pause a moment while\r\nthe hounds came up to Tony\'s horn out of the wood. Then there was\r\nplain sailing and there were very few before them. "He\'s one of the\r\nold sort, my lord," said Tony as he pressed on, speaking of the fox.\r\n"Not too near me, and you\'ll go like a bird," said his lordship.\r\n"He\'s a nice little horse, isn\'t he? When I\'m going to be married,\r\nhe\'ll be the first present I shall make her."\r\n\r\n"He\'d tempt almost any girl," said Arabella.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful how well she went, knowing so little about it as she\r\ndid. The horse was one easily ridden, and on plain ground she knew\r\nwhat she was about in a saddle. At any rate she did not disgrace\r\nherself and when they had already run some three or four miles Lord\r\nRufford had nearly the best of it and she had kept with him. "You\r\ndon\'t know where you are I suppose," he said when they came to a\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t in the least care, if they\'d only go on," said she\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n"We\'re back at Rufford Park. We\'ve left the road nearly a mile to our\r\nleft, but there we are. Those trees are the park."\r\n\r\n"But must we stop there?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s as the fox may choose to behave. We shan\'t stop unless he\r\ndoes." Then young Hampton came up, declaring that there was the very\r\nmischief going on between Major Caneback and Jemima. According to\r\nHampton\'s account, the Major had been down three or four times, but\r\nwas determined to break either the mare\'s neck or her spirit. He had\r\nbeen considerably hurt, so Hampton said, in one shoulder, but had\r\ninsisted on riding on. "That\'s the worst of him," said Lord Rufford.\r\n"He never knows when to give up."\r\n\r\nThen the hounds were again on the scent and were running very fast\r\ntowards the park. "That\'s a nasty ditch before us," said the Lord.\r\n"Come down a little to the left. The hounds are heading that way, and\r\nthere\'s a gate." Young Hampton in the meantime was going straight for\r\nthe fence.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid," said Arabella.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Give him his head and he\'ll do it."\r\n\r\nJust at that moment there was a noise behind them and the Major on\r\nJemima rushed up. She was covered with foam and he with dirt, and\r\nher sides were sliced with the spur. His hat was crushed, and he\r\nwas riding almost altogether with his right hand. He came close to\r\nArabella and she could see the rage in his face as the animal rushed\r\non with her head almost between her knees. "He\'ll have another fall\r\nthere," said Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\nHampton who had passed them was the first over the fence, and the\r\nother three all took it abreast. The Major was to the right, the lord\r\nto the left and the girl between them. The mare\'s head was perhaps\r\nthe first. She rushed at the fence, made no leap at all, and of\r\ncourse went headlong into the ditch. The Major still stuck to her\r\nthough two or three voices implored him to get off. He afterwards\r\ndeclared that he had not strength to lift himself out of the saddle.\r\nThe mare lay for a moment;--then blundered out, rolled over him,\r\njumped on to her feet, and lunging out kicked her rider on the\r\nhead as he was rising. Then she went away and afterwards jumped the\r\npalings into Rufford Park. That evening she was shot.\r\n\r\nThe man when kicked had fallen back close under the feet of Miss\r\nTrefoil\'s horse. She screamed and half-fainting, fell also;--but fell\r\nwithout hurting herself. Lord Rufford of course stopped, as did also\r\nMr. Hampton and one of the whips,--with several others in the course\r\nof a minute or two. The Major was senseless,--but they who understood\r\nwhat they were looking at were afraid that the case was very bad. He\r\nwas picked up and put on a door and within half an hour was on his\r\nbed in Rufford Hall. But he did not speak for some hours and before\r\nsix o\'clock that evening the doctor from Rufford had declared that he\r\nhad mounted his last horse and ridden his last hunt!\r\n\r\n"Oh Lord Rufford," said Arabella, "I shall never recover that. I\r\nheard the horse\'s feet against his head." Lord Rufford shuddered and\r\nput his hand round her waist to support her. At that time they were\r\nstanding on the ground. "Don\'t mind me if you can do any good to\r\nhim." But there was nothing that Lord Rufford could do as four men\r\nwere carrying the Major on a shutter. So he and Arabella returned\r\ntogether, and when she got off her horse she was only able to throw\r\nherself into his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nPOOR CANEBACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA closer intimacy will occasionally be created by some accident, some\r\nfortuitous circumstance, than weeks of ordinary intercourse will\r\nproduce. Walk down Bond Street in a hailstorm of peculiar severity\r\nand you may make a friend of the first person you meet, whereas you\r\nwould be held to have committed an affront were you to speak to\r\nthe same person in the same place on a fine day. You shall travel\r\nsmoothly to York with a lady and she will look as though she would\r\ncall the guard at once were you so much as to suggest that it were\r\na fine day; but if you are lucky enough to break a wheel before you\r\nget to Darlington, she will have told you all her history and shared\r\nyour sherry by the time you have reached that town. Arabella was\r\nvery much shocked by the dreadful accident she had seen. Her nerves\r\nhad suffered, though it may be doubted whether her heart had been\r\naffected much. But she was quite conscious when she reached her room\r\nthat the poor Major\'s misfortune, happening as it had done just\r\nbeneath her horse\'s feet, had been a godsend to her. For a moment the\r\nyoung lord\'s arm had been round her waist and her head had been upon\r\nhis shoulder. And again when she had slipped from her saddle she had\r\nfelt his embrace. His fervour to her had been simply the uncontrolled\r\nexpression of his feeling at the moment,--as one man squeezes another\r\ntightly by the hand in any crisis of sudden impulse. She knew\r\nthis;--but she knew also that he would probably revert to the\r\nintimacy which the sudden emotion had created. The mutual galvanic\r\nshock might be continued at the next meeting,--and so on. They had\r\nseen the tragedy together and it would not fail to be a bond of\r\nunion. As she told the tragedy to her mother, she delicately laid\r\naside her hat and whip and riding dress, and then asked whether it\r\nwas not possible that they might prolong their stay at Rufford. "But\r\nthe Gores, my dear! I put them off, you know, for two days only."\r\nThen Arabella declared that she did not care a straw for the Gores.\r\nIn such a matter as this what would it signify though they should\r\nquarrel with a whole generation of Gores? For some time she thought\r\nthat she would not come down again that afternoon or even that\r\nevening. It might well be that the sight of the accident should have\r\nmade her too ill to appear. She felt conscious that in that moment\r\nand in the subsequent half hour she had carried herself well, and\r\nthat there would be an interest about her were she to own herself\r\ncompelled to keep her room. Were she now to take to her bed they\r\ncould not turn her out on the following day. But at last her mother\'s\r\ncounsel put an end to that plan. Time was too precious. "I think you\r\nmight lose more than you\'d gain," said her mother.\r\n\r\nBoth Lord Rufford and his sister were very much disturbed as to what\r\nthey should do on the occasion. At half-past six Lord Rufford was\r\ntold that the Major had recovered his senses, but that the case was\r\nalmost hopeless. Of course he saw his guest. "I\'m all right," said\r\nthe Major. The Lord sat there by the bedside, holding the man\'s hand\r\nfor a few moments, and then got up to leave him. "No nonsense about\r\nputting off," said the Major in a faint voice; "beastly bosh all\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\nBut what was to be done? The dozen people who were in the house must\r\nof course sit down to dinner. And then all the neighbourhood for\r\nmiles round were coming to a ball. It would be impossible to send\r\nmessages to everybody. And there was the feeling too that the man was\r\nas yet only ill, and that his recovery was possible. A ball, with a\r\ndead man in one of the bedrooms, would be dreadful. With a dying man\r\nit was bad enough;--but then a dying man is always also a living man!\r\nLord Rufford had already telegraphed for a first-class surgeon from\r\nLondon, it having been whispered to him that perhaps Old Nokes from\r\nRufford might be mistaken. The surgeon could not be there till four\r\no\'clock in the morning by which time care would have been taken to\r\nremove the signs of the ball; but if there was reason to send for a\r\nLondon surgeon, then also was there reason for hope;--and if there\r\nwere ground for hope, then the desirability of putting off the ball\r\nwas very much reduced. "He\'s at the furthest end of the corridor,"\r\nthe Lord said to his sister, "and won\'t hear a sound of the music."\r\n\r\nThough the man were to die why shouldn\'t the people dance? Had the\r\nMajor been dying three or four miles off, at the hotel at Rufford,\r\nthere would only have been a few sad looks, a few shakings of the\r\nhead, and the people would have danced without any flaw in their\r\ngaiety. Had it been known at Rufford Hall that he was lying at that\r\nmoment in his mortal agony at Aberdeen, an exclamation or two,--"Poor\r\nCaneback!"--"poor Major!"--would have been the extent of the wailing,\r\nand not the pressure of a lover\'s hand would have been lightened, or\r\nthe note of a fiddle delayed. And nobody in that house really cared\r\nmuch for Caneback. He was not a man worthy of much care. He was\r\npossessed of infinite pluck, and now that he was dying could bear it\r\nwell. But he had loved no one particularly, had been dear to no one\r\nin these latter days of his life, had been of very little use in\r\nthe world, and had done very little more for society than any other\r\nhorse-trainer! But nevertheless it is a bore when a gentleman dies in\r\nyour house,--and a worse bore if he dies from an accident than from\r\nan illness for which his own body may be supposed to be responsible.\r\nThough the gout should fly to a man\'s stomach in your best bedroom,\r\nthe idea never strikes you that your burgundy has done it! But here\r\nthe mare had done the mischief.\r\n\r\nPoor Caneback;--and poor Lord Rufford! The Major was quite certain\r\nthat it was all over with himself. He had broken so many of his bones\r\nand had his head so often cracked that he understood his own anatomy\r\npretty well. There he lay quiet and composed, sipping small modicums\r\nof brandy and water, and taking his outlook into such transtygian\r\nworld as he had fashioned for himself in his dull imagination. If he\r\nhad misgivings he showed them to no bystander. If he thought then\r\nthat he might have done better with his energies than devote them to\r\ndangerous horses, he never said so. His voice was weak, but it never\r\nquailed; and the only regret he expressed was that he had not changed\r\nthe bit in Jemima\'s mouth. Lord Rufford\'s position was made worse by\r\nan expression from Sir John Purefoy that the party ought to be put\r\noff. Sir John was in a measure responsible for what his mare had\r\ndone, and was in a wretched state. "If it could possibly affect the\r\npoor fellow I would do it," said Lord Rufford; "but it would create\r\nvery great inconvenience and disappointment. I have to think of other\r\npeople." "Then I shall send my wife home," said Sir John. And Lady\r\nPurefoy was sent home. Sir John himself of course could not leave the\r\nhouse while the man was alive. Before they all sat down to dinner the\r\nMajor was declared to be a little stronger. That settled the question\r\nand the ball was not put off.\r\n\r\nThe ladies came down to dinner in a melancholy guise. They were not\r\nfully dressed for the evening and were of course inclined to be\r\nsilent and sad. Before Lord Rufford came in Arabella managed to get\r\nherself on to the sofa next to Lady Penwether, and then to undergo\r\nsome little hysterical manifestation, "Oh Lady Penwether; if you had\r\nseen it;--and heard it!"\r\n\r\n"I am very glad that I was spared anything so horrible."\r\n\r\n"And the man\'s face as he passed me going to the leap! It will haunt\r\nme to my dying day!" Then she shivered, and gurgled in her throat,\r\nand turning suddenly round, hid her face on the elbow of the couch.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been afraid all the afternoon that she would be ill," whispered\r\nLady Augustus to Miss Penge. "She is so susceptible!"\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Rufford came into the room Arabella at once got up and\r\naccosted him with a whisper. Either he took her or she took him\r\ninto a distant part of the room where they conversed apart for five\r\nminutes. And he, as he told her how things were going and what was\r\nbeing done, bent over her and whispered also. "What good would it\r\ndo, you know?" she said with affected intimacy as he spoke of his\r\ndifficulty about the ball. "One would do anything if one could be\r\nof service,--but that would do nothing." She felt completely that\r\nher presence at the accident had given her a right to have peculiar\r\nconversations and to be consulted about everything. Of course she was\r\nvery sorry for Major Caneback. But as it had been ordained that Major\r\nCaneback was to have his head split in two by a kick from a horse,\r\nand that Lord Rufford was to be there to see it, how great had been\r\nthe blessing which had brought her to the spot at the same time!\r\n\r\nEverybody there saw the intimacy and most of them understood the way\r\nin which it was being used. "That girl is very clever, Rufford," his\r\nsister whispered to him before dinner. "She is very much excited\r\nrather than clever just at present," he answered;--upon which Lady\r\nPenwether shook her head. Miss Penge whispered to Miss Godolphin\r\nthat Miss Trefoil was making the most of it; and Mr. Morton, who had\r\ncome into the room while the conversation apart was going on, had\r\ncertainly been of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nShe had seated herself in an arm-chair away from the others after\r\nthat conversation was over, and as she sat there Morton came up to\r\nher. He had been so little intimate with the members of the party\r\nassembled and had found himself so much alone, that he had only\r\nlately heard the story about Major Caneback, and had now only\r\nheard it imperfectly. But he did see that an absolute intimacy had\r\nbeen effected where two days before there had only been a slight\r\nacquaintance; and he believed that this sudden rush had been in some\r\nway due to the accident of which he had been told. "You know what has\r\nhappened?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Morton; do not talk to me about it!"\r\n\r\n"Were you not speaking of it to Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I was. We were together."\r\n\r\n"Did you see it?" Then she shuddered, put her handkerchief up to her\r\neyes, and turned her face away. "And yet the ball is to go on?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Pray, pray, do not dwell on it,--unless you wish to force me back to\r\nmy room. When I left it I felt that I was attempting to do too much."\r\nThis might have been all very well had she not been so manifestly\r\nable to talk to Lord Rufford on the same subject. If there is any\r\nyoung man to whom a girl should be able to speak when she is in a\r\nstate of violent emotion, it is the young man to whom she is engaged.\r\nSo at least thought Mr. John Morton.\r\n\r\nThen dinner was announced, and the dinner certainly was sombre\r\nenough. A dinner before a ball in the country never is very much\r\nof a dinner. The ladies know that there is work before them, and\r\nkeep themselves for the greater occasion. Lady Purefoy had gone,\r\nand Lady Penwether was not very happy in the prospects for the\r\nevening. Neither Miss Penge nor either of the two Miss Godolphins\r\nhad entertained personal hopes in regard to Lord Rufford, but\r\nnevertheless they took badly the great favour shown to Arabella.\r\nLady Augustus did not get on particularly well with any of the\r\nother ladies,--and there seemed during the dinner to be an air of\r\nunhappiness over them all. They retired as soon as it was possible,\r\nand then Arabella at once went up to her bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Nokes says he is a little stronger, my Lord," said the butler\r\ncoming into the room. Mr. Nokes had gone home and had returned again.\r\n\r\n"He might pull through yet," said Mr. Hampton. Lord Rufford shook his\r\nhead. Then Mr. Gotobed told a wonderful story of an American who had\r\nhad his brains knocked almost out of his head and had sat in Congress\r\nafterwards. "He was the finest horseman I ever saw on a horse," said\r\nHampton.\r\n\r\n"A little too much temper," said Captain Battersby, who was a very\r\nold friend of the Major.\r\n\r\n"I\'d give a good deal that that mare had never been brought to my\r\nstables," said Lord Rufford. "Purefoy will never get over it, and\r\nI shan\'t forget it in a hurry." Sir John at this time was up-stairs\r\nwith the sufferer. Even while drinking their wine they could not\r\nkeep themselves from the subject, and were convivial in a cadaverous\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people came of course, but not in such numbers as had been\r\nexpected. Many of those in Rufford had heard of the accident, and\r\nhaving been made acquainted with Nokes\'s report, stayed away.\r\nEverybody was told that supper would be on the table at twelve, and\r\nthat it was generally understood that the house was to be cleared\r\nby two. Nokes seemed to think that the sufferer would live at least\r\ntill the morrow, and it was ascertained to a certainty that the music\r\ncould not affect him. It was agreed among the party in the house that\r\nthe ladies staying there should stand up for the first dance or two,\r\nas otherwise the strangers would be discouraged and the whole thing\r\nwould be a failure. This request was made by Lady Penwether because\r\nMiss Penge had said that she thought it impossible for her to dance.\r\nPoor Miss Penge, who was generally regarded as a brilliant young\r\nwoman, had been a good deal eclipsed by Arabella and had seen the\r\nnecessity of striking out some line for herself. Then Arabella had\r\nwhispered a few words to Lord Rufford, and the lord had whispered\r\na few words to his sister, and Lady Penwether had explained what\r\nwas to be done to the ladies around. Lady Augustus nodded her head\r\nand said that it was all right. The other ladies of course agreed,\r\nand partners were selected within the house party. Lord Rufford\r\nstood up with Arabella and John Morton with Lady Penwether. Mr.\r\nGotobed selected Miss Penge, and Hampton and Battersby the two\r\nMiss Godolphins. They all took their places with a lugubrious but\r\nbusiness-like air, as aware that they were sacrificing themselves\r\nin the performance of a sad duty. But Morton was not allowed to\r\ndance in the same quadrille with the lady of his affections. Lady\r\nPenwether explained to him that she and her brother had better divide\r\nthemselves,--for the good of the company generally,--and therefore he\r\nand Arabella were also divided.\r\n\r\nA rumour had reached Lady Penwether of the truth in regard to their\r\nguests from Bragton. Mr. Gotobed had whispered to her that he had\r\nunderstood that they certainly were engaged; and, even before that,\r\nthe names of the two lovers had been wafted to her ears from the\r\nother side of the Atlantic. Both John Morton and Lady Augustus were\r\n"somebodies," and Lady Penwether generally knew what there was to\r\nbe known of anybody who was anybody. But it was quite clear to\r\nher,--more so even than to poor John Morton,--that the lady was\r\nconducting herself now as though she were fettered by no bonds, and\r\nit seemed to Lady Penwether also that the lady was very anxious to\r\ncontract other bonds. She knew her brother well. He was always in\r\nlove with somebody; but as he had hitherto failed of success where\r\nmarriage was desirable, so had he avoided disaster when it was not.\r\nHe was one of those men who are generally supposed to be averse to\r\nmatrimony. Lady Penwether and some other relatives were anxious that\r\nhe should take a wife;--but his sister was by no means anxious that\r\nhe should take such a one as Arabella Trefoil. Therefore she thought\r\nthat she might judiciously ask Mr. Morton a few questions. "I believe\r\nyou knew the Trefoils in Washington?" she said. Morton acknowledged\r\nthat he had seen much of them there. "She is very handsome,\r\ncertainly."\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"And rides well I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I never heard much of her riding."\r\n\r\n"Has she been staying long at Bragton?"\r\n\r\n"Just a week."\r\n\r\n"Do you know Lord Augustus?" Morton said that he did not know Lord\r\nAugustus and then answered sundry other questions of the same nature\r\nin the same uncommunicative way. Though he had once or twice almost\r\nfancied that he would like to proclaim aloud that the girl was\r\nengaged to him, yet he did not like to have the fact pumped out of\r\nhim. And if she were such a girl as she now appeared to be, might\r\nit not be better for him to let her go? Surely her conduct here at\r\nRufford Hall was opportunity enough. No doubt she was handsome. No\r\ndoubt he loved her,--after his fashion of loving. But to lose her\r\nnow would not break his heart, whereas to lose her after he was\r\nmarried to her, would, he knew well, bring him to the very ground.\r\nHe would ask her a question or two this very night, and then come to\r\nsome resolution. With such thoughts as these crossing his mind he\r\ncertainly was not going to proclaim his engagement to Lady Penwether.\r\nBut Lady Penwether was a determined woman. Her smile, when she\r\ncondescended to smile, was very sweet,--lighting up her whole face\r\nand flattering for the moment the person on whom it shone. It was as\r\nthough a rose in emitting its perfume could confine itself to the\r\nnostrils of its one favoured friend. And now she smiled on Morton\r\nas she asked another question. "I did hear," she said, "from one of\r\nyour Foreign Office young men that you and Miss Trefoil were very\r\nintimate."\r\n\r\n"Who was that, Lady Penwether?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall mention no name. You might call out the poor lad\r\nand shoot him, or, worse still, have him put down to the bottom of\r\nhis class. But I did hear it. And then, when I find her staying with\r\nher mother at your house, of course I believe it to be true."\r\n\r\n"Now she is staying at your brother\'s house,--which is much the same\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"But I am here."\r\n\r\n"And my grandmother is at Bragton."\r\n\r\n"That puts me in mind, Mr. Morton. I am so sorry that we did not know\r\nit, so that we might have asked her."\r\n\r\n"She never goes out anywhere, Lady Penwether."\r\n\r\n"And there is nothing then in the report that I heard?"\r\n\r\nMorton paused a moment before he answered, and during that moment\r\ncollected his diplomatic resources. He was not a weak man, who could\r\nbe made to tell anything by the wiles of a pretty woman. "I think,"\r\nhe said, "that when people have anything of that kind which they wish\r\nto be known, they declare it."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon. I did not mean to unravel a secret."\r\n\r\n"There are secrets, Lady Penwether, which people do like to unravel,\r\nbut which the owners of them sometimes won\'t abandon." Then there was\r\nnothing more said on the subject. Lady Penwether did not smile again,\r\nand left him to go about the room on her business as hostess, as soon\r\nas the dance was over. But she was sure that they were engaged.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the conversation between Lord Rufford and Arabella\r\nwas very different in its tone, though on the same subject. He was\r\ncertainly very much struck with her, not probably ever waiting to\r\ndeclare to himself that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever\r\nseen in his life, but still feeling towards her an attraction which\r\nfor the time was strong. A very clever girl would frighten him; a\r\nvery horsey girl would disgust him; a very quiet girl would bore him;\r\nor a very noisy girl annoy him. With a shy girl he could never be\r\nat his ease, not enjoying the labour of overcoming such a barrier;\r\nand yet he liked to be able to feel that any female intimacy which\r\nhe admitted was due to his own choice and not to that of the young\r\nwoman. Arabella Trefoil was not very clever, but she had given\r\nall her mind to this peculiar phase of life, and, to use a common\r\nphrase, knew what she was about. She was quite alive to the fact that\r\ndifferent men require different manners in a young woman; and as she\r\nhad adapted herself to Mr. Morton at Washington, so could she at\r\nRufford adapt herself to Lord Rufford. At the present moment the lord\r\nwas in love with her as much as he was wont to be in love. "Doesn\'t\r\nit seem an immense time since we came here yesterday?" she said to\r\nhim. "There has been so much done."\r\n\r\n"There has been a great misfortune."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that is it. Only for that how very very pleasant it would\r\nhave been!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. It was a nice run, and that little horse carried you\r\ncharmingly. I wish I could see you ride him again." She shook her\r\nhead as she looked up into his face. "Why do you shake your head?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am afraid there is no possible chance of such happiness.\r\nWe are going to such a dull house to-morrow! And then to so many dull\r\nhouses afterwards."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you shouldn\'t come back and have another day or\r\ntwo;--when all this sadness has gone by."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk about it, Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I never like to talk about any pleasure because it always vanishes\r\nas soon as it has come;--and when it has been real pleasure it never\r\ncomes back again. I don\'t think I ever enjoyed anything so much as\r\nour ride this morning,--till that tragedy came."\r\n\r\n"Poor Caneback!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose there is no hope?" He shook his head. "And we must go on\r\nto those Gores to-morrow without knowing anything about it. I wonder\r\nwhether you could send me a line."\r\n\r\n"Of course I can, and I will." Then he asked her a question looking\r\ninto her face. "You are not going back to Bragton?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no."\r\n\r\n"Was Bragton dull?"\r\n\r\n"Awfully dull;--frightfully dull."\r\n\r\n"You know what they say?"\r\n\r\n"What who say, Lord Rufford? People say anything,--the more\r\nill-natured the better they like it, I think."\r\n\r\n"Have you not heard what they say about you and Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"Just because mamma made a promise when in Washington to go to\r\nBragton with that Mr. Gotobed. Don\'t you find they marry you to\r\neverybody?"\r\n\r\n"They have married me to a good many people. Perhaps they\'ll marry me\r\nto you to-morrow. That would not be so bad."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord Rufford! Nobody has ever condemned you to anything so\r\nterrible as that."\r\n\r\n"There was no truth in it then, Miss Trefoil?"\r\n\r\n"None at all, Lord Rufford. Only I don\'t know why you should ask me."\r\n\r\n"Well; I don\'t know. A man likes sometimes to be sure how the land\r\nlies. Mr. Morton looks so cross that I thought that perhaps the very\r\nfact of my dancing with you might be an offence."\r\n\r\n"Is he cross?"\r\n\r\n"You know him better than I do. Perhaps it\'s his nature. Now I must\r\ndo one other dance with a native and then my work will be over."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t very civil, Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"If you do not know what I meant, you\'re not the girl I take you to\r\nbe." Then as she walked with him back out of the ball-room into the\r\ndrawing-room she assured him that she did know what he meant, and\r\nthat therefore she was the girl he took her to be.\r\n\r\nShe had determined that she would not dance again and had resolved to\r\nherd with the other ladies of the house,--waiting for any opportunity\r\nthat chance might give her for having a last word with Lord Rufford\r\nbefore they parted for the night,--when Morton came up to her and\r\ndemanded rather than asked that she would stand up with him for a\r\nquadrille. "We settled it all among ourselves, you know," she said.\r\n"We were to dance only once, just to set the people off." He still\r\npersisted, but she still refused, alleging that she was bound by the\r\ngeneral compact; and though he was very urgent she would not yield.\r\n"I wonder how you can ask me," she said. "You don\'t suppose that\r\nafter what has occurred I can have any pleasure in dancing." Upon\r\nthis he asked her to take a turn with him through the rooms, and to\r\nthat she found herself compelled to assent. Then he spoke out to her.\r\n"Arabella," he said, "I am not quite content with what has been going\r\non since we came to this house."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that."\r\n\r\n"Nor, indeed, have I been made very happy by all that has occurred\r\nsince your mother and you did me the honour of coming to Bragton."\r\n\r\n"I must acknowledge you haven\'t seemed to be very happy, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to distress you;--and as far as possible I wish to\r\navoid distressing myself. If it is your wish that our engagement\r\nshould be over, I will endeavour to bear it. If it is to be\r\ncontinued,--I expect that your manner to me should be altered."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say?"\r\n\r\n"Say what you feel."\r\n\r\n"I feel that I can\'t alter my manner, as you call it."\r\n\r\n"You do wish the engagement to be over then?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say so. The truth is, Mr. Morton, that there is some\r\ntrouble about the lawyers."\r\n\r\n"Why do you always call me Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am aware how probable it is that all this may come to\r\nnothing. I can\'t walk out of the house and marry you as the cookmaid\r\ndoes the gardener. I\'ve got to wait till I\'m told that everything is\r\nsettled; and at present I\'m told that things are not settled because\r\nyou won\'t agree."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave it to anybody to say whether I\'ve been unreasonable."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go into that. I haven\'t meddled with it, and I don\'t know\r\nanything about it. But until it is all settled as a matter of course\r\nthere must be some little distance between us. It\'s the commonest\r\nthing in the world, I should say."\r\n\r\n"What is to be the end of it?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. If you think yourself injured you can back out of it\r\nat once. I\'ve nothing more to say about it."\r\n\r\n"And you think I can like the way you\'re going on here?"\r\n\r\n"If you\'re jealous, Mr. Morton, there\'s an end of it. I tell you\r\nfairly once for all, that as long as I\'m a single woman I will\r\nregulate my conduct as I please. You can do the same, and I shall not\r\nsay a word to you." Then she withdrew her arm from him, and, leaving\r\nhim, walked across the room and joined her mother. He went off at\r\nonce to his own room resolving that he would write to her from\r\nBragton. He had made his propositions in regard to money which he was\r\nquite aware were as liberal as was fit. If she would now fix a day\r\nfor their marriage, he would be a happy man. If she would not bring\r\nherself to do this, then he would have no alternative but to regard\r\ntheir engagement as at an end.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock the guests were nearly all gone. The Major was alive,\r\nand likely to live at least for some hours, and the Rufford people\r\ngenerally were glad that they had not put off the ball. Some of them\r\nwho were staying in the house had already gone to bed, and Lady\r\nPenwether, with Miss Penge at her side, was making her last adieux\r\nin the drawing-room. The ball-room was reached from the drawing-room,\r\nwith a vestibule between them, and opening from this was a small\r\nchamber, prettily furnished but seldom used, which had no peculiar\r\npurpose of its own, but in which during the present evening many\r\nsweet words had probably been spoken. Now, at this last moment, Lord\r\nRufford and Arabella Trefoil were there alone together. She had just\r\ngot up from a sofa, and he had taken her hand in his. She did not\r\nattempt to withdraw it, but stood looking down upon the ground. Then\r\nhe passed his arm round her waist and lifting her face to his held\r\nher in a close embrace from which she made no effort to free herself.\r\nAs soon as she was released she hastened to the door which was\r\nall but closed, and as she opened it and passed through to the\r\ndrawing-room said some ordinary word to him quite aloud in her\r\nordinary voice. If his action had disturbed her she knew very well\r\nhow to recover her equanimity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST MORNING AT RUFFORD HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well, my love?" said Lady Augustus, as soon as her daughter had\r\njoined her in her bedroom. On such occasions there was always a\r\nquarter of an hour before going to bed in which the mother and\r\ndaughter discussed their affairs, while the two lady\'s maids were\r\ndiscussing their affairs in the other room. The two maids probably\r\ndid not often quarrel, but the mother and daughter usually did.\r\n\r\n"I wish that stupid man hadn\'t got himself hurt."\r\n\r\n"Of course, my dear; we all wish that. But I really don\'t see that it\r\nhas stood much in your way."\r\n\r\n"Yes it has. After all there is nothing like dancing, and we\r\nshouldn\'t all have been sent to bed at two o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Then it has come to nothing?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say that at all, mamma. I think I have done uncommonly\r\nwell. Indeed I know I have. But then if everything had not been\r\nupset, I might have done so much better."\r\n\r\n"What have you done?" asked Lady Augustus, timidly. She knew\r\nperfectly well that her daughter would tell her nothing, and yet she\r\nalways asked these questions and was always angry when no information\r\nwas given to her. Any young woman would have found it very hard to\r\ngive the information needed. "When we were alone he sat for five\r\nminutes with his arm round my waist, and then he kissed me. He didn\'t\r\nsay much, but then I knew perfectly well that he would be on his\r\nguard not to commit himself by words. But I\'ve got him to promise\r\nthat he\'ll write to me, and of course I\'ll answer in such a way that\r\nhe must write again. I know he\'ll want to see me, and I think I can\r\ngo very near doing it. But he\'s an old stager and knows what he\'s\r\nabout: and of course there\'ll be ever so many people to tell him I\'m\r\nnot the sort of girl he ought to marry. He\'ll hear about Colonel de\r\nB----, and Sir C. D----, and Lord E. F----, and there are ever so\r\nmany chances against me. But I\'ve made up my mind to try it. It\'s\r\ntaking the long odds. I can hardly expect to win, but if I do pull\r\nit off I\'m made for ever!" A daughter can hardly say all that to her\r\nmother. Even Arabella Trefoil could not say it to her mother,--or, at\r\nany rate, she would not. "What a question that is to ask, mamma?" she\r\ndid say tossing her head.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, unless you tell me something how can I help you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I want you to help me,--at any rate not in that\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"In what way?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, you are so odd."\r\n\r\n"Has he said anything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has. He said he liked dry champagne and that he never ate\r\nsupper."\r\n\r\n"If you won\'t tell me how things are going you may fight your own\r\nbattles by yourself."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I must do. Nobody else can fight my battles for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do about Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"I saw him talking to you and looking as black as thunder."\r\n\r\n"He always looks as black as thunder."\r\n\r\n"Is that to be all off? I insist upon having an answer to that\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"I believe you fancy, mamma, that a lot of men can be played like a\r\nparcel of chessmen, and that as soon as a knight is knocked on the\r\nhead you can take him up and put him into the box and have done with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t done with Mr. Morton then?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Morton! I do feel he is badly used because he is so honest.\r\nI sometimes wish that I could afford to be honest too and to tell\r\nsomebody the downright truth. I should like to tell him the truth\r\nand I almost think I will. \'My dear fellow, I did for a time think I\r\ncouldn\'t do better, and I\'m not at all sure now that I can. But then\r\nyou are so very dull, and I\'m not certain that I should care to be\r\nQueen of the English society at the Court of the Emperor of Morocco!\r\nBut if you\'ll wait for another six months, I shall be able to tell\r\nyou.\' That\'s what I should have to say to him."\r\n\r\n"Who is talking nonsense now, Arabella?"\r\n\r\n"I am not. But I shan\'t say it. And now, mamma, I\'ll tell you what we\r\nmust do."\r\n\r\n"You must tell me why also."\r\n\r\n"I can do nothing of the kind. He knows the Duke." The Duke with the\r\nTrefoils always meant the Duke of Mayfair who was Arabella\'s ducal\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n"Intimately?"\r\n\r\n"Well enough to go there. There is to be a great shooting at\r\nMistletoe,"--Mistletoe was the duke\'s place,--"in January. I got that\r\nfrom him, and he can go if he likes. He won\'t go as it is: but if I\r\ntell him I\'m to be there, I think he will."\r\n\r\n"What did you tell him?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--I told him a tarradiddle of course. I made him understand\r\nthat I could be there if I pleased, and he thinks that I mean to be\r\nthere if he goes."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m sure the Duchess won\'t have me again."\r\n\r\n"She might let me come."\r\n\r\n"And what am I to do?"\r\n\r\n"You could go to Brighton with Miss De Groat;--or what does it matter\r\nfor a fortnight? You\'ll get the advantage when it\'s done. It\'s as\r\nwell to have the truth out at once, mamma,--I cannot carry on if I\'m\r\nalways to be stuck close to your apron-strings. There are so many\r\npeople won\'t have you."\r\n\r\n"Arabella, I do think you are the most ungrateful, hard-hearted\r\ncreature that ever lived."\r\n\r\n"Very well; I don\'t know what I have to be grateful about, and I need\r\nto be hard-hearted. Of course I am hard-hearted. The thing will be to\r\nget papa to see his brother."\r\n\r\n"Your papa!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that\'s what I mean to try. The Duke, of course, would like me\r\nto marry Lord Rufford. Do you think that if I were at home here it\r\nwouldn\'t make Mistletoe a very different sort of place for you? The\r\nDuke does like papa in a sort of way, and he\'s civil enough to me\r\nwhen I\'m there. He never did like you."\r\n\r\n"Everybody is so fond of you! It was what you did when young\r\nStranorlar was there which made the Duchess almost turn us out of the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good of your saying that, mamma? If you go on like that\r\nI\'ll separate myself from you and throw myself on papa."\r\n\r\n"Your father wouldn\'t lift his little finger for you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try at any rate. Will you consent to my going there without you\r\nif I can manage it?"\r\n\r\n"What did Lord Rufford say?" Arabella here made a grimace. "You\r\ncan tell me something. What are the lawyers to say to Mr. Morton\'s\r\npeople?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever they like."\r\n\r\n"If they come to arrangements do you mean to marry him?"\r\n\r\n"Not for the next two months certainly. I shan\'t see him again now\r\nheaven knows when. He\'ll write no doubt,--one of his awfully sensible\r\nletters, and I shall take my time about answering him. I can stretch\r\nit out for two months. If I\'m to do any good with this man it will be\r\nall arranged before that time. If the Duke could really be made to\r\nbelieve that Lord Rufford was in earnest I\'m sure he\'d have me there.\r\nAs to her, she always does what he tells her."\r\n\r\n"He is going to write to you?"\r\n\r\n"I told you that before, mamma. What is the good of asking a lot of\r\nquestions? You know now what my plan is, and if you won\'t help me\r\nI must carry it out alone. And, remember, I don\'t want to start\r\nto-morrow till after Morton and that American have gone." Then\r\nwithout a kiss or wishing her mother good night she went off to her\r\nown room.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at about nine Arabella heard from her maid that the\r\nMajor was still alive but senseless. The London surgeon had been\r\nthere and had declared it to be possible that the patient should\r\nlive,--but barely possible. At ten they were all at breakfast, and\r\nthe carriage from Bragton was already at the door to take back Mr.\r\nMorton and his American friend. Lady Augustus had been clever enough\r\nto arrange that she should have the phaeton to take her to the\r\nRufford Station a little later on in the day, and had already hinted\r\nto one of the servants that perhaps a cart might be sent with the\r\nluggage. The cart was forthcoming. Lady Augustus was very clever\r\nin arranging her locomotion and seldom paid for much more than her\r\nrailway tickets.\r\n\r\n"I had meant to say a few words to you, my lord, about that\r\nman Goarly," said the Senator, standing before the fire in the\r\nbreakfast-room, "but this sad catastrophe has stopped me."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t much to say about him, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not; only I would not wish you to think that I would oppose\r\nyou without some cause. If the man is in the wrong according to law\r\nlet him be proved to be so. The cost to you will be nothing. To him\r\nit might be of considerable importance."\r\n\r\n"Just so. Won\'t you sit down and have some breakfast? If Goarly ever\r\nmakes himself nuisance enough it may be worth my while to buy him out\r\nat three times the value of his land. But he\'ll have to be a very\r\ngreat nuisance before I shall do that. Dillsborough wood is not the\r\nonly fox covert in the county." After that there was no more said\r\nabout it; but neither did Lord Rufford understand the Senator nor\r\ndid the Senator understand Lord Rufford. John Runce had a clearer\r\nconviction on his mind than either of them. Goarly ought to be\r\nhanged, and no American should, under any circumstances be allowed to\r\nput his foot upon British soil. That was Runce\'s idea of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe parting between Morton and the Trefoils was very chill and\r\nuncomfortable. "Good-bye, Mr. Morton;--we had such a pleasant time at\r\nBragton!" said Lady Augustus. "I shall write to you this afternoon,"\r\nhe whispered to Arabella as he took her hand. She smiled and murmured\r\na word of adieu, but made him no reply. Then they were gone, and as\r\nhe got into the carriage he told himself that in all probability he\r\nwould never see her again. It might be that he would curtail his\r\nleave of absence and get back to Washington as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Trefoils did not start for an hour after this, during which\r\nArabella could hardly find an opportunity for a word in private. She\r\ncould not quite appeal to him to walk with her in the grounds, or\r\neven to take a turn with her round the empty ball-room She came down\r\ndressed for walking, thinking that so she might have the best chance\r\nof getting him for a quarter of an hour to herself, but he was either\r\ntoo wary or else the habits of his life prevented it. And in what she\r\nhad to do it was so easy to go beyond the proper line! She would wish\r\nhim to understand that she would like to be alone with him after what\r\nhad passed between them on the previous evening,--but she must be\r\ncareful not to let him imagine that she was too anxious. And then\r\nwhatever she did she had to do with so many eyes upon her! And when\r\nshe went, as she would do now in so short a time, so many hostile\r\ntongues would attack her! He had everything to protect him;--and she\r\nhad nothing, absolutely nothing, to help her! It was thus that she\r\nlooked at it; and yet she had courage for the battle. Almost at the\r\nlast moment she did get a word with him in the hall. "How is he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, better, decidedly."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad. If I could only think that he could live! Well, my\r\nLord, we have to say good-bye."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll write me a line,--about him."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"I shall be so glad to have a line from Rufford. Maddox Hall, you\r\nknow; Stafford."\r\n\r\n"I will remember."\r\n\r\n"And dear old Jack. Tell me when you write what Jack has been doing."\r\nThen she put out her hand and he held it. "I wonder whether you will\r\never remember--" But she did not quite know what to bid him remember,\r\nand therefore turned away her face and wiped away a tear, and then\r\nsmiled as she turned her back on him. The carriage was at the door,\r\nand the ladies flocked into the hall, and then not another word could\r\nbe said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I call a really nice country house," said Lady Augustus\r\nas she was driven away. Arabella sat back in the phaeton lost in\r\nthought and said nothing. "Everything so well done, and yet none of\r\nall that fuss that there is at Mistletoe." She paused but still her\r\ndaughter did not speak. "If I were beginning the world again I would\r\nnot wish for a better establishment than that. Why can\'t you answer\r\nme a word when I speak to you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s all very nice. What\'s the good of going on in that\r\nway? What a shame it is that a man like that should have so much and\r\nthat a girl like me should have nothing at all. I know twice as much\r\nas he does, and am twice as clever, and yet I\'ve got to treat him\r\nas though he were a god. He\'s all very well, but what would anybody\r\nthink of him if he were a younger brother with L300 a year." This was\r\na kind of philosophy which Lady Augustus hated. She threw herself\r\nback therefore in the phaeton and pretended to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe wheels were not out of sight of the house before the attack on\r\nthe Trefoils began. "I had heard of Lady Augustus before," said\r\nLady Penwether, "but I didn\'t think that any woman could be so\r\ndisagreeable."\r\n\r\n"So vulgar," said Miss Penge.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t she the daughter of an ironmonger?" asked the elder Miss\r\nGodolphin.\r\n\r\n"The girl of course is handsome," said Lady Penwether.\r\n\r\n"But so self-sufficient," said Miss Godolphin.\r\n\r\n"And almost as vulgar as her mother," said Miss Penge.\r\n\r\n"She may be clever," said Lady Penwether, "but I do not think I\r\nshould ever like her."\r\n\r\n"She is one of those girls whom only gentlemen like," said Miss\r\nPenge.\r\n\r\n"And whom they don\'t like very long," said Lady Penwether.\r\n\r\n"How well I understand all this," said Lord Rufford turning to\r\nthe younger Miss Godolphin. "It is all said for my benefit, and\r\nconsidered to be necessary because I danced with the young lady last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"I hope you are not attributing such a motive to me," said Miss\r\nPenge.\r\n\r\n"Or to me," said Miss Godolphin.\r\n\r\n"I look on both of you and Eleanor as all one on the present\r\noccasion. I am considered to be falling over a precipice, and she has\r\ngot hold of my coat tails. Of course you wouldn\'t be Christians if\r\nyou didn\'t both of you seize a foot."\r\n\r\n"Looking at it in that light I certainly wish to be understood as\r\nholding on very fast," said Miss Penge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nGIVE ME SIX MONTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of trouble and some very genuine sorrow\r\nin the attorney\'s house at Dillsborough during the first week in\r\nDecember. Mr. Masters had declared to his wife that Mary should go\r\nto Cheltenham and a letter was written to Lady Ushant accepting the\r\ninvitation. The L20 too was forthcoming and the dress and the boots\r\nand the hat were bought. But while this was going on Mrs. Masters\r\ntook care that there should be no comfort whatever around them and\r\nmade every meal a separate curse to the unfortunate lawyer. She told\r\nhim ten times a day that she had been a mother to his daughter, but\r\ndeclared that such a position was no longer possible to her as the\r\ngirl had been taken altogether out of her hands. To Mary she hardly\r\nspoke at all and made her thoroughly wish that Lady Ushant\'s kindness\r\nhad been declined. "Mamma," she said one day, "I had rather write now\r\nand tell her that I cannot come."\r\n\r\n"After all the money has been wasted!"\r\n\r\n"I have only got things that I must have had very soon."\r\n\r\n"If you have got anything to say you had better talk to your father.\r\nI know nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"You break my heart when you say that, mamma."\r\n\r\n"You think nothing about breaking mine;--or that young man\'s\r\nwho is behaving so well to you. What makes me mad is to see you\r\nshilly-shallying with him."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I haven\'t shilly-shallied."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I call it. Why can\'t you speak him fair and tell him\r\nyou\'ll have him and settle yourself down properly? You\'ve got some\r\nidea into your silly head that what you call a gentleman will come\r\nafter you."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, that isn\'t fair."\r\n\r\n"Very well, miss. As your father takes your part of course you can\r\nsay what you please to me. I say it is so." Mary knew very well what\r\nher mother meant and was safe at least from any allusion to Reginald\r\nMorton. There was an idea prevalent in the house, and not without\r\nsome cause, that Mr. Surtees the curate had looked with an eye of\r\nfavour on Mary Masters. Mr. Surtees was certainly a gentleman, but\r\nhis income was strictly limited to the sum of L120 per annum which\r\nhe received from Mr. Mainwaring. Now Mrs. Masters disliked clergymen,\r\ndisliked gentlemen, and especially disliked poverty; and therefore\r\nwas not disposed to look upon Mr. Surtees as an eligible suitor for\r\nher stepdaughter. But as the curate\'s courtship had hitherto been\r\nof the coldest kind and as it had received no encouragement from\r\nthe young lady, Mary was certainly justified in declaring that\r\nthe allusion was not fair. "What I want to know is this;--are you\r\nprepared to marry Lawrence Twentyman?" To this question, as Mary\r\ncould not give a favourable answer, she thought it best to make none\r\nat all. "There is a man as has got a house fit for any woman, and\r\nmeans to keep it; who can give a young woman everything that she\r\nought to want;--and a handsome fellow too, with some life in him; one\r\nwho really dotes on you,--as men don\'t often do on young women now as\r\nfar as I can see. I wonder what it is you would have?"\r\n\r\n"I want nothing, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Yes you do. You have been reading books of poetry till you don\'t\r\nknow what it is you do want. You\'ve got your head full of claptraps\r\nand tantrums till you haven\'t a grain of sense belonging to you. I\r\nhate such ways. It\'s a spurning of the gifts of Providence not to\r\nhave such a man as Lawrence Twentyman when he comes in your way. Who\r\nare you, I wonder, that you shouldn\'t be contented with such as him?\r\nHe\'ll go and take some one else and then you\'ll be fit to break your\r\nheart, fretting after him, and I shan\'t pity you a bit. It\'ll serve\r\nyou right and you\'ll die an old maid, and what there will be for you\r\nto live upon God in heaven only knows. You\'re breaking your father\'s\r\nheart, as it is." Then she sat down in a rocking-chair and throwing\r\nher apron over her eyes gave herself up to a deluge of hysterical\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThis was very hard upon Mary for though she did not believe all the\r\nhorrible things which her stepmother said to her she did believe\r\nsome of them. She was not afraid of the fate of an old maid which\r\nwas threatened, but she did think that her marriage with this man\r\nwould be for the benefit of the family and a great relief to her\r\nfather. And she knew too that he was respectable, and believed him\r\nto be thoroughly earnest in his love. For such love as that it is\r\nimpossible that a girl should not be grateful. There was nothing to\r\nallure him, nothing to tempt him to such a marriage, but a simple\r\nappreciation of her personal merits. And in life he was at any rate\r\nher equal. She had told Reginald Morton that Larry Twentyman was a\r\nfit companion for her and for her sisters, and she owned as much to\r\nherself every day. When she acknowledged all this she was tempted to\r\nask herself whether she ought not to accept the man,--if not for her\r\nown sake at least for that of the family.\r\n\r\nThat same evening her father called her into the office after the\r\nclerks were gone and spoke to her thus. "Your mamma is very unhappy,\r\nmy dear," he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I have made everybody unhappy by wanting to go to\r\nCheltenham."\r\n\r\n"It is not only that. That is reasonable enough and you ought to go.\r\nMamma would say nothing more about that,--if you would make up your\r\nmind to one thing."\r\n\r\n"What thing, papa?" Of course she knew very well what the thing was.\r\n\r\n"It is time for you to think of settling in life, Mary. I never would\r\nput it into a girl\'s head that she ought to worry herself about\r\ngetting a husband unless the opportunity seemed to come in her way.\r\nYoung women should be quiet and wait till they\'re sought after. But\r\nhere is a young man seeking you whom we all like and approve. A good\r\nhouse is a very good thing when it\'s fairly come by."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"And so is a full house. A girl shouldn\'t run after money, but plenty\r\nis a great comfort in this world when it can be had without blushing\r\nfor."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"And so is an honest man\'s love. I don\'t like to see any girl\r\nwearying after some fellow to be always fal-lalling with her. A good\r\ngirl will be able to be happy and contented without that. But a lone\r\nlife is a poor life, and a good husband is about the best blessing\r\nthat a young woman can have." To this proposition Mary perhaps agreed\r\nin her own mind but she gave no spoken assent. "Now this young man\r\nthat is wanting to marry you has got all these things, and as far as\r\nI can judge with my experience in the world, is as likely to make a\r\ngood husband as any one I know." He paused for an answer but Mary\r\ncould only lean close upon his arm and be silent. "Have you anything\r\nto say about it, my dear? You see it has been going on now a long\r\ntime, and of course he\'ll look to have it decided." But still she\r\ncould say nothing. "Well, now;--he has been with me to-day."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Twentyman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--Mr. Twentyman. He knows you\'re going to Cheltenham and of\r\ncourse he has nothing to say against that. No young man such as he\r\nwould be sorry that his sweetheart should be entertained by such a\r\nlady as Lady Ushant. But he says that he wants to have an answer\r\nbefore you go."\r\n\r\n"I did answer him, papa."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--you refused him. But he hopes that perhaps you may think\r\nbetter of it. He has been with me and I have told him that if he will\r\ncome to-morrow you will see him. He is to be here after dinner and\r\nyou had better just take him up-stairs and hear what he has to say.\r\nIf you can make up your mind to like him you will please all your\r\nfamily. But if you can\'t,--I won\'t quarrel with you, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh papa, you are always so good."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am anxious that you should have a home of your own;--but\r\nlet it be how it may I will not quarrel with my child."\r\n\r\nAll that evening, and almost all the night, and again on the\r\nfollowing morning Mary turned it over in her mind. She was quite sure\r\nthat she was not in love with Larry Twentyman; but she was by no\r\nmeans sure that it might not be her duty to accept him without being\r\nin love with him. Of course he must know the whole truth; but she\r\ncould tell him the truth and then leave it for him to decide. What\r\nright had she to stand in the way of her friends, or to be a burden\r\nto them when such a mode of life was offered to her? She had nothing\r\nof her own, and regarded herself as being a dead weight on the\r\nfamily. And she was conscious in a certain degree of isolation in the\r\nhousehold,--as being her father\'s only child by the first marriage.\r\nShe would hardly know how to look her father in the face and tell him\r\nthat she had again refused the man. But yet there was something awful\r\nto her in the idea of giving herself to a man without loving him,--in\r\nbecoming a man\'s wife when she would fain remain away from him! Would\r\nit be possible that she should live with him while her feelings were\r\nof such a nature? And then she blushed as she lay in the dark, with\r\nher cheek on her pillow, when she found herself forced to inquire\r\nwithin her own heart whether she did not love some one else. She\r\nwould not own it, and yet she blushed, and yet she thought of it. If\r\nthere might be such a man it was not the young clergyman to whom her\r\nmother had alluded.\r\n\r\nThrough all that morning she was very quiet, very pale, and in\r\ntruth very unhappy. Her father said no further word to her, and her\r\nstepmother had been implored to be equally reticent. "I shan\'t speak\r\nanother word," said Mrs. Masters; "her fortune is in her own hands\r\nand if she don\'t choose to take it I\'ve done with her. One man may\r\nlead a horse to water but a hundred can\'t make him drink. It\'s just\r\nthe same with an obstinate pig-headed young woman."\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock Mr. Twentyman came and was at once desired to go up\r\nto Mary who was waiting for him in the drawing-room. Mrs. Masters\r\nsmiled and was gracious as she spoke to him, having for the moment\r\nwreathed herself in good humour so that he might go to his wooing in\r\nbetter spirit. He had learned his lesson by heart as nearly as he was\r\nable and began to recite it as soon as he had closed the door. "So\r\nyou\'re going to Cheltenham on Thursday?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll enjoy your visit there. I remember Lady Ushant myself\r\nvery well. I don\'t suppose she will remember me, but you can give her\r\nmy compliments."\r\n\r\n"I certainly will do that."\r\n\r\n"And now, Mary, what have you got to say to me?" He looked for a\r\nmoment as though he expected she would say what she had to say at\r\nonce,--without further question from him; but he knew that it could\r\nnot be so and he had prepared his lesson further than that. "I think\r\nyou must believe that I really do love you with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"I know that you are very good to me, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say anything about being good; but I\'m true:--that I am. I\'d\r\ntake you for my wife to-morrow if you hadn\'t a friend in the world,\r\njust for downright love. I\'ve got you so in my heart, Mary, that I\r\ncouldn\'t get rid of you if I tried ever so. You must know that it\'s\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\n"I do know that it\'s true."\r\n\r\n"Well! Don\'t you think that a fellow like that deserves something\r\nfrom a girl?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do."\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"He deserves a great deal too much for any girl to deceive him. You\r\nwouldn\'t like a young woman to marry you without loving you. I think\r\nyou deserve a great deal too well of me for that."\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment before he replied. "I don\'t know about that," he\r\nsaid at last. "I believe I should be glad to take you just anyhow.\r\nI don\'t think you can hate me."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I like you as well, Mr. Twentyman, as one friend can\r\nlike another,--without loving."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be content with that, Mary, and chance it for the rest. I\'ll be\r\nthat kind to you that I\'ll make you love me before twelve months are\r\nover. You come and try. You shall be mistress of everything. Mother\r\nisn\'t one that will want to be in the way."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that, Larry," she said.\r\n\r\nShe hadn\'t called him Larry for a long time and the sound of his\r\nown name from her lips gave him infinite hope. "Come and try. Say\r\nyou\'ll try. If ever a man did his best to please a woman I\'ll do it\r\nto please you." Then he attempted to take her in his arms but she\r\nglided away from him round the table. "I won\'t ask you not to go to\r\nCheltenham, or anything of that. You shall have your own time. By\r\nGeorge you shall have everything your own way." Still she did not\r\nanswer him but stood looking down upon the table. "Come;--say a word\r\nto a fellow."\r\n\r\nThen at last she spoke--"Give me--six months to think of it."\r\n\r\n"Six months! If you\'d say six weeks."\r\n\r\n"It is such a serious thing to do."\r\n\r\n"It is serious, of course. I\'m serious, I know. I shouldn\'t hunt\r\nabove half as often as I do now; and as for the club,--I don\'t\r\nsuppose I should go near the place once a month. Say six weeks, and\r\nthen, if you\'ll let me have one kiss, I\'ll not trouble you till\r\nyou\'re back from Cheltenham."\r\n\r\nMary at once perceived that he had taken her doubt almost as a\r\ncomplete surrender, and had again to become obdurate. At last she\r\npromised to give him a final answer in two months, but declared as\r\nshe said so that she was afraid she could not bring herself to do\r\nas he desired. She declined altogether to comply with that other\r\nrequest which he made, and then left him in the room declaring that\r\nat present she could say nothing further. As she did so she felt sure\r\nthat she would not be able to accept him in two months\' time whatever\r\nshe might bring herself to do when the vast abyss of six months\r\nshould have passed by.\r\n\r\nLarry made his way down into the parlour with hopes considerably\r\nraised. There he found Mrs. Masters and when he told her what\r\nhad passed she assured him that the thing was as good as settled.\r\nEverybody knew, she said, that when a girl doubted she meant to\r\nyield. And what were two months? The time would have nearly gone by\r\nthe end of her visit to Cheltenham. It was now early in December, and\r\nthey might be married and settled at home before the end of April.\r\nMrs. Masters, to give him courage, took out a bottle of currant wine\r\nand drank his health, and told him that in three months\' time she\r\nwould give him a kiss and call him her son. And she believed what she\r\nsaid. This, she thought, was merely Mary\'s way of letting herself\r\ndown without a sudden fall.\r\n\r\nThen the attorney came in and also congratulated him. When the\r\nattorney was told that Mary had taken two months for her decision he\r\nalso felt that the matter was almost as good as settled. This at any\r\nrate was clear to him,--that the existing misery of his household\r\nwould for the present cease, and that Mary would be allowed to go\r\nupon her visit without further opposition. He at present did not\r\nthink it wise to say another word to Mary about the young man;--nor\r\nwould Mrs. Masters condescend to do so. Mary would of course now\r\naccept her lover like any other girl, and had been such a fool,--so\r\nthought Mrs. Masters,--that she had thoroughly deserved to lose him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n"WONDERFUL BIRD!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were but two days between the scenes described in the last\r\nchapter and the day fixed for Mary\'s departure, and during these\r\ntwo days Larry Twentyman\'s name was not mentioned in the house. Mrs.\r\nMasters did not make herself quite pleasant to her stepdaughter,\r\nhaving still some grudge against her as to the L20. Nor, though she\r\nhad submitted to the visit to Cheltenham, did she approve of it. It\r\nwasn\'t the way, she said, to make such a girl as Mary like her life\r\nat Chowton Farm, going and sitting and doing nothing in old Lady\r\nUshant\'s drawing-room. It was cocking her up with gimcrack notions\r\nabout ladies till she\'d be ashamed to look at her own hands after\r\nshe had done a day\'s work with them. There was no doubt some truth\r\nin this. The woman understood the world and was able to measure\r\nLarry Twentyman and Lady Ushant and the rest of them. Books and\r\npretty needlework and easy conversation would consume the time at\r\nCheltenham, whereas at Chowton Farm there would be a dairy and a\r\npoultry yard,--under difficulties on account of the foxes,--with a\r\nprospect of baby linen and children\'s shoes and stockings. It was\r\nall that question of gentlemen and ladies, and of non-gentlemen and\r\nnon-ladies! They ought, Mrs. Masters thought, to be kept distinct.\r\nShe had never, she said, wanted to put her finger into a pie that\r\ndidn\'t belong to her. She had never tried to be a grand lady. But\r\nMary was perilously near the brink on either side, and as it was to\r\nbe her lucky fate at last to sit down to a plentiful but work-a-day\r\nlife at Chowton Farm she ought to have been kept away from the\r\nmaundering idleness of Lady Ushant\'s lodgings at Cheltenham. But Mary\r\nheard nothing of this during these two days, Mrs. Masters bestowing\r\nthe load of her wisdom upon her unfortunate husband.\r\n\r\nReginald Morton had been twice over at Mrs. Masters\' house with\r\nreference to the proposed journey. Mrs. Masters was hardly civil\r\nto him, as he was supposed to be among the enemies;--but she had\r\nno suspicion that he himself was the enemy of enemies. Had she\r\nentertained such an idea she might have reconciled herself to it, as\r\nthe man was able to support a wife, and by such a marriage she would\r\nhave been at once relieved from all further charge. In her own mind\r\nshe would have felt very strongly that Mary had chosen the wrong\r\nman, and thrown herself into the inferior mode of life. But her\r\nown difficulties in the matter would have been solved. There was,\r\nhowever, no dream of such a kind entertained by any of the family.\r\nReginald Morton was hardly regarded as a young man, and was supposed\r\nto be gloomy, misanthropic, and bookish. Mrs. Masters was not at all\r\naverse to the companionship for the journey, and Mr. Masters was\r\nreally grateful to one of the old family for being kind to his girl.\r\n\r\nNor must it be supposed that Mary herself had any expectations or\r\neven any hopes. With juvenile aptness to make much of the little\r\nthings which had interested her, and prone to think more than was\r\nreasonable of any intercourse with a man who seemed to her to be\r\nso superior to others as Reginald Morton, she was anxious for an\r\nopportunity to set herself right with him about that scene at the\r\nbridge. She still thought that he was offended and that she had given\r\nhim cause for offence. He had condescended to make her a request\r\nto which she had acceded,--and she had then not done as she had\r\npromised. She thought she was sure that this was all she had to say\r\nto him, and yet she was aware that she was unnaturally excited at\r\nthe idea of spending three or four hours alone with him. The fly\r\nwhich was to take him to the railway station called for Mary at the\r\nattorney\'s door at ten o\'clock, and the attorney handed her in. "It\r\nis very good of you indeed, Mr. Morton, to take so much trouble with\r\nmy girl," said the attorney, really feeling what he said. "It is very\r\ngood of you to trust her to me," said Reginald, also sincerely. Mary\r\nwas still to him the girl who had been brought up by his aunt at\r\nBragton, and not the fit companion for Larry Twentyman.\r\n\r\nReginald Morton had certainly not made up his mind to ask Mary\r\nMasters to be his wife. Thinking of Mary Masters very often as he\r\nhad done during the last two months, he was quite sure that he did\r\nnot mean to marry at all. He did acknowledge to himself that were he\r\nto allow himself to fall in love with any one it would be with Mary\r\nMasters,--but for not doing so there were many reasons. He had lived\r\nso long alone that a married life would not suit him; as a married\r\nman he would be a poor man; he himself was averse to company, whereas\r\nmost women prefer society. And then, as to this special girl, had he\r\nnot reason for supposing that she preferred another man to him, and a\r\nman of such a class that the very preference showed her to be unfit\r\nto mate with him? He also cozened himself with an idea that it was\r\nwell that he should have the opportunity which the journey would give\r\nhim of apologising for his previous rudeness to her.\r\n\r\nIn the carriage they had the compartment to themselves with the\r\nexception of an old lady at the further end who had a parrot in a\r\ncage for which she had taken a first-class ticket. "I can\'t offer\r\nyou this seat," said the old lady, "because it has been booked and\r\npaid for for my bird." As neither of the new passengers had shown\r\nthe slightest wish for the seat the communication was perhaps\r\nunnecessary. Neither of the two had any idea of separating from the\r\nother for the sake of the old lady\'s company.\r\n\r\nThey had before them a journey of thirty miles on one railway, then\r\na stop of half an hour at the Hinxton Junction; and then another\r\njourney of about equal length. In the first hour very little was said\r\nthat might not have been said in the presence of Lady Ushant,--or\r\neven of Mrs. Masters. There might be a question whether, upon the\r\nwhole, the parrot had not the best of the conversation, as the\r\nbird, which the old lady declared to be the wonder of his species,\r\nrepeated the last word of nearly every sentence spoken either by our\r\nfriends or by the old lady herself. "Don\'t you think you\'d be less\r\nliable to cold with that window closed?" the old lady said to Mary.\r\n"Cosed,--cosed,--cosed," said the bird, and Morton was of course\r\nconstrained to shut the window. "He is a wonderful bird," said the\r\nold lady. "Wonderful bird;--wonderful bird;--wonderful bird," said\r\nthe parrot, who was quite at home with this expression. "We shall be\r\nable to get some lunch at Hinxton," said Reginald. "Inxton," screamed\r\nthe bird--"Caw,--caw--caw." "He\'s worth a deal of money," said the\r\nold lady. "Deal o\' money, Deal o\' money," repeated the bird as he\r\nscrambled round the wire cage with a tremendous noise, to the great\r\ntriumph of the old lady.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the close attention which the bird paid to everything that\r\npassed, and the presence of the old lady as well, did for a time\r\ninterfere with their conversation. But, after awhile, the old lady\r\nwas asleep, and the bird, having once or twice attempted to imitate\r\nthe somnolent sounds which his mistress was making, seemed also to go\r\nto sleep himself. Then Reginald, beginning with Lady Ushant and the\r\nold Morton family generally, gradually got the conversation round to\r\nBragton and the little bridge. He had been very stern when he had\r\nleft her there, and he knew also that at that subsequent interview,\r\nwhen he had brought Lady Ushant\'s note to her at her father\'s house,\r\nhe had not been cordially kind to her. Now they were thrown together\r\nfor an hour or so in the closest companionship, and he wished to make\r\nher comfortable and happy. "I suppose you remember Bragton?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Every path and almost every tree about the place."\r\n\r\n"So do I. I called there the other day. Family quarrels are so silly,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Did you see Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"No;--and he hasn\'t returned my visit yet. I don\'t know whether he\r\nwill,--and I don\'t much mind whether he does or not. That old woman\r\nis there, and she is very bitter against me. I don\'t care about the\r\npeople, but I am sorry that I cannot see the place."\r\n\r\n"I ought to have walked with you that day," she said in a very low\r\ntone. The parrot opened his eyes and looked at them as though he were\r\nstriving to catch his cue.\r\n\r\n"Of course you ought." But as he said this he smiled and there was no\r\noffence in his voice. "I dare say you didn\'t guess how much I thought\r\nof it. And then I was a bear to you. I always am a bear when I am not\r\npleased."\r\n\r\n"Peas, peas, peas," said the parrot.\r\n\r\n"I shall be a bear to that brute of a bird before long."\r\n\r\n"What a very queer bird he is."\r\n\r\n"He is a public nuisance,--and so is the old lady who brought him\r\nhere." This was said quite in a whisper. "It is very odd, Miss\r\nMasters, but you are literally the only person in all Dillsborough in\r\nregard to whom I have any genuine feeling of old friendship."\r\n\r\n"You must remember a great many."\r\n\r\n"But I did not know any well enough. I was too young to have seen\r\nmuch of your father. But when I came back at that time you and I were\r\nalways together."\r\n\r\n"Gedder, gedder, gedder," said the parrot.\r\n\r\n"If that bird goes on like that I\'ll speak to the guard," said Mr.\r\nMorton with affected anger.\r\n\r\n"Polly mustn\'t talk," said the old lady waking up.\r\n\r\n"Tok, tok, tok, tok," screamed the parrot. Then the old lady threw a\r\nshawl over him and again went to sleep.\r\n\r\n"If I behaved badly I beg your pardon," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I wanted to say to you, Miss Masters,--only a man\r\nnever can do those things as well as a lady. I did behave badly, and\r\nI do beg your pardon. Of course I ought to have asked Mr. Twentyman\r\nto come with us. I know that he is a very good fellow."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he is," said Mary Masters, with all the emphasis in her\r\npower. "Deedy is, deedy is, deedy is, deedy is," repeated the parrot\r\nin a very angry voice about a dozen times under his shawl, and while\r\nthe old lady was remonstrating with her too talkative companion their\r\ntickets were taken and they ran into the Hinxton Station. "If the old\r\nlady is going on to Cheltenham we\'ll travel third class before we\'ll\r\nsit in the same carriage again with that bird," said Morton laughing\r\nas he took Mary into the refreshment-room. But the old lady did not\r\nget into the same compartment as they started, and the last that was\r\nheard of the parrot at Hinxton was a quarrel between him and the\r\nguard as to certain railway privileges.\r\n\r\nWhen they had got back into the railway carriage Morton was very\r\nanxious to ask whether she was in truth engaged to marry the young\r\nman as to whose good fellowship she and the parrot had spoken up so\r\nemphatically, but he hardly knew how to put the question. And were\r\nshe to declare that she was engaged to him, what should he say then?\r\nWould he not be bound to congratulate her? And yet it would be\r\nimpossible that any word of such congratulation should pass his lips.\r\n"You will stay a month at Cheltenham?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Your aunt was kind enough to ask me for so long."\r\n\r\n"I shall go back on Saturday. If I were to stay longer I should feel\r\nmyself to be in her way. And I have come to live a sort of hermit\'s\r\nlife. I hardly know how to sit down and eat my dinner in company, and\r\nhave no idea of seeing a human being before two o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"What do you do with yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I rush in and out of the garden and spend my time between my books\r\nand my flowers and my tobacco pipes."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to live always like that?" she asked,--in perfect\r\ninnocency.\r\n\r\n"I think so. Sometimes I doubt whether it\'s wise."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it wise at all," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"People should live together, I think."\r\n\r\n"You mean that I ought to have a wife?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I didn\'t mean that. Of course that must be just as you might\r\ncome to like any one well enough. But a person need not shut himself\r\nup and be a hermit because he is not married. Lord Rufford is not\r\nmarried and he goes everywhere."\r\n\r\n"He has money and property and is a man of pleasure."\r\n\r\n"And your cousin, Mr. John Morton."\r\n\r\n"He is essentially a man of business, which I never could have been.\r\nAnd they say he is going to be married to that Miss Trefoil who has\r\nbeen staying there. Unfortunately I have never had anything that I\r\nneed do in all my life, and therefore I have shut myself up as you\r\ncall it. I wonder what your life will be." Mary blushed and said\r\nnothing. "If there were anything to tell I wish I knew it."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to tell."\r\n\r\n"Nothing?"\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment before she answered him and then she said,\r\n"Nothing. What should I have to tell?" she added trying to laugh.\r\n\r\nHe remained for a few minutes silent, and then put his head out\r\ntowards her as he spoke. "I was afraid that you might have to tell\r\nthat you were engaged to marry Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"I am not."\r\n\r\n"Oh!--I am so glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should be glad. If I had said I was, it would\r\nhave been very uncivil if you hadn\'t declared yourself glad to hear\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Then I must have been uncivil for I couldn\'t have done it. Knowing\r\nhow my aunt loves you, knowing what she thinks of you and what she\r\nwould think of such a match, remembering myself what I do of you, I\r\ncould not have congratulated you on your engagement to a man whom I\r\nthink so much inferior to yourself in every respect. Now you know it\r\nall,--why I was angry at the bridge, why I was hardly civil to you\r\nat your father\'s house; and, to tell the truth, why I have been so\r\nanxious to be alone with you for half an hour. If you think it an\r\noffence that I should take so much interest in you, I will beg your\r\npardon for that also."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!"\r\n\r\n"I have never spoken to my aunt about it, but I do not think that she\r\nwould have been contented to hear that you were to become the wife of\r\nMr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\nWhat answer she was to make to this or whether she was to make any\r\nshe had not decided when they were interrupted by the reappearance\r\nof the old lady and the bird. She was declaring to the guard at the\r\nwindow, that as she had paid for a first-class seat for her parrot\r\nshe would get into any carriage she liked in which there were two\r\nempty seats. Her bird had been ill-treated by some scurrilous\r\nill-conditioned travellers and she had therefore returned to the\r\ncomparative kindness of her former companions. "They threatened to\r\nput him out of the window, sir," said the old woman to Morton as she\r\nwas forcing her way in.\r\n\r\n"Windersir, windersir," said the parrot.\r\n\r\n"I hope he\'ll behave himself here, ma\'am," said Morton.\r\n\r\n"Heremam, heremam, heremam," said the parrot.\r\n\r\n"Now go to bed like a good bird," said the old lady putting her shawl\r\nover the cage,--whereupon the parrot made a more diabolical noise\r\nthan ever under the curtain.\r\n\r\nMary felt that there was no more to be said about Mr. Twentyman and\r\nher hopes and prospects, and for the moment she was glad to be left\r\nin peace. The old lady and the parrot continued their conversation\r\ntill they had all arrived in Cheltenham;--and Mary as she sat alone\r\nthinking of it afterwards might perhaps feel a soft regret that\r\nReginald Morton had been interrupted by the talkative animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMOUNSER GREEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n"So Peter Boyd is to go to Washington in the Paragon\'s place, and\r\nJack Slade goes to Vienna, and young Palliser is to get Slade\'s\r\nberth at Lisbon." This information was given by a handsome man,\r\nknown as Mounser Green, about six feet high, wearing a velvet\r\nshooting coat,--more properly called an office coat from its present\r\nuses,--who had just entered a spacious well-carpeted comfortable\r\nroom in which three other gentlemen were sitting at their different\r\ntables. This was one of the rooms in the Foreign Office and looked\r\nout into St. James\'s Park. Mounser Green was a distinguished clerk\r\nin that department,--and distinguished also in various ways, being\r\none of the fashionable men about town, a great adept at private\r\ntheatricals, remarkable as a billiard player at his club, and a\r\ncontributor to various magazines. At this moment he had a cigar in\r\nhis mouth, and when he entered the room he stood with his back to\r\nthe fire ready for conversation and looking very unlike a clerk who\r\nintended to do any work. But there was a general idea that Mounser\r\nGreen was invaluable to the Foreign Office. He could speak and write\r\ntwo or three foreign languages; he could do a spurt of work,--ten\r\nhours at a sitting when required; he was ready to go through fire\r\nand water for his chief; and was a gentleman all round. Though still\r\nnominally a young man,--being perhaps thirty-five years of age--he\r\nhad entered the service before competitive examination had assumed\r\nits present shape and had therefore the gifts which were required for\r\nhis special position. Some critics on the Civil Service were no doubt\r\napt to find fault with Mounser Green. When called upon at his office\r\nhe was never seen to be doing anything, and he always had a cigar in\r\nhis mouth. These gentlemen found out too that he never entered his\r\noffice till half-past twelve, perhaps not having also learned that he\r\nwas generally there till nearly seven. No doubt during the time that\r\nhe remained there he read a great many newspapers, and wrote a great\r\nmany private notes,--on official paper! But there may be a question\r\nwhether even these employments did not help to make Mounser Green the\r\nvaluable man he was.\r\n\r\n"What a lounge for Jack Slade," said young Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you who it won\'t be a lounge for, Green," said Archibald\r\nCurrie, the clerk who held the second authority among them. "What\r\nwill Bell Trefoil think of going to Patagonia?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all off," said Mounser Green.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so," said Charley Glossop, one of the numerous younger\r\nsons of Lord Glossop. "She was staying only the other day down at\r\nthe Paragon\'s place in Rufford, and they went together to my cousin\r\nRufford\'s house. His sister,--that\'s Lady Penwether, told me they\r\nwere certainly engaged then."\r\n\r\n"That was before the Paragon had been named for Patagonia. To tell\r\nyou a little bit of my own private mind,--which isn\'t scandal," said\r\nMounser Green, "because it is only given as opinion,--I think it just\r\npossible that the Paragon has taken this very uncomfortable mission\r\nbecause it offered him some chance of escape."\r\n\r\n"Then he has more sense about him than I gave him credit for," said\r\nArchibald Currie.\r\n\r\n"Why should a man like Morton go to Patagonia?" continued Green. "He\r\nhas an independent fortune and doesn\'t want the money. He\'d have been\r\nsure to have something comfortable in Europe very soon if he had\r\nwaited, and was much better off as second at a place like Washington.\r\nI was quite surprised when he took it."\r\n\r\n"Patagonia isn\'t bad at all," said Currie.\r\n\r\n"That depends on whether a man has got money of his own. When I heard\r\nabout the Paragon and Bell Trefoil at Washington, I knew there had\r\nbeen a mistake made. He didn\'t know what he was doing. I\'m a poor\r\nman, but I wouldn\'t take her with L5,000 a year, settled on myself."\r\nPoor Mounser Green!\r\n\r\n"I think she\'s the handsomest girl in London," said Hoffmann, who was\r\na young man of German parentage and perhaps of German taste.\r\n\r\n"That may be," continued Green;--"but, heaven and earth! what a\r\nlife she would lead a man like the Paragon! He\'s found it out, and\r\ntherefore thought it well to go to South America. She has declined\r\nalready, I\'m told; but he means to stick to the mission." During all\r\nthis time Mounser Green was smoking his cigar with his back to the\r\nfire, and the other clerks looked as though they had nothing to do\r\nbut talk about the private affairs of ministers abroad and their\r\nfriends. Of course it will be understood that since we last saw John\r\nMorton the position of Minister Plenipotentiary at Patagonia had been\r\noffered to him and that he had accepted the place in spite of Bragton\r\nand of Arabella Trefoil.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a card was handed to Mounser Green by a messenger who\r\nwas desired to show the gentleman up. "It\'s the Paragon himself,"\r\nsaid Green.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll make him tell us whether he\'s going out single or double,"\r\nsaid Archibald Currie.\r\n\r\n"After what the Rufford people said to me I\'m sure he\'s going to\r\nmarry her," said young Glossop. No doubt Lady Penwether had been\r\nanxious to make it understood by every one connected with the family\r\nthat if any gossip should be heard about Rufford and Arabella Trefoil\r\nthere was nothing in it.\r\n\r\nThen the Paragon was shown into the room and Mounser Green and\r\nthe young men were delighted to see him. Colonial governors at\r\ntheir seats of government, and Ministers Plenipotentiary in their\r\nambassadorial residences are very great persons indeed; and when\r\nmet in society at home, with the stars and ribbons which are common\r\namong them now, they are less indeed, but still something. But at\r\nthe colonial and foreign offices in London, among the assistant\r\nsecretaries and clerks, they are hardly more than common men. All the\r\ngingerbread is gone there. His Excellency is no more than Jones, and\r\nthe Representative or Alter Ego of Royalty mildly asks little favours\r\nof the junior clerks.\r\n\r\n"Lord Drummond only wants to know what you wish and it shall be\r\ndone," said Mounser Green. Lord Drummond was the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the day. "I hope I need hardly say that we were delighted\r\nthat you accepted the offer."\r\n\r\n"One doesn\'t like to refuse a step upward," said Morton; "otherwise\r\nPatagonia isn\'t exactly the place one would like."\r\n\r\n"Very good climate," said Currie. "Ladies I have known who have gone\r\nthere have enjoyed it very much."\r\n\r\n"A little rough I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"They didn\'t seem to say so. Young Bartletot took his wife out\r\nthere,--just married. He liked it. There wasn\'t much society, but\r\nthey didn\'t care about that just at first."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--I\'m a single man," said Morton laughing. He was too good a\r\ndiplomate to be pumped in that simple way by such a one as Archibald\r\nCurrie.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll like to see Lord Drummond. He is here and will be glad to\r\nshake hands with you. Come into my room." Then Mounser Green led the\r\nway into a small inner sanctum in which it may be presumed that he\r\nreally did his work. It was here at any rate that he wrote the notes\r\non official note paper.\r\n\r\n"They haven\'t settled as yet how they\'re to be off it," said Currie\r\nin a whisper, as soon as the two men were gone, "but I\'ll bet a\r\nfive-pound note that Bell Trefoil doesn\'t go out to Patagonia as his\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"We know the Senator here well enough." This was said in the inner\r\nroom by Mounser Green to Morton, who had breakfasted with the Senator\r\nthat morning and had made an appointment to meet him at the Foreign\r\nOffice. The Senator wanted to secure a seat for himself at the\r\nopening of Parliament which was appointed to take place in the course\r\nof the next month, and being a member of the Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs in the American Senate of course thought himself entitled to\r\nhave things done for him by the Foreign Office clerks. "Oh yes, I\'ll\r\nsee him. Lord Drummond will get him a seat as a matter of course. How\r\nis he getting on with your neighbour at Dillsborough?"\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve heard of that."\r\n\r\n"Heard of it! who hasn\'t heard of it?"--At this moment the messenger\r\ncame in again and the Senator was announced. "Lord Drummond will\r\nmanage about the seats in the House of Lords, Mr. Gotobed. Of course\r\nhe\'ll see you if you wish it; but I\'ll take a note of it."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll do that, Mr. Green, I shall be fixed up straight. And I\'d\r\na great deal sooner see you than his lordship."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very flattering, Mr. Gotobed, but I\'m sure I don\'t know why."\r\n\r\n"Because Lord Drummond always seems to me to have more on hand than\r\nhe knows how to get through, and you never seem to have anything to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not quite so flattering,--and would be killing, only that I\r\nfeel that your opinion is founded on error. Mens conscia recti, Mr.\r\nGotobed."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. I understand English pretty well;--better, as far as I can\r\nsee than some of those I meet around me here; but I don\'t go beyond\r\nthat, Mr. Green."\r\n\r\n"I merely meant to observe, Mr. Gotobed, that as, within my own\r\nbreast, I am conscious of my zeal and diligence in Her Majesty\'s\r\nservice your shafts of satire pass me by without hurting me. Shall I\r\noffer you a cigar? A candle burned at both ends is soon consumed." It\r\nwas quite clear that as quickly as the Senator got through one end of\r\nhis cigar by the usual process of burning, so quickly did he eat the\r\nother end. But he took that which Mounser Green offered him without\r\nany displeasure at the allusion. "I\'m sorry to say that I haven\'t a\r\nspittoon," said Mounser Green, "but the whole fire-place is at your\r\nservice." The Senator could hardly have heard this, as it made no\r\ndifference in his practice.\r\n\r\nMorton at this moment was sent for by the Secretary of State, and the\r\nSenator expressed his intention of waiting for him in Mr. Green\'s\r\nroom. "How does the great Goarly case get on, Mr. Gotobed?" asked the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n"Well! I don\'t know that it\'s getting on very much."\r\n\r\n"You are not growing tired of it, Senator?"\r\n\r\n"Not by any means. But it\'s getting itself complicated, Mr. Green. I\r\nmean to see the end of it, and if I\'m beat,--why I can take a beating\r\nas well as another man."\r\n\r\n"You begin to think you will be beat?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say so, Mr. Green. It is very hard to understand all the\r\nins and outs of a case like that in a foreign country."\r\n\r\n"Then I shouldn\'t try it, Senator."\r\n\r\n"There I differ. It is my object to learn all I can."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I shouldn\'t pay for the lesson as you are like to do.\r\nWhat\'ll the bill be? Four hundred dollars?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Mr. Green. If you\'ll take the opinion of a good deal\r\nolder man than yourself and one who has perhaps worked harder, you\'ll\r\nunderstand that there\'s no knowledge got so thoroughly as that for\r\nwhich a man pays." Soon after this Morton came out from the great\r\nman\'s room and went away in company with the Senator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SENATOR\'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after this Senator Gotobed went down, alone, to Dillsborough\r\nand put himself up at the Bush Inn. Although he had by no means the\r\nreputation of being a rich man, he did not seem to care much what\r\nmoney he spent in furthering any object he had taken in hand. He\r\nnever knew how near he had been to meeting the direst inhospitality\r\nat Mr. Runciman\'s house. That worthy innkeeper, knowing well the\r\nSenator\'s sympathy with Goarly, Scrobby and Bearside, and being heart\r\nand soul devoted to the Rufford interest, had almost refused the\r\nSenator the accommodation he wanted. It was only when Mrs. Runciman\r\nrepresented to him that she could charge ten shillings a day for\r\nthe use of her sitting-room, and also that Lord Rufford himself had\r\ncondescended to entertain the gentleman, that Runciman gave way. Mr.\r\nGotobed would, no doubt, have delighted in such inhospitality. He\r\nwould have gone to the second-rate inn, which was very second-rate\r\nindeed, and have acquired a further insight into British manners\r\nand British prejudices. As it was, he made himself at home in the\r\nbest upstairs sitting-room at the Bush, and was quite unaware of the\r\nindignity offered to him when Mr. Runciman refused to send him up\r\nthe best sherry. Let us hope that this refusal was remembered by the\r\nyoung woman in the bar when she made out the Senator\'s bill.\r\n\r\nHe stayed at Dillsborough for three or four days during which he saw\r\nGoarly once and Bearside on two or three occasions,--and moreover\r\nhanded to that busy attorney three bank notes for L5 each. Bearside\r\nwas clever enough to make him believe that Goarly would certainly\r\nobtain serious damages from the lord. With Bearside he was fairly\r\nsatisfied, thinking however that the man was much more illiterate and\r\nignorant than the general run of lawyers in the United States; but\r\nwith Goarly he was by no means satisfied. Goarly endeavoured to keep\r\nout of his way and could not be induced to come to him at the Bush.\r\nThree times he walked out to the house near Dillsborough Wood, on\r\neach of which occasions Mrs. Goarly pestered him for money, and\r\ntold him at great length the history of her forlorn goose. Scrobby,\r\nof whom he had heard, he could not see at all; and he found that\r\nBearside was very unwilling to say anything about Scrobby. Scrobby,\r\nand the red herrings and the strychnine and the dead fox were,\r\naccording to Bearside, to be kept quite distinct from the pheasants\r\nand the wheat. Bearside declared over and over again that there was\r\nno evidence to connect his client with the demise of the fox. When\r\nasked whether he did not think that his client had compassed the\r\ndeath of the animal, he assured the Senator that in such matters he\r\nnever ventured to think. "Let us go by the evidence, Mr. Gotobed," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"But I am paying my money for the sake of getting at the facts."\r\n\r\n"Evidence is facts, sir," said the attorney. "Any way let us settle\r\nabout the pheasants first."\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Senator\'s mind may perhaps be best made known\r\nby a letter which he wrote from Dillsborough to his especial and\r\nwell-trusted friend Josiah Scroome, a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives from his own state of Mickewa. Since he had been\r\nin England he had written constantly to his friend, giving him the\r\nresult of his British experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Bush Inn, Dillsborough,\r\n   Ufford County, England,\r\n   December 16, 187--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   Since my last I have enjoyed myself very well and I am I\r\n   trust beginning to understand something of the mode of\r\n   thinking of this very peculiar people. That there should\r\n   be so wide a difference between us Americans and these\r\n   English, from whom we were divided, so to say, but the\r\n   other day, is one of the most peculiar physiological\r\n   phenomena that the history of the world will have\r\n   afforded. As far as I can hear a German or even a\r\n   Frenchman thinks much more as an Englishman thinks than\r\n   does an American. Nor does this come mainly from the\r\n   greater prevalence with us of democratic institutions. I\r\n   do not think that any one can perceive in half an hour\'s\r\n   conversation the difference between a Swiss and a German;\r\n   but I fancy, and I may say I flatter myself, that an\r\n   American is as easily distinguished from an Englishman, as\r\n   a sheep from a goat or a tall man from one who is short.\r\n\r\n   And yet there is a pleasure in associating with those here\r\n   of the highest rank which I find it hard to describe, and\r\n   which perhaps I ought to regard as a pernicious temptation\r\n   to useless luxury. There is an ease of manner with them\r\n   which recalls with unfavourable reminiscences the hard\r\n   self-consciousness of the better class of our citizens.\r\n   There is a story of an old hero who with his companions\r\n   fell among beautiful women and luscious wine, and, but\r\n   that the hero had been warned in time, they would all\r\n   have been turned into filthy animals by yielding to the\r\n   allurements around them. The temptation here is perhaps\r\n   the same. I am not a hero; and, though I too have been\r\n   warned by the lessons I have learned under our happy\r\n   Constitution, I feel that I might easily become one of the\r\n   animals in question.\r\n\r\n   And, to give them their due, it is better than merely\r\n   beautiful women and luscious wine. There is a reality\r\n   about them, and a desire to live up to their principles\r\n   which is very grand. Their principles are no doubt\r\n   bad, utterly antagonistic to all progress, unconscious\r\n   altogether of the demand for progressive equality which is\r\n   made by the united voices of suffering mankind. The man\r\n   who is born a lord and who sees a dozen serfs around him\r\n   who have been born to be half-starved ploughmen, thinks\r\n   that God arranged it all and that he is bound to maintain\r\n   a state of things so comfortable to himself, as being\r\n   God\'s vicegerent here on earth. But they do their work as\r\n   vicegerents with an easy grace, and with sweet pleasant\r\n   voices and soft movements, which almost make a man doubt\r\n   whether the Almighty has not in truth intended that such\r\n   injustice should be permanent. That one man should be rich\r\n   and another poor is a necessity in the present imperfect\r\n   state of civilisation;--but that one man should be born\r\n   to be a legislator, born to have everything, born to\r\n   be a tyrant,--and should think it all right, is to me\r\n   miraculous. But the greatest miracle of all is that they\r\n   who are not so born,--who have been born to suffer the\r\n   reverse side,--should also think it to be all right.\r\n\r\n   With us it is necessary that a man, to shine in society,\r\n   should have done something, or should at any rate have\r\n   the capacity of doing something. But here the greatest\r\n   fool that you meet will shine, and will be admitted to\r\n   be brilliant, simply because he has possessions. Such a\r\n   one will take his part in conversation though he knows\r\n   nothing, and, when inquired into, he will own that he\r\n   knows nothing. To know anything is not his line in life.\r\n   But he can move about, and chatter like a child of ten,\r\n   and amuse himself from morning to night with various empty\r\n   playthings,--and be absolutely proud of his life!\r\n\r\n   I have lately become acquainted with a certain young lord\r\n   here of this class who has treated me with great kindness,\r\n   although I have taken it into my head to oppose him as to\r\n   a matter in which he is much interested. I ventured to\r\n   inquire of him as to the pursuits of his life. He is a\r\n   lord, and therefore a legislator, but he made no scruple\r\n   to tell me that he never goes near the Chamber in which it\r\n   is his privilege to have a seat. But his party does not\r\n   lose his support. Though he never goes near the place, he\r\n   can vote, and is enabled to trust his vote to some other\r\n   more ambitious lord who does go there. It required the\r\n   absolute evidence of personal information from those\r\n   who are themselves concerned to make me believe that\r\n   legislation in Great Britain could be carried on after\r\n   such a fashion as this! Then he told me what he does do.\r\n   All the winter he hunts and shoots, going about to other\r\n   rich men\'s houses when there is no longer sufficient for\r\n   him to shoot left on his own estate. That lasts him from\r\n   the 1st of September to the end of March, and occupies\r\n   all his time. August he spends in Scotland, also shooting\r\n   other animals. During the other months he fishes, and\r\n   plays cricket and tennis, and attends races, and goes\r\n   about to parties in London. His evenings he spends at a\r\n   card table when he can get friends to play with him. It\r\n   is the employment of his life to fit in his amusements\r\n   so that he may not have a dull day. Wherever he goes\r\n   he carries his wine with him and his valet and his\r\n   grooms;--and if he thinks there is anything to fear,\r\n   his cook also. He very rarely opens a book. He is more\r\n   ignorant than a boy of fifteen with us, and yet he manages\r\n   to have something to say about everything. When his\r\n   ignorance has been made as clear as the sun at noon-day,\r\n   he is no whit ashamed. One would say that such a life\r\n   would break the heart of any man; but upon my word,\r\n   I doubt whether I ever came across a human being so\r\n   self-satisfied as this young lord.\r\n\r\n   I have come down here to support the case of a poor man\r\n   who is I think being trampled on by this do-nothing\r\n   legislator. But I am bound to say that the lord in his\r\n   kind is very much better than the poor man in his. Such\r\n   a wretched, squalid, lying, cowardly creature I did not\r\n   think that even England could produce. And yet the man has\r\n   a property in land on which he ought to be able to live\r\n   in humble comfort. I feel sure that I have leagued myself\r\n   with a rascal, whereas I believe the lord, in spite of his\r\n   ignorance and his idleness, to be honest. But yet the man\r\n   is being hardly used, and has had the spirit, or rather\r\n   perhaps has been instigated by others, to rebel. His crops\r\n   have been eaten up by the lord\'s pheasants, and the lord,\r\n   exercising plenary power as though he were subject to no\r\n   laws, will only pay what compensation he himself chooses\r\n   to award. The whole country here is in arms against the\r\n   rebel, thinking it monstrous that a man living in a hovel\r\n   should contest such a point with the owner of half-a-dozen\r\n   palaces. I have come forward to help the man for the sake\r\n   of seeing how the matter will go; and I have to confess\r\n   that though those under the lord have treated me as though\r\n   I were a miscreant, the lord himself and his friends have\r\n   been civil enough.\r\n\r\n   I say what I think wherever I go, and I do not find\r\n   it taken in bad part. In that respect we might learn\r\n   something even from Englishmen. When a Britisher over in\r\n   the States says what he thinks about us, we are apt to be\r\n   a little rough with him. I have, indeed, known towns in\r\n   which he couldn\'t speak out with personal safety. Here\r\n   there is no danger of that kind. I am getting together\r\n   the materials for a lecture on British institutions in\r\n   general, in which I shall certainly speak my mind plainly,\r\n   and I think I shall venture to deliver it in London before\r\n   I leave for New York in the course of next spring. I will,\r\n   however, write to you again before that time comes.\r\n\r\n   Believe me to be,\r\n   Dear sir,\r\n   With much sincerity,\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n\r\n   ELIAS GOTOBED.\r\n\r\n   The Honble. Josiah Scroome,\r\n   125 Q Street,\r\n   Minnesota Avenue,\r\n   Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Senator\'s departure from Dillsborough, Mr.\r\nRunciman met him standing under the covered way leading from the inn\r\nyard into the street. He was waiting for the omnibus which was being\r\ndriven about the town, and which was to call for him and take him\r\ndown to the railway station. Mr. Runciman had not as yet spoken to\r\nhim since he had been at the inn, and had not even made himself\r\npersonally known to his guest. "So, sir, you are going to leave us,"\r\nsaid the landlord, with a smile which was intended probably as a\r\nsmile of triumph.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said the Senator. "It\'s about time, I guess, that I\r\nshould get back to London."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it is, sir," said the landlord. "I dare say you\'ve seen\r\nenough of Mr. Goarly by this time."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as may be. I don\'t know whom I have the pleasure of speaking\r\nto."\r\n\r\n"My name is Runciman, sir. I\'m the landlord here."\r\n\r\n"I hope I see you well, Mr. Runciman. I have about come to an end of\r\nmy business here."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you have, sir. I should say so. Perhaps I might express\r\nan opinion that you never came across a greater blackguard than\r\nGoarly either in this country or your own."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a strong opinion, Mr. Runciman."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the general opinion here, sir. I should have thought you\'d\r\nfound it out before this."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I am prepared at this moment to declare all that I\r\nhave found out."\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d have been tired of it by this time, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"Tired of what?"\r\n\r\n"Tired of the wrong side, sir."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I am on the wrong side. A man may be in the right\r\non one point even though his life isn\'t all that it ought to be."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, sir; but if they told you all that they know up\r\nstreet,"--and Runciman pointed to the part of the town in which\r\nBearside\'s office was situated,--"I should have thought you would\r\nhave understood who was going to win and who was going to lose. Good\r\nday, sir; I hope you\'ll have a pleasant journey. Much obliged to you\r\nfor your patronage, sir," and Runciman, still smiling unpleasantly,\r\ntouched his hat as the Senator got into the omnibus.\r\n\r\nThe Senator was not very happy as to the Goarly business. He had paid\r\nsome money and had half promised more, and had found out that he was\r\nin a boat with thoroughly disreputable persons. As he had said to the\r\nlandlord, a man may have the right on his side in an action at law\r\nthough he be a knave or a rascal; and if a lord be unjust to a poor\r\nman, the poor man should have justice done him, even though he be\r\nnot quite a pattern poor man. But now he was led to believe by what\r\nthe landlord had said to him that he was being kept in the dark, and\r\nthat there were facts generally known that he did not know. He had\r\nlearned something of English manners and English institutions by his\r\ninterference, but there might be a question whether he was not paying\r\ntoo dearly for his whistle. And there was growing upon him a feeling\r\nthat before he had done he would have to blush for his colleagues.\r\n\r\nAs the omnibus went away Dr. Nupper joined Mr. Runciman under the\r\narchway. "I\'m blessed if I can understand that man," said Runciman.\r\n"What is it he\'s after?"\r\n\r\n"Notoriety," said the doctor, with the air of a man who has\r\ncompletely solved a difficult question.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll have to pay for it, and that pretty smart," said Runciman. "I\r\nnever heard of such a foolish thing in all my life. What the dickens\r\nis it to him? One can understand Bearside, and Scrobby too. When a\r\nfellow has something to get, one does understand it. But why an old\r\nfellow like that should come down from the moon to pay ever so much\r\nmoney for such a man as Goarly, is what I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"Notoriety," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"He evidently don\'t know that Nickem has got round Goarly," said the\r\nlandlord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAT CHELTENHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month at Cheltenham was passed very quietly and would have been a\r\nvery happy month with Mary Masters but that there grew upon her from\r\nday to day increasing fears of what she would have to undergo when\r\nshe returned to Dillsborough. At the moment when she was hesitating\r\nwith Larry Twentyman, when she begged him to wait six months and then\r\nat last promised to give him an answer at the end of two, she had\r\nworked herself up to think that it might possibly be her duty to\r\naccept her lover for the sake of her family. At any rate she had at\r\nthat moment thought that the question of duty ought to be further\r\nconsidered, and therefore she had vacillated. When the two months\'\r\ndelay was accorded to her, and within that period the privilege of\r\na long absence from Dillsborough, she put the trouble aside for a\r\nwhile with the common feeling that the chapter of accidents might do\r\nsomething for her. Before she had reached Cheltenham the chapter of\r\naccidents had done much. When Reginald Morton told her that he could\r\nnot have congratulated her on such prospects, and had explained to\r\nher why in truth he had been angry at the bridge,--how he had been\r\nanxious to be alone with her that he might learn whether she were\r\nreally engaged to this man,--then she had known that her answer to\r\nLarry Twentyman at the end of the two months must be a positive\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\nBut as she became aware of this a new trouble arose and harassed her\r\nvery soul. When she had asked for the six months she had not at the\r\nmoment been aware, she had not then felt, that a girl who asks for\r\ntime is supposed to have already surrendered. But since she had made\r\nthat unhappy request the conviction had grown upon her. She had read\r\nit in every word her stepmother said to her and in her father\'s\r\nmanner. The very winks and hints and little jokes which fell from her\r\nyounger sisters told her that it was so. She could see around her the\r\nsatisfaction which had come from the settlement of that difficult\r\nquestion,--a satisfaction which was perhaps more apparent with her\r\nfather than even with the others. Then she knew what she had done,\r\nand remembered to have heard that a girl who expresses a doubt\r\nis supposed to have gone beyond doubting. While she was still at\r\nDillsborough there was a feeling that no evil would arise from this\r\nif she could at last make up her mind to be Mrs. Twentyman;--but when\r\nthe settled conviction came upon her, after hearing Reginald Morton\'s\r\nwords, then she was much troubled.\r\n\r\nHe stayed only a couple of days at Cheltenham and during that time\r\nsaid very little to her. He certainly spoke no word which would give\r\nher a right to think that he himself was attached to her. He had been\r\ninterested about her, as was his aunt, Lady Ushant, because she had\r\nbeen known and her mother had been known by the old Mortons. But\r\nthere was nothing of love in all that. She had never supposed that\r\nthere would be;--and yet there was a vague feeling in her bosom that\r\nas he had been strong in expressing his objection to Mr. Twentyman\r\nthere might have been something more to stir him than the memory of\r\nthose old days at Bragton!\r\n\r\n"To my thinking there is a sweetness about her which I have never\r\nseen equalled in any young woman." This was said by Lady Ushant to\r\nher nephew after Mary had gone to bed on the night before he left.\r\n\r\n"One would suppose," he answered, "that you wanted me to ask her to\r\nbe my wife."\r\n\r\n"I never want anything of that kind, Reg. I never make in such\r\nmatters,--or mar if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"There is a man at Dillsborough wants to marry her."\r\n\r\n"I can easily believe that there should be two or three. Who is the\r\nman?"\r\n\r\n"Do you remember old Twentyman of Chowton?"\r\n\r\n"He was our near neighbour. Of course I remember him. I can remember\r\nwell when they bought the land."\r\n\r\n"It is his son."\r\n\r\n"Surely he can hardly be worthy of her, Reg."\r\n\r\n"And yet they say he is very worthy. I have asked about him, and\r\nhe is not a bad fellow. He keeps his money and has ideas of living\r\ndecently. He doesn\'t drink or gamble. But he\'s not a gentleman or\r\nanything like one. I should think he never opens a book. Of course it\r\nwould be a degradation."\r\n\r\n"And what does Mary say herself?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy she has refused him." Then he added after a pause, "Indeed I\r\nknow she has."\r\n\r\n"How should you know? Has she told you?" In answer to this he\r\nonly nodded his head at the old lady. "There must have been close\r\nfriendship, Reg, between you two when she told you that. I hope you\r\nhave not made her give up one suitor by leading her to love another\r\nwho does not mean to ask her."\r\n\r\n"I certainly have not done that," said Reg. Men may often do much\r\nwithout knowing that they do anything, and such probably had been the\r\ncase with Reginald Morton during the journey from Dillsborough to\r\nCheltenham.\r\n\r\n"What would her father wish?"\r\n\r\n"They all want her to take the man."\r\n\r\n"How can she do better?"\r\n\r\n"Would you have her marry a man who is not a gentleman, whose wife\r\nwill never be visited by other ladies;--in marrying whom she would go\r\naltogether down into another and a lower world?"\r\n\r\nThis was a matter on which Lady Ushant and her nephew had conversed\r\noften, and he thought he knew her to be thoroughly wedded to the\r\nprivileges which she believed to be attached to her birth. With him\r\nthe same feeling was almost the stronger because he was so well aware\r\nof the blot upon himself caused by the lowness of his own father\'s\r\nmarriage. But a man, he held, could raise a woman to his own rank,\r\nwhereas a woman must accept the level of her husband.\r\n\r\n"Bread and meat and chairs and tables are very serious things, Reg."\r\n\r\n"You would then recommend her to take this man, and pass altogether\r\nout of your own sphere?"\r\n\r\n"What can I do for her? I am an old woman who will be dead probably\r\nbefore the first five years of her married life have passed over her.\r\nAnd as for recommending, I do not know enough to recommend anything.\r\nDoes she like the man?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure she would feel herself degraded by marrying him."\r\n\r\n"I trust she will never live to feel herself degraded. I do not\r\nbelieve that she could do anything that she thought would degrade\r\nher. But I think that you and I had better leave her to herself in\r\nthis matter." Further on in the same evening, or rather late in the\r\nnight,--for they had then sat talking together for hours over the\r\nfire,--she made a direct statement to him. "When I die, Reg, I have\r\nbut L5,000 to leave behind me, and this I have divided between you\r\nand her. I shall not tell her because I might do more harm than good.\r\nBut you may know."\r\n\r\n"That would make no difference to me," he said.\r\n\r\n"Very likely not, but I wish you to know it. What troubles me is\r\nthat she will have to pay so much out of it for legacy duty. I might\r\nleave it all to you and you could give it her." An honester or more\r\nreligious or better woman than old Lady Ushant there was not in\r\nCheltenham, but it never crossed her conscience that it would be\r\nwrong to cheat the revenue. It may be doubted whether any woman has\r\never been brought to such honesty as that.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Morton went away without saying another word\r\nin private to Mary Masters and she was left to her quiet life with\r\nthe old lady. To an ordinary visitor nothing could have been less\r\nexciting, for Lady Ushant very seldom went out and never entertained\r\ncompany. She was a tall thin old lady with bright eyes and grey hair\r\nand a face that was still pretty in spite of sunken eyes and sunken\r\ncheeks and wrinkled brow. There was ever present with her an air of\r\nmelancholy which told a whole tale of the sadness of a long life. Her\r\nchief excitement was in her two visits to church on Sunday and in the\r\nletter which she wrote every week to her nephew at Dillsborough. Now\r\nshe had her young friend with her, and that too was an excitement\r\nto her,--and the more so since she had heard the tidings of Larry\r\nTwentyman\'s courtship.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind that she would not speak on the subject to her\r\nyoung friend unless her young friend should speak to her. In the\r\nfirst three weeks nothing was said; but four or five days before\r\nMary\'s departure there came up a conversation about Dillsborough and\r\nBragton. There had been many conversations about Dillsborough and\r\nBragton, but in all of them the name of Lawrence Twentyman had been\r\nscrupulously avoided. Each had longed to name him, and yet each had\r\ndetermined not to do so. But at length it was avoided no longer. Lady\r\nUshant had spoken of Chowton Farm and the widow. Then Mary had spoken\r\nof the place and its inhabitants. "Mr. Twentyman comes a great deal\r\nto our house now," she said.\r\n\r\n"Has he any reason, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"He goes with papa once a week to the club; and he sometimes lends my\r\nsister Kate a pony. Kate is very fond of riding."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing else?"\r\n\r\n"He has got to be intimate and I think mamma likes him."\r\n\r\n"He is a good young man then?"\r\n\r\n"Very good;" said Mary with an emphasis.\r\n\r\n"And Chowton belongs to him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--it belongs to him."\r\n\r\n"Some young men make such ducks and drakes of their property when\r\nthey get it."\r\n\r\n"They say that he\'s not like that at all. People say that he\r\nunderstands farming very well and that he minds everything himself."\r\n\r\n"What an excellent young man! There is no other reason for his coming\r\nto your house, Mary?"\r\n\r\nThen the sluice-gates were opened and the whole story was told.\r\nSitting there late into the night Mary told it all as well as she\r\nknew how,--all of it except in regard to any spark of love which\r\nmight have fallen upon her in respect of Reginald Morton. Of Reginald\r\nMorton in her story of course she did not speak; but all the rest\r\nshe declared. She did not love the man. She was quite sure of that.\r\nThough she thought so well of him there was, she was quite sure, no\r\nfeeling in her heart akin to love. She had promised to take time\r\nbecause she had thought that she might perhaps be able to bring\r\nherself to marry him without loving him,--to marry him because her\r\nfather wished it, and because her going from home would be a relief\r\nto her stepmother and sisters, because it would be well for them\r\nall that she should be settled out of the way. But since that she\r\nhad made up her mind,--she thought that she had quite made up her\r\nmind,--that it would be impossible.\r\n\r\n"There is nobody else, Mary?" said Lady Ushant putting her hand on\r\nto Mary\'s lap. Mary protested that there was nobody else without any\r\nconsciousness that she was telling a falsehood. "And you are quite\r\nsure that you cannot do it?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I ought, Lady Ushant?"\r\n\r\n"I should be very sorry to say that, my dear. A young woman in such\r\na matter must be governed by her feelings. Only he seems to be a\r\ndeserving young man!" Mary looked askance at her friend, remembering\r\nat the moment Reginald Morton\'s assurance that his aunt would have\r\ndisapproved of such an engagement. "But I never would persuade a girl\r\nto marry a man she did not love. I think it would be wicked. I always\r\nthought so."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing about degradation in all this. It was quite clear\r\nto Mary that had she been able to tell Lady Ushant that she was head\r\nover ears in love with this young man and that therefore she was\r\ngoing to marry him, her old friend would have found no reason to\r\nlament such an arrangement. Her old friend would have congratulated\r\nher. Lady Ushant evidently thought Larry Twentyman to be good enough\r\nas soon as she heard what Mary found herself compelled to say in the\r\nyoung man\'s favour. Mary was almost disappointed; but reconciled\r\nherself to it very quickly, telling herself that there was yet time\r\nfor her to decide in favour of her lover if she could bring herself\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nAnd she did try that night and all the next day, thinking that if\r\nshe could so make up her mind she would declare her purpose to Lady\r\nUshant before she left Cheltenham. But she could not do it, and in\r\nthe struggle with herself at last she learned something of the truth.\r\nLady Ushant saw nothing but what was right and proper in a marriage\r\nwith Lawrence Twentyman, but Reginald Morton had declared it to be\r\nimproper, and therefore it was out of her reach. She could not do it.\r\nShe could not bring herself, after what he had said, to look him in\r\nthe face and tell him that she was going to become the wife of Larry\r\nTwentyman. Then she asked herself the fatal question;--was she in\r\nlove with Reginald Morton? I do not think that she answered it in the\r\naffirmative, but she became more and more sure that she could never\r\nmarry Larry Twentyman.\r\n\r\nLady Ushant declared herself to have been more than satisfied with\r\nthe visit and expressed a hope that it might be repeated in the next\r\nyear. "I would ask you to come and make your home here while I have\r\na home to offer you, only that you would be so much more buried here\r\nthan at Dillsborough. And you have duties there which perhaps you\r\nought not to leave. But come again when your papa will spare you."\r\n\r\nOn her journey back she certainly was not very happy. There were\r\nyet three weeks wanting to the time at which she would be bound to\r\ngive her answer to Larry Twentyman; but why should she keep the man\r\nwaiting for three weeks when her answer was ready? Her stepmother she\r\nknew would soon force her answer from her, and her father would be\r\nanxious to know what had been the result of her meditations. The real\r\nperiod of her reprieve had been that of her absence at Cheltenham,\r\nand that period was now come to an end. At each station as she\r\npassed them she remembered what Reginald Morton had been saying to\r\nher, and how their conversation had been interrupted,--and perhaps\r\noccasionally aided,--by the absurdities of the bird. How sweet it\r\nhad been to be near him and to listen to his whispered voice! How\r\ngreat was the difference between him and that other young man, the\r\nsmartness of whose apparel was now becoming peculiarly distasteful to\r\nher! Certainly it would have been better for her not to have gone to\r\nCheltenham if it was to be her fate to become Mrs. Twentyman. She was\r\nquite sure of that now.\r\n\r\nShe came up from the Dillsborough Station alone in the Bush omnibus.\r\nShe had not expected any one to meet her. Why should any one meet\r\nher? The porter put up her box and the omnibus left her at the door.\r\nBut she remembered well how she had gone down with Reginald Morton,\r\nand how delightful had been every little incident of the journey.\r\nEven to walk with him up and down the platform while waiting for the\r\ntrain had been a privilege. She thought of it as she got out of the\r\ncarriage and remembered that she had felt that the train had come too\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nAt her own door her father met her and took her into the parlour\r\nwhere the tea-things were spread, and where her sisters were already\r\nseated. Her stepmother soon came in and kissed her kindly. She was\r\nasked how she had enjoyed herself, and no disagreeable questions were\r\nput to her that night. No questions, at least, were asked which she\r\nfelt herself bound to answer. After she was in bed Kate came to her\r\nand did say a word. "Well, Mary, do tell me. I won\'t tell any one."\r\nBut Mary refused to speak a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE RUFFORD CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might be surmised from the description which Lord Rufford had\r\ngiven of his own position to his sister and his sister\'s two friends,\r\nwhen he pictured himself as falling over the edge of the precipice\r\nwhile they hung on behind to save him, that he was sufficiently aware\r\nof the inexpediency of the proposed intimacy with Miss Trefoil. Any\r\none hearing him would have said that Miss Trefoil\'s chances in that\r\ndirection were very poor,--that a man seeing his danger so plainly\r\nand so clearly understanding the nature of it would certainly avoid\r\nit. But what he had said was no more than Miss Trefoil knew that he\r\nwould say,--or, at any rate would think. Of course she had against\r\nher not only all his friends,--but the man himself also and his own\r\nfixed intentions. Lord Rufford was not a marrying man,--which was\r\nsupposed to signify that he intended to lead a life of pleasure till\r\nthe necessity of providing an heir should be forced upon him, when\r\nhe would take to himself a wife out of his own class in life twenty\r\nyears younger than himself for whom he would not care a straw. The\r\nodds against Miss Trefoil were of course great;--but girls have won\r\neven against such odds as these. She knew her own powers, and was\r\naware that Lord Rufford was fond of feminine beauty and feminine\r\nflutter and feminine flattery, though he was not prepared to marry.\r\nIt was quite possible that she might be able to dig such a pit for\r\nhim that it would be easier for him to marry her than to get out in\r\nany other way. Of course she must trust something to his own folly\r\nat first. Nor did she trust in vain. Before her week was over at Mrs.\r\nGore\'s she received from him a letter, which, with the correspondence\r\nto which it immediately led, shall be given in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   LETTER NO. 1.\r\n\r\n   Rufford, Sunday.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL,\r\n\r\n   We have had a sad house since you left us. Poor Caneback\r\n   got better and then worse and then better,--and at last\r\n   died yesterday afternoon. And now;--there is to be\r\n   the funeral! The poor dear old boy seems to have had\r\n   nobody belonging to him and very little in the way of\r\n   possessions. I never knew anything of him except that he\r\n   was, or had been, in the Blues, and that he was about the\r\n   best man in England to hounds on a bad horse. It now turns\r\n   out that his father made some money in India,--a sort\r\n   of Commissary purveyor,--and bought a commission for\r\n   him twenty-five years ago. Everybody knew him but nobody\r\n   knew anything about him. Poor old Caneback! I wish he\r\n   had managed to die anywhere else and I don\'t feel at all\r\n   obliged to Purefoy for sending that brute of a mare here.\r\n   He said something to me about that wretched ball;--not\r\n   altogether so wretched! was it? But I didn\'t like what\r\n   he said and told him a bit of my mind. Now we\'re two for\r\n   a while; and I don\'t care for how long unless he comes\r\n   round.\r\n\r\n   I cannot stand a funeral, and I shall get away from this.\r\n   I will pay the bill and Purefoy may do the rest. I\'m going\r\n   for Christmas to Surbiton\'s near Melton with a string of\r\n   horses. Surbiton is a bachelor, and as there will be no\r\n   young ladies to interfere with me I shall have the more\r\n   time to think of you. We shall have a little play there\r\n   instead. I don\'t know whether it isn\'t the better of the\r\n   two, as if one does get sat upon, one doesn\'t feel so\r\n   confoundedly sheep-faced. I have been out with the hounds\r\n   two or three times since you went, as I could do no good\r\n   staying with that poor fellow and there was a time when we\r\n   thought he would have pulled through. I rode Jack one day,\r\n   but he didn\'t carry me as well as he did you. I think he\'s\r\n   more of a lady\'s horse. If I go to Mistletoe I shall have\r\n   some horses somewhere in the neighbourhood and I\'ll make\r\n   them take Jack, so that you may have a chance.\r\n\r\n   I never know how to sign myself to young ladies. Suppose I\r\n   say that I am yours,\r\n\r\n   Anything you like best,\r\n\r\n   R.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a much nicer letter than Arabella had expected, as there\r\nwere one or two touches in it, apart from the dead man and the\r\nhorses, which she thought might lead to something,--and there was\r\na tone in the letter which seemed to show that he was given to\r\ncorrespondence. She took care to answer it so that he should get\r\nher letter on his arrival at Mr. Surbiton\'s house. She found out Mr.\r\nSurbiton\'s address, and then gave a great deal of time to her letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   LETTER NO. 2.\r\n\r\n   Murray\'s Hotel, Green Street,\r\n   Thursday.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LORD RUFFORD,\r\n\r\n   As we are passing through London on our way from one\r\n   purgatory with the Gores to another purgatory with old\r\n   Lady De Browne, and as mamma is asleep in her chair\r\n   opposite, and as I have nothing else on earth to do, I\r\n   think I might as well answer your letter. Poor old Major!\r\n   I am sorry for him, because he rode so bravely. I shall\r\n   never forget his face as he passed us, and again as he\r\n   rose upon his knee when that horrid blow came! How very\r\n   odd that he should have been like that, without any\r\n   friends. What a terrible nuisance to you! I think you were\r\n   quite wise to come away. I am sure I should have done so.\r\n   I can\'t conceive what right Sir John Purefoy can have had\r\n   to say anything, for after all it was his doing. Do you\r\n   remember when you talked of my riding Jemima? When I think\r\n   of it I can hardly hold myself for shuddering.\r\n\r\n   It is so kind of you to think of me about Jack. I am never\r\n   very fond of Mistletoe. Don\'t you be mischievous now\r\n   and tell the Duchess I said so. But with Jack in the\r\n   neighbourhood I can stand even her Grace. I think I shall\r\n   be there about the middle of January but it must depend on\r\n   all those people mamma is going to. I shall have to make a\r\n   great fight, for mamma thinks that ten days in the year at\r\n   Mistletoe is all that duty requires. But I always stick up\r\n   for my uncle, and mean in this instance to have a little\r\n   of my own way. What are parental commands in opposition to\r\n   Jack and all his glories? Besides mamma does not mean to\r\n   go herself.\r\n\r\n   I shall leave it to you to say whether the ball was\r\n   "altogether wretched." Of course there must have been\r\n   infinite vexation to you, and to us who knew of it all\r\n   there was a feeling of deep sorrow. But perhaps we were\r\n   able, some of us, to make it a little lighter for you. At\r\n   any rate I shall never forget Rufford, whether the memory\r\n   be more pleasant or more painful. There are moments which\r\n   one never can forget!\r\n\r\n   Don\'t go and gamble away your money among a lot of men.\r\n   Though I dare say you have got so much that it doesn\'t\r\n   signify whether you lose some of it or not. I do think it\r\n   is such a shame that a man like you should have such a\r\n   quantity, and that a poor girl such as I am shouldn\'t\r\n   have enough to pay for her hats and gloves. Why shouldn\'t\r\n   I send a string of horses about just when I please? I\r\n   believe I could make as good a use of them as you do, and\r\n   then I could lend you Jack. I would be so good-natured.\r\n   You should have Jack every day you wanted him.\r\n\r\n   You must write and tell me what day you will be at\r\n   Mistletoe. It is you that have tempted me and I don\'t mean\r\n   to be there without you,--or I suppose I ought to say,\r\n   without the horse. But of course you will have understood\r\n   that. No young lady ever is supposed to desire the\r\n   presence of any young man. It would be very improper of\r\n   course. But a young man\'s Jack is quite another thing.\r\n\r\nSo far her pen had flown with her, but then there came the necessity\r\nfor a conclusion which must be worded in some peculiar way, as his\r\nhad been so peculiar. How far might she dare to be affectionate\r\nwithout putting him on his guard? Or in what way might she be saucy\r\nso as best to please him? She tried two or three, and at last she\r\nended her letter as follows.\r\n\r\n   I have not had much experience in signing myself to young\r\n   gentlemen and am therefore quite in as great a difficulty\r\n   as you were; but, though I can\'t swear that I am\r\n   everything that you like best, I will protest that I am\r\n   pretty nearly what you ought to like,--as far as young\r\n   ladies go.\r\n\r\n   In the meantime I certainly am,\r\n\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n\r\n   A. T.\r\n\r\n   P.S. Mind you write--about Jack; and address to Lady\r\n   Smijth--Greenacres Manor--Hastings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal in this letter which was not true. But then\r\nsuch ladies as Miss Trefoil can never afford to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nThe letter was not written from Murray\'s Hotel, Lady Augustus having\r\ninsisted on staying at certain lodgings in Orchard Street because\r\nher funds were low. But on previous occasions they had stayed at\r\nMurray\'s. And her mamma, instead of being asleep when the letter was\r\nwritten, was making up her accounts. And every word about Mistletoe\r\nhad been false. She had not yet secured her invitation. She was\r\nhard at work on the attempt, having induced her father absolutely\r\nto beg the favour from his brother. But at the present moment she\r\nwas altogether diffident of success. Should she fail she must only\r\ntell Lord Rufford that her mother\'s numerous engagements had at the\r\nlast moment made her happiness impossible. That she was going to\r\nLady Smijth\'s was true, and at Lady Smijth\'s house she received the\r\nfollowing note from Lord Rufford. It was then January, and the great\r\nMistletoe question was not as yet settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n   LETTER NO. 3.\r\n\r\n   December 31.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL,\r\n\r\n   Here I am still at Surbiton\'s and we have had such good\r\n   sport that I\'m half inclined to give the Duke the slip.\r\n   What a pity that you can\'t come here instead. Wouldn\'t\r\n   it be nice for you and half a dozen more without any of\r\n   the Dowagers or Duennas? You might win some of the money\r\n   which I lose. I have been very unlucky and, if you had\r\n   won it all, there would be plenty of room for hats and\r\n   gloves,--and for sending two or three Jacks about all the\r\n   winter into the bargain. I never did win yet. I don\'t care\r\n   very much about it, but I don\'t know why I should always\r\n   be so uncommonly unlucky.\r\n\r\n   We had such a day yesterday,--an hour and ten minutes all\r\n   in the open, and then a kill just as the poor fellow was\r\n   trying to make a drain under the high road. There were\r\n   only five of us up. Surbiton broke his horse\'s back at\r\n   a bank, and young De Canute came down on to a road and\r\n   smashed his collar bone. Three or four of the hounds were\r\n   so done that they couldn\'t be got home. I was riding Black\r\n   Harry and he won\'t be out again for a fortnight. It was\r\n   the best thing I\'ve seen these two years. We never have it\r\n   quite like that with the U. R. U.\r\n\r\n   If I don\'t go to Mistletoe I\'ll send Jack and a groom if\r\n   you think the Duke would take them in and let you ride the\r\n   horse. If so I shall stay here pretty nearly all January,\r\n   unless there should be a frost. In that case I should go\r\n   back to Rufford as I have a deal of shooting to do. I\r\n   shall be so sorry not to see you;--but there is always a\r\n   sort of sin in not sticking to hunting when it\'s good. It\r\n   so seldom is just what it ought to be.\r\n\r\n   I rather think that after all we shall be down on that\r\n   fellow who poisoned our fox, in spite of your friend the\r\n   Senator.\r\n\r\n   Yours always faithfully,\r\n\r\n   R.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal in this letter which was quite terrible to\r\nMiss Trefoil. In the first place by the time she received it she had\r\nmanaged the matter with her uncle. Her father had altogether refused\r\nto mention Lord Rufford\'s name,--though he had heard the very plain\r\nproposition which his daughter made to him with perfect serenity. But\r\nhe had said to the Duke that it would be a great convenience if Bell\r\ncould be received at Mistletoe for a few days, and the Duke had got\r\nthe Duchess to assent. Lady Augustus, too, had been disposed of, and\r\ntwo very handsome new dresses had been acquired. Her habit had been\r\naltered with reckless disregard of the coming spring and she was\r\nfully prepared for her campaign. But what would Mistletoe be to her\r\nwithout Lord Rufford? In spite of all that had been done she would\r\nnot go there. Unless she could turn him by her entreaties she would\r\npack up everything and start for Patagonia, with the determination\r\nto throw herself overboard on the way there if she could find the\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nShe had to think very much of her next letter. Should she write in\r\nanger or should she write in love,--or should she mingle both? There\r\nwas no need for care now, as there had been at first. She must reach\r\nhim at once, or everything would be over. She must say something that\r\nwould bring him to Mistletoe, whatever that something might be. After\r\nmuch thought she determined that mingled anger and love would be the\r\nbest. So she mingled them as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   LETTER NO. 4.\r\n\r\n   Greenacre Manor, Monday.\r\n\r\n   Your last letter which I have just got has killed me. You\r\n   must know that I have altered my plans and done it at\r\n   immense trouble for the sake of meeting you at Mistletoe.\r\n   It will be most unkind,--I might say worse,--if you put me\r\n   off. I don\'t think you can do it as a gentleman. I\'m sure\r\n   you would not if you knew what I have gone through with\r\n   mamma and the whole set of them to arrange it. Of course\r\n   I shan\'t go if you don\'t come. Your talk of sending the\r\n   horse there is adding an insult to the injury. You must\r\n   have meant to annoy me or you wouldn\'t have pretended to\r\n   suppose that it was the horse I wanted to see. I didn\'t\r\n   think I could have taken so violent a dislike to poor Jack\r\n   as I did for a moment. Let me tell you that I think you\r\n   are bound to go to Mistletoe though the hunting at Melton\r\n   should be better than was ever known before. When the\r\n   hunting is good in one place of course it is good in\r\n   another. Even I am sportsman enough to know that. I\r\n   suppose you have been losing a lot of money and are\r\n   foolish enough to think you can win it back again.\r\n\r\n   Please, please come. It was to be the little cream of the\r\n   year for me. It wasn\'t Jack. There! That ought to bring\r\n   you. And yet, if you come, I will worship Jack. I have not\r\n   said a word to mamma about altering my plans, nor shall\r\n   I while there is a hope. But to Mistletoe I will not go,\r\n   unless you are to be there. Pray answer this by return of\r\n   post. If we have gone your letter will of course follow\r\n   us. Pray come. Yours if you do come--; what shall I say?\r\n   Fill it as you please.\r\n\r\n   A. T.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Rufford when he received the above very ardent epistle was\r\nquite aware that he had better not go to Mistletoe. He understood\r\nthe matter nearly as well as Arabella did herself. But there was a\r\nfeeling with him that up to that stage of the affair he ought to do\r\nwhat he was asked by a young lady, even though there might be danger.\r\nThough there was danger there would still be amusement. He therefore\r\nwrote again as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   LETTER NO. 5.\r\n\r\n   DEAR MISS TREFOIL,\r\n\r\n   You shan\'t be disappointed whether it be Jack or any less\r\n   useful animal that you wish to see. At any rate Jack,--and\r\n   the other animal,--will be at Mistletoe on the 15th. I\r\n   have written to the Duke by this post. I can only hope\r\n   that you will be grateful. After all your abuse about\r\n   my getting back my money I think you ought to be very\r\n   grateful. I have got it back again, but I can assure you\r\n   that has had nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\n   Yours ever,\r\n\r\n   R.\r\n\r\n   We had two miserably abortive days last week.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabella felt that a great deal of the compliment was taken away by\r\nthe postscript; but still she was grateful and contented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n"IT IS A LONG WAY."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the correspondence given in the last chapter was going on Miss\r\nTrefoil had other troubles besides those there narrated, and other\r\nletters to answer. Soon after her departure from Rufford she received\r\na very serious but still an affectionate epistle from John Morton\r\nin which he asked her if it was her intention to become his wife\r\nor not. The letter was very long as well as very serious and need\r\nnot be given here at length. But that was the gist of it; and he\r\nwent on to say that in regard to money he had made the most liberal\r\nproposition in his power, that he must decline to have any further\r\ncommunication with lawyers, and that he must ask her to let him know\r\nat once,--quite at once,--whether she did or did not regard herself\r\nas engaged to him. It was a manly letter and ended by a declaration\r\nthat as far as he himself was concerned his feelings were not at\r\nall altered. This she received while staying at the Gores\', but, in\r\naccordance with her predetermined strategy, did not at once send any\r\nanswer to it. Before she heard again from Morton she had received\r\nthat pleasant first letter from Lord Rufford, and was certainly\r\nthen in no frame of mind to assure Mr. Morton that she was ready\r\nto declare herself his affianced wife before all the world. Then,\r\nafter ten days, he had written to her again and had written much more\r\nseverely. It wanted at that time but a few days to Christmas, and she\r\nwas waiting for a second letter from Lord Rufford. Let what might\r\ncome of it she could not now give up the Rufford chance. As she\r\nsat thinking of it, giving the very best of her mind to it, she\r\nremembered the warmth of that embrace in the little room behind the\r\ndrawing-room, and those halcyon minutes in which her head had been on\r\nhis shoulder, and his arm round her waist. Not that they were made\r\nhalcyon to her by any of the joys of love. In giving the girl her due\r\nit must be owned that she rarely allowed herself to indulge in simple\r\npleasures. If Lord Rufford, with the same rank and property, had been\r\npersonally disagreeable to her it would have been the same. Business\r\nto her had for many years been business, and her business had been\r\nso very hard that she had never allowed lighter things to interfere\r\nwith it. She had had justice on her side when she rebuked her mother\r\nfor accusing her of flirtations. But could such a man as Lord\r\nRufford--with his hands so free,--venture to tell himself that such\r\ntokens of affection with such a girl would mean nothing? If she might\r\ncontrive to meet him again of course they would be repeated, and\r\nthen he should be forced to say that they did mean something. When\r\ntherefore the severe letter came from Morton,--severe and pressing,\r\ntelling her that she was bound to answer him at once and that were\r\nshe still silent he must in regard to his own honour take that as an\r\nindication of her intention to break off the match,--she felt that\r\nshe must answer it. The answer must, however, still be ambiguous. She\r\nwould not if possible throw away that stool quite as yet, though her\r\nmind was intent on ascending to the throne which it might be within\r\nher power to reach. She wrote to him an ambiguous letter,--but a\r\nletter which certainly was not intended to liberate him. "He ought,"\r\nshe said, "to understand that a girl situated as she was could not\r\nultimately dispose of herself till her friends had told her that she\r\nwas free to do so. She herself did not pretend to have any interest\r\nin the affairs as to which her father and his lawyers were making\r\nthemselves busy. They had never even condescended to tell her what it\r\nwas they wanted on her behalf;--nor, for the matter of that, had he,\r\nMorton, ever told her what it was that he refused to do. Of course\r\nshe could not throw herself into his arms till these things were\r\nsettled."--By that expression she had meant a metaphorical throwing\r\nof herself, and not such a flesh and blood embracing as she had\r\npermitted to the lord in the little room at Rufford. Then she\r\nsuggested that he should appeal again to her father. It need hardly\r\nbe said that her father knew very little about it, and that the\r\nlawyers had long since written to Lady Augustus to say that better\r\nterms as to settlement could not be had from Mr. John Morton.\r\n\r\nMorton, when he wrote his second letter, had received the offer of\r\nthe mission to Patagonia and had asked for a few days to think of it.\r\nAfter much consideration he had determined that he would say nothing\r\nto Arabella of the offer. Her treatment of him gave her no right to\r\nbe consulted. Should she at once write back declaring her readiness\r\nto become his wife, then he would consult her,--and would not only\r\nconsult her but would be prepared to abandon the mission at the\r\nexpression of her lightest wish. Indeed in that case he thought that\r\nhe would himself advise that it should be abandoned. Why should he\r\nexpatriate himself to such a place with such a wife as Arabella\r\nTrefoil? He received her answer and at once accepted the offer.\r\nHe accepted it, though he by no means assured himself that the\r\nengagement was irrevocably annulled. But now, if she came to him, she\r\nmust take her chance. She must be told that he at any rate was going\r\nto Patagonia, and that unless she could make up her mind to do so\r\ntoo, she must remain Arabella Trefoil for him. He would not even tell\r\nher of his appointment. He had done all that in him lay and would\r\nprepare himself for his journey as a single man. A minister going\r\nout to Patagonia would of course have some little leave of absence\r\nallowed him, and he arranged with his friend Mounser Green that he\r\nshould not start till April.\r\n\r\nBut when Lord Rufford\'s second letter reached Miss Trefoil down at\r\nGreenacre Manor, where she had learned by common report that Mr.\r\nMorton was to be the new minister at Patagonia,--when she believed as\r\nshe then did that the lord was escaping her, that, seeing and feeling\r\nhis danger, he had determined not to jump into the lion\'s mouth by\r\nmeeting her at Mistletoe, that her chance there was all over; then\r\nshe remembered her age, her many seasons, the hard work of her\r\ntoilet, those tedious long and bitter quarrels with her mother, the\r\never-renewed trouble of her smiles, the hopelessness of her future\r\nshould she smile in vain to the last, and the countless miseries of\r\nher endless visitings; and she remembered too the L1200 a year that\r\nMorton had offered to settle on her and the assurance of a home of\r\nher own though that home should be at Bragton. For an hour or two she\r\nhad almost given up the hope of Rufford and had meditated some letter\r\nto her other lover which might at any rate secure him. But she had\r\ncollected her courage sufficiently to make that last appeal to the\r\nlord, which had been successful. Three weeks now might settle all\r\nthat and for three weeks it might still be possible so to manage her\r\naffairs that she might fall back upon Patagonia as her last resource.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Morton returned to Bragton, waiting however till he\r\nwas assured that the Senator had completed his visit to Dillsborough.\r\nHe had been a little ashamed of the Senator in regard to the great\r\nGoarly conflict and was not desirous of relieving his solitude by the\r\npresence of the American. On this occasion he went quite alone and\r\nordered no carriages from the Bush and no increased establishment\r\nof servants. He certainly was not happy in his mind. The mission to\r\nPatagonia was well paid, being worth with house and etceteras nearly\r\nL3000 a year; and it was great and quick promotion for one so young\r\nas himself. For one neither a lord nor connected with a Cabinet\r\nMinister Patagonia was a great place at which to begin his career\r\nas Plenipotentiary on his own bottom;--but it is a long way off and\r\nhas its drawbacks. He could not look to be there for less than four\r\nyears; and there was hardly reason why a man in his position should\r\nexpatriate himself to such a place for so long a time. He felt that\r\nhe should not have gone but for his engagement to Arabella Trefoil,\r\nand that neither would he have gone had his engagement been solid\r\nand permanent. He was going in order that he might be rid of that\r\ntrouble, and a man\'s feelings in such circumstances cannot be\r\nsatisfactory to himself. However he had said that he would go, and he\r\nknew enough of himself to be certain that having said so he would not\r\nalter his mind. But he was very melancholy and Mrs. Hopkins declared\r\nto old Mrs. Twentyman that the young squire was "hipped,"--"along of\r\nhis lady love," as she thought.\r\n\r\nHis hands had been so full of his visitors when at Bragton before,\r\nand he had been carried off so suddenly to Rufford, and then had\r\nhurried up to London in such misery, that he had hardly had time to\r\nattend to his own business. Mr. Masters had made a claim upon him\r\nsince he had been in England for L127 8_s._ 4_d._ in reference to\r\ncertain long-gone affairs in which the attorney declared he had been\r\nbadly treated by those who had administered the Morton estate. John\r\nMorton had promised to look into the matter and to see Mr. Masters.\r\nHe had partially looked into it and now felt ashamed that he had not\r\nfully kept his promise. The old attorney had not had much hope of\r\ngetting his money. It was doubtful to himself whether he could make\r\ngood his claim against the Squire at law, and it was his settled\r\npurpose to make no such attempt although he was quite sure that the\r\nmoney was his due. Indeed if Mr. Morton would not do anything further\r\nin the matter, neither would he. He was almost too mild a man to be a\r\nsuccessful lawyer, and had a dislike to asking for money. Mr. Morton\r\nhad promised to see him, but Mr. Morton had probably--forgotten it.\r\nSome gentlemen seem apt to forget such promises.\r\n\r\nMr. Masters was somewhat surprised therefore when he was told one\r\nmorning in his office that Mr. Morton from Bragton wished to see him.\r\nHe thought that it must be Reginald Morton, having not heard that\r\nthe Squire had returned to the country. But John Morton was shown\r\ninto the office, and the old attorney immediately arose from his\r\narm-chair. Sundown was there, and was at once sent out of the room.\r\nSundown on such occasions was accustomed to retire to some settlement\r\nseldom visited by the public which was called the back office. Nickem\r\nwas away intent on unravelling the Goarly mystery, and the attorney\r\ncould ask his visitor to take a confidential seat. Mr. Morton however\r\nhad very little to say. He was full of apologies and at once handed\r\nout a cheque for the sum demanded. The money was so much to the\r\nattorney that he was flurried by his own success. "Perhaps," said\r\nMorton, "I ought in fairness to add interest."\r\n\r\n"Not at all;--by no means. Lawyers never expect that. Really, Mr.\r\nMorton, I am very much obliged. It was so long ago that I thought\r\nthat perhaps you might think--"\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt that it\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Morton--it is all right. It is quite right. But your coming\r\nin this way is quite a compliment. I am so proud to see the owner of\r\nBragton once more in this house. I respect the family as I always\r\ndid; and as for the money--"\r\n\r\n"I am only sorry that it has been delayed so long. Good morning, Mr.\r\nMasters."\r\n\r\nThe attorney\'s affairs were in such a condition that an unexpected\r\ncheque for L127 8_s._ 4_d._ sufficed to exhilarate him. It was as\r\nthough the money had come down to him from the very skies. As it\r\nhappened Mary returned from Cheltenham on that same evening and the\r\nattorney felt that if she had brought back with her an intention to\r\nbe Mrs. Twentyman he could still be a happy and contented man.\r\n\r\nAnd there had been another trouble on John Morton\'s mind. He had\r\nreceived his cousin\'s card but had not returned the visit while his\r\ngrandmother had been at Bragton. Now he walked on to Hoppet Hall and\r\nknocked at the door.--Yes;--Mr. Morton was at home, and then he was\r\nshown into the presence of his cousin whom he had not seen since he\r\nwas a boy. "I ought to have come sooner," said the Squire, who was\r\nhardly at his ease.\r\n\r\n"I heard you had a house full of people at Bragton."\r\n\r\n"Just that,--and then I went off rather suddenly to the other side\r\nof the country; and then I had to go up to London. Now I\'m going to\r\nPatagonia."\r\n\r\n"Patagonia! That\'s a long way off."\r\n\r\n"We Foreign Office slaves have to be sent a long way off."\r\n\r\n"But we heard, John," said Reginald, who did not feel it to be his\r\nduty to stand on any ceremony with his younger cousin,--"we heard\r\nthat you were going to be married to Miss Trefoil. Are you going to\r\ntake a wife out to Patagonia?"\r\n\r\nThis was a question which he certainly had not expected. "I don\'t\r\nknow how that may be," he said frowning.\r\n\r\n"We were told here in Dillsborough that it was all settled. I hope I\r\nhaven\'t asked an improper question."\r\n\r\n"Of course people will talk."\r\n\r\n"If it\'s only talk I beg pardon. Whatever concerns Bragton is\r\ninteresting to me, and from the way in which I heard this I thought\r\nit was a certainty. Patagonia;--well! You don\'t want an assistant\r\nprivate secretary I suppose? I should like to see Patagonia."\r\n\r\n"We are not allowed to appoint those gentlemen ourselves."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose I should be too old to get in at the bottom. It seems\r\na long way off for a man who is the owner of Bragton."\r\n\r\n"It is a long way."\r\n\r\n"And what will you do with the old place?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one to live there. If you were married you might perhaps\r\ntake it." This was of course said in joke, as old Mrs. Morton would\r\nhave thought Bragton to be disgraced for ever, even by such a\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n"You might let it."\r\n\r\n"Who would take such a place for five years? I suppose old Mrs.\r\nHopkins will remain, and that it will become more and more desolate\r\nevery year. I mustn\'t let the old house tumble down;--that\'s all."\r\nThen the Minister Plenipotentiary to Patagonia took his departure and\r\nwalked back to Bragton thinking of the publicity of his engagement.\r\nAll Dillsborough had heard that he was to be married to Miss Trefoil,\r\nand this cousin of his had been so sure of the fact that he had not\r\nhesitated to ask a question about it in the first moment of their\r\nfirst interview. Under such circumstances it would be better for him\r\nto go to Patagonia than to remain in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF PERSECUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mary Masters got up on the morning after her arrival she knew\r\nthat she would have to endure much on that day. Everybody had smiled\r\non her the preceding evening, but the smiles were of a nature which\r\ndeclared themselves to be preparatory to some coming event. The\r\npeople around her were gracious on the presumption that she was\r\ngoing to do as they wished, and would be quite prepared to withdraw\r\ntheir smiles should she prove to be contumacious. Mary, as she crept\r\ndown in the morning, understood all this perfectly. She found her\r\nstepmother alone in the parlour and was at once attacked with the all\r\nimportant question. "My dear, I hope you have made up your mind about\r\nMr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"There were to be two months, mamma."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, Mary. Of course you must know what you mean to tell\r\nhim." Mary thought that she did know, but was not at the present\r\nmoment disposed to make known her knowledge and therefore remained\r\nsilent. "You should remember how much this is to your papa and me and\r\nshould speak out at once. Of course you need not tell Mr. Twentyman\r\ntill the end of the time unless you like it."\r\n\r\n"I thought I was to be left alone for two months."\r\n\r\n"Mary, that is wicked. When your papa has so many things to think of\r\nand so much to provide for, you should be more thoughtful of him. Of\r\ncourse he will want to be prepared to give you what things will be\r\nnecessary." Mrs. Masters had not as yet heard of Mr. Morton\'s cheque,\r\nand perhaps would not hear of it till her husband\'s bank book fell\r\ninto her hands. The attorney had lately found it necessary to keep\r\nsuch matters to himself when it was possible, as otherwise he was\r\nasked for explanations which it was not always easy for him to give.\r\n"You know," continued Mrs. Masters, "how hard your father finds it to\r\nget money as it is wanted."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want anything, mamma."\r\n\r\n"You must want things if you are to be married in March or April."\r\n\r\n"But I shan\'t be married in March or April. Oh, mamma, pray don\'t."\r\n\r\n"In a week\'s time or so you must tell Larry. After all that has\r\npassed of course he won\'t expect to have to wait long, and you can\'t\r\nask him. Kate, my dear,"--Kate had just entered the room,--"go into\r\nthe office and tell your father to come into breakfast in five\r\nminutes. You must know, Mary, and I insist on your telling me."\r\n\r\n"When I said two months,--only it was he said two months--"\r\n\r\n"What difference does it make, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"It was only because he asked me to put it off. I knew it could make\r\nno difference."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me, Mary, that you are going to refuse him after\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it," said Mary, bursting out into tears.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t help it! Did anybody ever see such an idiot since girls were\r\nfirst created? Not help it, after having given him as good as a\r\npromise! You must help it. You must be made to help it."\r\n\r\nThere was an injustice in this which nearly killed poor Mary. She had\r\nbeen persuaded among them to put off her final decision, not because\r\nshe had any doubt in her own mind, but at their request, and now she\r\nwas told that in granting this delay she had "given as good as a\r\npromise!" And her stepmother also had declared that she "must be made\r\nto help it,"--or in other words be made to marry Mr. Twentyman in\r\nopposition to her own wishes! She was quite sure that no human being\r\ncould have such right of compulsion over her. Her father would not\r\nattempt it, and it was, after all, to her father alone, that she was\r\nbound by duty. At the moment she could make no reply, and then her\r\nfather with the two girls came in from the office.\r\n\r\nThe attorney was still a little radiant with his triumph about the\r\ncheque and was also pleased with his own discernment in the matter\r\nof Goarly. He had learned that morning from Nickem that Goarly\r\nhad consented to take 7_s._ 6_d._ an acre from Lord Rufford and\r\nwas prepared to act "quite the honourable part" on behalf of his\r\nlordship. Nickem had seemed to think that the triumph would not end\r\nhere, but had declined to make any very definite statements. Nickem\r\nclearly fancied that he had been doing great things himself, and that\r\nhe might be allowed to have a little mystery. But the attorney took\r\ngreat credit to himself in that he had rejected Goarly\'s case, and\r\nhad been employed by Lord Rufford in lieu of Goarly. When he entered\r\nthe parlour he had for the moment forgotten Larry Twentyman, and was\r\ndisposed to greet his girl lovingly;--but he found her dissolved in\r\nbitter tears. "Mary, my darling, what is it ails you?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Never mind about your darling now, but come to breakfast. She is\r\ngiving herself airs,--as usual."\r\n\r\nBut Mary never did give herself airs and her father could not endure\r\nthe accusation. "She would not be crying," he said, "unless she had\r\nsomething to cry for."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t make a fuss about things you don\'t understand," said his\r\nwife. "Mary, are you coming to the table? If not you had better go\r\nup-stairs. I hate such ways, and I won\'t have them. This comes of\r\nUshanting! I knew what it would be. The place for girls is to stay\r\nat home and mind their work,--till they have got houses of their own\r\nto look after. That\'s what I intend my girls to do. There\'s nothing\r\non earth so bad for girls as that twiddle-your-thumbs visiting about\r\nwhen they think they\'ve nothing to do but to show what sort of\r\nribbons and gloves they\'ve got. Now, Dolly, if you\'ve got any hands\r\nwill you cut the bread for your father? Mary\'s a deal too fine a\r\nlady to do anything but sit there and rub her eyes." After that the\r\nbreakfast was eaten in silence.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over Mary followed her father into the office and\r\nsaid that she wanted to speak to him. When Sundown had disappeared\r\nshe told her tale. "Papa," she said, "I am so sorry, but I can\'t do\r\nwhat you want about Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"Is it so, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be angry with me, papa."\r\n\r\n"Angry! No;--I won\'t be angry. I should be very sorry to be\r\nangry with my girl. But what you tell me will make us all very\r\nunhappy;--very unhappy indeed. What will you say to Lawrence\r\nTwentyman?"\r\n\r\n"What I said before, papa."\r\n\r\n"But he is quite certain now that you mean to take him. Of course we\r\nwere all certain when you only wanted a few more days to think of\r\nit." Mary felt this to be the cruellest thing of all. "When he asked\r\nme I said I wouldn\'t pledge you, but I certainly had no doubt. What\r\nis the matter, Mary?"\r\n\r\nShe could understand that a girl might be asked why she wanted to\r\nmarry a man, and that in such a condition she ought to be able to\r\ngive a reason; but it was she thought very hard that she should be\r\nasked why she didn\'t want to marry a man. "I suppose, papa," she said\r\nafter a pause, "I don\'t like him in that way."\r\n\r\n"Your mamma will be sure to say that it is because you went to Lady\r\nUshant\'s."\r\n\r\nAnd so in part it was,--as Mary herself very well knew; though Lady\r\nUshant herself had had nothing to do with it. "Lady Ushant," she\r\nsaid, "would be very well pleased,--if she thought that I liked him\r\nwell enough."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell Lady Ushant?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I told her all about it,--and how you would all be pleased. And\r\nI did try to bring myself to it. Papa,--pray, pray don\'t want to send\r\nme away from you."\r\n\r\n"You would be so near to us all at Chowton Farm!"\r\n\r\n"I am nearer here, papa." Then she embraced him, and he in a manner\r\nyielded to her. He yielded to her so far as to part with her at the\r\npresent moment with soft loving words.\r\n\r\nMrs. Masters had a long conversation with her husband on the subject\r\nthat same day, and condescended even to say a few words to the\r\ntwo girls. She had her own theory and her own plan in the present\r\nemergency. According to her theory girls shouldn\'t be indulged in any\r\nvagaries, and this rejecting of a highly valuable suitor was a most\r\ninexcusable vagary. And, if her plan were followed, a considerable\r\namount of wholesome coercion would at once be exercised towards this\r\nrefractory young woman. There was in fact more than a fortnight\r\nwanting to the expiration of Larry\'s two months, and Mrs. Masters was\r\nstrongly of opinion that if Mary were put into a sort of domestic\r\n"Coventry" during this period, if she were debarred from friendly\r\nintercourse with the family and made to feel that such wickedness as\r\nhers, if continued, would make her an outcast, then she would come\r\nround and accept Larry Twentyman before the end of the time. But this\r\nplan could not be carried out without her husband\'s co-operation.\r\nWere she to attempt it single-handed, Mary would take refuge in her\r\nfather\'s softness of heart and there would simply be two parties in\r\nthe household. "If you would leave her to me and not speak to her, it\r\nwould be all right," Mrs. Masters said to her husband.\r\n\r\n"Not speak to her!"\r\n\r\n"Not cosset her and spoil her for the next week or two. Just leave\r\nher to herself and let her feel what she\'s doing. Think what Chowton\r\nFarm would be, and you with your business all slipping through your\r\nfingers."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it\'s slipping through my fingers at all," said the\r\nattorney mindful of his recent successes.\r\n\r\n"If you mean to say you don\'t care about it--!"\r\n\r\n"I do care about it very much. You know I do. You ought not to talk\r\nto me in that way."\r\n\r\n"Then why won\'t you be said by me? Of course if you cocker her up,\r\nshe\'ll think she\'s to have her own way like a grand lady. She don\'t\r\nlike him because he works for his bread,--that\'s what it is; and\r\nbecause she\'s been taught by that old woman to read poetry. I never\r\nknew that stuff do any good to anybody. I hate them fandangled lines\r\nthat are all cut up short to make pretence. If she wants to read why\r\ncan\'t she take the cookery book and learn something useful? It just\r\ncomes to this;--if you want her to marry Larry Twentyman you had\r\nbetter not notice her for the next fortnight. Let her go and come and\r\nsay nothing to her. She\'ll think about it, if she\'s left to herself."\r\n\r\nThe attorney did want his daughter to marry the man and was half\r\nconvinced by his wife. He could not bring himself to be cruel and\r\nfelt that his heart would bleed every hour of the day that he\r\nseparated himself from his girl;--but still he thought that he might\r\nperhaps best in this way bring about a result which would be so\r\nmanifestly for her advantage. It might be that the books of poetry\r\nand the modes of thought which his wife described as "Ushanting" were\r\nof a nature to pervert his girl\'s mind from the material necessities\r\nof life and that a little hardship would bring her round to a more\r\nrational condition. With a very heavy heart he consented to do his\r\npart,--which was to consist mainly of silence. Any words which might\r\nbe considered expedient were to come from his wife.\r\n\r\nThree or four days went on in this way, which were days of absolute\r\nmisery to Mary. She soon perceived and partly understood her father\'s\r\nsilence. She knew at any rate that for the present she was debarred\r\nfrom his confidence. Her mother did not say much, but what she did\r\nsay was all founded on the theory that Ushanting and softness in\r\ngeneral are very bad for young women. Even Dolly and Kate were hard\r\nto her,--each having some dim idea that Mary was to be coerced\r\ntowards Larry Twentyman and her own good. At the end of that time,\r\nwhen Mary had been at home nearly a week, Larry came as usual on the\r\nSaturday evening. She, well knowing his habit, took care to be out of\r\nthe way. Larry, with a pleasant face, asked after her, and expressed\r\na hope that she had enjoyed herself at Cheltenham.\r\n\r\n"A nasty idle place where nobody does anything as I believe," said\r\nMrs. Masters. Larry received a shock from the tone of the lady\'s\r\nvoice. He had allowed himself to think that all his troubles were\r\nnow nearly over, but the words and the voice frightened him. He had\r\ntold himself that he was not to speak of his love again till the two\r\nmonths were over, and like an honourable man he was prepared to wait\r\nthe full time. He would not now have come to the attorney\'s house but\r\nthat he knew the attorney would wait for him before going over to the\r\nclub. He had no right to draw deductions till the time should be up.\r\nBut he could not help his own feelings and was aware that his heart\r\nsank within him when he was told that Cheltenham was a nasty idle\r\nplace. Abuse of Cheltenham at the present moment was in fact abuse of\r\nMary;--and the one sin which Mary could commit was persistence in her\r\nrejection of his suit. But he determined to be a man as he walked\r\nacross the street with his old friend, and said not a word about\r\nhis love. "They tell me that Goarly has taken his 7_s._ 6_d._, Mr.\r\nMasters."\r\n\r\n"Of course he has taken it, Larry. The worse luck for me. If he had\r\ngone on I might have had a bill against his Lordship as long as my\r\narm. Now it won\'t be worth looking after."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you\'re very glad, Mr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes; I am glad. I do hate to see a fellow like that who hasn\'t\r\ngot a farthing of his own, propped up from behind just to annoy his\r\nbetters."\r\n\r\n"They say that Bearside got a lot of money out of that American."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he got something."\r\n\r\n"What an idiot that man must be. Can you understand it, Mr. Masters?"\r\n\r\nThey now entered the club and Goarly and Nickem and Scrobby were of\r\ncourse being discussed. "Is it true, Mr. Masters, that Scrobby is to\r\nbe arrested?" asked Fred Botsey at once.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I can\'t say, Mr. Botsey; but if you tell me it is so I\r\nshan\'t cry my eyes out."\r\n\r\n"I thought you would have known."\r\n\r\n"A gentleman may know a thing, Mr. Botsey," said the landlord, "and\r\nnot exactly choose to tell it."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t suppose there was any secret," said the brewer. As Mr.\r\nMasters made no further remark it was of course conceived that he\r\nknew all about it and he was therefore treated with some increased\r\ndeference. But there was on that night great triumph in the club as\r\nit was known as a fact that Goarly had withdrawn his claim, and that\r\nthe American Senator had paid his money for nothing. It was moreover\r\nvery generally believed that Goarly was going to turn evidence\r\nagainst Scrobby in reference to the poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMARY\'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silent system in regard to Mary was carried on in the attorney\'s\r\nhouse for a week, during which her sufferings were very great. From\r\nthe first she made up her mind to oppose her stepmother\'s cruelty by\r\nsheer obstinacy. She had been told that she must be made to marry\r\nMr. Twentyman, and the injustice of that threat had at once made\r\nher rebel against her stepmother\'s authority. She would never allow\r\nher stepmother to make her marry any one. She put herself into a\r\nstate of general defiance and said as little as was said to her. But\r\nher father\'s silence to her nearly broke her heart. On one or two\r\noccasions, as opportunity offered itself to her, she said little soft\r\nwords to him in privacy. Then he would partly relent, would kiss her\r\nand bid her be a good girl, and would quickly hurry away from her.\r\nShe could understand that he suffered as well as herself, and she\r\nperhaps got some consolation from the conviction. At last, on the\r\nfollowing Saturday she watched her opportunity and brought to him\r\nwhen he was alone in his office a letter which she had written to\r\nLarry Twentyman. "Papa," she said, "would you read that?" He took and\r\nread the letter, which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. TWENTYMAN,\r\n\r\n   Something was said about two months which are now very\r\n   nearly over. I think I ought to save you from the trouble\r\n   of coming to me again by telling you in a letter that it\r\n   cannot be as you would have it. I have thought of it a\r\n   great deal and have of course been anxious to do as my\r\n   friends wish. And I am very grateful to you, and know how\r\n   good and how kind you are. And I would do anything for\r\n   you,--except this. But it never can be. I should not write\r\n   like this unless I were quite certain. I hope you won\'t be\r\n   angry with me and think that I should have spared you the\r\n   trouble of doubting so long. I know now that I ought not\r\n   to have doubted at all; but I was so anxious not to seem\r\n   to be obstinate that I became foolish about it when you\r\n   asked me. What I say now is quite certain.\r\n\r\n   Dear Mr. Twentyman, I shall always think of you with\r\n   esteem and regard, because I know how good you are; and\r\n   I hope you will come to like somebody a great deal better\r\n   than me who will always love you with her whole heart.\r\n\r\n   Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n   MARY MASTERS.\r\n\r\n   P.S. I shall show this letter to papa.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Masters read it as she stood by him,--and then read it again very\r\nslowly rubbing one hand over the other as he did so. He was thinking\r\nwhat he should do;--or rather what he should say. The idea of\r\nstopping the letter never occurred to him. If she chose to refuse\r\nthe man of course she must do so; and perhaps, if she did refuse him,\r\nthere was no way better than this. "Must it be so, Mary?" he said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I do not love him as I should have to love any man that I\r\nwanted to marry. I have tried it, because you wished it, but I cannot\r\ndo it."\r\n\r\n"What will mamma say?"\r\n\r\n"I am thinking more, papa, of you," she said putting her arm over his\r\nshoulder. "You have always been so good to me, and so kind!" Here his\r\nheart misgave him, for he felt that during the last week he had not\r\nbeen kind to her. "But you would not wish me to give myself to a man\r\nand then not to care for him."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t do it. I should fall down dead first. I have thought\r\nso much about it,--for your sake; and have tried it with myself. I\r\ncouldn\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Is there anybody else, Mary?" As he asked the question he held her\r\nhand beneath his own on the desk, but he did not dare to look into\r\nher face. He had been told by his wife that there was somebody\r\nelse;--that the girl\'s mind was running upon Mr. Surtees, because\r\nMr. Surtees was a gentleman. He was thinking of Mr. Surtees, and\r\ncertainly not of Reginald Morton.\r\n\r\nTo her the moment was very solemn and when the question was asked\r\nshe felt that she could not tell her father a falsehood. She had\r\ngradually grown bold enough to assure herself that her heart was\r\noccupied with that man who had travelled with her to Cheltenham; and\r\nshe felt that that feeling alone must keep her apart from any other\r\nlove. And yet, as she had no hope, as she had assured herself that\r\nher love was a burden to be borne and could never become a source\r\nof enjoyment, why should her secret be wrested from her? What good\r\nwould such a violation do? But she could not tell the falsehood, and\r\ntherefore she held her tongue.\r\n\r\nGradually he looked up into her face, still keeping her hand pressed\r\non the desk under his. It was his left hand that so guarded her,\r\nwhile she stood by his right shoulder. Then he gently wound his right\r\narm round her waist and pressed her to him. "Mary," he said, "if it\r\nis so, had you not better tell me?" But she was sure that she had\r\nbetter not mention that name even to him. It was impossible that she\r\nshould mention it. She would have outraged to herself her own maiden\r\nmodesty by doing so. "Is it,"--he asked very softly,--"is it--Mr.\r\nSurtees?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" she said quickly, almost escaping from the grasp of his arm\r\nin her start.\r\n\r\nThen he was absolutely at a loss. Beyond Mr. Surtees or Larry\r\nTwentyman he did not know what possible lover Dillsborough could have\r\nafforded. And yet the very rapidity of her answer when the curate\'s\r\nname had been mentioned had convinced him that there was some other\r\nperson,--had increased the strength of that conviction which her\r\nsilence had produced. "Have you nothing that you can tell me, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa." Then he gave her back the letter and she left the room\r\nwithout another word. Of course his sanction to the letter had now\r\nbeen given, and it was addressed to Chowton Farm and posted before\r\nhalf an hour was over. She saw him again in the afternoon of the same\r\nday and asked him to tell her stepmother what she had done. "Mamma\r\nought to know," she said.\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t sent it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa;--it is in the post."\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to him that his wife would tell him that he should\r\nhave prevented the sending of the letter,--that he should have\r\ndestroyed it and altogether taken the matter with a high hand. "You\r\ncan\'t tell her yourself?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I would rather you did. Mamma has been so hard to me since I came\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nHe did tell his wife and she overwhelmed him by the violence of her\r\nreproaches. He could never have been in earnest, or he would not have\r\nallowed such a letter as that to pass through his hands. He must be\r\nafraid of his own child. He did not know his own duty. He had been\r\ndeceiving her,--his wife,--from first to last. Then she threw herself\r\ninto a torrent of tears declaring that she had been betrayed. There\r\nhad been a conspiracy between them, and now everything might go to\r\nthe dogs, and she would not lift up her hands again to save them. But\r\nbefore the evening came round she was again on the alert, and again\r\nresolved that she would not even yet give way. What was there in a\r\nletter more than in a spoken word? She would tell Larry to disregard\r\nthe letter. But first she made a futile attempt to clutch the letter\r\nfrom the guardianship of the Post Office, and she went to the\r\nPostmaster assuring him that there had been a mistake in the family,\r\nthat a wrong letter had been put into a wrong envelope, and begging\r\nthat the letter addressed to Mr. Twentyman might be given back to\r\nher. The Postmaster, half vacillating in his desire to oblige a\r\nneighbour, produced the letter and Mrs. Masters put out her hand to\r\ngrasp it; but the servant of the public,--who had been thoroughly\r\ngrounded in his duties by one of those trusty guardians of\r\nour correspondence who inspect and survey our provincial post\r\noffices,--remembered himself at the last moment and expressing the\r\nviolence of his regret, replaced the letter in the box. Mrs. Masters,\r\nin her anger and grief, condescended to say very hard things to her\r\nneighbour;--but the man remembered his duty and was firm.\r\n\r\nOn that evening Larry Twentyman did not attend the Dillsborough\r\nClub,--having in the course of the week notified to the attorney that\r\nhe should be a defaulter. Mr. Masters himself went over earlier than\r\nusual, his own house having become very uncomfortable to him. Mrs.\r\nMasters for an hour sat expecting that Larry would come, and when the\r\nevening passed away without his appearance, she was convinced that\r\nthe unusual absence was a part of the conspiracy against her.\r\n\r\nLarry did not get his letter till the Monday morning. On the last\r\nThursday and Saturday he had consoled himself for his doubts with the\r\nU. R. U., and was minded to do so on the Monday also. He had not gone\r\nto the club on Saturday and had moped about Chowton all the Sunday\r\nin a feverish state because of his doubts. It seemed to him that the\r\ntwo months would never be over. On the Monday he was out early on\r\nthe farm and then came down in his boots and breeches, and had his\r\nred coat ready at the fire while he sat at breakfast. The meet was\r\nfifteen miles off and he had sent on his hunter, intending to travel\r\nthither in his dog cart. Just as he was cutting himself a slice of\r\nbeef the postman came, and of course he read his letter. He read it\r\nwith the carving knife in his hand, and then he stood gazing at his\r\nmother. "What is it, Larry?" she asked; "is anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Wrong,--well; I don\'t know," he said. "I don\'t know what you call\r\nwrong. I shan\'t hunt; that\'s all." Then he threw aside the knife\r\nand pushed away his plate and marched out of the room with the open\r\nletter in his hand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Twentyman knew very well of his love,--as indeed did nearly all\r\nDillsborough; but she had heard nothing of the two months and did\r\nnot connect the letter with Mary Masters. Surely he must have lost a\r\nlarge sum of money. That was her idea till she saw him again late in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe never went near the hounds that day or near his business. He\r\nwas not then man enough for either. But he walked about the fields,\r\nkeeping out of sight of everybody. It was all over now. It must\r\nbe all over when she wrote to him a letter like that. Why had she\r\ntempted him to thoughts of happiness and success by that promise of\r\ntwo months\' grace? He supposed that he was not good enough;--or that\r\nshe thought he was not good enough. Then he remembered his acres, and\r\nhis material comforts, and tried to console himself by reflecting\r\nthat Mary Masters might very well do worse in the world. But there\r\nwas no consolation in it. He had tried his best because he had\r\nreally loved the girl. He had failed, and all the world,--all his\r\nworld,--would know that he had failed. There was not a man in the\r\nclub,--hardly a man in the hunt,--who was not aware that he had\r\noffered to Mary Masters. During the last two months he had not been\r\nso reticent as was prudent, and had almost boasted to Fred Botsey of\r\nsuccess. And then how was he to live at Chowton Farm without Mary\r\nMasters as his wife? As he returned home he almost made up his mind\r\nthat he would not continue to live at Chowton Farm.\r\n\r\nHe came back through Dillsborough Wood; and there, prowling about, he\r\nmet Goarly. "Well, Mr. Twentyman," said the man, "I am making it all\r\nstraight now with his Lordship."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care what you\'re doing," said Larry in his misery. "You are\r\nan infernal blackguard and that\'s the best of you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCHOWTON FARM FOR SALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Morton had returned to town soon after his walk into\r\nDillsborough and had there learned from different sources that\r\nboth Arabella Trefoil and Lord Rufford had gone or were going to\r\nMistletoe. He had seen Lord Augustus who, though he could tell him\r\nnothing else about his daughter, had not been slow to inform him\r\nthat she was going to the house of her noble uncle. When Morton had\r\nspoken to him very seriously about the engagement he declared that he\r\nknew nothing about it,--except that he had given his consent if the\r\nsettlements were all right. Lady Augustus managed all that. Morton\r\nhad then said that under those circumstances he feared he must regard\r\nthe honour which he had hoped to enjoy as being beyond his reach.\r\nLord Augustus had shrugged his shoulders and had gone back to his\r\nwhist, this interview having taken place in the strangers\' room of\r\nhis club. That Lord Rufford was also going to Mistletoe he heard\r\nfrom young Glossop at the Foreign Office. It was quite possible that\r\nGlossop had been instructed to make this known to Morton by his\r\nsister Lady Penwether. Then Morton declared that the thing was\r\nover and that he would trouble himself no more about it. But this\r\nresolution did not make him at all contented, and in his misery he\r\nwent again down to his solitude at Bragton.\r\n\r\nAnd now when he might fairly consider himself to be free, and when he\r\nshould surely have congratulated himself on a most lucky escape from\r\nthe great danger into which he had fallen, his love and admiration\r\nfor the girl returned to him in a most wonderful manner. He thought\r\nof her beauty and her grace, and the manner in which she would sit\r\nat the head of his table when the time should come for him to be\r\npromoted to some great capital. To him she had fascinations which\r\nthe reader, who perhaps knows her better than he ever did, will not\r\nshare. He could forgive the coldness of her conduct to himself--he\r\nhimself not being by nature demonstrative or impassioned,--if only\r\nshe were not more kind to any rival. It was the fact that she should\r\nbe visiting at the same house with Lord Rufford after what he had\r\nseen at Rufford Hall which had angered him. But now in his solitude\r\nhe thought that he might have been wrong at Rufford Hall. If it were\r\nthe case that the girl feared that her marriage might be prevented by\r\nthe operations of lawyers and family friends, of course she would be\r\nright not to throw herself into his arms,--even metaphorically. He\r\nwas a cold, just man who, when he had loved, could not easily get rid\r\nof his love, and now he would ask himself whether he was not hard\r\nupon the girl. It was natural that she should be at Mistletoe; but\r\nthen why should Lord Rufford be there with her?\r\n\r\nHis prospects at Patagonia did not console him much. No doubt it\r\nwas a handsome mission for a man of his age and there were sundry\r\nPatagonian questions of importance at the present moment which would\r\ngive him a certain weight. Patagonia was repudiating a loan, and it\r\nwas hoped that he might induce a better feeling in the Patagonian\r\nParliament. There was the Patagonian railway for joining the Straits\r\nto the Cape the details of which he was now studying with great\r\ndiligence. And then there was the vital question of boundary between\r\nPatagonia and the Argentine Republic by settling which, should he be\r\nhappy enough to succeed in doing so, he would prevent the horrors of\r\nwarfare. He endeavoured to fix his mind with satisfaction on these\r\ngreat objects as he pored over the reports and papers which had been\r\nheaped upon him since he had accepted the mission. But there was\r\npresent to him always a feeling that the men at the Foreign Office\r\nhad been glad to get any respectable diplomate to go to Patagonia,\r\nand that his brethren in the profession had marvelled at his\r\nacceptance of such a mission. One never likes to be thanked over much\r\nfor doing anything. It creates a feeling that one has given more\r\nthan was expedient. He knew that he must now go to Patagonia, but he\r\nrepented the alacrity with which he had acceded to the proposition.\r\nWhether he did marry Arabella Trefoil or whether he did not, there\r\nwas no adequate reason for such a banishment. And yet he could not\r\nnow escape it!\r\n\r\nIt was on a Monday morning that Larry Twentyman had found himself\r\nunable to go hunting. On the Tuesday he gave his workmen about the\r\nfarm such a routing as they had not received for many a month. There\r\nhad not been a dungheap or a cowshed which he had not visited, nor a\r\nfence about the place with which he had not found fault. He was at it\r\nall day, trying thus to console himself, but in vain; and when his\r\nmother in the evening said some word of her misery in regard to the\r\nturkeys he had told her that as far as he was concerned Goarly might\r\npoison every fox in the county. Then the poor woman knew that matters\r\nwere going badly with her son. On the Wednesday, when the hounds met\r\nwithin two miles of Chowton, he again stayed at home; but in the\r\nafternoon he rode into Dillsborough and contrived to see the attorney\r\nwithout being seen by any of the ladies of the family. The interview\r\ndid not seem to do him any good. On the Thursday morning he walked\r\nacross to Bragton and with a firm voice asked to see the Squire.\r\nMorton who was deep in the boundary question put aside his papers and\r\nwelcomed his neighbour.\r\n\r\nNow it must be explained that when, in former years, his son\'s debts\r\nhad accumulated on old Mr. Reginald Morton, so that he had been\r\nobliged to part with some portion of his unentailed property, he had\r\nsold that which lay in the parish of St. John\'s, Dillsborough. The\r\nlands in Bragton and Mallingham he could not sell;--but Chowton\r\nFarm which was in St. John\'s had been bought by Larry Twentyman\'s\r\ngrandfather. For a time there had been some bitterness of feeling;\r\nbut the Twentymans had been well-to-do respectable people, most\r\nanxious to be good neighbours, and had gradually made themselves\r\nliked by the owner of Bragton. The present Squire had of course known\r\nnothing of Chowton as a part of the Morton property, and had no\r\nmore desire for it than for any of Lord Rufford\'s acres which were\r\ncontiguous to his own. He shook hands cordially with his neighbour,\r\nas though this visit were the most natural thing in the world, and\r\nasked some questions about Goarly and the hunt.\r\n\r\n"I believe that\'ll all come square, Mr. Morton. I\'m not interesting\r\nmyself much about it now." Larry was not dressed like himself. He had\r\non a dark brown coat, and dark pantaloons and a chimney-pot hat. He\r\nwas conspicuous generally for light-coloured close-fitting garments\r\nand for a billycock hat. He was very unlike his usual self on the\r\npresent occasion.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were just the man who did interest himself about those\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes; once it was so, Mr. Morton. What I\'ve got to say now, Mr.\r\nMorton, is this. Chowton Farm is in the market! But I wouldn\'t say a\r\nword to any one about it till you had had the offer."\r\n\r\n"You going to sell Chowton!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Morton, I am."\r\n\r\n"From all I have heard of you I wouldn\'t have believed it if anybody\r\nelse had told me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fact, Mr. Morton. There are three hundred and twenty acres. I\r\nput the rental at 30_s._ an acre. You know what you get, Mr. Morton,\r\nfor the land that lies next to it. And I think twenty-eight years\'\r\npurchase isn\'t more than it\'s worth. Those are my ideas as to price,\r\nMr. Morton. There isn\'t a halfpenny owing on it--not in the way of\r\nmortgage."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it\'s worth that."\r\n\r\n"Up at auction I might get a turn more, Mr. Morton;--but those are my\r\nideas at present."\r\n\r\nJohn Morton, who was a man of business, went to work at once with his\r\npencil and in two minutes had made out a total. "I don\'t know that\r\nI could put my hand on L14,000 even if I were minded to make the\r\npurchase."\r\n\r\n"That needn\'t stand in the way, sir. Any part you please could lie\r\non mortgage at 4-1/2 per cent." Larry in the midst of his distress\r\nhad certain clear ideas about business.\r\n\r\n"This is a very serious proposition, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, sir."\r\n\r\n"Have you any other views in life?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say as I have any fixed. I shan\'t be idle, Mr. Morton. I\r\nnever was idle. I was thinking perhaps of New Zealand."\r\n\r\n"A very fine colony for a young man, no doubt. But, seeing how well\r\nyou are established here--."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t stay here, Mr. Morton. I\'ve made up my mind about that.\r\nThere are things which a man can\'t bear,--not and live quiet. As for\r\nhunting, I don\'t care about it any more than--nothing."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that anything should have made you so unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I am unhappy. That\'s about the truth of it. And I always\r\nshall be unhappy here. There\'s nothing else for it but going away."\r\n\r\n"If it\'s anything sudden, Mr. Twentyman, allow me to say that you\r\nought not to sell your property without grave consideration."\r\n\r\n"I have considered it,--very grave, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"Ah,--but I mean long consideration. Take a year to think of it.\r\nYou can\'t buy such a place back in a year. I don\'t know you well\r\nenough to be justified in inquiring into the circumstances of your\r\ntrouble;--but unless it be something which makes it altogether\r\ninexpedient, or almost impossible that you should remain in the\r\nneighbourhood, you should not sell Chowton."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you, Mr. Morton," said Larry almost weeping. Poor Larry\r\nwhether in his triumph or his sorrow had no gift of reticence and now\r\ntold his neighbour the whole story of his love. He was certain it had\r\nbecome quite hopeless. He was sure that she would never have written\r\nhim a letter if there had been any smallest chance left. According to\r\nhis ideas a girl might say "no" half-a-dozen times and yet not mean\r\nmuch; but when she had committed herself to a letter she could not go\r\nback from it.\r\n\r\n"Is there anybody else?" asked Morton.\r\n\r\n"Not as I know. I never saw anything like--like lightness with her,\r\nwith any man. They said something about the curate but I don\'t\r\nbelieve a word of it."\r\n\r\n"And the family approve of it?"\r\n\r\n"Every one of them,--father and stepmother and sisters and all. My\r\nown mother too! There ain\'t a ha\'porth against it. I don\'t want any\r\none to give me sixpence in money. And she should live just like a\r\nlady. I can keep a servant for her to cook and do every mortal thing.\r\nBut it ain\'t nothing of all that, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"What is it then?"\r\n\r\nThe poor man paused before he made his answer; but when he did, he\r\nmade it plain enough. "I ain\'t good enough for her! Nor more I ain\'t,\r\nMr. Morton. She was brought up in this house, Mr. Morton, by your own\r\ngrand-aunt."\r\n\r\n"So I have heard, Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"And there\'s more of Bragton than there is of Dillsborough about\r\nher;--that\'s just where it is. I know what I am and I know what she\r\nis, and I ain\'t good enough for her. It should be somebody that can\r\ntalk books to her. I can tell her how to plant a field of wheat or\r\nhow to run a foal;--but I can\'t sit and read poetry, nor yet be read\r\nto. There\'s plenty of \'em would sell themselves because the land\'s\r\nall there, and the house, and the things in it. What makes me mad is\r\nthat I should love her all the better because she won\'t. My belief\r\nis, Mr. Morton, they\'re as poor as Job. That makes no difference\r\nto me because I don\'t want it;--but it makes no difference to her\r\nneither! She\'s right, Mr. Morton. I\'m not good enough, and so I\'ll\r\njust cut it as far as Dillsborough is concerned. You\'ll think of what\r\nI said of taking the land?"\r\n\r\nMr. Morton said much more to him, walking with him to the gate of\r\nChowton Farm. He assured him that the young lady might yet be won.\r\nHe had only, Morton said, to plead his case to her as well as he\r\nhad pleaded up at Bragton and he thought that she would be won. "I\r\ncouldn\'t speak out free to her,--not if it was to save the whole\r\nplace," said the unfortunate lover. But Morton still continued his\r\nadvice. As to leaving Chowton because a young lady refused him, that\r\nwould be unmanly--"There isn\'t a bit of a man left about me," said\r\nLarry weeping. Morton nevertheless went on. Time would cure these\r\nwounds; but no time would give him back Chowton should he once\r\npart with it. If he must leave the place for a time let him put a\r\ncaretaker on the farm, even though by doing so the loss might be\r\ngreat. He should do anything rather than surrender his house. As\r\nto buying the land himself, Morton would not talk about it in the\r\npresent circumstances. Then they parted at Chowton gate with many\r\nexpressions of friendship on each side.\r\n\r\nJohn Morton, as he returned home, could not help thinking that the\r\nyoung farmer\'s condition was after all better than his own. There was\r\nan honesty about both the persons concerned of which at any rate they\r\nmight be proud. There was real love,--and though that love was not at\r\npresent happy it was of a nature to inspire perfect respect. But in\r\nhis own case he was sure of nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMISTLETOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Arabella Trefoil started from London for Mistletoe, with no\r\ncompanion but her own maid, she had given more serious consideration\r\nto her visit than she had probably ever paid to any matter up to\r\nthat time. She had often been much in earnest but never so much in\r\nearnest as now. Those other men had perhaps been worthy,--worthy as\r\nfar as her ideas went of worth,--but none of them so worthy as this\r\nman. Everything was there if she could only get it;--money, rank,\r\nfashion, and an appetite for pleasure. And he was handsome too,\r\nand good-humoured, though these qualities told less with her than\r\nthe others. And now she was to meet him in the house of her great\r\nrelations,--in a position in which her rank and her fashion would\r\nseem to be equal to his own. And she would meet him with the\r\nremembrance fresh in his mind as in her own of those passages of love\r\nat Rufford. It would be impossible that he should even seem to forget\r\nthem. The most that she could expect would be four or five days of\r\nhis company, and she knew that she must be upon her mettle. She must\r\ndo more now than she had ever attempted before. She must scruple at\r\nnothing that might bind him. She would be in the house of her uncle\r\nand that uncle a duke, and she thought that those facts might help\r\nto quell him. And she would be there without her mother, who was so\r\noften a heavy incubus on her shoulders. She thought of it all, and\r\nmade her plans carefully and even painfully. She would be at any rate\r\ntwo days in the house before his arrival. During that time she would\r\ncurry favour with her uncle by all her arts, and would if possible\r\nreconcile herself to her aunt. She thought once of taking her aunt\r\ninto her full confidence and balanced the matter much in her mind.\r\nThe Duchess, she knew, was afraid of her,--or rather afraid of the\r\nrelationship, and would of course be pleased to have all fears set\r\nat rest by such an alliance. But her aunt was a woman who had never\r\nsuffered hardships, whose own marriage had been easily arranged, and\r\nwhose two daughters had been pleasantly married before they were\r\ntwenty years old. She had had no experience of feminine difficulties,\r\nand would have no mercy for such labours as those to which her less\r\nfortunate niece was driven. It would have been a great thing to have\r\nthe cordial co-operation of her aunt;--but she could not venture to\r\nask for it.\r\n\r\nShe had stretched her means and her credit to the utmost in regard to\r\nher wardrobe, and was aware that she had never been so well equipped\r\nsince those early days of her career in which her father and mother\r\nhad thought that her beauty, assisted by a generous expenditure,\r\nwould serve to dispose of her without delay. A generous expenditure\r\nmay be incurred once even by poor people, but cannot possibly be\r\nmaintained over a dozen years. Now she had taken the matter into her\r\nown hands and had done that which would be ruinous if not successful.\r\nShe was venturing her all upon the die,--with the prospect of\r\ndrowning herself on the way out to Patagonia should the chances of\r\nthe game go against her. She forgot nothing. She could hardly hope\r\nfor more than one day\'s hunting and yet that had been provided for\r\nas though she were going to ride with the hounds through all the\r\nremainder of the season.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached Mistletoe there were people going and coming every\r\nday, so that an arrival was no event. She was kissed by her uncle and\r\nwelcomed with characteristic coldness by her aunt, then allowed to\r\nsettle in among the other guests as though she had been there all\r\nthe winter. Everybody knew that she was a Trefoil and her presence\r\ntherefore raised no question. The Duchess of Omnium was among the\r\nguests. The Duchess knew all about her and vouchsafed to her the\r\nsmallest possible recognition. Lady Chiltern had met her before, and\r\nas Lady Chiltern was always generous, she was gracious to Arabella.\r\nShe was sorry to see Lady Drummond, because she connected Lady\r\nDrummond with the Foreign Office and feared that the conversation\r\nmight be led to Patagonia and its new minister. She contrived to\r\nsqueeze her uncle\'s hand and to utter a word of warm thanks,--which\r\nhis grace did not perfectly understand. The girl was his niece and\r\nthe Duke had an idea that he should be kind to the family of which he\r\nwas the head. His brother\'s wife had become objectionable to him, but\r\nas to the girl, if she wanted a home for a week or two, he thought it\r\nto be his duty to give it to her.\r\n\r\nMistletoe is an enormous house with a frontage nearly a quarter of\r\na mile long, combining as it does all the offices, coach houses,\r\nand stables. There is nothing in England more ugly or perhaps more\r\ncomfortable. It stands in a huge park which, as it is quite flat,\r\nnever shows its size and is altogether unattractive. The Duke\r\nhimself was a hospitable, easy man who was very fond of his dinner\r\nand performed his duties well; but could never be touched by any\r\nsentiment. He always spent six months in the country, in which he\r\nacted as landlord to a great crowd of shooting, hunting, and flirting\r\nvisitors, and six in London, in which he gave dinners and dined out\r\nand regularly took his place in the House of Lords without ever\r\nopening his mouth. He was a grey-haired comely man of sixty, with\r\na large body and a wonderful appetite. By many who understood the\r\nsubject he was supposed to be the best amateur judge of wine in\r\nEngland. His son Lord Mistletoe was member for the county and as the\r\nDuke had no younger sons he was supposed to be happy at all points.\r\nLord Mistletoe, who had a large family of his own, lived twenty miles\r\noff,--so that the father and son could meet pleasantly without fear\r\nof quarrelling.\r\n\r\nDuring the first evening Arabella did contrive to make herself very\r\nagreeable. She was much quieter than had been her wont when at\r\nMistletoe before, and though there were present two or three very\r\nwell circumstanced young men she took but little notice of them.\r\nShe went out to dinner with Sir Jeffrey Bunker, and made herself\r\nagreeable to that old gentleman in a remarkable manner. After dinner,\r\nsomething having been said of the respectable old game called cat\'s\r\ncradle, she played it to perfection with Sir Jeffrey,--till her aunt\r\nthought that she must have been unaware that Sir Jeffrey had a wife\r\nand family. She was all smiles and all pleasantness, and seemed to\r\nwant no other happiness than what the present moment gave her. Nor\r\ndid she once mention Lord Rufford\'s name.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning after breakfast her aunt sent for her to come\r\nup-stairs. Such a thing had never happened to her before. She could\r\nnot recollect that, on any of those annual visits which she had made\r\nto Mistletoe for more years than she now liked to think of, she had\r\never had five minutes\' conversation alone with her aunt. It had\r\nalways seemed that she was to be allowed to come and go by reason\r\nof her relationship, but that she was to receive no special mark of\r\nconfidence or affection. The message was whispered into her ear by\r\nher aunt\'s own woman as she was listening with great attention to\r\nLady Drummond\'s troubles in regard to her nursery arrangements. She\r\nnodded her head, heard a few more words from Lady Drummond, and then,\r\nwith a pretty apology and a statement made so that all should hear\r\nher, that her aunt wanted her, followed the maid up-stairs. "My\r\ndear," said her aunt, when the door was closed, "I want to ask you\r\nwhether you would like me to ask Mr. Morton to come here while you\r\nare with us?" A thunderbolt at her feet could hardly have surprised\r\nor annoyed her more. If there was one thing that she wanted less than\r\nanother it was the presence of the Paragon at Mistletoe. It would\r\nutterly subvert everything and rob her of every chance. With a great\r\neffort she restrained all emotion and simply shook her head. She\r\ndid it very well, and betrayed nothing. "I ask," said the Duchess,\r\n"because I have been very glad to hear that you are engaged to marry\r\nhim. Lord Drummond tells me that he is a most respectable young man."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Morton will be so much obliged to Lord Drummond."\r\n\r\n"And I thought that if it were so, you would be glad that he should\r\nmeet you here. I could manage it very well, as the Drummonds are\r\nhere, and Lord Drummond would be glad to meet him."\r\n\r\nThey had not been above a minute or two together, and Arabella had\r\nbeen called upon to expend her energy in suppressing any expression\r\nof her horror; but still, by the time that she was called on to\r\nspeak, she had fabricated her story. "Thanks, aunt; it is so good of\r\nyou;--and if everything was going straight, there would be nothing of\r\ncourse that I should like so much."\r\n\r\n"You are engaged to him?"\r\n\r\n"Well; I was going to tell you. I dare say it is not his fault; but\r\npapa and mamma and the lawyers think that he is not behaving well\r\nabout money;--settlements and all that. I suppose it will all come\r\nright; but in the meantime perhaps I had better not meet him."\r\n\r\n"But you were engaged to him?"\r\n\r\nThis had to be answered without a moment\'s pause. "Yes," said\r\nArabella; "I was engaged to him."\r\n\r\n"And he is going out as minister to Patagonia almost immediately?"\r\n\r\n"He is going, I know."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you will go with him?"\r\n\r\nThis was very hard. She could not say that she certainly was not\r\ngoing with him. And yet she had to remember that her coming campaign\r\nwith Lord Rufford must be carried on in part beneath her aunt\'s eyes.\r\nWhen she had come to Mistletoe she had fondly hoped that none of\r\nthe family there would know anything about Mr. Morton. And now she\r\nwas called upon to answer these horrid questions without a moment\'s\r\nnotice! "I don\'t think I shall go with him, aunt; though I am unable\r\nto say anything certain just at present. If he behaves badly of\r\ncourse the engagement must be off."\r\n\r\n"I hope not. You should think of it very seriously. As for money, you\r\nknow, you have none of your own, and I am told that he has a very\r\nnice property in Rufford. There is a neighbour of his coming here\r\nto-morrow, and perhaps he knows him."\r\n\r\n"Who is the neighbour, aunt?" asked Arabella, innocently.\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford. He is coming to shoot. I will ask him about the\r\nproperty."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t mention my name, aunt. It would be so unpleasant if\r\nnothing were to come of it. I know Lord Rufford very well."\r\n\r\n"Know Lord Rufford very well!"\r\n\r\n"As one does know men that one meets about."\r\n\r\n"I thought it might settle everything if we had Mr. Morton here."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t meet him, aunt; I couldn\'t indeed. Mamma doesn\'t think\r\nthat he is behaving well." To the Duchess condemnation from Lady\r\nAugustus almost amounted to praise. She felt sure that Mr. Morton\r\nwas a worthy man who would not probably behave badly, and though she\r\ncould not unravel the mystery, and certainly had no suspicion in\r\nregard to Lord Rufford, she was sure that there was something wrong.\r\nBut there was nothing more to be said at present. After what Arabella\r\nhad told her Mr. Morton could not be asked there to meet her niece.\r\nBut all the slight feeling of kindness to the girl which had been\r\ncreated by the tidings of so respectable an engagement were at once\r\nobliterated from the Duchess\'s bosom. Arabella, with many expressions\r\nof thanks and a good-humoured countenance, left the room, cursing the\r\nuntowardness of her fate which would let nothing run smooth.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford was to come. That at any rate was now almost certain.\r\nUp to the present she had doubted, knowing the way in which such men\r\nwill change their engagements at the least caprice. But the Duchess\r\nexpected him on the morrow. She had prepared the way for meeting him\r\nas an old friend without causing surprise, and had gained that step.\r\nBut should she succeed, as she hoped, in exacting continued homage\r\nfrom the man,--homage for the four or five days of his sojourn at\r\nMistletoe,--this must be carried on with the knowledge on the part\r\nof many in the house that she was engaged to that horrid Patagonian\r\nMinister! Was ever a girl called upon to risk her entire fate under\r\nso many disadvantages?\r\n\r\nWhen she went up to dress for dinner on the day of his expected\r\narrival Lord Rufford had not come. Since the interview in her aunt\'s\r\nroom she had not heard his name mentioned. When she came into the\r\ndrawing-room, a little late, he was not there. "We won\'t wait,\r\nDuchess," said the Duke to his wife at three minutes past eight. The\r\nDuke\'s punctuality at dinner-time was well known, and everybody else\r\nwas then assembled. Within two minutes after the Duke\'s word dinner\r\nwas announced, and a party numbering about thirty walked away into\r\nthe dinner-room. Arabella, when they were all settled, found that\r\nthere was a vacant seat next herself. If the man were to come,\r\nfortune would have favoured her in that.\r\n\r\nThe fish and soup had already disappeared and the Duke was wakening\r\nhimself to eloquence on the first entree when Lord Rufford entered\r\nthe room. "There never were trains so late as yours, Duchess," he\r\nsaid, "nor any part of the world in which hired horses travel so\r\nslowly. I beg the Duke\'s pardon, but I suffer the less because I know\r\nhis Grace never waits for anybody."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said the Duke, "having some regard for my friends\'\r\ndinners."\r\n\r\n"And I find myself next to you," said Lord Rufford as he took his\r\nseat. "Well; that is more than I deserve."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOW THINGS WERE ARRANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Jack is here," said Lord Rufford, as soon as the fuss of his late\r\narrival had worn itself away.\r\n\r\n"I shall be proud to renew my acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"Can you come to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Arabella, rapturously.\r\n\r\n"There are difficulties, and I ought to have written to you about\r\nthem. I am going with the Fitzwilliam." Now Mistletoe was in\r\nLincolnshire, not very far from Peterborough, not very far from\r\nStamford, not very far from Oakham. A regular hunting man like Lord\r\nRufford knew how to compass the difficulties of distance in all\r\nhunting countries. Horses could go by one train or overnight, and\r\nhe could follow by another. And a postchaise could meet him here or\r\nthere. But when a lady is added, the difficulty is often increased\r\nfivefold.\r\n\r\n"Is it very far?" asked Arabella.\r\n\r\n"It is a little far. I wonder who are going from here?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven only knows. I have passed my time in playing cat\'s cradle\r\nwith Sir Jeffrey Bunker for the amusement of the company, and in\r\nconfidential communications with my aunt and Lady Drummond. I haven\'t\r\nheard hunting mentioned."\r\n\r\n"Have you anything on wheels going across to Holcombe Cross\r\nto-morrow, Duke?" asked Lord Rufford. The Duke said that he did not\r\nknow of anything on wheels going to Holcombe Cross. Then a hunting\r\nman who had heard the question said that he and another intended to\r\ntravel by train to Oundle. Upon this Lord Rufford turned round and\r\nlooked at Arabella mournfully.\r\n\r\n"Cannot I go by train to Oundle?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth so jolly if your pastors and masters and all that\r\nwill let you."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t got any pastors and masters."\r\n\r\n"The Duchess!" suggested Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"I thought all that kind of nonsense was over," said Arabella.\r\n\r\n"I believe a great deal is over. You can do many things that your\r\nmother and grandmother couldn\'t do; but absolute freedom,--what you\r\nmay call universal suffrage,--hasn\'t come yet, I fear. It\'s twenty\r\nmiles by road, and the Duchess would say something awful if I were to\r\npropose to take you in a postchaise."\r\n\r\n"But the railway!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that would be worse. We couldn\'t ride back, you know, as\r\nwe did at Rufford. At the best it would be rather a rough and tumble\r\nkind of arrangement. I\'m afraid we must put it off. To tell you the\r\ntruth I\'m the least bit in the world afraid of the Duchess."\r\n\r\n"I am not at all," said Arabella, angrily.\r\n\r\nThen Lord Rufford ate his dinner and seemed to think that that matter\r\nwas settled. Arabella knew that he might have hunted elsewhere,--that\r\nthe Cottesmore would be out in their own county within twelve miles\r\nof them, and that the difficulty of that ride would be very much\r\nless. The Duke might have been persuaded to send a carriage that\r\ndistance. But Lord Rufford cared more about the chance of a good run\r\nthan her company! For a while she was sulky;--for a little while,\r\ntill she remembered how ill she could afford to indulge in such a\r\nfeeling. Then she said a demure word or two to the gentleman on the\r\nother side of her who happened to be a clergyman, and did not return\r\nto the hunting till Lord Rufford had eaten his cheese. "And is that\r\nto be the end of Jack as far as I\'m concerned?"\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking about it ever since. This is Thursday."\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt about it."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow will be Friday and the Duke has his great shooting on\r\nSaturday. There\'s nothing within a hundred miles of us on Saturday. I\r\nshall go with the Pytchley if I don\'t shoot, but I shall have to get\r\nup just when other people are going to bed. That wouldn\'t suit you."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t mind if I didn\'t go to bed at all."\r\n\r\n"At any rate it wouldn\'t suit the Duchess. I had meant to go away on\r\nSunday. I hate being anywhere on Sunday except in a railway carriage.\r\nBut if I thought the Duke would keep me till Tuesday morning we might\r\nmanage Peltry on Monday. I meant to have got back to Surbiton\'s on\r\nSunday and have gone from there."\r\n\r\n"Where is Peltry?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a Cottesmore meet,--about five miles this side of Melton."\r\n\r\n"We could ride from here."\r\n\r\n"It\'s rather far for that, but we could talk over the Duke to send a\r\ncarriage. Ladies always like to see a meet, and perhaps we could make\r\na party. If not we must put a good face on it and go in anything we\r\ncan get. I shouldn\'t fear the Duchess so much for twelve miles as I\r\nshould for twenty."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to let the Duchess interfere with me," said Arabella in\r\na whisper.\r\n\r\nThat evening Lord Rufford was very good-natured and managed to\r\narrange everything. Lady Chiltern and another lady said that they\r\nwould be glad to go to the meet, and a carriage or carriages were\r\norganised. But nothing was said as to Arabella\'s hunting because the\r\nquestion would immediately be raised as to her return to Mistletoe in\r\nthe evening. It was, however, understood that she was to have a place\r\nin the carriage.\r\n\r\nArabella had gained two things. She would have her one day\'s hunting,\r\nand she had secured the presence of Lord Rufford at Mistletoe for\r\nSunday. With such a man as his lordship it was almost impossible to\r\nfind a moment for confidential conversation. He worked so hard at his\r\namusements that he was as bad a lover as a barrister who has to be in\r\nCourt all day,--almost as bad as a sailor who is always going round\r\nthe world. On this evening it was ten o\'clock before the gentlemen\r\ncame into the drawing-room, and then Lord Rufford\'s time was spent in\r\narranging the party for the meet on Monday. When the ladies went up\r\nto bed Arabella had had no other opportunity than what Fortune had\r\ngiven her at dinner.\r\n\r\nAnd even then she had been watched. That juxtaposition at the\r\ndinner-table had come of chance and had been caused by Lord Rufford\'s\r\nlate arrival. Old Sir Jeffrey should have been her neighbour, with\r\nthe clergyman on the other side, an arrangement which Her Grace\r\nhad thought safe with reference to the rights of the Minister to\r\nPatagonia. The Duchess, though she was at some distance down the\r\ntable, had seen that her niece and Lord Rufford were intimate, and\r\nremembered immediately what had been said up-stairs. They could\r\nnot have talked as they were then talking,--sometimes whispering\r\nas the Duchess could perceive very well,--unless there had been\r\nconsiderable former intimacy. She began gradually to understand\r\nvarious things;--why Arabella Trefoil had been so anxious to come to\r\nMistletoe just at this time, why she had behaved so unlike her usual\r\nself before Lord Rufford\'s arrival, and why she had been so unwilling\r\nto have Mr. Morton invited. The Duchess was in her way a clever woman\r\nand could see many things. She could see that though her niece might\r\nbe very anxious to marry Lord Rufford, Lord Rufford might indulge\r\nhimself in a close intimacy with the girl without any such intention\r\non his part. And, as far as the family was concerned, she would have\r\nbeen quite contented with the Morton alliance. She would have asked\r\nMorton now only that it would be impossible that he should come in\r\ntime to be of service. Had she been consulted in the first instance\r\nshe would have put her veto on that drive to the meet: but she had\r\nheard nothing about it until Lady Chiltern had said that she would\r\ngo. The Duchess of Omnium had since declared that she also would go,\r\nand there were to be two carriages. But still it never occurred to\r\nthe Duchess that Arabella intended to hunt. Nor did Arabella intend\r\nthat she should know it till the morning came.\r\n\r\nThe Friday was very dull. The hunting men of course had gone before\r\nArabella came down to breakfast. She would willingly have got up at\r\nseven to pour out Lord Rufford\'s tea, had that been possible; but,\r\nas it was, she strolled into the breakfast room at half-past ten.\r\nShe could see by her aunt\'s eye and hear in her voice that she was\r\nin part detected; and that she would do herself no further service\r\nby acting the good girl; and she therefore resolutely determined to\r\nlisten to no more twaddle. She read a French novel which she had\r\nbrought with her, and spent as much of the day as she could in her\r\nbedroom. She did not see Lord Rufford before dinner, and at dinner\r\nsat between Sir Jeffrey and an old gentleman out of Stamford who\r\ndined at Mistletoe that evening. "We\'ve had no such luck to-night,"\r\nLord Rufford said to her in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"The old dragon took care of that," replied Arabella.\r\n\r\n"Why should the old dragon think that I\'m dangerous?"\r\n\r\n"Because--; I can\'t very well tell you why, but I dare say you know."\r\n\r\n"And do you think I am dangerous?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a sort of a five-barred gate," said Arabella laughing. "Of\r\ncourse there is a little danger, but who is going to be stopped by\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\nHe could make no reply to this because the Duchess called him away\r\nto give some account to Lady Chiltern about Goarly and the U. R.\r\nU., Lady Chiltern\'s husband being a master of hounds and a great\r\nauthority on all matters relating to hunting. "Nasty old dragon!"\r\nArabella said to herself when she was thus left alone.\r\n\r\nThe Saturday was the day of the great shooting and at two o\'clock\r\nthe ladies went out to lunch with the gentlemen by the side of the\r\nwood. Lord Rufford had at last consented to be one of the party. With\r\nlogs of trees, a few hurdles, and other field appliances, a rustic\r\nbanqueting hall was prepared and everything was very nice. Tons of\r\ngame had been killed, and tons more were to be killed after luncheon.\r\nThe Duchess was not there and Arabella contrived so to place herself\r\nthat she could be waited upon by Lord Rufford, or could wait upon\r\nhim. Of course a great many eyes were upon her, but she knew how to\r\nsustain that. Nobody was present who could dare to interfere with\r\nher. When the eating and drinking were over she walked with him to\r\nhis corner by the next covert, not heeding the other ladies; and she\r\nstood with him for some minutes after the slaughter had begun. She\r\nhad come to feel that the time was slipping between her fingers and\r\nthat she must say something effective. The fatal word upon which\r\neverything would depend must be spoken at the very latest on their\r\nreturn home on Monday, and she was aware that much must probably be\r\nsaid before that. "Do we hunt or shoot to-morrow?" she said.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow is Sunday."\r\n\r\n"I am quite aware of that, but I didn\'t know whether you could live a\r\nday without sport."\r\n\r\n"The country is so full of prejudice that I am driven to Sabbatical\r\nquiescence."\r\n\r\n"Take a walk with me to-morrow," said Arabella.\r\n\r\n"But the Duchess?" exclaimed Lord Rufford in a stage whisper. One of\r\nthe beaters was so near that he could not but have heard;--but what\r\ndoes a beater signify?\r\n\r\n"H\'mh\'m the Duchess! You be at the path behind the great conservatory\r\nat half-past three and we won\'t mind the Duchess." Lord Rufford was\r\nforced to ask for many other particulars as to the locality and then\r\npromised that he would be there at the time named.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n"YOU ARE SO SEVERE."\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Arabella went to church as did of course a great\r\nmany of the party. By remaining at home she could only have excited\r\nsuspicion. The church was close to the house, and the family pew\r\nconsisted of a large room screened off from the rest of the church,\r\nwith a fire-place of its own,--so that the labour of attending divine\r\nservice was reduced to a minimum. At two o\'clock they lunched, and\r\nthat amusement lasted nearly an hour. There was an afternoon service\r\nat three in attending which the Duchess was very particular. The Duke\r\nnever went at that time nor was it expected that any of the gentlemen\r\nwould do so; but women are supposed to require more church than men,\r\nand the Duchess rather made it a point that at any rate the young\r\nladies staying in the house should accompany her. Over the other\r\nyoung ladies there her authority could only be that of influence,\r\nbut such authority generally sufficed. From her niece it might be\r\nsupposed that she would exact obedience, and in this instance she\r\ntried it. "We start in five minutes," she said to Arabella as that\r\nyoung lady was loitering at the table.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t wait for me, aunt; I\'m not going," said Arabella boldly.\r\n\r\n"I hope you will come to church with us," said the Duchess sternly.\r\n\r\n"Not this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Why not, Arabella?"\r\n\r\n"I never do go to church twice on Sundays. Some people do, and some\r\npeople don\'t. I suppose that\'s about it."\r\n\r\n"I think that all young women ought to go to church on Sunday\r\nafternoon unless there is something particular to prevent them."\r\nArabella shrugged her shoulders and the Duchess stalked angrily away.\r\n\r\n"That makes me feel so awfully wicked," said the Duchess of Omnium,\r\nwho was the only other lady then left in the room. Then she got up\r\nand went out and Arabella of course followed her. Lord Rufford had\r\nheard it all but had stood at the window and said nothing. He had not\r\nbeen to church at all, and was quite accustomed to the idea that as\r\na young nobleman who only lived for pleasure he was privileged to be\r\nwicked. Had the Duchess of Mayfair been blessed with a third daughter\r\nfit for marriage she would not have thought of repudiating such a\r\nsuitor as Lord Rufford because he did not go to church.\r\n\r\nWhen the house was cleared Arabella went upstairs and put on her hat.\r\nIt was a bright beautiful winter\'s day, not painfully cold because\r\nthe air was dry, but still a day that warranted furs and a muff.\r\nHaving prepared herself she made her way alone to a side door which\r\nled from a branch of the hall on to the garden terrace, and up\r\nand down that she walked two or three times,--so that any of the\r\nhousehold that saw her might perceive that she had come out simply\r\nfor exercise. At the end of the third turn instead of coming back she\r\nwent on quickly to the conservatory and took the path which led round\r\nto the further side. There was a small lawn here fitted for garden\r\ngames, and on the other end of it an iron gate leading to a path into\r\nthe woods. At the further side of the iron gate and leaning against\r\nit, stood Lord Rufford smoking a cigar. She did not pause a moment\r\nbut hurried across the lawn to join him. He opened the gate and she\r\npassed through. "I\'m not going to be done by a dragon," she said as\r\nshe took her place alongside of him.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Miss Trefoil, I don\'t think I ever knew a human being\r\nwith so much pluck as you have got."\r\n\r\n"Girls have to have pluck if they don\'t mean to be sat upon;--a great\r\ndeal more than men. The idea of telling me that I was to go to church\r\nas though I were twelve years old!"\r\n\r\n"What would she say if she knew that you were walking here with me?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care what she\'d say. I dare say she walked with somebody\r\nonce;--only I should think the somebody must have found it very\r\ndull."\r\n\r\n"Does she know that you\'re to hunt to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t told her and don\'t mean. I shall just come down in my\r\nhabit and hat and say nothing about it. At what time must we start?"\r\n\r\n"The carriages are ordered for half-past nine. But I\'m afraid you\r\nhaven\'t clearly before your eyes all the difficulties which are\r\nincidental to hunting."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"It looks as like a black frost as anything I ever saw in my life."\r\n\r\n"But we should go?"\r\n\r\n"The horses won\'t be there if there is a really hard frost. Nobody\r\nwould stir. It will be the first question I shall ask the man when he\r\ncomes to me, and if there have been seven or eight degrees of frost I\r\nshan\'t get up."\r\n\r\n"How am I to know?"\r\n\r\n"My man shall tell your maid. But everybody will soon know all about\r\nit. It will alter everything."\r\n\r\n"I think I shall go mad."\r\n\r\n"In white satin?"\r\n\r\n"No;--in my habit and hat. It will be the hardest thing, after all! I\r\nought to have insisted on going to Holcombe Cross on Friday. The sun\r\nis shining now. Surely it cannot freeze."\r\n\r\n"It will be uncommonly ill-bred if it does."\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the hunting was not the main point. The hunting\r\nhad been only intended as an opportunity; and if that were to be\r\nlost,--in which case Lord Rufford would no doubt at once leave\r\nMistletoe,--there was the more need for using the present hour, the\r\nmore for using even the present minute. Though she had said that the\r\nsun was shining, it was the setting sun, and in another half hour\r\nthe gloom of the evening would be there. Even Lord Rufford would not\r\nconsent to walk about with her in the dark. "Oh, Lord Rufford," she\r\nsaid, "I did so look forward to your giving me another lead." Then\r\nshe put her hand upon his arm and left it there.\r\n\r\n"It would have been nice," said he, drawing her hand a little on, and\r\nremembering as he did so his own picture of himself on the cliff with\r\nhis sister holding his coat-tails.\r\n\r\n"If you could possibly know," she said, "the condition I am in."\r\n\r\n"What condition?"\r\n\r\n"I know that I can trust you. I am sure that I can trust you."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes. If you mean about telling, I never tell anything."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I do mean. You remember that man at your place?"\r\n\r\n"What man? Poor Caneback?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no! I wish they could change places because then he could\r\ngive me no more trouble."\r\n\r\n"That\'s wishing him to be dead, whoever he is."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Why should he persecute me? I mean that man we were staying\r\nwith at Bragton."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. Don\'t you remember your asking me about him, and my\r\ntelling you that I was not engaged to him?"\r\n\r\n"I remember that."\r\n\r\n"Mamma and this horrid old Duchess here want me to marry him. They\'ve\r\ngot an idea that he is going to be ambassador at Pekin or something\r\nvery grand, and they\'re at me day and night."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t take him unless you like him."\r\n\r\n"They do make me so miserable!" And then she leaned heavily upon his\r\narm. He was a man who could not stand such pressure as this without\r\nreturning it. Though he were on the precipice, and though he must go\r\nover, still he could not stand it. "You remember that night after the\r\nball?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do."\r\n\r\n"And you too had asked me whether I cared for that horrid man."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t see anything horrid. You had been staying at his house and\r\npeople had told me. What was I to think?"\r\n\r\n"You ought to have known what to think. There; let me go,"--for now\r\nhe had got his arm round her waist. "You don\'t care for me a bit. I\r\nknow you don\'t. It would be all the same to you whom I married;--or\r\nwhether I died."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think that, Bella?" He fancied that he had heard her\r\nmother call her Bella, and that the name was softer and easier than\r\nthe full four syllables. It was at any rate something for her to have\r\ngained.\r\n\r\n"I do think it. When I came here on purpose to have a skurry over the\r\ncountry with you, you went away to Holcombe Cross though you could\r\nhave hunted here, close in the neighbourhood. And now you tell me\r\nthere will be a frost to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Can I help that, darling?"\r\n\r\n"Darling! I ain\'t your darling. You don\'t care a bit for me. I\r\nbelieve you hope there\'ll be a frost." He pressed her tighter, but\r\nlaughed as he did so. It was evidently a joke to him;--a pleasant\r\njoke no doubt. "Leave me alone, Lord Rufford. I won\'t let you, for I\r\nknow you don\'t love me." Very suddenly he did leave his hold of her\r\nand stood erect with his hands in his pockets, for the rustle of a\r\ndress was heard. It was still daylight, but the light was dim and\r\nthe last morsel of the grandeur of the sun had ceased to be visible\r\nthrough the trees. The church-going people had been released, and the\r\nDuchess having probably heard certain tidings, had herself come to\r\ntake a walk in the shrubbery behind the conservatory. Arabella had\r\nprobably been unaware that she and her companion by a turn in the\r\nwalks were being brought back towards the iron gate. As it was they\r\nmet the Duchess face to face.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford had spoken the truth when he had said that he was a\r\nlittle afraid of the Duchess. Such was his fear that at the moment\r\nhe hardly knew what he was to say. Arabella had boasted when she had\r\ndeclared that she was not at all afraid of her aunt;--but she was\r\nsteadfastly minded that she would not be cowed by her fears. She had\r\nknown beforehand that she would have occasion for much presence of\r\nmind, and was prepared to exercise it at a moment\'s notice. She was\r\nthe first to speak. "Is that you, aunt? you are out of church very\r\nsoon."\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford," said the Duchess, "I don\'t think this is a proper\r\ntime for walking out."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you, Duchess? The air is very nice."\r\n\r\n"It is becoming dark and my niece had better return to the house\r\nwith me. Arabella, you can come this way. It is just as short as\r\nthe other. If you go on straight, Lord Rufford, it will take you\r\nto the house." Of course Lord Rufford went on straight and of\r\ncourse Arabella had to turn with her aunt. "Such conduct as this is\r\nshocking," began the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Aunt, let me tell you."\r\n\r\n"What can you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you a great deal if you will let me. Of course I am quite\r\nprepared to own that I did not intend to tell you anything."\r\n\r\n"I can well believe that."\r\n\r\n"Because I could hardly hope for your sympathy. You have never liked\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You have no right to say that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t do it in the way of finding fault. I don\'t know why you\r\nshould. But I have been too much afraid of you to tell you my\r\nsecrets. I must do so now because you have found me walking with Lord\r\nRufford. I could not otherwise excuse myself."\r\n\r\n"Is he engaged to marry you?"\r\n\r\n"He has asked me."\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"But he has, aunt. You must be a little patient and let me tell it\r\nyou all. Mamma did make up an engagement between me and Mr. Morton at\r\nWashington."\r\n\r\n"Did you know Lord Rufford then?"\r\n\r\n"I knew him, but did not think he was behaving quite well. It is very\r\nhard sometimes to know what a man means. I was angry when I went to\r\nWashington. He has told me since that he loves me,--and has offered."\r\n\r\n"But you are engaged to marry the other man."\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth shall make me marry Mr. Morton. Mamma did it, and\r\nmamma now has very nearly broken it off because she says he is very\r\nshabby about money. Indeed it is broken off. I had told him so even\r\nbefore Lord Rufford had proposed to me."\r\n\r\n"When did he propose and where?"\r\n\r\n"At Rufford. We were staying there in November."\r\n\r\n"And you asked to come here that you might meet him?"\r\n\r\n"Just so. Was that strange? Where could I be better pleased to meet\r\nhim than in my own uncle\'s house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--if you had told us all this before."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I ought; but you are so severe, that I did not dare. Do\r\nnot turn against me now. My uncle could not but like that his niece\r\nshould marry Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"How can I turn against you if it is settled? Lord Rufford can do as\r\nhe pleases. Has he told your father,--or your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma knows it."\r\n\r\n"But not from him?" asked the Duchess.\r\n\r\nArabella paused a moment but hardly a moment before she answered. It\r\nwas hard upon her that she should have to make up her mind on matters\r\nof such importance with so little time for consideration. "Yes," she\r\nsaid; "mamma knows it from him. Papa is so very indifferent about\r\neverything that Lord Rufford has not spoken to him."\r\n\r\n"If so, it will be best that the Duke should speak to him."\r\n\r\nThere was another pause, but hardly long enough to attract notice.\r\n"Perhaps so," she said;--"but not quite yet. He is so peculiar, so\r\ntouchy. The Duke is not quite like my father and he would think\r\nhimself suspected."\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine that if he is in earnest."\r\n\r\n"That is because you do not know him as I do. Only think where I\r\nshould be if I were to lose him!"\r\n\r\n"Lose him!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, aunt, now that you know it I do hope that you will be my friend.\r\nIt would kill me if he were to throw me over."\r\n\r\n"But why should he throw you over if he proposed to you only last\r\nmonth?"\r\n\r\n"He might do it if he thought that he were interfered with. Of course\r\nI should like my uncle to speak to him, but not quite immediately. If\r\nhe were to say that he had changed his mind, what could I do, or what\r\ncould my uncle do?"\r\n\r\n"That would be very singular conduct."\r\n\r\n"Men are so different now, aunt. They give themselves so much more\r\nlatitude. A man has only to say that he has changed his mind and\r\nnothing ever comes of it."\r\n\r\n"I have never been used to such men, my dear."\r\n\r\n"At any rate do not ask the Duke to speak to him to-day. I will think\r\nabout it and perhaps you will let me see you to-morrow, after we all\r\ncome in." To this the Duchess gravely assented. "And I hope you won\'t\r\nbe angry because you found me walking with him, or because I did not\r\ngo to church. It is everything to me. I am sure, dear aunt, you will\r\nunderstand that." To this the Duchess made no reply, and they both\r\nentered the house together. What became of Lord Rufford neither of\r\nthem saw.\r\n\r\nArabella when she regained her room thought that upon the whole\r\nfortune had favoured her by throwing her aunt in her way. She had, no\r\ndoubt, been driven to tell a series of barefaced impudent lies,--lies\r\nof such a nature that they almost made her own hair stand on end as\r\nshe thought of them;--but they would matter nothing if she succeeded;\r\nand if she failed in this matter she did not care much what her aunt\r\nthought of her. Her aunt might now do her a good turn; and some lies\r\nshe must have told;--such had been the emergencies of her position!\r\nAs she thought of it all she was glad that her aunt had met her;\r\nand when Lord Rufford was summoned to take her out to dinner on\r\nthat very Sunday,--a matter as to which her aunt managed everything\r\nherself,--she was immediately aware that her lies had done her good\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n"This was more than I expected," Lord Rufford said when they were\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n"She knew that she had overdone it when she sent you away in that\r\ncavalier way," replied Arabella, "and now she wants to show that she\r\ndidn\'t mean anything."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE DAY AT PELTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duchess did tell the Duke the whole story about Lord Rufford and\r\nArabella that night,--as to which it may be said that she also was\r\nfalse. But according to her conscience there were two ways of telling\r\nsuch a secret. As a matter of course she told her husband everything.\r\nThat idle placid dinner-loving man was in truth consulted about each\r\ndetail of the house and family;--but the secret was told to him\r\nwith injunctions that he was to say nothing about it to any one for\r\ntwenty-four hours. After that the Duchess was of opinion that he\r\nshould speak to Lord Rufford. "What could I say to him?" asked the\r\nDuke. "I\'m not her father."\r\n\r\n"But your brother is so indifferent."\r\n\r\n"No doubt. But that gives me no authority. If he does mean to marry\r\nthe girl he must go to her father;--or it is possible that he might\r\ncome to me. But if he does not mean it, what can I do?" He promised,\r\nhowever, that he would think of it.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark night, or the morning was still dark as night,\r\nwhen Arabella got out of bed and opened her window. The coming of a\r\nfrost now might ruin her. The absence of it might give her everything\r\nin life that she wanted. Lord Rufford had promised her a tedious\r\ncommunication through servants as to the state of the weather. She\r\nwas far too energetic, far too much in earnest, to wait for that.\r\nShe opened the window and putting out her hand she felt a drizzle of\r\nrain. And the air, though the damp from it seemed to chill her all\r\nthrough, was not a frosty air. She stood there a minute so as to be\r\nsure and then retreated to her bed.\r\n\r\nFortune was again favouring her;--but then how would it be if it\r\nshould turn to hard rain? In that case Lady Chiltern and the other\r\nladies certainly would not go, and how in such case should she get\r\nherself conveyed to the meet? She would at any rate go down in her\r\nhat and habit and trust that somebody would provide for her. There\r\nmight be much that would be disagreeable and difficult, but hardly\r\nanything could be worse than the necessity of telling such lies as\r\nthose which she had fabricated on the previous afternoon.\r\n\r\nShe had been much in doubt whether her aunt had or had not believed\r\nher. That the belief was not a thorough belief she was almost\r\ncertain. But then there was the great fact that after the story had\r\nbeen told she had been sent out to dinner leaning on Lord Rufford\'s\r\narm. Unless her aunt had believed something that would not have taken\r\nplace. And then so much of it was true. Surely it would be impossible\r\nthat he should not propose after what had occurred! Her aunt was\r\nevidently alive to the advantage of the marriage,--to the advantage\r\nwhich would accrue not to her, Arabella, individually, but to the\r\nTrefoils generally. She almost thought that her aunt would not put\r\nspokes in her wheel for this day. She wished now that she had told\r\nher aunt that she intended to hunt, so that there need not be any\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nShe slept again and again looked out of the window. It rained a\r\nlittle but still there were hours in which the rain might cease.\r\nAgain she slept and at eight her maid brought her word that there\r\nwould be hunting. It did rain a little but very little. Of course she\r\nwould dress herself in riding attire.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock she walked into the breakfast parlour properly\r\nequipped for the day\'s sport. There were four or five men there in\r\nred coats and top boots, among whom Lord Rufford was conspicuous.\r\nThey were just seating themselves at the breakfast table, and her\r\naunt was already in her place. Lady Chiltern had come into the room\r\nwith herself, and at the door had spoken some good-natured words of\r\nsurprise. "I did not know that you were a sportswoman, Miss Trefoil."\r\n"I do ride a little when I am well mounted," Arabella had said as\r\nshe entered the room. Then she collected herself, and arranged her\r\ncountenance, and endeavoured to look as though she were doing the\r\nmost ordinary thing in the world. She went round the room and kissed\r\nher aunt\'s brow. This she had not done on any other morning; but then\r\non other mornings she had been late. "Are you going to ride?" said\r\nthe Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I believe so, aunt."\r\n\r\n"Who is giving you a horse?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford is lending me one. I don\'t think even his good-nature\r\nwill extend to giving away so perfect an animal. I know him well for\r\nI rode him when I was at Rufford." This she said so that all the room\r\nshould hear her.\r\n\r\n"You need not be afraid, Duchess," said Lord Rufford. "He is quite\r\nsafe."\r\n\r\n"And his name is Jack," said Arabella laughing as she took her place\r\nwith a little air of triumph. "Lord Rufford offered to let me have\r\nhim all the time I was here, but I didn\'t know whether you would take\r\nme in so attended."\r\n\r\nThere was not one who heard her who did not feel that she spoke as\r\nthough Lord Rufford were all her own. Lord Rufford felt it himself\r\nand almost thought he might as well turn himself round and bid his\r\nsister and Miss Penge let him go. He must marry some day and why\r\nshould not this girl do as well as any one else? The Duchess did not\r\napprove of young ladies hunting. She certainly would not have had her\r\nniece at Mistletoe had she expected such a performance. But she could\r\nnot find fault now. There was a feeling in her bosom that if there\r\nwere an engagement it would be cruel to cause obstructions. She\r\ncertainly could not allow a lover in her house for her husband\'s\r\nniece without having official authenticated knowledge of the\r\nrespectability of the lover;--but the whole thing had come upon her\r\nso suddenly that she was at a loss what to do or what to say. It\r\ncertainly did not seem to her that Arabella was in the least afraid\r\nof being found out in any untruth. If the girl were about to become\r\nLady Rufford then it would be for Lord Rufford to decide whether or\r\nno she should hunt. Soon after this the Duke came in and he also\r\nalluded to his niece\'s costume and was informed that she was to ride\r\none of Lord Rufford\'s horses. "I didn\'t hear it mentioned before,"\r\nsaid the Duke. "He\'ll carry Miss Trefoil quite safely," said Lord\r\nRufford who was at the moment standing over a game pie on the\r\nsideboard. Then the subject was allowed to drop.\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine there was no rain, and the ladies were so nearly\r\npunctual that the carriages absolutely started at ten. Some of the\r\nmen rode on; one got a seat on the carriage; and Lord Rufford drove\r\nhimself and a friend in a dog-cart, tandem. The tandem was off before\r\nthe carriages, but Lord Rufford assured them that he would get the\r\nmaster to allow them a quarter of an hour. Arabella contrived to say\r\none word to him. "If you start without me I\'ll never speak to you\r\nagain." He nodded and smiled; but perhaps thought that if so it might\r\nbe as well that he should start without waiting for her.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment the Duchess had taken it into her head that she\r\ntoo would go to the meet. No doubt she was actuated by some feeling\r\nin regard to her niece; but it was not till Arabella was absolutely\r\ngetting on to Jack at the side of the carriage,--under the auspices\r\nof Jack\'s owner,--that the idea occurred to her Grace that there\r\nwould be a great difficulty as to the return home. "Arabella, how do\r\nyou mean to get back?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"That will be all right, aunt," said Arabella.\r\n\r\n"I will see to that," said Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\nThe gracious but impatient master of the hounds had absolutely waited\r\nfull twenty minutes for the Duchess\'s party;--and was not minded to\r\nwait a minute longer for conversation. The moment that the carriages\r\nwere there the huntsmen had started so that there was an excuse\r\nfor hurry. Lord Rufford as he was speaking got on to his own horse,\r\nand before the Duchess could expostulate they were away. There was\r\na feeling of triumph in Arabella\'s bosom as she told herself that\r\nshe had at any rate secured her day\'s hunting in spite of such\r\nheart-breaking difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe sport was fairly good. They had twenty minutes in the morning\r\nand a kill. Then they drew a big wood during which they ate their\r\nlunch and drank their sherry. In the big wood they found a fox but\r\ncould not do anything with him. After that they came on a third in\r\na stubble field and ran him well for half an hour, when he went to\r\nground. It was then three o\'clock; and as the days were now at the\r\nshortest the master declined to draw again. They were then about\r\nsixteen miles from Mistletoe, and about ten from Stamford where\r\nLord Rufford\'s horses were standing. The distance from Stamford to\r\nMistletoe was eight. Lord Rufford proposed that they should ride to\r\nStamford and then go home in a hired carriage. There seemed indeed\r\nto be no other way of getting home without taking three tired\r\nhorses fourteen miles out of their way. Arabella made no objection\r\nwhatever to the arrangement. Lord Rufford did in truth make a slight\r\neffort,--the slightest possible,--to induce a third person to join\r\ntheir party. There was still something pulling at his coat-tail, so\r\nthat there might yet be a chance of saving him from the precipice.\r\nBut he failed. The tired horseman before whom the suggestion was\r\ncasually thrown out, would have been delighted to accept it, instead\r\nof riding all the way to Mistletoe;--but he did not look upon it as\r\nmade in earnest. Two, he knew, were company and three none.\r\n\r\nThe hunting field is by no means a place suited for real love-making.\r\nVery much of preliminary conversation may be done there in a pleasant\r\nway, and intimacies may be formed. But when lovers have already\r\nwalked with arms round each other in a wood, riding together may be\r\nvery pleasant but can hardly be ecstatic. Lord Rufford might indeed\r\nhave asked her to be Lady R. while they were breaking up the first\r\nfox, or as they loitered about in the big wood;--but she did not\r\nexpect that. There was no moment during the day\'s sport in which she\r\nhad a right to tell herself that he was misbehaving because he did\r\nnot so ask her. But in a postchaise it would be different.\r\n\r\nAt the inn at Stamford the horses were given up, and Arabella\r\ncondescended to take a glass of cherry brandy. She had gone through a\r\nlong day; it was then half-past four, and she was not used to be many\r\nhours on horseback. The fatigue seemed to her to be very much greater\r\nthan it had been when she got back to Rufford immediately after the\r\nfatal accident. The ten miles along the road, which had been done in\r\nlittle more than an hour, had almost overcome her. She had determined\r\nnot to cry for mercy as the hard trot went on. She had passed herself\r\noff as an accustomed horsewoman, and having done so well across the\r\ncountry, would not break down coming home. But, as she got into\r\nthe carriage, she was very tired. She could almost have cried with\r\nfatigue;--and yet she told herself that now,--now,--must the work be\r\ndone. She would perhaps tell him that she was tired. She might even\r\nassist her cause by her languor;--but, though she should die for it,\r\nshe would not waste her precious moments by absolute rest. "May I\r\nlight a cigar?" he said as he got in.\r\n\r\n"You know you may. Wherever I may be with you do you think that I\r\nwould interfere with your gratifications?"\r\n\r\n"You are the best girl in all the world," he said as he took out his\r\ncase and threw himself back in the corner.\r\n\r\n"Do you call that a long day?" she asked when he had lit his cigar.\r\n\r\n"Not very long."\r\n\r\n"Because I am so tired."\r\n\r\n"We came home pretty sharp. I thought it best not to shock her Grace\r\nby too great a stretch into the night. As it is you will have time to\r\ngo to bed for an hour or two before you dress. That\'s what I do when\r\nI am in time. You\'ll be right as a trivet then."\r\n\r\n"Oh; I\'m right now,--only tired. It was very nice."\r\n\r\n"Pretty well. We ought to have killed that last fox. And why on\r\nearth we made nothing of that fellow in Gooseberry Grove I couldn\'t\r\nunderstand. Old Tony would never have left that fox alive above\r\nground. Would you like to go to sleep?"\r\n\r\n"O dear no."\r\n\r\n"Afraid of gloves?" said he, drawing nearer to her. They might pull\r\nhim as they liked by his coat-tails but as he was in a postchaise\r\nwith her he must make himself agreeable. She shook her head and\r\nlaughed as she looked at him through the gloom. Then of course he\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford, what does this mean?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know what it means?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly."\r\n\r\n"It means that I think you the jolliest girl out. I never liked\r\nanybody so well as I do you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you never liked anybody," said she.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes, I have; but I am not going to boast of what fortune has\r\ndone for me in that way. I wonder whether you care for me?"\r\n\r\n"Do you want to know?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to know. You have never said that you did."\r\n\r\n"Because you have never asked me."\r\n\r\n"Am I not asking you now, Bella?"\r\n\r\n"There are different ways of asking,--but there is only one way that\r\nwill get an answer from me. No;--no. I will not have it. I have\r\nallowed too much to you already. Oh, I am so tired." Then she sank\r\nback almost into his arms,--but recovered herself very quickly. "Lord\r\nRufford," she said, "if you are a man of honour let there be an end\r\nof this. I am sure you do not wish to make me wretched."\r\n\r\n"I would do anything to make you happy."\r\n\r\n"Then tell me that you love me honestly, sincerely, with all your\r\nheart,--and I shall be happy."\r\n\r\n"You know I do."\r\n\r\n"Do you? Do you?" she said, and then she flung herself on to his\r\nshoulder, and for a while she seemed to faint. For a few minutes\r\nshe lay there and as she was lying she calculated whether it would\r\nbe better to try at this moment to drive him to some clearer\r\ndeclaration, or to make use of what he had already said without\r\ngiving him an opportunity of protesting that he had not meant to make\r\nher an offer of marriage. He had declared that he loved her honestly\r\nand with his whole heart. Would not that justify her in setting her\r\nuncle at him? And might it not be that the Duke would carry great\r\nweight with him;--that the Duke might induce him to utter the fatal\r\nword though she, were she to demand it now, might fail? As she\r\nthought of it all she affected to swoon, and almost herself believed\r\nthat she was swooning. She was conscious but hardly more than\r\nconscious that he was kissing her;--and yet her brain was at work.\r\nShe felt that he would be startled, repelled, perhaps disgusted were\r\nshe absolutely to demand more from him now. "Oh, Rufford;--oh, my\r\ndearest," she said as she woke up, and with her face close to his,\r\nso that he could look into her eyes and see their brightness even\r\nthrough the gloom. Then she extricated herself from his embrace with\r\na shudder and a laugh. "You would hardly believe how tired I am," she\r\nsaid putting out her ungloved hand. He took it and drew her to him\r\nand there she sat in his arms for the short remainder of the journey.\r\n\r\nThey were now in the park, and as the lights of the house came in\r\nsight he gave her some counsel. "Go up to your room at once, dearest,\r\nand lay down."\r\n\r\n"I will. I don\'t think I could go in among them. I should fall."\r\n\r\n"I will see the Duchess and tell her that you are all right,--but\r\nvery tired. If she goes up to you you had better see her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. But I had rather not."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll be sure to come. And, Bella, Jack must be yours now."\r\n\r\n"You are joking."\r\n\r\n"Never more serious in my life. Of course he must remain with me\r\njust at present, but he is your horse." Then, as the carriage was\r\nstopping, she took his hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\nShe got to her room as quickly as possible; and then, before she had\r\neven taken off her hat, she sat down to think of it all,--sending her\r\nmaid away meanwhile to fetch her a cup of tea. He must have meant it\r\nfor an offer. There had at any rate been enough to justify her in so\r\ntaking it. The present he had made to her of the horse could mean\r\nnothing else. Under no other circumstances would it be possible that\r\nshe should either take the horse or use him. Certainly it was an\r\noffer, and as such she would instruct her uncle to use it. Then she\r\nallowed her imagination to revel in thoughts of Rufford Hall, of the\r\nRufford house in town, and a final end to all those weary labours\r\nwhich she would thus have brought to so glorious a termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nLORD RUFFORD WANTS TO SEE A HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Rufford had been quite right about the Duchess. Arabella had\r\nonly taken off her hat and was drinking her tea when the Duchess came\r\nup to her. "Lord Rufford says that you were too tired to come in,"\r\nsaid the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I am tired, aunt;--very tired. But there is nothing the matter with\r\nme. We had to ride ever so far coming home and it was that knocked me\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"It was very bad, your coming home with him in a postchaise,\r\nArabella."\r\n\r\n"Why was it bad, aunt? I thought it very nice."\r\n\r\n"My dear, it shouldn\'t have been done. You ought to have known that.\r\nI certainly wouldn\'t have had you here had I thought that there would\r\nbe anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"It is going to be all right," said Arabella laughing.\r\n\r\nAccording to her Grace\'s view of things it was not and could not be\r\nmade "all right." It would not have been all right were the girl to\r\nbecome Lady Rufford to-morrow. The scandal, or loud reproach due\r\nto evil doings, may be silenced by subsequent conduct. The merited\r\npunishment may not come visibly. But nothing happening after could\r\nmake it right that a young lady should come home from hunting in a\r\npostchaise alone with a young unmarried man. When the Duchess first\r\nheard it she thought what would have been her feelings if such a\r\nthing had been suggested in reference to one of her own daughters!\r\nLord Rufford had come to her in the drawing-room and had told her the\r\nstory in a quiet pleasant manner,--merely saying that Miss Trefoil\r\nwas too much fatigued to show herself at the present moment. She had\r\nthought from his manner that her niece\'s story had been true. There\r\nwas a cordiality and apparent earnestness as to the girl\'s comfort\r\nwhich seemed to be compatible with the story. But still she could\r\nhardly understand that Lord Rufford should wish to have it known that\r\nhe travelled about the country in such a fashion with the girl he\r\nintended to marry. But if it were true, then she must look after\r\nher niece. And even if it were not true,--in which case she would\r\nnever have the girl at Mistletoe again,--yet she could not ignore\r\nher presence in the house. It was now the 18th of January. Lord\r\nRufford was to go on the following day, and Arabella on the 20th.\r\nThe invitation had not been given so as to stretch beyond that.\r\nIf it could be at once decided,--declared by Lord Rufford to the\r\nDuke,--that the match was to be a match, then the invitation should\r\nbe renewed, Arabella should be advised to put off her other friends,\r\nand Lord Rufford should be invited to come back early in the next\r\nmonth and spend a week or two in the proper fashion with his future\r\nbride. All that had been settled between the Duke and the Duchess. So\r\nmuch should be done for the sake of the family. But the Duke had not\r\nseen his way to asking Lord Rufford any question.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess must now find out the truth if she could,--so that if the\r\nstory were false she might get rid of the girl and altogether shake\r\nher off from the Mistletoe roof tree. Arabella\'s manner was certainly\r\nfree from any appearance of hesitation or fear. "I don\'t know about\r\nbeing all right," said the Duchess. "It cannot be right that you\r\nshould have come home with him alone in a hired carriage."\r\n\r\n"Is a hired carriage wickeder than a private one?"\r\n\r\n"If a carriage had been sent from here for you, it would have been\r\ndifferent;--but even then he should not have come with you."\r\n\r\n"But he would I\'m sure;--and I should have asked him. What;--the man\r\nI\'m engaged to marry! Mayn\'t he sit in a carriage with me?"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess could not explain herself, and thought that she had\r\nbetter drop that topic. "What does he mean to do now, Arabella?"\r\n\r\n"What does who mean, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"He means to marry me. And he means to go from here to Mr. Surbiton\'s\r\nto-morrow. I don\'t quite understand the question."\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean to do?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to marry him. And I mean to join mamma in London on\r\nWednesday. I believe we are to go to the Connop Green\'s the next day.\r\nMr. Connop Green is a sort of cousin of mamma;--but they are odious\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"Who is to see Lord Rufford? However, my dear, if you are very tired,\r\nI will leave you now."\r\n\r\n"No, aunt. Stay a moment if you will be so very kind. I am tired; but\r\nif I were twice as tired I would find strength to talk about this. If\r\nmy uncle would speak to Lord Rufford at once I should take it as the\r\nvery kindest thing he could do. I could not send him to my uncle;\r\nfor, after all, one\'s uncle and one\'s father are not the same. I\r\ncould only refer him to papa. But if the Duke would speak to him!"\r\n\r\n"Did he renew his offer to-day?"\r\n\r\n"He has done nothing else but renew it ever since he has been in\r\nthe carriage with me. That\'s the plain truth. He made his offer at\r\nRufford. He renewed it in the wood yesterday;--and he repeated it\r\nover and over again as we came home to-day. It may have been very\r\nwrong, but so it was." Miss Trefoil must have thought that kissing\r\nand proposing were the same thing. Other young ladies have, perhaps,\r\nbefore now made such a mistake. But this young lady had had much\r\nexperience and should have known better.\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford had better perhaps speak to your uncle."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell him so, aunt?"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess thought about it for a moment. She certainly could not\r\ntell Lord Rufford to speak to the Duke without getting the Duke\'s\r\nleave to tell him so. And then, if all this were done, and Lord\r\nRufford were to assure the Duke that the young lady had made a\r\nmistake, how derogatory would all that be to the exalted quiescence\r\nof the house of Mayfair! She thoroughly wished that her niece were\r\nout of the house; for though she did believe the story, her belief\r\nwas not thorough. "I will speak to your uncle," she said. "And now\r\nyou had better go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"And, dear aunt, pray excuse me at dinner. I have been so excited, so\r\nflurried, and so fatigued, that I fear I should make a fool of myself\r\nif I attempted to come down. I should get into a swoon, which would\r\nbe dreadful. My maid shall bring me a bit of something and a glass of\r\nsherry, and you shall find me in the drawing-room when you come out."\r\nThen the Duchess went, and Arabella was left alone to take another\r\nview of the circumstances of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThough there were still infinite dangers, yet she could hardly wish\r\nthat anything should be altered. Should Lord Rufford disown her,\r\nwhich she knew to be quite possible, there would be a general\r\ncollapse and the world would crash over her head. But she had known,\r\nwhen she took this business in hand, that as success would open\r\nElysium to her, so would failure involve her in absolute ruin. She\r\nwas determined that she would mar nothing now by cowardice, and\r\nhaving so resolved, and having fortified herself with perhaps two\r\nglasses of sherry, she went down to the drawing-room a little before\r\nnine, and laid herself out upon a sofa till the ladies should come\r\nin.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford had gone to bed, as was his wont on such occasions, with\r\norders that he should be called to dress for dinner at half-past\r\nseven. But as he laid himself down he made up his mind that, instead\r\nof sleeping, he would give himself up to thinking about Arabella\r\nTrefoil. The matter was going beyond a joke, and would require some\r\nthinking. He liked her well enough, but was certainly not in love\r\nwith her. I doubt whether men ever are in love with girls who throw\r\nthemselves into their arms. A man\'s love, till it has been chastened\r\nand fastened by the feeling of duty which marriage brings with it,\r\nis instigated mainly by the difficulty of pursuit. "It is hardly\r\npossible that anything so sweet as that should ever be mine; and\r\nyet, because I am a man, and because it is so heavenly sweet, I will\r\ntry." That is what men say to themselves, but Lord Rufford had had no\r\nopportunity of saying that to himself in regard to Miss Trefoil. The\r\nthing had been sweet, but not heavenly sweet; and he had never for a\r\nmoment doubted the possibility. Now at any rate he would make up his\r\nmind. But, instead of doing so, he went to sleep, and when he got up\r\nhe was ten minutes late, and was forced, as he dressed himself, to\r\nthink of the Duke\'s dinner instead of Arabella Trefoil.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess before dinner submitted herself and all her troubles at\r\ngreat length to the Duke, but the Duke could give her no substantial\r\ncomfort. Of course it had all been wrong. He supposed that they\r\nought not to have been found walking together in the dark on Sunday\r\nafternoon. The hunting should not have been arranged without\r\nsanction; and the return home in the hired carriage had no doubt\r\nbeen highly improper. But what could he do? If the marriage came\r\noff it would be all well. If not, this niece must not be invited to\r\nMistletoe again. As to speaking to Lord Rufford, he did not quite see\r\nhow he was to set about it. His own girls had been married in so very\r\ndifferent a fashion! He could imagine nothing so disagreeable as to\r\nhave to ask a gentleman his intentions. Parental duty might make it\r\nnecessary when a daughter had not known how to keep her own position\r\nintact;--but here there was no parental duty. If Lord Rufford would\r\nspeak to him, then indeed there would be no difficulty. At last he\r\ntold his wife that, if she could find an opportunity of suggesting to\r\nthe young Lord that he might perhaps say a word to the young lady\'s\r\nuncle without impropriety,--if she could do this in a light easy way,\r\nso as to run no peril of a scene,--she might do so.\r\n\r\nWhen the two duchesses and all the other ladies came out into the\r\ndrawing-room, Arabella was found upon the sofa. Of course she became\r\nthe centre of a little interest for a few minutes, and the more so,\r\nas her aunt went up to her and made some inquiries. Had she had any\r\ndinner? Was she less fatigued? The fact of the improper return home\r\nin the postchaise had become generally known, and there were some\r\nthere who would have turned a very cold shoulder to Arabella had not\r\nher aunt noticed her. Perhaps there were some who had envied her\r\nJack, and Lord Rufford\'s admiration, and even the postchaise. But as\r\nlong as her aunt countenanced her it was not likely that any one at\r\nMistletoe would be unkind to her. The Duchess of Omnium did indeed\r\nremark to Lady Chiltern that she remembered something of the same\r\nkind happening to the same girl soon after her own marriage. As the\r\nDuchess had now been married a great many years this was unkind;--but\r\nit was known that when the Duchess of Omnium did dislike any one, she\r\nnever scrupled to show it. "Lord Rufford is about the silliest man\r\nof his day," she said afterwards to the same lady; "but there is one\r\nthing which I do not think even he is silly enough to do."\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten o\'clock when the gentlemen came into the room\r\nand then it was that the Duchess,--Arabella\'s aunt,--must find\r\nthe opportunity of giving Lord Rufford the hint of which the Duke\r\nhad spoken. He was to leave Mistletoe on the morrow and might not\r\nimprobably do so early. Of all women she was the steadiest, the most\r\ntranquil, the least abrupt in her movements. She could not pounce\r\nupon a man, and nail him down, and say what she had to say, let him\r\nbe as unwilling as he might to hear it. At last, however, seeing Lord\r\nRufford standing alone,--he had then just left the sofa on which\r\nArabella was still lying,--without any apparent effort she made her\r\nway up to his side. "You had rather a long day," she said.\r\n\r\n"Not particularly, Duchess."\r\n\r\n"You had to come home so far!"\r\n\r\n"About the average distance. Did you think it a hard day, Maurice?"\r\nThen he called to his aid a certain Lord Maurice St. John, a\r\nhard-riding and hard-talking old friend of the Trefoil family who\r\ngave the Duchess a very clear account of all the performance, during\r\nwhich Lord Rufford fell into an interesting conversation with Mrs.\r\nMulready, the wife of the neighbouring bishop.\r\n\r\nAfter that the Duchess made another attempt. "Lord Rufford," she\r\nsaid, "we should be so glad if you would come back to us the first\r\nweek in February. The Prices will be here and the Mackenzies, and--."\r\n\r\n"I am pledged to stay with my sister till the fifth, and on the sixth\r\nSurbiton and all his lot come to me. Battersby, is it not the sixth\r\nthat you and Surbiton come to Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"I rather think it is," said Battersby.\r\n\r\n"I wish it were possible. I like Mistletoe so much. It\'s so central."\r\n\r\n"Very well for hunting,--is it not, Lord Rufford?" But that horrid\r\nCaptain Battersby did not go out of the way.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether Lady Chiltern would do me a favour," said Lord\r\nRufford stepping across the room in search of that lady. He might\r\nbe foolish, but when the Duchess of Omnium declared him to be the\r\nsilliest man of the day I think she used a wrong epithet. The Duchess\r\nwas very patient and intended to try again, but on that evening she\r\ngot no opportunity.\r\n\r\nCaptain Battersby was Lord Rufford\'s particular friend on this\r\noccasion and had come over with him from Mr. Surbiton\'s house. "Bat,"\r\nhe said as they were sitting close to each other in the smoking-room\r\nthat night, "I mean to make an early start to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"What;--to get to Surbiton\'s?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got something to do on the way. I want to look at a horse at\r\nStamford."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be off with you."\r\n\r\n"No;--don\'t do that. I\'ll go in my own cart. I\'ll make my man get\r\nhold of my groom and manage it somehow. I can leave my things and you\r\ncan bring them. Only say to-morrow that I was obliged to go."\r\n\r\n"I understand."\r\n\r\n"Heard something, you know, and all that kind of thing. Make my\r\napologies to the Duchess. In point of fact I must be in Stamford at\r\nten."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll manage it all," said Captain Battersby, who made a very shrewd\r\nguess at the cause which drew his friend to such an uncomfortable\r\nproceeding. After that Lord Rufford went to his room and gave a good\r\ndeal of trouble that night to some of the servants in reference to\r\nthe steps which would be necessary to take him out of harm\'s way\r\nbefore the Duchess would be up on the morrow.\r\n\r\nArabella when she heard of the man\'s departure on the following\r\nmorning, which she luckily did from her own maid, was for some time\r\noverwhelmed by it. Of course the man was running away from her. There\r\ncould be no doubt of it. She had watched him narrowly on the previous\r\nevening, and had seen that her aunt had tried in vain to speak to\r\nhim. But she did not on that account give up the game. At any rate\r\nthey had not found her out at Mistletoe. That was something. Of\r\ncourse it would have been infinitely better for her could he have\r\nbeen absolutely caught and nailed down before he left the house;\r\nbut that was perhaps more than she had a right to expect. She could\r\nstill pursue him; still write to him;--and at last, if necessary,\r\nforce her father to do so. But she must trust now chiefly to her own\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n"He told me, aunt, the last thing last night that he was going," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Why did you not mention it?"\r\n\r\n"I thought he would have told you. I saw him speaking to you. He\r\nhad received some telegram about a horse. He\'s the most flighty\r\nman in the world about such things. I am to write to him before I\r\nleave this to-morrow." Then the Duchess did not believe a word of\r\nthe engagement. She felt at any rate certain that if there was an\r\nengagement, Lord Rufford did not mean to keep it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SENATOR IS BADLY TREATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these great efforts were being made by Arabella Trefoil at\r\nMistletoe, John Morton was vacillating in an unhappy mood between\r\nLondon and Bragton. It may be remembered that an offer was made to\r\nhim as to the purchase of Chowton Farm. At that time the Mistletoe\r\nparty was broken up, and Miss Trefoil was staying with her mother at\r\nthe Connop Greens. By the morning post on the next day he received\r\na note from the Senator in which Mr. Gotobed stated that business\r\nrequired his presence at Dillsborough and suggested that he should\r\nagain become a guest at Bragton for a few days. Morton was so sick\r\nof his own company and so tired of thinking of his own affairs that\r\nhe was almost glad to welcome the Senator. At any rate he had no\r\nmeans of escaping, and the Senator came. The two men were alone at\r\nthe house and the Senator was full of his own wrongs as well as\r\nthose of Englishmen in general. Mr. Bearside had written to him very\r\ncautiously, but pressing for an immediate remittance of L25, and\r\nexplaining that the great case could not be carried on without that\r\nsum of money. This might have been very well as being open to the\r\nidea that the Senator had the option of either paying the money or of\r\nallowing the great case to be abandoned, but that the attorney in the\r\nlast paragraph of his letter intimated that the Senator would be of\r\ncourse aware that he was liable for the whole cost of the action be\r\nit what it might. He had asked a legal friend in London his opinion,\r\nand the legal friend had seemed to think that perhaps he was liable.\r\nWhat orders he had given to Bearside he had given without any\r\nwitness, and at any rate had already paid a certain sum. The legal\r\nfriend, when he heard all that Mr. Gotobed was able to tell him about\r\nGoarly, had advised the Senator to settle with Bearside,--taking a\r\ndue receipt and having some person with him when he did so. The legal\r\nfriend had thought that a small sum of money would suffice. "He went\r\nso far as to suggest," said the Senator with indignant energy, "that\r\nif I contested my liability to the man\'s charges, the matter would go\r\nagainst me because I had interfered in such a case on the unpopular\r\nside. I should think that in this great country I should find justice\r\nadministered on other terms than that." Morton attempted to explain\r\nto him that his legal friend had not been administering justice but\r\nonly giving advice. He had, so Morton told him, undoubtedly taken up\r\nthe case of one blackguard, and in urging it had paid his money to\r\nanother. He had done so as a foreigner,--loudly proclaiming as his\r\nreason for such action that the man he supported would be unfairly\r\ntreated unless he gave his assistance. Of course he could not expect\r\nsympathy. "I want no sympathy," said the Senator;--"I only want\r\njustice." Then the two gentlemen had become a little angry with each\r\nother. Morton was the last man in the world to have been aggressive\r\non such a matter;--but with the Senator it was necessary either to be\r\nprostrate or to fight.\r\n\r\nBut with Mr. Gotobed such fighting never produced ill blood. It was\r\nthe condition of his life, and it must be supposed that he liked it.\r\nOn the next morning he did not scruple to ask his host\'s advice as\r\nto what he had better do, and they agreed to walk across to Goarly\'s\r\nhouse and to ascertain from the man himself what he thought or might\r\nhave to say about his own case. On their way they passed up the road\r\nleading to Chowton Farm, and at the gate leading into the garden they\r\nfound Larry Twentyman standing. Morton shook hands with the young\r\nfarmer and introduced the Senator. Larry was still woe-begone though\r\nhe endeavoured to shake off his sorrows and to appear to be gay. "I\r\nnever see much of the man," he said when they told him that they were\r\ngoing across to call upon his neighbour, "and I don\'t know that I\r\nwant to."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t seem to have much friendship among you all," said the\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\n"Quite as much as he deserves, Mr. Gotobed," replied Larry. The\r\nSenator\'s name had lately become familiar as a household word in\r\nDillsborough, and was, to tell the truth, odious to such men as Larry\r\nTwentyman. "He\'s a thundering rascal, and the only place fit for him\r\nin the county is Rufford gaol. He\'s like to be there soon, I think."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what provokes me," said the Senator. "You think he\'s a\r\nrascal, Mister."\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"And because you take upon yourself to think so you\'d send him to\r\nRufford gaol! There was one gentleman somewhere about here told me\r\nhe ought to be hung, and because I would not agree with him he got\r\nup and walked away from me at table, carrying his provisions with\r\nhim. Another man in the next field to this insulted me because I said\r\nI was going to see Goarly. The clergyman in Dillsborough and the\r\nhotelkeepers were just as hard upon me. But you see, Mister, that\r\nwhat we want to find out is whether Goarly or the Lord has the right\r\nof it in this particular case."\r\n\r\n"I know which has the right without any more finding out," said\r\nLarry. "The shortest way to his house is by the ride through the\r\nwood, Mr. Morton. It takes you out on his land on the other side.\r\nBut I don\'t think you\'ll find him there. One of my men told me that\r\nhe had made himself scarce." Then he added as the two were going\r\non, "I should like to have just a word with you, Mr. Morton. I\'ve\r\nbeen thinking of what you said, and I know it was kind. I\'ll take\r\na month over it. I won\'t talk of selling Chowton till the end of\r\nFebruary;--but if I feel about it then as I do now I can\'t stay."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Mr. Twentyman;--and work hard, like a man, through the\r\nmonth. Go out hunting, and don\'t allow yourself a moment for moping."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Larry, as he retreated to the house, and then he gave\r\ndirections that his horse might be ready for the morrow.\r\n\r\nThey went in through the wood, and the Senator pointed out the spot\r\nat which Bean the gamekeeper had been so insolent to him. He could\r\nnot understand, he said, why he should be treated so roughly, as\r\nthese men must be aware that he had nothing to gain himself. "If I\r\nwere to go into Mickewa," said Morton, "and interfere there with the\r\npeculiarities of the people as you have done here, it\'s my belief\r\nthat they\'d have had the eyes out of my head long before this."\r\n\r\n"That only shows that you don\'t know Mickewa," said the Senator. "Its\r\npeople are the most law-abiding population on the face of the earth."\r\n\r\nThey passed through the wood, and a couple of fields brought them to\r\nGoarly\'s house. As they approached it by the back the only live thing\r\nthey saw was the old goose which had been so cruelly deprived of\r\nher companions and progeny. The goose was waddling round the dirty\r\npool, and there were to be seen sundry ugly signs of a poor man\'s\r\nhabitation, but it was not till they had knocked at the window as\r\nwell as the door that Mrs. Goarly showed herself. She remembered the\r\nSenator at once and curtseyed to him; and when Morton introduced\r\nhimself she curtseyed again to the Squire of Bragton. When Goarly was\r\nasked for she shook her head and declared that she knew nothing about\r\nhim. He had been gone, she said, for the last week, and had left no\r\nword as to whither he was going;--nor had he told her why. "Has he\r\ngiven up his action against Lord Rufford?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"Indeed then, sir, I can\'t tell you a word about it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been told that he has taken Lord Rufford\'s money."\r\n\r\n"He ain\'t \'a taken no money as I\'ve seed, sir. I wish he had, for\r\nmoney\'s sore wanted here, and if the gen\'leman has a mind to be\r\nkind-hearted--" Then she intimated her own readiness to take any\r\ncontribution to the good cause which the Senator might be willing to\r\nmake at that moment. But the Senator buttoned up his breeches pockets\r\nwith stern resolution. Though he still believed Lord Rufford to be\r\naltogether wrong, he was beginning to think that the Goarlys were\r\nnot worthy his benevolence. As she came to the door with them and\r\naccompanied them a few yards across the field she again told the\r\ntragic tale of her goose;--but the Senator had not another word to\r\nsay to her.\r\n\r\nOn that same day Morton drove Mr. Gotobed into Dillsborough and\r\nconsented to go with him to Mr. Bearside\'s office. They found the\r\nattorney at home, and before anything was said as to payment they\r\nheard his account of the action. If Goarly had consented to take any\r\nmoney from Lord Rufford he knew nothing about it. As far as he was\r\naware the action was going on. Ever so many witnesses must be brought\r\nfrom a distance who had seen the crop standing and who would have no\r\nbias against the owner,--as would be the case with neighbours, such\r\nas Lawrence Twentyman. Of course it was not easy to oppose such a man\r\nas Lord Rufford and a little money must be spent. Indeed such, he\r\nsaid, was his interest in the case that he had already gone further\r\nthan he ought to have done out of his own pocket. Of course they\r\nwould be successful,--that is if the matter were carried on with\r\nspirit, and then the money would all come back again. But just at\r\npresent a little money must be spent. "I don\'t mean to spend it,"\r\nsaid the Senator.\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t stick to that, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"But I shall, sir. I understand from your letter that you look to me\r\nfor funds."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do, Mr. Gotobed;--because you told me to do so."\r\n\r\n"I told you nothing of the kind, Mr. Bearside."\r\n\r\n"You paid me L15 on account, Mr. Gotobed."\r\n\r\n"I paid you L15 certainly."\r\n\r\n"And told me that more should be coming as it was wanted. Do you\r\nthink I should have gone on for such a man as Goarly,--a fellow\r\nwithout a shilling,--unless he had some one like you to back him? It\r\nisn\'t likely. Now, Mr. Morton, I appeal to you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose that my friend has made himself liable for your bill\r\nbecause he paid you L15 with the view of assisting Goarly," said\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\n"But he said that he meant to go on, Mr. Morton. He said that plain,\r\nand I can swear it. Now, Mr. Gotobed, you just say out like an honest\r\nman whether you didn\'t give me to understand that you meant to go\r\non."\r\n\r\n"I never employed you or made myself responsible for your bill."\r\n\r\n"You authorized me, distinctly,--most distinctly, and I shall\r\nstick to it. When a gentleman comes to a lawyer\'s office and pays\r\nhis money and tells that lawyer as how he means to see the case\r\nout,--explaining his reasons as you did when you said all that\r\nagainst the landlords and squires and nobility of this here\r\ncountry,--why then that lawyer has a right to think that that\r\ngentleman is his mark."\r\n\r\n"I thought you were employed by Mr. Scrobby," said Morton, who had\r\nheard much of the story by this time.\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr. Morton, I must make bold to say that you have heard wrong.\r\nI know nothing of Mr. Scrobby and don\'t want. There ain\'t nothing\r\nabout the poisoning of that fox in this case of ours. Scrobby and\r\nGoarly may have done that, or Scrobby and Goarly may be as innocent\r\nas two babes unborn for aught I know or care. Excuse me, Mr. Morton,\r\nbut I have to be on my p\'s and q\'s I see. This is a case for trespass\r\nand damage against Lord Rufford in which we ask for 40_s._ an acre.\r\nOf course there is expenses. There\'s my own time. I ain\'t to be kept\r\nhere talking to you two gentlemen for nothing, I suppose. Well; this\r\ngentleman comes to me and pays me L15 to go on. I couldn\'t have gone\r\non without something. The gentleman saw that plain enough. And he\r\ntold me he\'d see me through the rest of it."\r\n\r\n"I said nothing of the kind, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Then we must put it to a jury. May I make bold to ask\r\nwhether you are going out of the country all at once?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be here for the next two months, at least."\r\n\r\n"Happy to hear it, sir, and have no doubt it will all be settled\r\nbefore that time--amiable or otherwise. But as I am money out of\r\npocket I did hope you would have paid me something on account\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Gotobed made his offer, informing Mr. Bearside that he had\r\nbrought his friend, Mr. Morton, with him in order that there might\r\nbe a witness. "I could see that, sir, with half an eye," said the\r\nattorney unabashed. He was willing to pay Mr. Bearside a further sum\r\nof L10 immediately to be quit of the affair, not because he thought\r\nthat any such sum was due, but because he wished to free himself\r\nfrom further trouble in the matter. Mr. Bearside hinted in a very\r\ncavalier way that L20 might be thought of. A further payment of L20\r\nwould cover the money he was out of pocket. But this proposition\r\nMr. Gotobed indignantly refused, and then left the office with his\r\nfriend. "Wherever there are lawyers there will be rogues," said the\r\nSenator, as soon as he found himself in the street. "It is a noble\r\nprofession, that of the law; the finest perhaps that the work of the\r\nworld affords; but it gives scope and temptation for roguery. I do\r\nnot think, however, that you would find anything in America so bad as\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Why did you go to him without asking any questions?"\r\n\r\n"Of whom was I to ask questions? When I took up Goarly\'s case he had\r\nalready put it into this man\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you should be troubled, Mr. Gotobed; but, upon my word, I\r\ncannot say but what it serves you right."\r\n\r\n"That is because you are offended with me. I endeavoured to protect\r\na poor man against a rich man, and that in this country is cause of\r\noffence."\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the attorney\'s office they called on Mr. Mainwaring the\r\nrector, and found that he knew, or professed to know, a great deal\r\nmore about Goarly, than they had learned from Bearside. According to\r\nhis story Nickem, who was clerk to Mr. Masters, had Goarly in safe\r\nkeeping somewhere. The rector indeed was acquainted with all the\r\ndetails. Scrobby had purchased the red herrings and strychnine, and\r\nhad employed Goarly to walk over by night to Rufford and fetch them.\r\nThe poison at that time had been duly packed in the herrings. Goarly\r\nhad done this and had, at Scrobby\'s instigation, laid the bait down\r\nin Dillsborough Wood. Nickem was now at work trying to learn where\r\nScrobby had purchased the poison, as it was feared that Goarly\'s\r\nevidence alone would not suffice to convict the man. But if the\r\nstrychnine could be traced and the herrings, then there would be\r\nalmost a certainty of punishing Scrobby.\r\n\r\n"And what about Goarly?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"He would escape of course," said the rector. "He would get a little\r\nmoney and after such an experience would probably become a good\r\nfriend to fox-hunting."\r\n\r\n"And quite a respectable man!" The rector did not guarantee this but\r\nseemed to think that there would at any rate be promise of improved\r\nconduct. "The place ought to be too hot to hold him!" exclaimed the\r\nSenator indignantly. The rector seemed to think it possible that he\r\nmight find it uncomfortable at first, in which case he would sell the\r\nland at a good price to Lord Rufford and every one concerned would\r\nhave been benefited by the transaction,--except Scrobby for whom no\r\none would feel any pity.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen then promised to come and dine with the rector on\r\nthe following day. He feared he said that he could not make up a\r\nparty as there was,--he declared,--nobody in Dillsborough. "I never\r\nknew such a place," said the rector. "Except old Nupper, who is\r\nthere? Masters is a very decent fellow himself, but he has got out\r\nof that kind of thing;--and you can\'t ask a man without asking his\r\nwife. As for clergymen, I\'m sick of dining with my own cloth and\r\ndiscussing the troubles of sermons. There never was such a place as\r\nDillsborough." Then he whispered a word to the Squire. Was the Squire\r\nunwilling to meet his cousin Reginald Morton? Things were said and\r\npeople never knew what was true and what was false. Then John Morton\r\ndeclared that he would be very happy to meet his cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMR. MAINWARING\'S LITTLE DINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company at the rector\'s house consisted of the Senator, the\r\ntwo Mortons, Mr. Surtees the curate, and old Doctor Nupper. Mrs.\r\nMainwaring was not well enough to appear, and the rector therefore\r\nwas able to indulge himself in what he called a bachelor party. As a\r\nrule he disliked clergymen, but at the last had been driven to invite\r\nhis curate because he thought six a better number than five for\r\njoviality. He began by asking questions as to the Trefoils which were\r\nnot very fortunate. Of course he had heard that Morton was to marry\r\nArabella Trefoil, and though he made no direct allusion to the fact,\r\nas Reginald had done, he spoke in that bland eulogistic tone which\r\nclearly showed his purpose. "They went with you to Lord Rufford\'s, I\r\nwas told."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--they did."\r\n\r\n"And now they have left the neighbourhood. A very clever young lady,\r\nMiss Trefoil;--and so is her mother, a very clever woman." The\r\nSenator, to whom a sort of appeal was made, nodded his assent. "Lord\r\nAugustus, I believe, is a brother of the Duke of Mayfair?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is," said Morton. "I am afraid we are going to have frost\r\nagain." Then Reginald Morton was sure that the marriage would never\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\n"The Trefoils are a very distinguished family," continued the rector.\r\n"I remember the present Duke\'s father when he was in the cabinet,\r\nand knew this man almost intimately when we were at Christchurch\r\ntogether. I don\'t think this Duke ever took a prominent part in\r\npolitics."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he ever did," said Morton.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, how tipsy he was once driving back to Oxford with me in\r\na gig. But he has the reputation of being one of the best landlords\r\nin the country now."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what it is that gives a man the reputation of being a good\r\nlandlord. Is it foxes?" asked the Senator. The rector acknowledged\r\nwith a smile that foxes helped. "Or does it mean that he lets his\r\nland below the value? If so, he certainly does more harm than good,\r\nthough he may like the popularity which he is rich enough to buy."\r\n\r\n"It means that he does not exact more than his due," said the rector\r\nindiscreetly.\r\n\r\n"When I hear a man so highly praised for common honesty I am of\r\ncourse led to suppose that dishonesty in his particular trade is\r\nthe common rule. The body of English landlords must be exorbitant\r\ntyrants when one among them is so highly eulogised for taking no more\r\nthan his own." Luckily at that moment dinner was announced, and the\r\nexceptional character of the Duke of Mayfair was allowed to drop.\r\n\r\nMr. Mainwaring\'s dinner was very good and his wines were\r\nexcellent,--a fact of which Mr. Mainwaring himself was much better\r\naware than any of his guests. There is a difficulty in the giving\r\nof dinners of which Mr. Mainwaring and some other hosts have become\r\npainfully aware. What service do you do to any one in pouring your\r\nbest claret down his throat, when he knows no difference between that\r\nand a much more humble vintage,--your best claret which you feel so\r\nsure you cannot replace? Why import canvas-back ducks for appetites\r\nwhich would be quite as well satisfied with those out of the next\r\nfarm-yard? Your soup, which has been a care since yesterday, your\r\nfish, got down with so great trouble from Bond Street on that very\r\nday, your saddle of mutton, in selecting which you have affronted\r\nevery butcher in the neighbourhood, are all plainly thrown away! And\r\nyet the hospitable hero who would fain treat his friends as he would\r\nbe treated himself can hardly arrange his dinners according to the\r\npalates of his different guests; nor will he like, when strangers sit\r\nat his board, to put nothing better on his table than that cheaper\r\nwine with which needful economy induces him to solace himself when\r\nalone. I,--I who write this,--have myself seen an honoured guest\r\ndeluge with the pump my, ah! so hardly earned, most scarce and most\r\npeculiar vintage! There is a pang in such usage which some will not\r\nunderstand, but which cut Mr. Mainwaring to the very soul. There was\r\nnot one among them there who appreciated the fact that the claret\r\non his dinner table was almost the best that its year had produced.\r\nIt was impossible not to say a word on such a subject at such a\r\nmoment;--though our rector was not a man who usually lauded his\r\nown viands. "I think you will find that claret what you like, Mr.\r\nGotobed," he said. "It\'s a \'57 Mouton, and judges say that it is\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"Very good indeed," said the Senator. "In the States we haven\'t got\r\ninto the way yet of using dinner clarets." It was as good as a play\r\nto see the rector wince under the ignominious word. "Your great\r\nstatesman added much to your national comfort when he took the duty\r\noff the lighter kinds of French wines."\r\n\r\nThe rector could not stand it. He hated light wines. He hated cheap\r\nthings in general. And he hated Gladstone in particular. "Nothing,"\r\nsaid he, "that the statesman you speak of ever did could make such\r\nwine as that any cheaper. I am sorry, sir, that you don\'t perceive\r\nthe difference."\r\n\r\n"In the matter of wine," said the Senator, "I don\'t think that I have\r\nhappened to come across anything so good in this country as our old\r\nMadeiras. But then, sir, we have been fortunate in our climate. The\r\nEnglish atmosphere is not one in which wine seems to reach its full\r\nperfection." The rector heaved a deep sigh as he looked up to the\r\nceiling with his hands in his trowsers-pockets. He knew, or thought\r\nthat he knew, that no one could ever get a glass of good wine in the\r\nUnited States. He knew, or thought that he knew, that the best wine\r\nin the world was brought to England. He knew, or thought he knew,\r\nthat in no other country was wine so well understood, so diligently\r\nsought for, and so truly enjoyed as in England. And he imagined that\r\nit was less understood and less sought for and less enjoyed in the\r\nStates than in any other country. He did not as yet know the Senator\r\nwell enough to fight with him at his own table, and could only groan\r\nand moan and look up at the ceiling. Doctor Nupper endeavoured to\r\ntake away the sting by smacking his lips, and Reginald Morton, who\r\ndid not in truth care a straw what he drank, was moved to pity and\r\ndeclared the claret to be very fine. "I have nothing to say against\r\nit," said the Senator, who was not in the least abashed.\r\n\r\nBut when the cloth was drawn,--for the rector clung so lovingly to\r\nold habits that he delighted to see his mahogany beneath the wine\r\nglasses,--a more serious subject of dispute arose suddenly, though\r\nperhaps hardly more disagreeable. "The thing in England," said the\r\nSenator, "which I find most difficult to understand, is the matter of\r\nwhat you call Church patronage."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll pass half an hour with Mr. Surtees to-morrow morning,\r\nhe\'ll explain it all to you," said the rector, who did not like that\r\nany subject connected with his profession should be mooted after\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n"I should be delighted," said Mr. Surtees.\r\n\r\n"Nothing would give me more pleasure," said the Senator; "but what\r\nI mean is this;--the question is, of course, one of paramount\r\nimportance."\r\n\r\n"No doubt it is," said the deluded rector.\r\n\r\n"It is very necessary to get good doctors."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, rather;--considering that all men wish to live." That\r\nobservation, of course, came from Doctor Nupper.\r\n\r\n"And care is taken in employing a lawyer,--though, after my\r\nexperience of yesterday, not always, I should say, so much care as is\r\nneedful. The man who wants such aid looks about him and gets the best\r\ndoctor he can for his money, or the best lawyer. But here in England\r\nhe must take the clergyman provided for him."\r\n\r\n"It would be very much better for him if he did," said the rector.\r\n\r\n"A clergyman at any rate is supposed to be appointed; and that\r\nclergyman he must pay."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said the rector. "The clergy are paid by the wise\r\nprovision of former ages."\r\n\r\n"We will let that pass for the present," said the Senator. "There he\r\nis, however he may be paid. How does he get there?" Now it was the\r\nfact that Mr. Mainwaring\'s living had been bought for him with his\r\nwife\'s money,--a fact of which Mr. Gotobed was not aware, but which\r\nhe would hardly have regarded had he known it. "How does he get\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"In the majority of cases the bishop puts him there," said Mr.\r\nSurtees.\r\n\r\n"And how is the bishop governed in his choice? As far as I can learn\r\nthe stipends are absurdly various, one man getting L100 a year for\r\nworking like a horse in a big town, and another L1000 for living an\r\nidle life in a luxurious country house. But the bishop of course\r\ngives the bigger plums to the best men. How is it then that the big\r\nplums find their way so often to the sons and sons-in-law and nephews\r\nof the bishops?"\r\n\r\n"Because the bishop has looked after their education and principles,"\r\nsaid the rector.\r\n\r\n"And taught them how to choose their wives," said the Senator with\r\nimperturbable gravity.\r\n\r\n"I am not the son of a bishop, sir," exclaimed the rector.\r\n\r\n"I wish you had been, sir, if it would have done you any good. A\r\ngeneral can\'t make his son a colonel at the age of twenty-five, or\r\nan admiral his son a first lieutenant, or a judge his a Queen\'s\r\nCounsellor,--nor can the head of an office promote his to be a chief\r\nsecretary. It is only a bishop can do this;--I suppose because a cure\r\nof souls is so much less important than the charge of a ship or the\r\ndiscipline of twenty or thirty clerks."\r\n\r\n"The bishops don\'t do it," said the rector fiercely.\r\n\r\n"Then the statistics which have been put into my hands belie them.\r\nBut how is it with those the bishops don\'t appoint? There seems to me\r\nto be such a complication of absurdities as to defy explanation."\r\n\r\n"I think I could explain them all," said Mr. Surtees mildly.\r\n\r\n"If you can do so satisfactorily, I shall be very glad to hear it,"\r\ncontinued the Senator, who seemed in truth to be glad to hear no one\r\nbut himself. "A lad of one-and-twenty learns his lessons so well\r\nthat he has to be rewarded at his college, and a part of his reward\r\nconsists in his having a parish entrusted to him when he is forty\r\nyears old, to which he can maintain his right whether he be in any\r\nway trained for such work or no. Is that true?"\r\n\r\n"His collegiate education is the best training he can have," said the\r\nrector.\r\n\r\n"I came across a young fellow the other day," continued the Senator,\r\n"in a very nice house, with L700 a year, and learned that he had\r\ninherited the living because he was his father\'s second son. Some\r\npoor clergyman had been keeping it ready for him for the last fifteen\r\nyears and had to turn out as soon as this young spark could be made a\r\nclergyman."\r\n\r\n"It was his father\'s property," said the rector, "and the poor man\r\nhad had great kindness shown him for those fifteen years."\r\n\r\n"Exactly;--his father\'s property! And this is what you call a cure of\r\nsouls! And another man had absolutely had his living bought for him\r\nby his uncle,--just as he might have bought him a farm. He couldn\'t\r\nhave bought him the command of a regiment or a small judgeship. In\r\nthose matters you require capacity. It is only when you deal with the\r\nChurch that you throw to the winds all ideas of fitness. \'Sir,\' or\r\n\'Madam,\' or perhaps, \'my little dear,\' you are bound to come to your\r\nplaces in Church and hear me expound the Word of God because I have\r\npaid a heavy sum of money for the privilege of teaching you, at the\r\nmoderate salary of L600 a year!\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Surtees sat aghast, with his mouth open, and knew not how to say\r\na word. Doctor Nupper rubbed his red nose. Reginald Morton attempted\r\nsome suggestion about the wine which fell wretchedly flat. John\r\nMorton ventured to tell his friend that he did not understand the\r\nsubject. "I shall be most happy to be instructed," said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"Understand it!" said the rector, almost rising in his chair to\r\nrebuke the insolence of his guest--"He understands nothing about\r\nit, and yet he ventures to fall foul with unmeasured terms on an\r\nestablishment which has been brought to its present condition by the\r\nfostering care of perhaps the most pious set of divines that ever\r\nlived, and which has produced results with which those of no other\r\nChurch can compare!"\r\n\r\n"Have I represented anything untruly?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"A great deal, sir."\r\n\r\n"Only put me right, and no man will recall his words more readily. Is\r\nit not the case that livings in the Church of England can be bought\r\nand sold?"\r\n\r\n"The matter is one, sir," said the rector, "which cannot be discussed\r\nin this manner. There are two clergymen present to whom such language\r\nis distasteful; as it is also I hope to the others who are all\r\nmembers of the Church of England. Perhaps you will allow me to\r\nrequest that the subject may be changed." After that conversation\r\nflagged and the evening was by no means joyous. The rector certainly\r\nregretted that his "\'57" claret should have been expended on such a\r\nman. "I don\'t think," said he when John Morton had taken the Senator\r\naway, "that in my whole life before I ever met such a brute as that\r\nAmerican Senator."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPERSECUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was great consternation in the attorney\'s house after the\r\nwriting of the letter to Lawrence Twentyman. For twenty-four hours\r\nMrs. Masters did not speak to Mary, not at all intending to let her\r\nsin pass with such moderate punishment as that, but thinking during\r\nthat period that as she might perhaps induce Larry to ignore the\r\nletter and look upon it as though it were not written, it would be\r\nbest to say nothing till the time should come in which the lover\r\nmight again urge his suit. But when she found on the evening of the\r\nsecond day that Larry did not come near the place she could control\r\nherself no longer, and accused her step-daughter of ruining herself,\r\nher father, and the whole family. "That is very unfair, mamma," Mary\r\nsaid. "I have done nothing. I have only not done that which nobody\r\nhad a right to ask me to do."\r\n\r\n"Right indeed! And who are you with your rights? A decent\r\nwell-behaved young man with five or six hundred a year has no right\r\nto ask you to be his wife! All this comes of you staying with an old\r\nwoman with a handle to her name."\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Mary endeavoured to explain that she had not\r\nalluded to Larry when she declared that no one had a right to ask her\r\nto do it. She had, she said, always thanked him for his good opinion\r\nof her, and had spoken well of him whenever his name was mentioned.\r\nBut it was a matter on which a young woman was entitled to judge\r\nfor herself, and no one had a right to scold her because she\r\ncould not love him. Mrs. Masters hated such arguments, despised\r\nthis rodomontade about love, and would have crushed the girl into\r\nobedience could it have been possible. "You are an idiot," she said,\r\n"an ungrateful idiot; and unless you think better of it you\'ll repent\r\nyour folly to your dying day. Who do you think is to come running\r\nafter a moping slut like you?" Then Mary gathered herself up and left\r\nthe room, feeling that she could not live in the house if she were to\r\nbe called a slut.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Larry came to the attorney and got him to come out\r\ninto the street and to walk with him round the churchyard. It was\r\nthe spot in Dillsborough in which they would most certainly be left\r\nundisturbed. This took place on the day before his proposition\r\nfor the sale of Chowton Farm. When he got the attorney into the\r\nchurchyard he took out Mary\'s letter and in speechless agony handed\r\nit to the attorney. "I saw it before it went," said Masters putting\r\nit back with his hand.\r\n\r\n"I suppose she means it?" asked Larry.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say to you but what she does, Twentyman. As far as I know\r\nher she isn\'t a girl that would ever say anything that she didn\'t\r\nmean."\r\n\r\n"I was sure of that. When I got it and read it, it was just as\r\nthough some one had come behind me and hit me over the head with a\r\nwheel-spoke. I couldn\'t have ate a morsel of breakfast if I knew I\r\nwasn\'t to see another bit of food for four-and-twenty hours."\r\n\r\n"I knew you would feel it, Larry."\r\n\r\n"Feel it! Till it came to this I didn\'t think of myself but what I\r\nhad more strength. It has knocked me about till I feel all over like\r\ndrinking."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that, Larry."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t answer for myself what I\'ll do. A man sets his heart on a\r\nthing,--just on one thing,--and has grit enough in him to be sure of\r\nhimself that if he can get that nothing shall knock him over. When\r\nthat thoroughbred mare of mine slipped her foal who can say I ever\r\nwhimpered. When I got pleuro among the cattle I killed a\'most the lot\r\nof \'em out of hand, and never laid awake a night about it. But I\'ve\r\ngot it so heavy this time I can\'t stand it. You don\'t think I have\r\nany chance, Mr. Masters?"\r\n\r\n"You can try of course. You\'re welcome to the house."\r\n\r\n"But what do you think? You must know her."\r\n\r\n"Girls do change their minds."\r\n\r\n"But she isn\'t like other girls. Is she now? I come to you because\r\nI sometimes think Mrs. Masters is a little hard on her. Mrs. Masters\r\nis about the best friend I have. There isn\'t anybody more on my side\r\nthan she is. But I feel sure of this;--Mary will never be drove."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she will, Larry."\r\n\r\n"She\'s got a will of her own as well as another."\r\n\r\n"No man alive ever had a better daughter."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure of that, Mr. Masters; and no man alive \'ll ever have a\r\nbetter wife. But she won\'t be drove. I might ask her again, you\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\n"You certainly have my leave."\r\n\r\n"But would it be any good? I\'d rather cut my throat and have done\r\nwith it than go about teasing her because her parents let me come\r\nto her." Then there was a pause during which they walked on, the\r\nattorney feeling that he had nothing more to say. "What I want to\r\nknow," said Larry, "is this. Is there anybody else?"\r\n\r\nThat was just the point on which the attorney himself was perplexed.\r\nHe had asked Mary that question, and her silence had assured him that\r\nit was so. Then he had suggested to her the name of the only probable\r\nsuitor that occurred to him, and she had repelled the idea in a\r\nmanner that had convinced him at once. There was some one, but Mr.\r\nSurtees was not the man. There was some one, he was sure, but he had\r\nnot been able to cross-examine her on the subject. He had, since\r\nthat, cudgelled his brain to think who that some one might be, but\r\nhad not succeeded in suggesting a name even to himself. That of\r\nReginald Morton, who hardly ever came to the house and whom he\r\nregarded as a silent, severe, unapproachable man, did not come into\r\nhis mind. Among the young ladies of Dillsborough Reginald Morton was\r\nnever regarded as even a possible lover. And yet there was assuredly\r\nsome one. "If there is any one else I think you ought to tell me,"\r\ncontinued Larry.\r\n\r\n"It is quite possible."\r\n\r\n"Young Surtees, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I do not say there is anybody; but if there be anybody I do not\r\nthink it is Surtees."\r\n\r\n"Who else then?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say, Larry. I know nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"But there is some one?"\r\n\r\n"I do not say so. You ask me and I tell you all I know."\r\n\r\nAgain they walked round the churchyard in silence and the attorney\r\nbegan to be anxious that the interview might be over. He hardly liked\r\nto be interrogated about the state of his daughter\'s heart, and yet\r\nhe had felt himself bound to tell what he knew to the man who had\r\nin all respects behaved well to him. When they had returned for the\r\nthird or fourth time to the gate by which they had entered Larry\r\nspoke again. "I suppose I may as well give it up."\r\n\r\n"What can I say?"\r\n\r\n"You have been fair enough, Mr. Masters. And so has she. And so has\r\neverybody. I shall just get away as quick as I can, and go and hang\r\nmyself. I feel above bothering her any more. When she sat down to\r\nwrite a letter like that she must have been in earnest."\r\n\r\n"She certainly was in earnest, Larry."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of going on after that? Only it is so hard for a\r\nfellow to feel that everything is gone. It is just as though the\r\nhouse was burnt down, or I was to wake in the morning and find that\r\nthe land didn\'t belong to me."\r\n\r\n"Not so bad as that, Larry."\r\n\r\n"Not so bad, Mr. Masters! Then you don\'t know what it is I\'m feeling.\r\nI\'d let his lordship or Squire Morton have it all, and go in upon\r\nit as a tenant at 30_s._ an acre, so that I could take her along\r\nwith me. I would, and sell the horses and set to and work in my\r\nshirt-sleeves. A man could stand that. Nobody wouldn\'t laugh at\r\nme then. But there\'s an emptiness now here that makes me sick all\r\nthrough, as though I hadn\'t got stomach left for anything." Then\r\npoor Larry put his hand upon his heart and hid his face upon the\r\nchurchyard wall. The attorney made some attempt to say a kind word\r\nto him, and then, leaving him there, slowly made his way back to his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nWe already know what first step Larry took with the intention of\r\nrunning away from his cares. In the house at Dillsborough things were\r\nalmost as bad as they were with him. Over and over again Mrs. Masters\r\ntold her husband that it was all his fault, and that if he had torn\r\nthe letter when it was showed to him, everything would have been\r\nright by the end of the two months. This he bore with what equanimity\r\nhe could, shutting himself up very much in his office, occasionally\r\nescaping for a quarter of an hour of ease to his friends at the Bush,\r\nand eating his meals in silence. But when he became aware that his\r\ngirl was being treated with cruelty,--that she was never spoken to\r\nby her stepmother without harsh words, and that her sisters were\r\nencouraged to be disdainful to her, then his heart rose within\r\nhim and he rebelled. He declared aloud that Mary should not be\r\npersecuted, and if this kind of thing were continued he would defend\r\nhis girl let the consequences be what they might.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to defend her against?" asked his wife.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t have her ill-used because she refuses to marry at your\r\nbidding."\r\n\r\n"Bah! You know as much how to manage a girl as though you were an old\r\nmaid yourself. Cocker her up and make her think that nothing is good\r\nenough for her! Break her spirit, and make her come round, and teach\r\nher to know what it is to have an honest man\'s house offered to her.\r\nIf she don\'t take Larry Twentyman\'s she\'s like to have none of her\r\nown before long." But Mr. Masters would not assent to this plan of\r\nbreaking his girl\'s spirit, and so there was continual war in the\r\nplace and every one there was miserable.\r\n\r\nMary herself was so unhappy that she convinced herself that it was\r\nnecessary that some change should be made. Then she remembered Lady\r\nUshant\'s offer of a home, and not only the offer, but the old lady\'s\r\nassurance that to herself such an arrangement, if possible, would\r\nbe very comfortable. She did not suggest to herself that she would\r\nleave her father\'s home for ever and always; but it might be that an\r\nabsence of some months might relieve the absolute misery of their\r\npresent mode of living. The effect on her father was so sad that she\r\nwas almost driven to regret that he should have taken her own part.\r\nHer stepmother was not a bad woman; nor did Mary even now think her\r\nto be bad. She was a hardworking, painstaking wife, with a good\r\ngeneral idea of justice. In the division of puddings and pies and\r\nother material comforts of the household she would deal evenly\r\nbetween her own children and her step-daughter. She had not desired\r\nto send Mary away to an inadequate home, or with a worthless husband.\r\nBut when the proper home and the proper man were there she was\r\nprepared to use any amount of hardship to secure these good things to\r\nthe family generally. This hardship Mary could not endure, nor could\r\nMary\'s father on her behalf, and therefore Mary prepared a letter to\r\nLady Ushant in which, at great length, she told her old friend the\r\nwhole story. She spoke as tenderly as was possible of all concerned,\r\nbut declared that her stepmother\'s feelings on the subject were so\r\nstrong that every one in the house was made wretched. Under these\r\ncircumstances,--for her father\'s sake if only for that,--she thought\r\nherself bound to leave the house. "It is quite impossible," she said,\r\n"that I should do as they wish me. That is a matter on which a young\r\nwoman must judge for herself. If you could have me for a few months\r\nit would perhaps all pass by. I should not dare to ask this but for\r\nwhat you said yourself; and, dear Lady Ushant, pray remember that I\r\ndo not want to be idle. There are a great many things I can do; and\r\nthough I know that nothing can pay for kindness, I might perhaps be\r\nable not to be a burden." Then she added in a postscript--"Papa is\r\neverything that is kind;--but then all this makes him so miserable!"\r\n\r\nWhen she had kept the letter by her for a day she showed it to her\r\nfather, and by his consent it was sent. After much consultation it\r\nwas agreed between them that nothing should be said about it to Mrs.\r\nMasters till the answer should come; and that, should the answer be\r\nfavourable, the plan should be carried out in spite of any domestic\r\nopposition. In this letter Mary told as accurately as she could the\r\nwhole story of Larry\'s courtship, and was very clear in declaring\r\nthat under no possible circumstances could she encourage any hope.\r\nBut of course she said not a word as to any other man or as to any\r\nlove on her side. "Have you told her everything?" said her father as\r\nhe closed the letter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa;--everything that there is to be told." Then there arose\r\nwithin his own bosom an immense desire to know that secret, so that\r\nif possible he might do something to relieve her pain;--but he could\r\nnot bring himself to ask further questions.\r\n\r\nLady Ushant on receiving the letter much doubted what she ought to\r\ndo. She acknowledged at once Mary\'s right to appeal to her, and\r\nassured herself that the girl\'s presence would be a comfort and a\r\nhappiness to herself. If Mary were quite alone in the world Lady\r\nUshant would have been at once prepared to give her a home. But she\r\ndoubted as to the propriety of taking the girl from her own family.\r\nShe doubted even whether it would not be better that Mary should be\r\nleft within the influence of Larry Twentyman\'s charms. A settlement,\r\nan income, and assured comforts for life are very serious things to\r\nall people who have reached Lady Ushant\'s age. And then she had a\r\ndoubt within her own mind whether Mary might not be debarred from\r\naccepting this young man by some unfortunate preference for Reginald\r\nMorton. She had seen them together and had suspected something of\r\nthe truth before it had glimmered before the eyes of any one in\r\nDillsborough. Had Reginald been so inclined Lady Ushant would have\r\nbeen very glad to see him marry Mary Masters. For both their sakes\r\nshe would have preferred such a match to one with the owner of\r\nChowton Farm. But she did not think that Reginald himself was that\r\nway minded, and she fancied that poor Mary might be throwing away\r\nher prosperity in life were she to wait for Reginald\'s love. Larry\r\nTwentyman was at any rate sure;--and perhaps it might be unwise to\r\nseparate the girl from her lover.\r\n\r\nIn her doubt she determined to refer the case to Reginald himself,\r\nand instead of writing to Mary she wrote to him. She did not send him\r\nMary\'s letter,--which would, she felt, have been a breach of faith;\r\nnor did she mention the name of Larry Twentyman. But she told him\r\nthat Mary had proposed to come to Cheltenham for a long visit because\r\nthere were disturbances at home,--which disturbances had arisen from\r\nher rejection of a certain suitor. Lady Ushant said a great deal as\r\nto the inexpediency of fostering family quarrels, and suggested that\r\nMary might perhaps have been a little impetuous. The presence of this\r\nlover could hardly do her much injury. These were not days in which\r\nyoung women were forced to marry men. What did he, Reginald Morton,\r\nthink about it? He was to remember that as far as she herself was\r\nconcerned, she dearly loved Mary Masters and would be delighted\r\nto have her at Cheltenham; and, so remembering, he was to see the\r\nattorney, and Mary herself, and if necessary Mrs. Masters;--and then\r\nto report his opinion to Cheltenham.\r\n\r\nThen, fearing that her nephew might be away for a day or two, or\r\nthat he might not be able to perform his commission instantly, and\r\nthinking that Mary might be unhappy if she received no immediate\r\nreply to such a request as hers had been, Lady Ushant by the same\r\npost wrote to her young friend as follows;--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MARY,\r\n\r\n   Reginald will go over and see your father about your\r\n   proposition. As far as I myself am concerned nothing would\r\n   give me so much pleasure. This is quite sincere. But the\r\n   matter is in other respects very important. Of course I\r\n   have kept your letter all to myself, and in writing to\r\n   Reginald I have mentioned no names.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n   MARGARET USHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n"PARTICULARLY PROUD OF YOU."\r\n\r\n\r\nArabella Trefoil left her uncle\'s mansion on the day after her\r\nlover\'s departure, certainly not in triumph, but with somewhat\r\nrecovered spirits. When she first heard that Lord Rufford was\r\ngone,--that he had fled away as it were in the middle of the night\r\nwithout saying a word to her, without a syllable to make good the\r\nslight assurances of his love that had been given to her in the post\r\ncarriage, she felt that she was deserted and betrayed. And when she\r\nfound herself altogether neglected on the following day, and that\r\nthe slightly valuable impression which she had made on her aunt was\r\napparently gone, she did for half an hour think in earnest of the\r\nParagon and Patagonia. But after a while she called to mind all that\r\nshe knew of great efforts successfully made in opposition to almost\r\noverwhelming difficulties. She had heard of forlorn hopes, and\r\nperhaps in her young days had read something of Caesar still clinging\r\nto his Commentaries as he struggled in the waves. This was her\r\nforlorn hope, and she would be as brave as any soldier of them all.\r\nLord Rufford\'s embraces were her Commentaries, and let the winds\r\nblow and the waves roll as they might she would still cling to them.\r\nAfter lunch she spoke to her aunt with great courage,--as the Duchess\r\nthought with great effrontery. "My uncle wouldn\'t speak to Lord\r\nRufford before he went?"\r\n\r\n"How could he speak to a man who ran away from his house in that\r\nway?"\r\n\r\n"The running away, as you call it, aunt, did not take place till two\r\ndays after I had told you all about it. I thought he would have done\r\nas much as that for his brother\'s daughter."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe in it at all," said the Duchess sternly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t believe in what, aunt? You don\'t mean to say that you don\'t\r\nbelieve that Lord Rufford has asked me to be his wife!" Then she\r\npaused, but the Duchess absolutely lacked the courage to express her\r\nconviction again. "I don\'t suppose it signifies much," continued\r\nArabella, "but of course it would have been something to me that Lord\r\nRufford should have known that the Duke was anxious for my welfare.\r\nHe was quite prepared to have assured my uncle of his intentions."\r\n\r\n"Then why didn\'t he speak himself?"\r\n\r\n"Because the Duke is not my father. Really, aunt, when I hear you\r\ntalk of his running away I do feel it to be unkind. As if we didn\'t\r\nall know that a man like that goes and comes as he pleases. It was\r\njust before dinner that he got the message, and was he to run round\r\nand wish everybody good-bye like a schoolgirl going to bed?"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was almost certain that no message had come, and from\r\nvarious little things which she had observed and from tidings which\r\nhad reached her, very much doubted whether Arabella had known\r\nanything of his intended going. She too had a maid of her own who on\r\noccasions could bring information. But she had nothing further to say\r\non the subject. If Arabella should ever become Lady Rufford she would\r\nof course among other visitors be occasionally received at Mistletoe.\r\nShe could never be a favourite, but things would to a certain degree\r\nhave rectified themselves. But if, as the Duchess expected, no such\r\nmarriage took place, then this ill-conducted niece should never be\r\nadmitted within the house again.\r\n\r\nLater on in the afternoon, some hours after it became dusk, Arabella\r\ncontrived to meet her aunt in the hall with a letter in her hand, and\r\nasked where the letter-box was. She knew where to deposit her letters\r\nas well as did the Duchess herself; but she desired an opportunity of\r\nproclaiming what she had done. "I am writing to Lord Rufford. Perhaps\r\nas I am in your house I ought to tell you what I have done."\r\n\r\n"The letter-box is in the billiard-room, close to the door," said the\r\nDuchess passing on. Then she added as she went, "The post for to-day\r\nhas gone already."\r\n\r\n"His Lordship will have to wait a day for his letter. I dare say it\r\nwon\'t break his heart," said Arabella, as she turned away to the\r\nbilliard-room.\r\n\r\nAll this had been planned; and, moreover, she had so written her\r\nletter that if her magnificent aunt should condescend to tamper with\r\nit all that was in it should seem to corroborate her own story. The\r\nDuchess would have considered herself disgraced if ever she had done\r\nsuch a thing;--but the niece of the Duchess did not quite understand\r\nthat this would be so. The letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Mistletoe, 19th Jany. 1875.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST R.,\r\n\r\n   Your going off like that was, after all, very horrid. My\r\n   aunt thinks that you were running away from me. I think\r\n   that you were running away from her. Which was true? In\r\n   real earnest I don\'t for a moment think that either I or\r\n   the Duchess had anything to do with it, and that you did\r\n   go because some horrid man wrote and asked you. I know you\r\n   don\'t like being bound by any of the conventionalities.\r\n   I hope there is such a word, and that if not, you\'ll\r\n   understand it just the same.\r\n\r\n   Oh, Peltry,--and oh, Jack,--and oh, that road back to\r\n   Stamford! I am so stiff that I can\'t sit upright, and\r\n   everybody is cross to me, and everything is uncomfortable.\r\n   What horrible things women are! There isn\'t one here,\r\n   not even old Lady Rumpus, who hasn\'t an unmarried\r\n   daughter left in the world, who isn\'t jealous of me,\r\n   because--because--. I must leave you to guess why they\r\n   all hate me so! And I\'m sure if you had given Jack to\r\n   any other woman I should hate her, though you may give\r\n   every horse you have to any man that you please. I wonder\r\n   whether I shall have another day\'s hunting before it is\r\n   all over. I suppose not. It was almost by a miracle that\r\n   we managed yesterday--only fancy--yesterday! It seems to\r\n   be an age ago!\r\n\r\n   Pray, pray, pray write to me at once,--to the Connop\r\n   Greens, so that I may get a nice, soft, pleasant word\r\n   directly I get among those nasty, hard, unpleasant people.\r\n   They have lots of money, and plenty of furniture, and\r\n   I dare say the best things to eat and drink in the\r\n   world,--but nothing else. There will be no Jack; and if\r\n   there were, alas, alas, no one to show me the way to ride\r\n   him.\r\n\r\n   I start to-morrow, and as far as I understand, shall have\r\n   to make my way into Hampshire all by myself, with only\r\n   such security as my maid can give me. I shall make her go\r\n   in the same carriage and shall have the gratification of\r\n   looking at her all the way. I suppose I ought not to say\r\n   that I will shut my eyes and try to think that somebody\r\n   else is there.\r\n\r\n   Good-bye dear, dear, dear R. I shall be dying for a letter\r\n   from you. Yours ever, with all my heart. A.\r\n\r\n   I shall write you such a serious epistle when I get to the\r\n   Greens.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was not such a letter as she thought that her aunt would\r\napprove; but it was, she fancied, such as the Duchess would believe\r\nthat she would write to her lover. And if it were allowed to go on\r\nits way it would make Lord Rufford feel that she was neither alarmed\r\nnor displeased by the suddenness of his departure. But it was not\r\nexpected to do much good. It might produce some short, joking,\r\nhalf-affectionate reply, but would not draw from him that serious\r\nword which was so necessary for the success of her scheme. Therefore\r\nshe had told him that she intended to prepare a serious missile.\r\nShould this pleasant little message of love miscarry, the serious\r\nmissile would still be sent, and the miscarriage would occasion no\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nBut then further plans were necessary. It might be that Lord Rufford\r\nwould take no notice of the serious missile,--which she thought very\r\nprobable. Or it might be that he would send back a serious reply,\r\nin which he would calmly explain to her that she had unfortunately\r\nmistaken his sentiments;--which she believed would be a stretch of\r\nmanhood beyond his reach. But in either case she would be prepared\r\nwith the course which she would follow. In the first she would begin\r\nby forcing her father to write to him a letter which she herself\r\nwould dictate. In the second she would set the whole family at him\r\nas far as the family were within her reach. With her cousin Lord\r\nMistletoe, who was only two years older than herself, she had always\r\nheld pleasant relations. They had been children together, and as they\r\nhad grown up the young Lord had liked his pretty cousin. Latterly\r\nthey had seen each other but rarely, and therefore the feeling still\r\nremained. She would tell Lord Mistletoe her whole story,--that is\r\nthe story as she would please to tell it,--and implore his aid. Her\r\nfather should be driven to demand from Lord Rufford an execution of\r\nhis alleged promises. She herself would write such a letter to the\r\nDuke as an uncle should be unable not to notice. She would move\r\nheaven and earth as to her wrongs. She thought that if her friends\r\nwould stick to her, Lord Rufford would be weak as water in their\r\nhands. But it must be all done immediately,--so that if everything\r\nfailed she might be ready to start to Patagonia some time in April.\r\nWhen she looked back and remembered that it was hardly more than two\r\nmonths since she had been taken to Rufford Hall by Mr. Morton she\r\ncould not accuse herself of having lost any time.\r\n\r\nIn London she met her mother,--as to which meeting there had been\r\nsome doubt,--and underwent the tortures of a close examination. She\r\nhad thought it prudent on this occasion to tell her mother something,\r\nbut not to tell anything quite truly. "He has proposed to me," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"He has!" said Lady Augustus, holding up her hands almost in awe.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything so wonderful in that?"\r\n\r\n"Then it is all arranged. Does the Duke know it?"\r\n\r\n"It is not all arranged by any means, and the Duke does know it. Now,\r\nmamma, after that I must decline to answer any more questions. I have\r\ndone this all myself, and I mean to continue it in the same way."\r\n\r\n"Did he speak to the Duke? You will tell me that."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you nothing."\r\n\r\n"You will drive me mad, Arabella."\r\n\r\n"That will be better than your driving me mad just at present. You\r\nought to feel that I have a great deal to think of."\r\n\r\n"And have not I?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t help me;--not at present."\r\n\r\n"But he did propose,--in absolute words?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma, what a goose you are! Do you suppose that men do it all now\r\njust as it is done in books? \'Miss Arabella Trefoil, will you do me\r\nthe honour to become my wife?\' Do you think that Lord Rufford would\r\nask the question in that way?"\r\n\r\n"It is a very good way."\r\n\r\n"Any way is a good way that answers the purpose. He has proposed, and\r\nI mean to make him stick to it."\r\n\r\n"You doubt then?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma, you are so silly! Do you not know what such a man is well\r\nenough to be sure that he\'ll change his mind half-a-dozen times if\r\nhe can? I don\'t mean to let him; and now, after that, I won\'t say\r\nanother word."\r\n\r\n"I have got a letter here from Mr. Short saying that something must\r\nbe fixed about Mr. Morton." Mr. Short was the lawyer who had been\r\ninstructed to prepare the settlements.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Short may do whatever he likes," said Arabella. There were very\r\nhot words between them that night in London, but the mother could\r\nobtain no further information from her daughter.\r\n\r\nThat serious epistle had been commenced even before Arabella had left\r\nMistletoe; but the composition was one which required great care, and\r\nit was not completed and copied and recopied till she had been two\r\ndays in Hampshire. Not even when it was finished did she say a word\r\nto her mother about it. She had doubted much as to the phrases which\r\nin such an emergency she ought to use, but she thought it safer to\r\ntrust to herself than to her mother. In writing such a letter as that\r\nposted at Mistletoe she believed herself to be happy. She could write\r\nit quickly, and understood that she could convey to her correspondent\r\nsome sense of her assumed mood. But her serious letter would, she\r\nfeared, be stiff and repulsive. Whether her fears were right the\r\nreader shall judge,--for the letter when written was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Marygold Place, Basingstoke,\r\n   Saturday.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LORD RUFFORD,\r\n\r\n   You will I suppose have got the letter that I wrote before\r\n   I left Mistletoe, and which I directed to Mr. Surbiton\'s.\r\n   There was not much in it,--except a word or two as to your\r\n   going and as to my desolation, and just a reminiscence of\r\n   the hunting. There was no reproach that you should have\r\n   left me without any farewell, or that you should have gone\r\n   so suddenly, after saying so much, without saying more. I\r\n   wanted you to feel that you had made me very happy, and\r\n   not to feel that your departure in such a way had robbed\r\n   me of part of the happiness.\r\n\r\n   It was a little bad of you, because it did of course leave\r\n   me to the hardness of my aunt; and because all the other\r\n   women there would of course follow her. She had inquired\r\n   about our journey home, that dear journey home, and I had\r\n   of course told her,--well I had better say it out at once;\r\n   I told her that we were engaged. You, I am sure, will\r\n   think that the truth was best. She wanted to know why you\r\n   did not go to the Duke. I told her that the Duke was not\r\n   my father; but that as far as I was concerned the Duke\r\n   might speak to you or not as he pleased. I had nothing to\r\n   conceal. I am very glad he did not, because he is pompous,\r\n   and you would have been bored. If there is one thing I\r\n   desire more than another it is that nothing belonging to\r\n   me shall ever be a bore to you. I hope I may never stand\r\n   in the way of anything that will gratify you,--as I said\r\n   when you lit that cigar. You will have forgotten, I dare\r\n   say. But, dear Rufford,--dearest; I may say that, mayn\'t\r\n   I?--say something, or do something to make me satisfied.\r\n   You know what I mean;--don\'t you? It isn\'t that I am a bit\r\n   afraid myself. I don\'t think so little of myself, or so\r\n   badly of you. But I don\'t like other women to look at me\r\n   as though I ought not to be proud of anything. I am proud\r\n   of everything; particularly proud of you,--and of Jack.\r\n\r\n   Now there is my serious epistle, and I am sure that\r\n   you will answer it like a dear, good, kind-hearted,\r\n   loving--lover. I won\'t be afraid of writing the word, nor\r\n   of saying that I love you with all my heart, and that I am\r\n   always your own\r\n\r\n   ARABELLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe kept the letter till the Sunday, thinking that she might have an\r\nanswer to that written from Mistletoe, and that his reply might alter\r\nits tone, or induce her to put it aside altogether; but when on\r\nSunday morning none came, her own was sent. The word in it which\r\nfrightened herself was the word "engaged." She tried various other\r\nphrases, but declared to herself at last that it was useless to "beat\r\nabout the bush." He must know the light in which she was pleased to\r\nregard those passages of love which she had permitted so that there\r\nmight be no mistake. Whether the letter would be to his liking or\r\nnot, it must be of such a nature that it would certainly draw from\r\nhim an answer on which she could act. She herself did not like the\r\nletter; but, considering her difficulties, we may own that it was not\r\nmuch amiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLORD RUFFORD MAKES UP HIS MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Lord Rufford got the two letters together, the cause\r\nof which was as follows.\r\n\r\nWhen he ran away from Mistletoe, as he certainly did, he had thought\r\nmuch about that journey home in the carriage, and was quite aware\r\nthat he had made an ass of himself. As he sat at dinner on that day\r\nat Mistletoe his neighbour had said some word to him in joke as to\r\nhis attachment to Miss Trefoil, and after the ladies had left the\r\nroom another neighbour of the other sex had hoped that he had had a\r\npleasant time on the road. Again, in the drawing-room it had seemed\r\nto him that he was observed. He could not refrain from saying a few\r\nwords to Arabella as she lay on the sofa. Not to do so after what\r\nhad occurred would have been in itself peculiar. But when he did so,\r\nsome other man who was near her made way for him, as though she were\r\nacknowledged to be altogether his property. And then the Duchess had\r\nstriven to catch him, and lead him into special conversation. When\r\nthis attempt was made he decided that he must at once retreat,--or\r\nelse make up his mind to marry the young lady. And therefore he\r\nretreated.\r\n\r\nHe breakfasted that morning at the inn at Stamford, and as he smoked\r\nhis cigar afterwards, he positively resolved that he would under\r\nno circumstances marry Arabella Trefoil. He was being hunted and\r\nrun down, and, with the instinct of all animals that are hunted, he\r\nprepared himself for escape. It might be said, no doubt would be\r\nsaid, that he behaved badly. That would be said because it would not\r\nbe open to him to tell the truth. The lady in such a case can always\r\ntell her story, with what exaggeration she may please to give, and\r\ncan complain. The man never can do so. When inquired into, he cannot\r\nsay that he has been pursued. He cannot tell her friends that she\r\nbegan it, and in point of fact did it all. "She would fall into my\r\narms; she would embrace me; she persisted in asking me whether I\r\nloved her!" Though a man have to be shot for it, or kicked for it,\r\nor even though he have to endure perpetual scorn for it, he cannot\r\nsay that, let it be ever so true. And yet is a man to be forced\r\ninto a marriage which he despises? He would not be forced into\r\nthe marriage,--and the sooner he retreated the less would be the\r\nmetaphorical shooting and kicking and the real scorn. He must get out\r\nof it as best he could;--but that he would get out of it he was quite\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon he reached Mr. Surbiton\'s house, as did also Captain\r\nBattersby, and his horses, grooms, and other belongings. When\r\nthere he received a lot of letters, and among others one from Mr.\r\nRunciman, of the Bush, inquiring as to a certain hiring of rooms\r\nand preparation for a dinner or dinners which had been spoken of\r\nin reference to a final shooting decreed to take place in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dillsborough in the last week of January. Such\r\nthings were often planned by Lord Rufford, and afterwards forgotten\r\nor neglected. When he declared his purpose to Runciman, he had not\r\nintended to go to Mistletoe, nor to stay so long with his friend\r\nSurbiton. But now he almost thought that it would be better for him\r\nto be back at Rufford Hall, where at present his sister was staying\r\nwith her husband, Sir George Penwether.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the second or third day his old friend Tom Surbiton\r\nsaid a few words to him which had the effect of sending him back to\r\nRufford. They had sat out the rest of the men who formed the party\r\nand were alone in the smoking-room. "So you\'re going to marry Miss\r\nTrefoil," said Tom Surbiton, who perhaps of all his friends was the\r\nmost intimate.\r\n\r\n"Who says so?"\r\n\r\n"I am saying so at present."\r\n\r\n"You are not saying it on your own authority. You have never seen me\r\nand Miss Trefoil in a room together."\r\n\r\n"Everybody says so. Of course such a thing cannot be arranged without\r\nbeing talked about."\r\n\r\n"It has not been arranged."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t mean to have it arranged, you had better look to\r\nit. I am speaking in earnest, Rufford. I am not going to give up\r\nauthorities. Indeed if I did I might give up everybody. The very\r\nservants suppose that they know it, and there isn\'t a groom or\r\nhorseboy about who isn\'t in his heart congratulating the young lady\r\non her promotion."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what it is, Tom."\r\n\r\n"Well;--what is it?"\r\n\r\n"If this had come from any other man than yourself I should quarrel\r\nwith him. I am not engaged to the young lady, nor have I done\r\nanything to warrant anybody in saying so."\r\n\r\n"Then I may contradict it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you either to contradict it or affirm it. It would be\r\nan impertinence to the young lady if I were to instruct any one to\r\ncontradict such a report. But as a fact I am not engaged to marry\r\nMiss Trefoil, nor is there the slightest chance that I ever shall be\r\nso engaged." So saying he took up his candlestick and walked off.\r\n\r\nEarly on the next morning he saw his friend and made some sort of\r\nlaughing apology for his heat on the previous evening. "It is so\r\nd---- hard when these kind of things are said because a man has lent\r\na young lady a horse. However, Tom, between you and me the thing is a\r\nlie."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to hear it," said Tom.\r\n\r\n"And now I want you to come over to Rufford on the twenty-eighth."\r\nThen he explained the details of his proposed party, and got his\r\nfriend to promise that he would come. He also made it understood\r\nthat he was going home at once. There were a hundred things, he said,\r\nwhich made it necessary. So the horses and grooms and servant and\r\nportmanteaus were again made to move, and Lord Rufford left his\r\nfriend on that day and went up to London on his road to Rufford.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly disturbed in his mind, foreseeing that there might\r\nbe much difficulty in his way. He remembered with fair accuracy all\r\nthat had occurred during the journey from Stamford to Mistletoe. He\r\nfelt assured that up to that time he had said nothing which could be\r\ntaken to mean a real declaration of love. All that at Rufford had\r\nbeen nothing. He had never said a word which could justify the girl\r\nin a hope. In the carriage she had asked him whether he loved her,\r\nand he had said that he did. He had also declared that he would do\r\nanything in his power to make her happy. Was a man to be bound to\r\nmarry a girl because of such a scene as that? There was, however,\r\nnothing for him to do except to keep out of the girl\'s way. If she\r\ntook any steps, then he must act. But as he thought of it, he swore\r\nto himself that nothing should induce him to marry her.\r\n\r\nHe remained a couple of days in town and reached Rufford Hall on the\r\nMonday,--just a week from the day of that fatal meet at Peltry. There\r\nhe found Sir George and his sister and Miss Penge, and spent his\r\nfirst evening in quiet. On the Tuesday he hunted with the U. R. U.,\r\nand made his arrangements with Runciman. He invited Hampton to shoot\r\nwith him. Surbiton and Battersby were coming, and his brother-in-law.\r\nNot wishing to have less than six guns he asked Hampton how he could\r\nmake up his party. "Morton doesn\'t shoot," he said, "and is as stiff\r\nas a post." Then he was told that John Morton was supposed to be very\r\nill at Bragton. "I\'m sick of both the Botseys," continued the lord,\r\nthinking more of his party than of Mr. Morton\'s health. "Purefoy\r\nis still sulky with me because he killed poor old Caneback." Then\r\nHampton suggested that if he would ask Lawrence Twentyman it might\r\nbe the means of saving that unfortunate young man\'s life. The story\r\nof his unrequited love was known to every one at Dillsborough and\r\nit was now told to Lord Rufford. "He is not half a bad fellow,"\r\nsaid Hampton, "and quite as much like a gentleman as either of the\r\nBotseys."\r\n\r\n"I shall be delighted to save the life of so good a man on such easy\r\nterms," said the lord. Then and there, with a pencil, on the back of\r\nan old letter, he wrote a line to Larry asking him to shoot on next\r\nSaturday and to dine with him afterwards at the Bush.\r\n\r\nThat evening on his return home he found both the letters from\r\nArabella. As it happened he read them in the order in which they had\r\nbeen written, first the laughing letter, and then the one that was\r\ndeclared to be serious. The earlier of the two did not annoy him\r\nmuch. It contained hardly more than those former letters which had\r\ninduced him to go to Mistletoe. But the second letter opened up her\r\nentire strategy. She had told the Duchess that she was engaged to\r\nhim, and the Duchess of course would have told the Duke. And now she\r\nwrote to him asking him to acknowledge the engagement in black and\r\nwhite. The first letter he might have ignored. He might have left it\r\nunanswered without gross misconduct. But the second letter, which\r\nshe herself had declared to be a serious epistle, was one which he\r\ncould not neglect. Now had come his difficulty. What must he do? How\r\nshould he answer it? Was it imperative on him to write the words with\r\nhis own hand? Would it be possible that he should get his sister to\r\nundertake the commission? He said nothing about it to any one for\r\nfour and twenty hours; but he passed those hours in much discomfort.\r\nIt did seem so hard to him that because he had been forced to carry\r\na lady home from hunting in a postchaise, that he should be driven\r\nto such straits as this! The girl was evidently prepared to make a\r\nfight of it. There would be the Duke and the Duchess and that prig\r\nMistletoe, and that idle ass Lord Augustus, and that venomous old\r\nwoman her mother, all at him. He almost doubted whether a shooting\r\nexcursion in Central Africa or a visit to the Pampas would not be the\r\nbest thing for him. But still, though he should resolve to pass five\r\nyears among the Andes, he must answer the lady\'s letter before he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nThen he made up his mind that he would tell everything to his\r\nbrother-in-law, as far as everything can be told in such a matter.\r\nSir George was near fifty, full fifteen years older than his wife,\r\nwho was again older than her brother. He was a man of moderate\r\nwealth, very much respected, and supposed to be possessed of almost\r\ninfinite wisdom. He was one of those few human beings who seem never\r\nto make a mistake. Whatever he put his hand to came out well;--and\r\nyet everybody liked him His brother-in-law was a little afraid of\r\nhim, but yet was always glad to see him. He kept an excellent house\r\nin London, but having no country house of his own passed much of his\r\ntime at Rufford Hall when the owner was not there. In spite of the\r\nyoung peer\'s numerous faults Sir George was much attached to him, and\r\nalways ready to help him in his difficulties. "Penwether," said the\r\nLord, "I have got myself into an awful scrape."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to hear it. A woman, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I never gamble, and therefore no other scrape can be awful.\r\nA young lady wants to marry me."\r\n\r\n"That is not unnatural."\r\n\r\n"But I am quite determined, let the result be what it may, that I\r\nwon\'t marry the young lady."\r\n\r\n"That will be unfortunate for her, and the more so if she has a right\r\nto expect it. Is the young lady Miss Trefoil?"\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to mention any name,--till I was sure it might be\r\nnecessary. But it is Miss Trefoil."\r\n\r\n"Eleanor had told me something of it."\r\n\r\n"Eleanor knows nothing about this, and I do not wish you to tell her.\r\nThe young lady was here with her mother,--and for the matter of that\r\nwith a gentleman to whom she was certainly engaged;--but nothing\r\nparticular occurred here. That unfortunate ball was going on when\r\npoor Caneback was dying. But I met her since that at Mistletoe."\r\n\r\n"I can hardly advise, you know, unless you tell me everything."\r\n\r\nThen Lord Rufford began. "These kind of things are sometimes deuced\r\nhard upon a man. Of course if a man were a saint or a philosopher or\r\na Joseph he wouldn\'t get into such scrapes,--and perhaps every man\r\nought to be something of that sort. But I don\'t know how a man is to\r\ndo it, unless it\'s born with him."\r\n\r\n"A little prudence I should say."\r\n\r\n"You might as well tell a fellow that it is his duty to be six feet\r\nhigh."\r\n\r\n"But what have you said to the young lady,--or what has she said to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"There has been a great deal more of the latter than the former. I\r\nsay so to you, but of course it is not to be said that I have said\r\nso. I cannot go forth to the world complaining of a young lady\'s\r\nconduct to me. It is a matter in which a man must not tell the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"But what is the truth?"\r\n\r\n"She writes me word to say that she has told all her friends that I\r\nam engaged to her, and kindly presses me to make good her assurances\r\nby becoming so."\r\n\r\n"And what has passed between you?"\r\n\r\n"A fainting fit in a carriage and half-a-dozen kisses."\r\n\r\n"Nothing more?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing more that is material. Of course one cannot tell it all down\r\nto each mawkish word of humbugging sentiment. There are her letters,\r\nand what I want you to remember is that I never asked her to be my\r\nwife, and that no consideration on earth shall induce me to become\r\nher husband. Though all the duchesses in England were to persecute me\r\nto the death I mean to stick to that."\r\n\r\nThen Sir George read the letters and handed them back. "She seems to\r\nme," said he, "to have more wit about her than any of the family that\r\nI have had the honour of meeting."\r\n\r\n"She has wit enough,--and pluck too."\r\n\r\n"You have never said a word to her to encourage these hopes."\r\n\r\n"My dear Penwether, don\'t you know that if a man with a large income\r\nsays to a girl like that that the sun shines he encourages hope.\r\nI understand that well enough. I am a rich man with a title, and a\r\nbig house, and a great command of luxuries. There are so many young\r\nladies who would also like to be rich, and to have a title, and a big\r\nhouse, and a command of luxuries! One sometimes feels oneself like a\r\ncarcase in the midst of vultures."\r\n\r\n"Marry after a proper fashion, and you\'ll get rid of all that."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think about it, but in the meantime what can I say to this\r\nyoung woman? When I acknowledge that I kissed her, of course I\r\nencouraged hopes."\r\n\r\n"No doubt."\r\n\r\n"But St. Anthony would have had to kiss this young woman if she had\r\nmade her attack upon him as she did on me;--and after all a kiss\r\ndoesn\'t go for everything. These are things, Penwether, that must not\r\nbe inquired into too curiously. But I won\'t marry her though it were\r\na score of kisses. And now what must I do?" Sir George said that he\r\nwould take till the next morning to think about it,--meaning to make\r\na draft of the reply which he thought his brother-in-law might best\r\nsend to the lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nIT CANNOT BE ARRANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Reginald Morton received his aunt\'s letter he understood from it\r\nmore than she had intended. Of course the man to whom allusion was\r\nmade was Mr. Twentyman; and of course the discomfort at home had come\r\nfrom Mrs. Masters\' approval of that suitor\'s claim. Reginald, though\r\nhe had seen but little of the inside of the attorney\'s household,\r\nthought it very probable that the stepmother would make the girl\'s\r\nhome very uncomfortable for her. Though he knew well all the young\r\nfarmer\'s qualifications as a husband,--namely that he was well to\r\ndo in the world and bore a good character for honesty and general\r\nconduct,--still he thoroughly, nay heartily approved of Mary\'s\r\nrejection of the man\'s hand. It seemed to him to be sacrilege that\r\nsuch a one should have given to him such a woman. There was, to his\r\nthinking, something about Mary Masters that made it altogether unfit\r\nthat she should pass her life as the mistress of Chowton Farm, and he\r\nhonoured her for the persistence of her refusal. He took his pipe and\r\nwent out into the garden in order that he might think of it all as he\r\nstrolled round his little domain.\r\n\r\nBut why should he think so much about it? Why should he take so deep\r\nan interest in the matter? What was it to him whether Mary Masters\r\nmarried after her kind, or descended into what he felt to be an\r\ninferior manner of life? Then he tried to tell himself what were the\r\ngifts in the girl\'s possession which made her what she was, and he\r\npictured her to himself, running over all her attributes. It was\r\nnot that she specially excelled in beauty. He had seen Miss Trefoil\r\nas she was being driven about the neighbourhood, and having heard\r\nmuch of the young lady as the future wife of his own cousin, had\r\nacknowledged to himself that she was very handsome. But he had\r\nthought at the same time that under no possible circumstances could\r\nhe have fallen in love with Miss Trefoil. He believed that he did not\r\ncare much for female beauty, and yet he felt that he could sit and\r\nlook at Mary Masters by the hour together. There was a quiet even\r\ncomposure about her, always lightened by the brightness of her modest\r\neyes, which seemed to tell him of some mysterious world within, which\r\nwas like the unseen loveliness that one fancies to be hidden within\r\nthe bosom of distant mountains. There was a poem to be read there\r\nof surpassing beauty, rhythmical and eloquent as the music of the\r\nspheres, if it might only be given to a man to read it. There was an\r\nabsence, too, of all attempt at feminine self-glorification which\r\nhe did not analyse but thoroughly appreciated. There was no fussy\r\namplification of hair, no made-up smiles, no affectation either\r\nin her good humour or her anger, no attempt at effect in her gait,\r\nin her speech, or her looks. She seemed to him to be one who had\r\nsomething within her on which she could feed independently of the\r\ngrosser details of the world to which it was her duty to lend her\r\nhand. And then her colour charmed his eyes. Miss Trefoil was white\r\nand red;--white as pearl powder and red as paint. Mary Masters, to\r\ntell the truth, was brown. No doubt that was the prevailing colour,\r\nif one colour must be named. But there was so rich a tint of young\r\nlife beneath the surface, so soft but yet so visible an assurance\r\nof blood and health and spirit, that no one could describe her\r\ncomplexion by so ugly a word without falsifying her gifts. In all her\r\nmovements she was tranquil, as a noble woman should be. Even when she\r\nhad turned from him with some anger at the bridge, she had walked\r\nlike a princess. There was a certainty of modesty about her which was\r\nlike a granite wall or a strong fortress. As he thought of it all he\r\ndid not understand how such a one as Lawrence Twentyman should have\r\ndared to ask her to be his wife,--or should even have wished it.\r\n\r\nWe know what were her feelings in regard to himself,--how she had\r\ncome to look almost with worship on the walls within which he lived;\r\nbut he had guessed nothing of this. Even now, when he knew that she\r\nhad applied to his aunt in order that she might escape from her\r\nlover, it did not occur to him that she could care for himself.\r\nHe was older than she, nearly twenty years older, and even in his\r\nyounger years, in the hard struggles of his early life, had never\r\nregarded himself as a man likely to find favour with women. There\r\nwas in his character much of that modesty for which he gave her such\r\ninfinite credit. Though he thought but little of most of those around\r\nhim, he thought also but little of himself. It would break his heart\r\nto ask and be refused;--but he could, he fancied, live very well\r\nwithout Mary Masters. Such, at any rate, had been his own idea of\r\nhimself hitherto; and now, though he was driven to think much of her,\r\nthough on the present occasion he was forced to act on her behalf,\r\nhe would not tell himself that he wanted to take her for his wife.\r\nHe constantly assured himself that he wanted no wife, that for him\r\na solitary life would be the best. But yet it made him wretched when\r\nhe reflected that some man would assuredly marry Mary Masters. He\r\nhad heard of that excellent but empty-headed young man Mr. Surtees.\r\nWhen the idea occurred to him he found himself reviling Mr. Surtees\r\nas being of all men the most puny, the most unmanly, and the least\r\nworthy of marrying Mary Masters. Now that Mr. Twentyman was certainly\r\ndisposed of, he almost became jealous of Mr. Surtees.\r\n\r\nIt was not till three or four o\'clock in the afternoon that he went\r\nout on his commission to the attorney\'s house, having made up his\r\nmind that he would do everything in his power to facilitate Mary\'s\r\nproposed return to Cheltenham. He asked first for Mr. Masters and\r\nthen for Miss Masters, and learned that they were both out together.\r\nBut he had been desired also to see Mrs. Masters, and on inquiring\r\nfor her was again shown into the grand drawing-room. Here he remained\r\na quarter of an hour while the lady of the house was changing her\r\ncap and apron, which he spent in convincing himself that this house\r\nwas altogether an unfit residence for Mary. In the chamber in which\r\nhe was standing it was clear enough that no human being ever lived.\r\nMary\'s drawing-room ought to be a bower in which she at least might\r\npass her time with books and music and pretty things around her.\r\nThe squalor of the real living room might be conjectured from the\r\nuntouched cleanliness of this useless sanctum. At last the lady came\r\nto him and welcomed him with very grim courtesy. As a client of her\r\nhusband he was very well;--but as a nephew of Lady Ushant he was\r\ninjurious. It was he who had carried Mary away to Cheltenham where\r\nshe had been instigated to throw her bread-and-butter into the\r\nfire,--as Mrs. Masters expressed it,--by that pernicious old woman\r\nLady Ushant. "Mr. Masters is out walking," she said. Reginald clearly\r\nunderstood by the contempt which she threw almost unconsciously into\r\nher words that she did not approve of her husband going out walking\r\nat such an hour.\r\n\r\n"I had a message for him--and also for you. My aunt, Lady Ushant,\r\nis very anxious that your daughter Mary should return to her at\r\nCheltenham for a while." The proposition to Mrs. Masters\' thinking\r\nwas so monstrous, and was at the same time so unexpected, that it\r\nalmost took away her breath. At any rate she stood for a moment\r\nspeechless. "My aunt is very fond of your daughter," he continued,\r\n"and if she can be spared would be delighted to have her. Perhaps she\r\nhas written to Miss Masters, but she has asked me to come over and\r\nsee if it cannot be arranged."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be arranged," said Mrs. Masters. "Nothing of the kind can\r\nbe arranged."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that."\r\n\r\n"It is only disturbing the girl, and upsetting her, and filling her\r\nhead full of nonsense. What is she to do at Cheltenham? This is her\r\nhome and here she had better be." Though things had hitherto gone\r\nvery badly, though Larry Twentyman had not shown himself since the\r\nreceipt of the letter, still Mrs. Masters had not abandoned all hope.\r\nShe was fixed in opinion that if her husband were joined with her\r\nthey could still, between them, so break the girl\'s spirit as to\r\nforce her into a marriage. "As for letters," she continued, "I don\'t\r\nknow anything about them. There may have been letters but if so they\r\nhave been kept from me." She was so angry that she could not even\r\nattempt to conceal her wrath.\r\n\r\n"Lady Ushant thinks--" began the messenger.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, Lady Ushant is very well of course. Lady Ushant is your\r\naunt, Mr. Morton, and I haven\'t anything to say against her. But Lady\r\nUshant can\'t do any good to that girl. She has got her bread to earn,\r\nand if she won\'t do it one way then she must do it another. She\'s\r\nobstinate and pigheaded, that\'s the truth of it. And her father\'s\r\njust as bad. He has taken her out now merely because she likes to\r\nbe idle, and to go about thinking herself a fine lady. Lady Ushant\r\ndoesn\'t do her any good at all by cockering her up."\r\n\r\n"My aunt, you know, saw very much of her when she was young."\r\n\r\n"I know she did, Mr. Morton; and all that has to be undone,--and I\r\nhave got the undoing of it. Lady Ushant is one thing and her papa\'s\r\nbusiness is quite another. At any rate if I have my say she\'ll not\r\ngo to Cheltenham any more. I don\'t mean to be uncivil to you, Mr.\r\nMorton, or to say anything as oughtn\'t to be said of your aunt.\r\nBut when you can\'t make people anything but what they are, it\'s my\r\nopinion that it\'s best to leave them alone. Good day to you, sir, and\r\nI hope you understand what it is that I mean."\r\n\r\nThen Morton retreated and went down the stairs, leaving the lady in\r\npossession of her own grandeur. He had not quite understood what she\r\nhad meant, and was still wondering at the energy of her opposition\r\nwhen he met Mary herself at the front door. Her father was not with\r\nher, but his retreating form was to be seen entering the portal of\r\nthe Bush. "Oh, Mr. Morton!" exclaimed Mary surprised to have the\r\nhouse-door opened for her by him.\r\n\r\n"I have come with a message from my aunt."\r\n\r\n"She told me that you would do so."\r\n\r\n"Lady Ushant would of course be delighted to have you if it could be\r\narranged."\r\n\r\n"Then Lady Ushant will be disappointed," said Mrs. Masters who had\r\ndescended the stairs. "There has been something going on behind my\r\nback."\r\n\r\n"I wrote to Lady Ushant," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"I call that sly and deceitful;--very sly and very deceitful. If\r\nI know it you won\'t stir out of this house to go to Cheltenham. I\r\nwonder Lady Ushant would go to put you up in that way against those\r\nyou\'re bound to obey."\r\n\r\n"I thought Mrs. Masters had been told," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Papa did know that I wrote," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and in this way a conspiracy is to be made up in the house! If\r\nshe goes to Cheltenham I won\'t stay here. You may tell Lady Ushant\r\nthat I say that. I\'m not going to be one thing one day and another\r\nanother, and to be made a tool of all round." By this time Dolly\r\nand Kate had come down from the upper regions and were standing\r\nbehind their mother. "What do you two do there, standing gaping\r\nlike fools?" said the angry mother. "I suppose your father has gone\r\nover to the public-house again. That, miss, is what comes from your\r\npigheadedness. Didn\'t I tell you that you were ruining everybody\r\nbelonging to you?" Before all this was over Reginald Morton had\r\nescaped, feeling that he could do no good to either side by remaining\r\na witness to such a scene. He must take some other opportunity of\r\nfinding the attorney and of learning from him whether he intended\r\nthat his daughter should be allowed to accept Lady Ushant\'s\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary as she shrunk into the house was nearly heartbroken. That\r\nsuch things should be at all was very dreadful, but that the scene\r\nshould have taken place in the presence of Reginald Morton was an\r\naggravation of the misery which nearly overwhelmed her. How could she\r\nmake him understand whence had arisen her stepmother\'s anger and that\r\nshe herself had been neither sly nor deceitful nor pigheaded?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n"BUT THERE IS SOME ONE."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Masters had gone across to the Bush his purpose had\r\ncertainly been ignoble, but it had had no reference to brandy and\r\nwater. And the allusion made by Mrs. Masters to the probable ruin\r\nwhich was to come from his tendencies in that direction had been\r\ncalumnious, for she knew that the man was not given to excess in\r\nliquor. But as he approached his own house he bethought himself that\r\nit would not lead to domestic comfort if he were seen returning from\r\nhis walk with Mary, and he had therefore made some excuse as to the\r\nexpediency of saying a word to Runciman whom he espied at his own\r\ndoor. He said his word to Runciman, and so loitered away perhaps a\r\nquarter of an hour, and then went back to his office. But his wife\r\nhad kept her anger at burning heat and pounced upon him before he\r\nhad taken his seat. Sundown was there copying, sitting with his eyes\r\nintent on the board before him as though he were quite unaware of the\r\nsudden entrance of his master\'s wife. She in her fury did not regard\r\nSundown in the least, but at once commenced her attack. "What is\r\nall this, Mr. Masters," she said, "about Lady Ushant and going to\r\nCheltenham? I won\'t have any going to Cheltenham and that\'s flat."\r\nNow the attorney had altogether made up his mind that his daughter\r\nshould go to Cheltenham if her friend would receive her. Whatever\r\nmight be the consequences, they must be borne. But he thought it best\r\nto say nothing at the first moment of the attack, and simply turned\r\nhis sorrowful round face in silence up to the partner of all his\r\ncares and the source of so many of them. "There have been letters,"\r\ncontinued the lady;--"letters which nobody has told me nothing about.\r\nThat proud peacock from Hoppet Hall has been here, as though he\r\nhad nothing to do but carry Mary away about the country just as\r\nhe pleased. Mary won\'t go to Cheltenham with him nor yet without\r\nhim;--not if I am to remain here."\r\n\r\n"Where else should you remain, my dear?" asked the attorney.\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner go into the workhouse than have all this turmoil. That\'s\r\nwhere we are all likely to go if you pass your time between walking\r\nabout with that minx and the public-house opposite." Then the\r\nattorney was aware that he had been watched, and his spirit began to\r\nrise within him. He looked at Sundown, but the man went on copying\r\nquicker than ever.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Mr. Masters, "you shouldn\'t talk in that way before\r\nthe clerk. I wanted to speak to Mr. Runciman, and, as to the\r\nworkhouse, I don\'t know that there is any more danger now than there\r\nhas been for the last twenty years."\r\n\r\n"It\'s always off and on as far as I can see. Do you mean to send that\r\ngirl to Cheltenham?"\r\n\r\n"I rather think she had better go--for a time."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall leave this house and go with my girls to Norrington."\r\nNow this threat, which had been made before, was quite without\r\nmeaning. Mrs. Masters\' parents were both dead, and her brother, who\r\nhad a large family, certainly would not receive her. "I won\'t remain\r\nhere, Mr. Masters, if I ain\'t to be mistress of my own house. What is\r\nshe to go to Cheltenham for, I should like to know?"\r\n\r\nThen Sundown was desired by his wretched employer to go into the back\r\nsettlement and the poor man prepared himself for the battle as well\r\nas he could. "She is not happy here," he said.\r\n\r\n"Whose fault is that? Why shouldn\'t she be happy? Of course you know\r\nwhat it means. She has got round you because she wants to be a fine\r\nlady. What means have you to make her a fine lady? If you was to\r\ndie to-morrow what would there be for any of \'em? My little bit of\r\nmoney is all gone. Let her stay here and be made to marry Lawrence\r\nTwentyman. That\'s what I say."\r\n\r\n"She will never marry Mr. Twentyman."\r\n\r\n"Not if you go on like this she won\'t. If you\'d done your duty by her\r\nlike a real father instead of being afraid of her when she puts on\r\nher tantrums, she\'d have been at Chowton Farm by this time."\r\n\r\nIt was clear to him that now was the time not to be afraid of his\r\nwife when she put on her tantrums,--or at any rate, to appear not to\r\nbe afraid. "She has been very unhappy of late."\r\n\r\n"Oh, unhappy! She\'s been made more of than anybody else in this\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"And a change will do her good. She has my permission to go;--and go\r\nshe shall!" Then the word had been spoken.\r\n\r\n"She shall!"\r\n\r\n"It is very much for the best. While she is here the house is made\r\nwretched for us all."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be wretcheder yet; unless it would make you happy to see me\r\ndead on the threshold,--which I believe it would. As for her, she\'s\r\nan ungrateful, sly, wicked slut."\r\n\r\n"She has done nothing wicked that I know of."\r\n\r\n"Not writing to that old woman behind my back?"\r\n\r\n"She told me what she was doing and showed me the letter."\r\n\r\n"Yes; of course. The two of you were in it. Does that make it any\r\nbetter? I say it was sly and wicked; and you were sly and wicked as\r\nwell as she. She has got the better of you, and now you are going to\r\nsend her away from the only chance she\'ll ever get of having a decent\r\nhome of her own over her head."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing more to be said about it, my dear. She\'ll go to\r\nLady Ushant." Having thus pronounced his dictum with all the marital\r\nauthority he was able to assume he took his hat and sallied forth.\r\nMrs. Masters, when she was left alone, stamped her foot and hit the\r\ndesk with a ruler that was lying there. Then she went up-stairs and\r\nthrew herself on her bed in a paroxysm of weeping and wailing.\r\n\r\nMr. Masters, when he closed his door, looked up the street and down\r\nthe street and then again went across to the Bush. Mr. Runciman was\r\nstill there, and was standing with a letter in his hand, while one\r\nof the grooms from Rufford Hall was holding a horse beside him. "Any\r\nanswer, Mr. Runciman?" said the groom.\r\n\r\n"Only to tell his lordship that everything will be ready for him.\r\nYou\'d better go through and give the horse a feed of corn, and get\r\na bit of something to eat and a glass of beer yourself." The man\r\nwasn\'t slow to do as he was bid;--and in this way the Bush had\r\nbecome very popular with the servants of the gentry around the place.\r\n"His lordship is to be here from Friday to Sunday with a party, Mr.\r\nMasters."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed."\r\n\r\n"For the end of the shooting. And who do you think he has asked to be\r\none of the party?"\r\n\r\n"Not Mr. Reginald?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they ever spoke in their lives. Who but Larry\r\nTwentyman!"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be the making of Larry. I only hope he won\'t cock his beaver\r\ntoo high."\r\n\r\n"Is he coming?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. He\'ll be sure to come. His Lordship only tells me\r\nthat there are to be six of \'em on Saturday and five on Friday night.\r\nBut the lad there knew who they all were. There\'s Mr. Surbiton and\r\nCaptain Battersby and Sir George are to come over with his lordship\r\nfrom Rufford. And young Mr. Hampton is to join them here, and Larry\r\nTwentyman is to shoot with them on Saturday and dine afterwards.\r\nWon\'t those two Botseys be jealous; that\'s all?"\r\n\r\n"It only shows what they think of Larry," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"Larry Twentyman is a very good fellow," said the landlord. "I don\'t\r\nknow a better fellow round Dillsborough, or one who is more always on\r\nthe square. But he\'s weak. You know him as well as I, Mr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not so weak but what he can keep what he\'s got."\r\n\r\n"This\'ll be the way to try him. He\'d melt away like water into sand\r\nif he were to live for a few weeks with such men as his Lordship\'s\r\nfriends. I suppose there\'s no chance of his taking a wife home to\r\nChowton with him?" The attorney shook his head. "That\'d be the making\r\nof him, Mr. Masters; a good girl like that who\'d keep him at home.\r\nIf he takes it to heart he\'ll burst out somewhere and spend a lot of\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\nThe attorney declined Mr. Runciman\'s offer of a glass of beer and\r\nslowly made his way round the corner of the inn by Hobb\'s gate to the\r\nfront door of Hoppet Hall. Then he passed on to the churchyard, still\r\nthinking of the misery of his position. When he reached the church\r\nhe turned back, still going very slowly, and knocked at the door of\r\nHoppet Hall. He was shown at once by Reginald\'s old housekeeper up to\r\nthe library, and there in a few minutes he was joined by the master\r\nof the house. "I was over looking for you an hour or two ago," said\r\nReginald.\r\n\r\n"I heard you were there, Mr. Morton, and so I thought I would come to\r\nyou. You didn\'t see Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I just saw her,--but could hardly say much. She had written to my\r\naunt about going to Cheltenham."\r\n\r\n"I saw the letter before she sent it, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"So she told me. My aunt would be delighted to have her, but it seems\r\nthat Mrs. Masters does not wish her to go."\r\n\r\n"There is some trouble about it, Mr. Morton;--but I may as well tell\r\nyou at once that I wish her to go. She would be better for awhile at\r\nCheltenham with such a lady as your aunt than she can be at home. Her\r\nstepmother and she cannot agree on a certain point. I dare say you\r\nknow what it is, Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"In regard, I suppose, to Mr. Twentyman?"\r\n\r\n"Just that. Mrs. Masters thinks that Mr. Twentyman would make an\r\nexcellent husband. And so do I. There\'s nothing in the world against\r\nhim, and as compared with me he\'s a rich man. I couldn\'t give the\r\npoor girl any fortune, and he wouldn\'t want any. But money isn\'t\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"No indeed."\r\n\r\n"He\'s an industrious steady young man too, and he has had my word\r\nwith him all through. But I can\'t compel my girl to marry him if she\r\ndon\'t like him. I can\'t even try to compel her. She\'s as good a girl\r\nas ever stirred about a house."\r\n\r\n"I can well believe that."\r\n\r\n"And nothing would take such a load off me as to know that she was\r\ngoing to be well married. But as she don\'t like the young man well\r\nenough, I won\'t have her hardly used."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Masters perhaps is--hard to her."\r\n\r\n"God forbid I should say anything against my wife. I never did, and\r\nI won\'t now. But Mary will be better away; and if Lady Ushant will be\r\ngood enough to take her, she shall go."\r\n\r\n"When will she be ready, Mr. Masters?"\r\n\r\n"I must ask her about that;--in a week perhaps, or ten days."\r\n\r\n"She is quite decided against the young man?"\r\n\r\n"Quite. At the bidding of all of us she said she\'d take two months to\r\nthink of it. But before the time was up she wrote to him to say it\r\ncould never be. It quite upset my wife; because it would have been\r\nsuch an excellent arrangement."\r\n\r\nReginald wished to learn more but hardly knew how to ask the father\r\nquestions. Yet, as he had been trusted so far, he thought that he\r\nmight be trusted altogether. "I must own," he said, "that I think\r\nthat Mr. Twentyman would hardly be a fit husband for your daughter."\r\n\r\n"He is a very good young man."\r\n\r\n"Very likely;--but she is something more than a very good young\r\nwoman. A young lady with her gifts will be sure to settle well in\r\nlife some day." The attorney shook his head. He had lived long enough\r\nto see many young ladies with good gifts find it difficult to settle\r\nin life; and perhaps that mysterious poem which Reginald found in\r\nMary\'s eyes was neither visible nor audible to Mary\'s father. "I did\r\nhear," said Reginald, "that Mr. Surtees--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing in that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed. I thought that perhaps as she is so determined not to do\r\nas her friends would wish, that there might be something else." He\r\nsaid this almost as a question, looking close into the attorney\'s\r\neyes as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"It is always possible," said Mr. Masters.\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t think there is anybody?"\r\n\r\n"It is very hard to say, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t expect anything of that sort?"\r\n\r\nThen the attorney broke forth into sudden confidence. "To tell the\r\ntruth then, Mr. Morton, I think there is somebody, though who it\r\nis I know as little as the baby unborn. She sees nobody here at\r\nDillsborough to be intimate with. She isn\'t one of those who would\r\nwrite letters or do anything on the sly."\r\n\r\n"But there is some one?"\r\n\r\n"She told me as much herself. That is, when I asked her she would\r\nnot deny it. Then I thought that perhaps it might be somebody at\r\nCheltenham."\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"She was there so short a time, Mr. Morton; and Lady Ushant would\r\nbe the last person in the world to let such a thing as that go on\r\nwithout telling her parents."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there was any one at Cheltenham. She was only there a\r\nmonth."\r\n\r\n"I did fancy that perhaps that was one reason why she should want to\r\ngo back."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it. I don\'t in the least believe it," said Reginald\r\nenthusiastically. "My aunt would have been sure to have seen it.\r\nIt would have been impossible without her knowledge. But there is\r\nsomebody?"\r\n\r\n"I think so, Mr. Morton;--and if she does go to Cheltenham perhaps\r\nLady Ushant had better know." To this Reginald agreed, or half\r\nagreed. It did not seem to him to be of much consequence what might\r\nbe done at Cheltenham. He felt certain that the lover was not there.\r\nAnd yet who was there at Dillsborough? He had seen those young\r\nBotseys about. Could it possibly be one of them? And during the\r\nChristmas vacation the rector\'s scamp of a son had been home from\r\nOxford,--to whom Mary Masters had barely spoken. Was it young\r\nMainwaring? Or could it be possible that she had turned an eye of\r\nfavour on Dr. Nupper\'s elegantly-dressed assistant. There was nothing\r\ntoo monstrous for him to suggest to himself as soon as the attorney\r\nhad left him.\r\n\r\nBut there was a young man in Dillsborough,--one man at any rate young\r\nenough to be a lover,--of whom Reginald did not think; as to whom,\r\nhad his name been suggested as that of the young man to whom Mary\'s\r\nheart had been given, he would have repudiated such a suggestion with\r\nastonishment and anger. But now, having heard this from the girl\'s\r\nfather, he was again vexed, and almost as much disgusted as when he\r\nhad first become aware that Larry Twentyman was a suitor for her\r\nhand. Why should he trouble himself about a girl who was ready to\r\nfall in love with the first man that she saw about the place? He\r\ntried to pacify himself by some such question as this, but tried in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE DINNER AT THE BUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the letter which at his brother-in-law\'s advice Lord Rufford\r\nwrote to Arabella:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Rufford, 3 February, 1875.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL,\r\n\r\n   It is a great grief to me that I should have to answer\r\n   your letter in a manner that will I fear not be\r\n   satisfactory to you. I can only say that you have\r\n   altogether mistaken me if you think that I have said\r\n   anything which was intended as an offer of marriage. I\r\n   cannot but be much flattered by your good opinion. I have\r\n   had much pleasure from our acquaintance, and I should have\r\n   been glad if it could have been continued. But I have had\r\n   no thoughts of marriage. If I have said a word which has,\r\n   unintentionally on my part, given rise to such an idea I\r\n   can only beg your pardon heartily. If I were to add more\r\n   after what I have now said perhaps you would take it as an\r\n   impertinence.\r\n\r\n   Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n   RUFFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had desired to make various additions and suggestions which\r\nhowever had all been disallowed by Sir George Penwether. He had\r\nproposed among other things to ask her whether he should keep Jack\r\nfor her for the remainder of the season or whether he should send the\r\nhorse elsewhere, but Sir George would not allow a word in the letter\r\nabout Jack. "You did give her the horse then?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I had hardly any alternative as the things went. She would have been\r\nquite welcome to the horse if she would have let me alone\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\n"No doubt; but when young gentlemen give young ladies horses--"\r\n\r\n"I know all about it, my dear fellow. Pray don\'t preach more than you\r\ncan help. Of course I have been an infernal ass. I know all that. But\r\nas the horse is hers--"\r\n\r\n"Say nothing about the horse. Were she to ask for it of course she\r\ncould have it; but that is not likely."\r\n\r\n"And you think I had better say nothing else."\r\n\r\n"Not a word. Of course it will be shown to all her friends and may\r\npossibly find its way into print. I don\'t know what steps such a\r\nyoung lady may be advised to take. Her uncle is a man of honour. Her\r\nfather is an ass and careless about everything. Mistletoe will not\r\nimprobably feel himself bound to act as though he were her brother.\r\nThey will, of course, all think you to be a rascal,--and will say\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"If Mistletoe says so I\'ll horsewhip him."\r\n\r\n"No you won\'t, Rufford. You will remember that this woman is a woman,\r\nand that a woman\'s friends are bound to stand up for her. After all\r\nyour hands are not quite clean in the matter."\r\n\r\n"I am heavy enough on myself, Penwether. I have been a fool and I own\r\nit. But I have done nothing unbecoming a gentleman." He was almost\r\ntempted to quarrel with his brother-in-law, but at last he allowed\r\nthe letter to be sent just as Sir George had written it, and then\r\ntried to banish the affair from his mind for the present so that he\r\nmight enjoy his life till the next hostile step should be taken by\r\nthe Trefoil clan.\r\n\r\nWhen Larry Twentyman received the lord\'s note, which was left at\r\nChowton Farm by Hampton\'s groom, he was in the lowest depth of\r\ndesolation. He had intended to hunt that day in compliance with\r\nJohn Morton\'s advice, but had felt himself quite unable to make the\r\neffort. It was not only that he had been thrown over by Mary Masters,\r\nbut that everybody knew that he had been thrown over. If he had kept\r\nthe matter secret, perhaps he might have borne it;--but it is so\r\nhard to bear a sorrow of which all one\'s neighbours are conscious.\r\nWhen a man is reduced by poverty to the drinking of beer instead of\r\nwine, it is not the loss of the wine that is so heavy on him as the\r\nconsciousness that those around him are aware of the reason. And he\r\nis apt to extend his idea of this consciousness to a circle that is\r\naltogether indifferent of the fact. That a man should fail in his\r\nlove seems to him to be of all failures the most contemptible, and\r\nLarry thought that there would not be one in the field unaware of his\r\nmiserable rejection. In spite of his mother\'s prayers he had refused\r\nto go, and had hung about the farm all day.\r\n\r\nThen there came to him Lord Rufford\'s note. It had been quite\r\nunexpected, and a month or two before, when his hopes had still been\r\nhigh in regard to Mary Masters, would have filled him with delight.\r\nIt was the foible of his life to be esteemed a gentleman, and his\r\npoor ambition to be allowed to live among men of higher social\r\nstanding than himself. Those dinners of Lord Rufford\'s at the Bush\r\nhad been a special grief to him. The young lord had been always\r\ncourteous to him in the field, and he had been able, as he thought,\r\nto requite such courtesy by little attentions in the way of game\r\npreserving. If pheasants from Dillsborough Wood ate Goarly\'s wheat,\r\nso did they eat Larry Twentyman\'s barley. He had a sportsman\'s heart,\r\nabove complaint as to such matters, and had always been neighbourly\r\nto the lord. No doubt pheasants and hares were left at his house\r\nwhenever there was shooting in the neighbourhood,--which to his\r\nmother afforded great consolation. But Larry did not care for the\r\npheasants and hares. Had he so pleased he could have shot them on\r\nhis own land; but he did not preserve, and, as a good neighbour,\r\nhe regarded the pheasants and hares as Lord Rufford\'s property. He\r\nfelt that he was behaving as a gentleman as well as a neighbour, and\r\nthat he should be treated as such. Fred Botsey had dined at the Bush\r\nwith Lord Rufford, and Larry looked on Fred as in no way better than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNow at last the invitation had come. He was asked to a day\'s shooting\r\nand to dine with the lord and his party at the inn. How pleasant\r\nwould it be to give a friendly nod to Runciman as he went into the\r\nroom, and to assert afterwards in Botsey\'s hearing something of\r\nthe joviality of the evening. Of course Hampton would be there as\r\nHampton\'s servant had brought the note, and he was very anxious to be\r\non friendly terms with Mr. Hampton. Next to the lord himself there\r\nwas no one in the hunt who carried his head so high as young Hampton.\r\n\r\nBut there arose to him the question whether all this had not arrived\r\ntoo late! Of what good is it to open up the true delights of life\r\nto a man when you have so scotched and wounded him that he has no\r\ncapability left of enjoying anything? As he sat lonely with his\r\npipe in his mouth he thought for a while that he would decline the\r\ninvitation. The idea of selling Chowton Farm and of establishing\r\nhimself at some Antipodes in which the name of Mary Masters should\r\nnever have been heard, was growing upon him. Of what use would the\r\nfriendship of Lord Rufford be to him at the other side of the globe?\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the hope of giving that friendly nod to Runciman\r\novercame him, and he determined to go. He wrote a note, which caused\r\nhim no little thought, presenting his compliments to Lord Rufford and\r\npromising to meet his lordship\'s party at Dillsborough Wood.\r\n\r\nThe shooting went off very well and Larry behaved himself with\r\npropriety. He wanted the party to come in and lunch, and had given\r\nsundry instructions to his mother on that head. But they did not\r\nremain near to his place throughout the day, and his efforts in that\r\ndirection were not successful. Between five and six he went home, and\r\nat half-past seven appeared at the Bush attired in his best. He never\r\nyet had sat down with a lord, and his mind misgave him a little; but\r\nhe had spirit enough to look about for Runciman,--who, however, was\r\nnot to be seen.\r\n\r\nSir George was not there, but the party had been made up, as regarded\r\nthe dinner, by the addition of Captain Glomax, who had returned\r\nfrom hunting. Captain Glomax was in high glee, having had,--as he\r\ndeclared,--the run of the season. When a Master has been deserted on\r\nany day by the choice spirits of his hunt he is always apt to boast\r\nto them that he had on that occasion the run of the season. He had\r\ntaken a fox from Impington right across to Hogsborough, which, as\r\nevery one knows, is just on the borders of the U. R. U., had then run\r\nhim for five miles into Lord Chiltern\'s country, and had killed him\r\nin the centre of the Brake Hunt, after an hour and a half, almost\r\nwithout a check. "It was one of those straight things that one\r\ndoesn\'t often see now-a-days," said Glomax.\r\n\r\n"Any pace?" asked Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"Very good, indeed, for the first forty minutes. I wish you had all\r\nbeen there. It was better fun I take it than shooting rabbits."\r\n\r\nThen Hampton put the Captain through his facings as to time and\r\ndistance and exact places that had been passed, and ended by\r\nexpressing an opinion that he could have kicked his hat as fast on\r\nfoot. Whereupon the Captain begged him to try, and hinted that he did\r\nnot know the country. In answer to which Hampton offered to bet a\r\nfive-pound note that young Jack Runce would say that the pace had\r\nbeen slow. Jack was the son of the old farmer whom the Senator had so\r\ndisgusted, and was supposed to know what he was about on a horse. But\r\nGlomax declined the bet saying that he did not care a ---- for Jack\r\nRunce. He knew as much about pace as any farmer, or for the matter\r\nof that any gentleman, in Ufford or Rufford, and the pace for forty\r\nminutes had been very good. Nevertheless all the party were convinced\r\nthat the "thing" had been so slow that it had not been worth riding\r\nto;--a conviction which is not uncommon with gentlemen when they have\r\nmissed a run. In all this discussion poor Larry took no great part\r\nthough he knew the country as well as any one. Larry had not as yet\r\ngot over the awe inspired by the lord in his black coat.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Larry\'s happiest moment in the evening was when Runciman\r\nhimself brought in the soup, for at that moment Lord Rufford put his\r\nhand on his shoulder and desired him to sit down,--and Runciman both\r\nheard and saw it. And at dinner, when the champagne had been twice\r\nround, he became more comfortable. The conversation got upon Goarly,\r\nand in reference to that matter he was quite at home. "It\'s not my\r\ndoing," said Lord Rufford. "I have instructed no one to keep him\r\nlocked up."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very good job from all that I can hear," said Tom Surbiton.\r\n\r\n"All I did was to get Mr. Masters here to take up the case for me,\r\nand I learned from him to-day that the rascal had already agreed to\r\ntake the money I offered. He only bargains that it shall be paid\r\ninto his own hands,--no doubt desiring to sell the attorney he has\r\nemployed."\r\n\r\n"Bearside has got his money from the American Senator, my lord," said\r\nLarry.\r\n\r\n"They may fight it out among them. I don\'t care who gets the money or\r\nwho pays it as long as I\'m not imposed upon."\r\n\r\n"We must proceed against that man Scrobby," said Glomax with all the\r\nauthority of a Master.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never convict him on Goarly\'s evidence," said the Lord.\r\n\r\nThen Larry could give them further information. Nickem had positively\r\ntraced the purchase of the red herrings. An old woman in Rufford was\r\nready to swear that she herself had sold them to Mrs. Scrobby. Tom\r\nSurbiton suggested that the possession of red herrings was not of\r\nitself a crime. Hampton thought that it was corroborative. Captain\r\nBattersby wanted to know whether any of the herrings were still in\r\nexistence, so that they could be sworn to. Glomax was of opinion that\r\nvillainy of so deep a dye could not have taken place in any other\r\nhunting country in England.\r\n\r\n"There\'s been strychnine put down in the Brake too," said Hampton.\r\n\r\n"But not in cartloads," said the Master.\r\n\r\n"I rather think," said Larry, "that Nickem knows where the strychnine\r\nwas bought. That\'ll make a clear case of it. Hanging would be too\r\ngood for such a scoundrel." This was said after the third glass of\r\nchampagne, but the opinion was one which was well received by the\r\nwhole company. After that the Senator\'s conduct was discussed, and\r\nthey all agreed that in the whole affair that was the most marvellous\r\ncircumstance. "They must be queer people over there," said Larry.\r\n\r\n"Brutes!" said Glomax. "They once tried a pack of hounds somewhere in\r\none of the States, but they never could run a yard."\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of wine drank, which was not unusual at Lord\r\nRufford\'s dinners. Most of the company were seasoned vessels, and\r\nnone of them were much the worse for what they drank. But the\r\ngenerous wine got to Larry\'s heart, and perhaps made his brain a\r\nlittle soft. Lord Rufford remembering what had been said about the\r\nyoung man\'s misery tried to console him by attention; and as the\r\nevening wore on, and when the second cigars had been lit all round,\r\nthe two were seated together in confidential conversation at a\r\ncorner of the table. "Yes, my lord; I think I shall hook it," said\r\nLarry. "Something has occurred that has made the place not quite so\r\ncomfortable to me; and as it is all my own I think I shall sell it."\r\n\r\n"We should miss you immensely in the hunt," said Lord Rufford, who of\r\ncourse knew what the something was.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of you to say so, my lord. But there are things which\r\nmay make a man go."\r\n\r\n"Nothing serious, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Just a young woman, my lord. I don\'t want it talked about, but I\r\ndon\'t mind mentioning it to you."\r\n\r\n"You should never let those troubles touch you so closely," said his\r\nlordship, whose own withers at this moment were by no means unwrung.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. But if you feel it, how are you to help it? I shall\r\ndo very well when I get away. Chowton Farm is not the only spot in\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"But a man so fond of hunting as you are!"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes. I shall miss the hunting, my lord,--shan\'t I? If Mr.\r\nMorton don\'t buy the place I should like it to go to your lordship.\r\nI offered it to him first because it came from them."\r\n\r\n"Quite right. By-the-bye, I hear that Mr. Morton is very ill."\r\n\r\n"So I heard," said Larry. "Nupper has been with him, I know, and I\r\nfancy they have sent for somebody from London. I don\'t know that he\r\ncares much about the land. He thinks more of the foreign parts he\'s\r\nalways in. I don\'t believe we should fall out about the price, my\r\nlord." Then Lord Rufford explained that he would not go into that\r\nmatter just at present, but that if the place were in the market he\r\nwould certainly like to buy it. He, however, did as John Morton had\r\ndone before, and endeavoured to persuade the poor fellow that he\r\nshould not alter the whole tenor of his life because a young lady\r\nwould not look at him.\r\n\r\n"Good night, Mr. Runciman," said Larry as he made his way down-stairs\r\nto the yard. "We\'ve had an uncommon pleasant evening."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you\'ve enjoyed yourself, Larry." Larry thought that his\r\nChristian name from the hotel keeper\'s lips had never sounded so\r\noffensively as on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nMISS TREFOIL\'S DECISION.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Rufford\'s letter reached Arabella at her cousin\'s house, in due\r\ncourse, and was handed to her in the morning as she came down to\r\nbreakfast. The envelope bore his crest and coronet, and she was sure\r\nthat more than one pair of eyes had already seen it. Her mother had\r\nbeen in the room some time before her, and would of course know that\r\nthe letter was from Lord Rufford. An indiscreet word or two had been\r\nsaid in the hearing of Mrs. Connop Green,--as to which Arabella had\r\nalready scolded her mother most vehemently, and Mrs. Connop Green too\r\nwould probably have seen the letter, and would know that it had come\r\nfrom the lover of whom boasts had been made. The Connop Greens would\r\nbe ready to worship Arabella down to the very soles of her feet if\r\nshe were certainly,--without a vestige of doubt,--engaged to be the\r\nwife of Lord Rufford. But there had been so many previous mistakes!\r\nAnd they, too, had heard of Mr. John Morton. They too were a little\r\nafraid of Arabella though she was undoubtedly the niece of a Duke.\r\n\r\nShe was aware now,--as always,--how much depended on her personal\r\nbearing; but this was a moment of moments! She would fain have kept\r\nthe letter, and have opened it in the retirement of her own room. She\r\nknew its terrible importance, and was afraid of her own countenance\r\nwhen she should read it. All the hopes of her life were contained in\r\nthat letter. But were she to put it in her pocket she would betray\r\nher anxiety by doing so. She found herself bound to open it and read\r\nit at once,--and she did open it and read it.\r\n\r\nAfter all it was what she had expected. It was very decided, very\r\nshort, very cold, and carrying with it no sign of weakness. But it\r\nwas of such a letter that she had thought when she resolved that she\r\nwould apply to Lord Mistletoe, and endeavour to put the whole family\r\nof Trefoil in arms. She had been,--so she had assured herself,--quite\r\nsure that that kind, loving response which she had solicited,\r\nwould not be given to her. But yet the stern fact, now that it was\r\nabsolutely in her hands, almost overwhelmed her. She could not\r\nrestrain the dull dead look of heart-breaking sorrow which for a few\r\nmoments clouded her face,--a look which took away all her beauty,\r\nlengthening her cheeks, and robbing her eyes of that vivacity which\r\nit was the task of her life to assume. "Is anything the matter, my\r\ndear?" asked Mrs. Connop Green.\r\n\r\nThen she made a final effort,--an heroic effort. "What do you think,\r\nmamma?" she said, paying no attention to her cousin\'s inquiry.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Arabella?"\r\n\r\n"Jack got some injury that day at Peltry, and is so lame that they\r\ndon\'t know whether he\'ll ever put his foot to the ground again."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow," said Mr. Green. "Who is Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Jack is a horse, Mr. Green;--and such a horse that one cannot but be\r\nsorry for him. Poor Jack! I don\'t know any Christian whose lameness\r\nwould be such a nuisance."\r\n\r\n"Does Lord Rufford write about his horses?" asked Mrs. Connop Green,\r\nthus betraying that knowledge as to the letter which she had obtained\r\nfrom the envelope.\r\n\r\n"If you must know all the truth about it," said Arabella, "the horse\r\nis my horse, and not Lord Rufford\'s. And as he is the only horse I\r\nhave got, and as he\'s the dearest horse in all the world, you must\r\nexcuse my being a little sorry about him. Poor Jack!" After that the\r\nbreakfast was eaten and everybody in the room believed the story of\r\nthe horse\'s lameness--except Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast and the loitering after breakfast were well over, so\r\nthat she could escape without exciting any notice, she made her way\r\nup to her bedroom. In a few minutes,--so that again there should\r\nbe nothing noticeable,--her mother followed her. But her door was\r\nlocked. "It is I, Arabella," said her mother.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t come in at present, mamma. I am busy."\r\n\r\n"But Arabella."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t come in at present, mamma." Then Lady Augustus slowly\r\nglided away to her own room and there waited for tidings.\r\n\r\nThe whole form of the girl\'s face was altered when she was alone.\r\nHer features in themselves were not lovely. Her cheeks and chin were\r\nheavy. Her brow was too low, and her upper lip too long. Her nose and\r\nteeth were good, and would have been very handsome had they belonged\r\nto a man. Her complexion had always been good till it had been\r\ninjured by being improved,--and so was the carriage of her head and\r\nthe outside lines of her bust and figure, and her large eyes, though\r\nnever soft, could be bright and sparkle. Skill had done much for her\r\nand continued effort almost more. But now the effort was dropped and\r\nthat which skill had done turned against her. She was haggard, lumpy,\r\nand almost hideous in her bewildered grief.\r\n\r\nHad there been a word of weakness in the short letter she might\r\nhave founded upon it some hope. It did not occur to her that he had\r\nhad the letter written for him, and she was astonished at its curt\r\nstrength. How could he dare to say that she had mistaken him? Had she\r\nnot lain in his arms while he embraced her? How could he have found\r\nthe courage to say that he had had no thought of marriage when he\r\nhad declared to her that he loved her? She must have known that she\r\nhad hunted him as a fox is hunted;--and yet she believed that she\r\nwas being cruelly ill-used. For a time all that dependence on Lord\r\nMistletoe and her uncle deserted her. What effect could they have on\r\na man who would write such a letter as that? Had she known that the\r\nwords were the words of his brother-in-law, even that would have\r\ngiven her some hope.\r\n\r\nBut what should she do? Whatever steps she took she must take at\r\nonce. And she must tell her mother. Her mother\'s help would be\r\nnecessary to her now in whatever direction she might turn her mind.\r\nShe almost thought that she would abandon him without another word.\r\nShe had been strong in her reliance on family aid till the time for\r\ninvoking it had come; but now she believed that it would be useless.\r\nCould it be that such a man as this would be driven into marriage\r\nby the interference of Lord Mistletoe! She would much like to bring\r\ndown some punishment on his head;--but in doing so she would cut all\r\nother ground from under her own feet. There were still open to her\r\nPatagonia and the Paragon.\r\n\r\nShe hated the Paragon, and she recoiled with shuddering from the idea\r\nof Patagonia. But as for hating,--she hated Lord Rufford most. And\r\nwhat was there that she loved? She tried to ask herself some question\r\neven as to that. There certainly was no man for whom she cared a\r\nstraw; nor had there been for the last six or eight years. Even when\r\nhe was kissing her she was thinking of her built-up hair, of her\r\npearl powder, her paint, and of possible accidents and untoward\r\nrevelations. The loan of her lips had been for use only, and not for\r\nany pleasure which she had even in pleasing him. In her very swoon\r\nshe had felt the need of being careful at all points. It was all\r\nlabour, and all care,--and, alas, alas, all disappointment!\r\n\r\nBut there was a future through which she must live. How might she\r\nbest avoid the misfortune of poverty for the twenty, thirty, or forty\r\nyears which might be accorded to her? What did it matter whom or what\r\nshe hated? The housemaid probably did not like cleaning grates; nor\r\nthe butcher killing sheep; nor the sempstress stitching silks. She\r\nmust live. And if she could only get away from her mother that in\r\nitself would be something. Most people were distasteful to her, but\r\nno one so much as her mother. Here in England she knew that she was\r\ndespised among the people with whom she lived. And now she would be\r\nmore despised than ever. Her uncle and aunt, though she disliked\r\nthem, had been much to her. It was something,--that annual visit to\r\nMistletoe, though she never enjoyed it when she was there. But she\r\ncould well understand that after such a failure as this, after such\r\na game, played before their own eyes in their own house, her uncle\r\nand her aunt would drop her altogether. She had played this game so\r\nboldly that there was no retreat. Would it not therefore be better\r\nthat she should fly altogether?\r\n\r\nThere was a time on that morning in which she had made up her mind\r\nthat she would write a most affectionate letter to Morton, telling\r\nhim that her people had now agreed to his propositions as to\r\nsettlement, and assuring him that from henceforward she would be all\r\nhis own. She did think that were she to do so she might still go with\r\nhim to Patagonia. But, if so, she must do it at once. The delay had\r\nalready been almost too long. In that case she would not say a word\r\nin reply to Lord Rufford, and would allow all that to be as though it\r\nhad never been. Then again there arose to her mind the remembrance of\r\nRufford Hall, of all the glories, of the triumph over everybody. Then\r\nagain there was the idea of a "forlorn hope." She thought that she\r\ncould have brought herself to do it, if only death would have been\r\nthe alternative of success when she had resolved to make the rush.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one when she went to her mother and even then she was\r\nundecided. But the joint agony of the solitude and the doubts had\r\nbeen too much for her and she found herself constrained to seek a\r\ncounsellor. "He has thrown you over," said Lady Augustus as soon as\r\nthe door was closed.\r\n\r\n"Of course he has," said Arabella walking up the room, and again\r\nplaying her part even before her mother.\r\n\r\n"I knew it would be so."\r\n\r\n"You knew nothing of the kind, mamma, and your saying so is simply an\r\nuntruth. It was you who put me up to it."\r\n\r\n"Arabella, that is false."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t you, I suppose, who made me throw over Mr. Morton and\r\nBragton."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"That is so like you, mamma. There isn\'t a single thing that you do\r\nor say that you don\'t deny afterwards." These little compliments were\r\nso usual among them that at the present moment they excited no great\r\ndanger. "There\'s his letter. I suppose you had better read it." And\r\nshe chucked the document to her mother.\r\n\r\n"It is very decided," said Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\n"It is the falsest, the most impudent, and the most scandalous letter\r\nthat a man ever wrote to a woman. I could horsewhip him for it myself\r\nif I could get near him."\r\n\r\n"Is it all over, Arabella?"\r\n\r\n"All over! What questions you do ask, mamma! No. It is not all over.\r\nI\'ll stick to him like a leech. He proposed to me as plainly as any\r\nman ever did to any woman. I don\'t care what people may say or think.\r\nHe hasn\'t heard the last of me; and so he\'ll find." And thus in her\r\npassion she made up her mind that she would not yet abandon the hunt.\r\n\r\n"What will you do, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"What will I do? How am I to say what I will do? If I were standing\r\nnear him with a knife in my hand I would stick it into his heart. I\r\nwould! Mistaken him! Liar! They talk of girls lying; but what girl\r\nwould lie like that?"\r\n\r\n"But something must be done."\r\n\r\n"If papa were not such a fool as he is, he could manage it all for\r\nme," said Arabella dutifully. "I must see my father and I must\r\ndictate a letter for him. Where is papa?"\r\n\r\n"In London, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"You must come up to London with me to-morrow. We shall have to go\r\nto his club and get him out. It must be done immediately; and then\r\nI must see Lord Mistletoe, and I will write to the Duke."\r\n\r\n"Would it not be better to write to your papa?" said Lady Augustus,\r\nnot liking the idea of being dragged away so quickly from comfortable\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n"No; it wouldn\'t. If you won\'t go I shall, and you must give me some\r\nmoney. I shall write to Lord Rufford too."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was at last decided, the wretched old woman being dragged\r\naway up to London on some excuse which the Connop Greens were not\r\nsorry to accept. But on that same afternoon Arabella wrote to Lord\r\nRufford.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Your letter has amazed me. I cannot understand it. It\r\n   seems to be almost impossible that it should really have\r\n   come from you. How can you say that I have mistaken you?\r\n   There has been no mistake. Surely that letter cannot have\r\n   been written by you.\r\n\r\n   Of course I have been obliged to tell my father\r\n   everything.\r\n\r\n   ARABELLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day at about four in the afternoon the mother and\r\ndaughter drove up to the door of Graham\'s Club in Bond Street, and\r\nthere they found Lord Augustus. With considerable difficulty he was\r\ninduced to come down from the whist room, and was forced into the\r\nbrougham. He was a handsome fat man, with a long grey beard, who\r\npassed his whole life in eating, drinking, and playing whist, and\r\nwas troubled by no scruples and no principles. He would not cheat at\r\ncards because it was dangerous and ungentlemanlike, and if discovered\r\nwould lead to his social annihilation; but as to paying money that\r\nhe owed to tradesmen, it never occurred to him as being a desirable\r\nthing as long as he could get what he wanted without doing so. He\r\nhad expended his own patrimony and his wife\'s fortune, and now lived\r\non an allowance made to him by his brother. Whatever funds his wife\r\nmight have not a shilling of them ever came from him. When he began\r\nto understand something of the nature of the business on hand, he\r\nsuggested that his brother, the Duke, could do what was desirable\r\ninfinitely better than he could. "He won\'t think anything of me,"\r\nsaid Lord Augustus.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll make him think something," said Arabella sternly. "You must do\r\nit, papa. They\'d turn you out of the club if they knew that you had\r\nrefused." Then he looked up in the brougham and snarled at her.\r\n"Papa, you must copy the letter and sign it."\r\n\r\n"How am I to know the truth of it all?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It is quite true," said Lady Augustus. There was very much more of\r\nit, but at last he was carried away bodily, and in his daughter\'s\r\npresence he did write and sign the following letter;--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I have heard from my daughter a story which has surprised\r\n   me very much. It appears that she has been staying with\r\n   you at Rufford Hall, and again at Mistletoe, and that\r\n   while at the latter place you proposed marriage to her.\r\n   She tells me with heart-breaking concern that you have now\r\n   repudiated your own proposition,--not only once made but\r\n   repeated. Her condition is most distressing. She is in all\r\n   respects your Lordship\'s equal. As her father I am driven\r\n   to ask you what excuse you have to make, or whether she\r\n   has interpreted you aright.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   Your very humble servant,\r\n\r\n   AUGUSTUS TREFOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n"IN THESE DAYS ONE CAN\'T MAKE A MAN MARRY."\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was going on while Lord Rufford was shooting in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dillsborough; and when the letter was being put into\r\nits envelope at the lodgings in Orchard Street, his Lordship was just\r\nsitting down to dinner with his guests at the Bush. At the same time\r\nJohn Morton was lying ill at Bragton;--a fact of which Arabella was\r\nnot aware.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Lord Augustus was put into the post on Saturday\r\nevening; but when that line of action was decided upon by Arabella\r\nshe was aware that she must not trust solely to her father. Various\r\nplans were fermenting in her brain; all, or any of which, if carried\r\nout at all, must be carried out at the same time and at once. There\r\nmust be no delay, or that final chance of Patagonia would be gone.\r\nThe leader of a forlorn hope, though he be ever so resolved to die in\r\nthe breach, still makes some preparation for his escape. Among her\r\nplans the first in order was a resolution to see Lord Mistletoe whom\r\nshe knew to be in town. Parliament was to meet in the course of the\r\nnext week and he was to move the address. There had been much said\r\nabout all this at Mistletoe from which she knew that he was in London\r\npreparing himself among the gentlemen at the Treasury. Then she\r\nherself would write to the Duke. She thought that she could concoct\r\na letter that would move even his heart. She would tell him that\r\nshe was a daughter of the house of Trefoil,--and "all that kind of\r\nthing." She had it distinctly laid down in her mind. And then there\r\nwas another move which she would make before she altogether threw up\r\nthe game. She would force herself into Lord Rufford\'s presence and\r\nthrow herself into his arms,--at his feet if need be,--and force him\r\ninto compliance. Should she fail, then she, too, had an idea what a\r\nraging woman could do. But her first step now must be with her cousin\r\nMistletoe. She would not write to the Duke till she had seen her\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nLord Mistletoe when in London lived at the family house in\r\nPiccadilly, and thither early on the Sunday morning she sent a note\r\nto say that she especially wished to see her cousin and would call\r\nat three o\'clock on that day. The messenger brought back word that\r\nLord Mistletoe would be at home, and exactly at that hour the hired\r\nbrougham stopped at the door. Her mother had wished to accompany her\r\nbut she had declared that if she could not go alone she would not go\r\nat all. In that she was right; for whatever favour the young heir to\r\nthe family honours might retain for his fair cousin, who was at any\r\nrate a Trefoil, he had none for his uncle\'s wife. She was shown into\r\nhis own sitting-room on the ground floor, and then he immediately\r\njoined her. "I wouldn\'t have you shown upstairs," he said, "because I\r\nunderstand from your note that you want to see me in particular."\r\n\r\n"That is so kind of you."\r\n\r\nLord Mistletoe was a young man about thirty, less in stature than his\r\nfather or uncle, but with the same handsome inexpressive face. Almost\r\nall men take to some line in life. His father was known as a manager\r\nof estates; his uncle as a whist-player; he was minded to follow the\r\nsteps of his grandfather and be a statesman. He was eaten up by no\r\nhigh ambition but lived in the hope that by perseverance he might\r\nlive to become a useful Under Secretary, and perhaps, ultimately,\r\na Privy Seal. As he was well educated and laborious, and had no\r\nobjection to sitting for five hours together in the House of Commons\r\nwith nothing to do and sometimes with very little to hear, it was\r\nthought by his friends that he would succeed. "And what is it I can\r\ndo?" he said with that affable smile to which he had already become\r\naccustomed as a government politician.\r\n\r\n"I am in great trouble," said Arabella, leaving her hand for a moment\r\nin his as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that. What sort of trouble?" He knew that his uncle\r\nand his aunt\'s family were always short of money, and was already\r\nconsidering to what extent he would go in granting her petition.\r\n\r\n"Do you know Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford! Yes;--I know him; but very slightly. My father knows\r\nhim very much better than I do."\r\n\r\n"I have just been at Mistletoe, and he was there. My story is so hard\r\nto tell. I had better out with it at once. Lord Rufford has asked me\r\nto be his wife."\r\n\r\n"The deuce he has! It\'s a very fine property and quite\r\nunembarrassed."\r\n\r\n"And now he repudiates his engagement." Upon hearing this the young\r\nlord\'s face became very long. He also had heard something of the past\r\nlife of his handsome cousin, though he had always felt kindly to her.\r\n"It was not once only."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! I should have thought your father would be the proper\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"Papa has written;--but you know what papa is."\r\n\r\n"Does the Duke know of it,--or my mother?"\r\n\r\n"It partly went on at Mistletoe. I would tell you the whole story\r\nif I knew how." Then she did tell him her story, during the telling\r\nof which he sat profoundly silent. She had gone to stay with Lady\r\nPenwether at Lord Rufford\'s house, and then he had first told her\r\nof his love. Then they had agreed to meet at Mistletoe, and she\r\nhad begged her aunt to receive her. She had not told her aunt at\r\nonce, and her aunt had been angry with her because they had walked\r\ntogether. Then she had told everything to the Duchess and had begged\r\nthe Duchess to ask the Duke to speak to Lord Rufford. At Mistletoe\r\nLord Rufford had twice renewed his offer,--and she had then accepted\r\nhim. But the Duke had not spoken to him before he left the place. She\r\nowned that she thought the Duchess had been a little hard to her. Of\r\ncourse she did not mean to complain, but the Duchess had been angry\r\nwith her because she had hunted. And now, in answer to the note from\r\nherself, had come a letter from Lord Rufford in which he repudiated\r\nthe engagement. "I only got it yesterday and I came at once to you. I\r\ndo not think you will see your cousin treated in that way without\r\nraising your hand. You will remember that I have no brother?"\r\n\r\n"But what can I do?" asked Lord Mistletoe.\r\n\r\nShe had taken great trouble with her face, so that she was able to\r\nburst out into tears. She had on a veil which partly concealed her.\r\nShe did not believe in the effect of a pocket handkerchief, but sat\r\nwith her face half averted. "Tell him what you think about it," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Such engagements, Arabella," he said, "should always be\r\nauthenticated by a third party. It is for that reason that a girl\r\ngenerally refers her lover to her father before she allows herself to\r\nbe considered as engaged."\r\n\r\n"Think what my position has been! I wanted to refer him to my uncle\r\nand asked the Duchess."\r\n\r\n"My mother must have had some reason. I\'m sure she must. There isn\'t\r\na woman in London knows how such things should be done better than my\r\nmother. I can write to Lord Rufford and ask him for an explanation;\r\nbut I do not see what good it would do."\r\n\r\n"If you were in earnest about it he would be--afraid of you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he would in the least. If I were to make a noise about\r\nit, it would only do you harm. You wouldn\'t wish all the world to\r\nknow that he had--"\r\n\r\n"Jilted me! I don\'t care what the world knows. Am I to put up with\r\nsuch treatment as that and do nothing? Do you like to see your cousin\r\ntreated in that way?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it at all. Lord Rufford is a good sort of man in his\r\nway, and has a large property. I wish with all my heart that it had\r\ncome off all right; but in these days one can\'t make a man marry.\r\nThere used to be the alternative of going out and being shot at; but\r\nthat is over now."\r\n\r\n"And a man is to do just as he pleases?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so. If a man is known to have behaved badly to a girl,\r\npublic opinion will condemn him."\r\n\r\n"Can anything be worse than this treatment of me?" Lord Mistletoe\r\ncould not tell her that he had alluded to absolute knowledge and that\r\nat present he had no more than her version of the story;--or that the\r\nworld would require more than that before the general condemnation of\r\nwhich he had spoken would come. So he sat in silence and shook his\r\nhead. "And you think that I should put up with it quietly!"\r\n\r\n"I think that your father should see the man." Arabella shook her\r\nhead contemptuously. "If you wish it I will write to my mother."\r\n\r\n"I would rather trust to my uncle."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he could do;--but I will write to him if you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"And you won\'t see Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\nHe sat silent for a minute or two during which she pressed him over\r\nand over again to have an interview with her recreant lover, bringing\r\nup all the arguments that she knew, reminding him of their former\r\naffection for each other, telling him that she had no brother of her\r\nown, and that her own father was worse than useless in such a matter.\r\nA word or two she said of the nature of the prize to be gained, and\r\nmany words as to her absolute right to regard that prize as her own.\r\nBut at last he refused. "I am not the person to do it," he said.\r\n"Even if I were your brother I should not be so,--unless with the\r\nview of punishing him for his conduct;--in which place the punishment\r\nto you would be worse than any I could inflict on him. It cannot be\r\ngood that any young lady should have her name in the mouths of all\r\nthe lovers of gossip in the country."\r\n\r\nShe was going to burst out at him in her anger, but before the words\r\nwere out of her mouth she remembered herself. She could not afford to\r\nmake enemies and certainly not an enemy of him. "Perhaps, then," she\r\nsaid, "you had better tell your mother all that I have told you. I\r\nwill write to the Duke myself."\r\n\r\nAnd so she left him, and as she returned to Orchard Street in the\r\nbrougham, she applied to him every term of reproach she could bring\r\nto mind. He was selfish, and a coward, and utterly devoid of all\r\nfeeling of family honour. He was a prig, and unmanly, and false. A\r\nreal cousin would have burst out into a passion and have declared\r\nhimself ready to seize Lord Rufford by the throat and shake him\r\ninto instant matrimony. But this man, through whose veins water was\r\nrunning instead of blood, had no feeling, no heart, no capability\r\nfor anger! Oh, what a vile world it was! A little help,--so very\r\nlittle,--would have made everything straight for her! If her aunt had\r\nonly behaved at Mistletoe as aunts should behave, there would have\r\nbeen no difficulty. In her misery she thought that the world was more\r\ncruel to her than to any other person in it.\r\n\r\nOn her arrival at home, she was astounded by a letter that she found\r\nthere,--a letter of such a nature that it altogether drove out of\r\nher head the purpose which she had of writing to the Duke on that\r\nevening. The letter was from John Morton and now reached her through\r\nthe lawyer to whom it had been sent by private hand for immediate\r\ndelivery. It ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAREST ARABELLA,\r\n\r\n   I am very ill,--so ill that Dr. Fanning who has come down\r\n   from London, has, I think, but a poor opinion of my case.\r\n   He does not say that it is hopeless,--and that is all. I\r\n   think it right to tell you this, as my affection for you\r\n   is what it always has been. If you wish to see me, you and\r\n   your mother had better come to Bragton at once. You can\r\n   telegraph. I am too weak to write more.\r\n\r\n   Yours most affectionately,\r\n\r\n   JOHN MORTON.\r\n\r\n   There is nothing infectious.\r\n\r\n\r\n"John Morton is dying," she almost screamed out to her mother.\r\n\r\n"Dying!"\r\n\r\n"So he says. Oh, what an unfortunate wretch I am! Everything that\r\ntouches me comes to grief." Then she burst out into a flood of true\r\nunfeigned tears.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t matter so much," said Lady Augustus, "if you mean to write\r\nto the Duke, and go on with this other--affair."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, how can you talk in that way?"\r\n\r\n"Well; my dear; you know--"\r\n\r\n"I am heartless. I know that. But you are ten times worse. Think how\r\nI have treated him!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want him to die, my dear; but what can I say? I can\'t do him\r\nany good. It is all in God\'s hands, and if he must die--why, it won\'t\r\nmake so much difference to you. I have looked upon all that as over\r\nfor a long time."\r\n\r\n"It is not over. After all he has liked me better than any of them.\r\nHe wants me to go to Bragton."\r\n\r\n"That of course is out of the question."\r\n\r\n"It is not out of the question at all. I shall go."\r\n\r\n"Arabella!"\r\n\r\n"And you must go with me, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I will do no such thing," said Lady Augustus, to whom the idea of\r\nBragton was terrible.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you must. He has asked me to go, and I shall do it. You can\r\nhardly let me go alone."\r\n\r\n"And what will you say to Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for Lord Rufford. Is he to prevent my going where I\r\nplease?"\r\n\r\n"And your father,--and the Duke,--and the Duchess! How can you go\r\nthere after all that you have been doing since you left?"\r\n\r\n"What do I care for the Duke and the Duchess. It has come to that,\r\nthat I care for no one. They are all throwing me over. That little\r\nwretch Mistletoe will do nothing. This man really loved me. He has\r\nnever treated me badly. Whether he live or whether he die, he has\r\nbeen true to me." Then she sat and thought of it all. What would Lord\r\nRufford care for her father\'s letter? If her cousin Mistletoe would\r\nnot stir in her behalf what chance had she with her uncle? And,\r\nthough she had thoroughly despised her cousin, she had understood and\r\nhad unconsciously believed much that he had said to her. "In these\r\ndays one can\'t make a man marry!" What horrid days they were! But\r\nJohn Morton would marry her to-morrow if he were well,--in spite of\r\nall her ill usage! Of course he would die and so she would again be\r\noverwhelmed;--but yet she would go and see him. As she determined to\r\ndo so there was something even in her hard callous heart softer than\r\nthe love of money and more human than the dream of an advantageous\r\nsettlement in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SENATOR\'S SECOND LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time our friend the Senator, up in London, was much\r\ndistracted in his mind, finding no one to sympathise with him in his\r\nefforts, conscious of his own rectitude of purpose, always brave\r\nagainst others, and yet with a sad doubt in his own mind whether it\r\ncould be possible that he should always be right and everybody around\r\nhim wrong.\r\n\r\nComing away from Mr. Mainwaring\'s dinner he had almost quarrelled\r\nwith John Morton, or rather John Morton had altogether quarrelled\r\nwith him. On their way back from Dillsborough to Bragton the minister\r\nelect to Patagonia had told him, in so many words, that he had\r\nmisbehaved himself at the clergyman\'s house. "Did I say anything that\r\nwas untrue?" asked the Senator--"Was I inaccurate in my statements?\r\nIf so no man alive will be more ready to recall what he has said and\r\nto ask for pardon." Mr. Morton endeavoured to explain to him that it\r\nwas not his statements which were at fault so much as the opinions\r\nbased on them and the language in which those opinions were given.\r\nBut the Senator could not be made to understand that a man had not\r\na right to his opinions, and a right also to the use of forcible\r\nlanguage as long as he abstained from personalities. "It was\r\nextremely personal,--all that you said about the purchase of\r\nlivings," said Morton. "How was I to know that?" rejoined the\r\nSenator. "When in private society I inveigh against pickpockets\r\nI cannot imagine, sir, that there should be a pickpocket in the\r\ncompany." As the Senator said this he was grieving in his heart at\r\nthe trouble he had occasioned, and was almost repenting the duties\r\nhe had imposed on himself; but, yet, his voice was bellicose and\r\nantagonistic. The conversation was carried on till Morton found\r\nhimself constrained to say that though he entertained great personal\r\nrespect for his guest he could not go with him again into society.\r\nHe was ill at the time,--though neither he himself knew it nor the\r\nSenator. On the next morning Mr. Gotobed returned to London without\r\nseeing his host, and before the day was over Mr. Nupper was at\r\nMorton\'s bedside. He was already suffering from gastric fever.\r\n\r\nThe Senator was in truth unhappy as he returned to town. The intimacy\r\nbetween him and the late Secretary of Legation at his capital had\r\narisen from a mutual understanding between them that each was to be\r\nallowed to see the faults and to admire the virtues of their two\r\ncountries, and that conversation between them was to be based on\r\nthe mutual system. But nobody can, in truth, endure to be told of\r\nshortcomings,--either on his own part or on that of his country. He\r\nhimself can abuse himself, or his country; but he cannot endure it\r\nfrom alien lips. Mr. Gotobed had hardly said a word about England\r\nwhich Morton himself might not have said,--but such words coming\r\nfrom an American had been too much even for the guarded temper of an\r\nunprejudiced and phlegmatic Englishman. The Senator as he returned\r\nalone to London understood something of this,--and when a few days\r\nlater he heard that the friend who had quarrelled with him was ill,\r\nhe was discontented with himself and sore at heart.\r\n\r\nBut he had his task to perform, and he meant to perform it to the\r\nbest of his ability. In his own country he had heard vehement abuse\r\nof the old land from the lips of politicians, and had found at the\r\nsame time almost on all sides great social admiration for the people\r\nso abused. He had observed that every Englishman of distinction was\r\nreceived in the States as a demigod, and that some who were not\r\nvery great in their own land had been converted into heroes in his.\r\nEnglish books were read there; English laws were obeyed there;\r\nEnglish habits were cultivated, often at the expense of American\r\ncomfort. And yet it was the fashion among orators to speak of\r\nthe English as a worn-out, stupid and enslaved people. He was a\r\nthoughtful man and all this had perplexed him;--so that he had\r\nobtained leave from his State and from Congress to be absent during\r\na part of a short Session, and had come over determined to learn as\r\nmuch as he could. Everything he heard and almost everything he saw\r\noffended him at some point. And, yet in the midst of it all, he was\r\nconscious that he was surrounded by people who claimed and made good\r\ntheir claims to superiority. What was a lord, let him be ever so rich\r\nand have ever so many titles? And yet, even with such a popinjay as\r\nLord Rufford, he himself felt the lordship. When that old farmer at\r\nthe hunt breakfast had removed himself and his belongings to the\r\nother side of the table the Senator, though aware of the justice of\r\nhis cause, had been keenly alive to the rebuke. He had expressed\r\nhimself very boldly at the rector\'s house at Dillsborough, and had\r\nbeen certain that not a word of real argument had been possible\r\nin answer to him. But yet he left the house with a feeling almost\r\nof shame, which had grown into real penitence before he reached\r\nBragton. He knew that he had already been condemned by Englishmen as\r\nill-mannered, ill-conditioned and absurd. He was as much alive as any\r\nman to the inward distress of heart which such a conviction brings\r\nwith it to all sensitive minds. And yet he had his purpose and would\r\nfollow it out. He was already hard at work on the lecture which he\r\nmeant to deliver somewhere in London before he went back to his home\r\nduties, and had made it known to the world at large that he meant to\r\nsay some sharp things of the country he was visiting.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return to town he was present at the opening of\r\nParliament, Mr. Mounser Green of the Foreign Office having seen\r\nthat he was properly accommodated with a seat. Then he went down\r\nto the election of a member of Parliament in the little borough of\r\nQuinborough. It was unfortunate for Great Britain, which was on its\r\ntrial, and unpleasant also for the poor Senator who had appointed\r\nhimself judge, that such a seat should have fallen vacant at that\r\nmoment. Quinborough was a little town of 3,000 inhabitants clustering\r\nround the gates of a great Whig Marquis, which had been spared,--who\r\ncan say why?--at the first Reform Bill, and having but one member\r\nhad come out scatheless from the second. Quinborough still returned\r\nits one member with something less than 500 constituents, and in\r\nspite of household suffrage and the ballot had always returned the\r\nmember favoured by the Marquis. This nobleman, driven no doubt by\r\nhis conscience to make some return to the country for the favour\r\nshown to his family, had always sent to Parliament some useful and\r\ndistinguished man who without such patronage might have been unable\r\nto serve his country. On the present occasion a friend of the\r\npeople,--so called,--an unlettered demagogue such as is in England\r\nin truth distasteful to all classes, had taken himself down to\r\nQuinborough as a candidate in opposition to the nobleman\'s nominee.\r\nHe had been backed by all the sympathies of the American Senator who\r\nknew nothing of him or his unfitness, and nothing whatever of the\r\npatriotism of the Marquis. But he did know what was the population\r\nand what the constituency of Liverpool, and also what were those\r\nof Quinborough. He supposed that he knew what was the theory of\r\nrepresentation in England, and he understood correctly that hitherto\r\nthe member for Quinborough had been the nominee of that great\r\nlord. These things were horrid to him. There was to his thinking a\r\nfiction,--more than fiction, a falseness,--about all this which not\r\nonly would but ought to bring the country prostrate to the dust. When\r\nthe working-man\'s candidate, whose political programme consisted of a\r\ngeneral disbelief in all religions, received--by ballot!--only nine\r\nvotes from those 500 voters, the Senator declared to himself that the\r\ncountry must be rotten to the core. It was not only that Britons were\r\nslaves,--but that they "hugged their chains." To the gentleman who\r\nassured him that the Right Honble. ---- ---- would make a much better\r\nmember of Parliament than Tom Bobster the plasterer from Shoreditch\r\nhe in vain tried to prove that the respective merits of the two men\r\nhad nothing to do with the question. It had been the duty of those\r\n500 voters to show to the world that in the exercise of a privilege\r\nentrusted to them for the public service they had not been under the\r\ndictation of their rich neighbour. Instead of doing so they had,\r\nalmost unanimously, grovelled in the dust at their rich neighbour\'s\r\nfeet. "There are but one or two such places left in all England,"\r\nsaid the gentleman. "But those one or two," answered the Senator,\r\n"were wilfully left there by the Parliament which represented the\r\nwhole nation."\r\n\r\nThen, quite early in the Session, immediately after the voting of\r\nthe address, a motion had been made by the Government of the day for\r\nintroducing household suffrage into the counties. No one knew the\r\nlabour to which the Senator subjected himself in order that he might\r\nmaster all these peculiarities,--that he might learn how men became\r\nmembers of Parliament, and how they ceased to be so, in what degree\r\nthe House of Commons was made up of different elements, how it came\r\nto pass, that though there was a House of Lords, so many lords sat\r\nin the lower chamber. All those matters which to ordinary educated\r\nEnglishmen are almost as common as the breath of their nostrils,\r\nhad been to him matter of long and serious study. And as the\r\nintent student, who has zealously buried himself for a week among\r\ncommentaries and notes, feels himself qualified to question Porson\r\nand to Be-Bentley Bentley, so did our Senator believe, while still\r\nhe was groping among the rudiments, that he had all our political\r\nintricacies at his fingers\' ends. When he heard the arguments\r\nused for a difference of suffrage in the towns and counties,\r\nand found that even they who were proposing the change were not\r\nready absolutely to assimilate the two and still held that rural\r\nascendancy,--feudalism as he called it,--should maintain itself by\r\nbarring a fraction of the House of Commons from the votes of the\r\nmajority, he pronounced the whole thing to be a sham. The intention\r\nwas, he said, to delude the people. "It is all coming," said the\r\ngentleman who was accustomed to argue with him in those days. He\r\nspoke in a sad vein, which was in itself distressing to the Senator.\r\n"Why should you be in such a hurry?" The Senator suggested that if\r\nthe country delayed much longer this imperative task of putting its\r\nhouse in order, the roof would have fallen in before the repairs were\r\ndone. Then he found that this gentleman too, avoided his company,\r\nand declined to sit with him any more in the Gallery of the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nAdded to all this was a private rankling sore in regard to Goarly\r\nand Bearside. He had now learned nearly all the truth about Goarly,\r\nand had learned also that Bearside had known the whole when he had\r\nlast visited that eminent lawyer\'s office. Goarly had deserted his\r\nsupporters and had turned evidence against Scrobby, his partner in\r\niniquity. That Goarly was a rascal the Senator had acknowledged.\r\nSo far the general opinion down in Rufford had been correct. But\r\nhe could get nobody to see,--or at any rate could get nobody to\r\nacknowledge,--that the rascality of Goarly had had nothing to do\r\nwith the question as he had taken it up. The man\'s right to his own\r\nland,--his right to be protected from pheasants and foxes, from\r\nhorses and hounds,--was not lessened by the fact that he was a poor\r\nignorant squalid dishonest wretch. Mr. Gotobed had now received a\r\nbill from Bearside for L42 7_s._ 9_d._ for costs in the case, leaving\r\nafter the deduction of L15 already paid a sum of L27 7_s._ 9_d._\r\nstated to be still due. And this was accompanied by an intimation\r\nthat as he, Mr. Gotobed, was a foreigner soon about to leave the\r\ncountry, Mr. Bearside must request that his claim might be settled\r\nquite at once. No one could be less likely than our Senator to leave\r\na foreign country without paying his bills. He had quarrelled with\r\nMorton,--who also at this time was too ill to have given him much\r\nassistance. Though he had become acquainted with half Dillsborough,\r\nthere was nobody there to whom he could apply. Thus he was driven to\r\nemploy a London attorney, and the London attorney told him that he\r\nhad better pay Bearside;--the Senator remembering at the time that\r\nhe would also have to pay the London attorney for his advice. He\r\ngave this second lawyer authority to conclude the matter, and at\r\nlast Bearside accepted L20. When the London attorney refused to take\r\nanything for his trouble, the Senator felt such conduct almost as an\r\nadditional grievance. In his existing frame of mind he would sooner\r\nhave expended a few more dollars than be driven to think well of\r\nanything connected with English law.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately after he had handed over the money in liquidation\r\nof Bearside\'s claim that he sat down to write a further letter to his\r\nfriend and correspondent Josiah Scroome. His letter was not written\r\nin the best of tempers; but still, through it all, there was a desire\r\nto be just, and an anxiety to abstain from the use of hard phrases.\r\nThe letter was as follows;--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Fenton\'s Hotel, St. James\' Street, London,\r\n   Feb. 12, 187--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   Since I last wrote I have had much to trouble me and\r\n   little perhaps to compensate me for my trouble. I told\r\n   you, I think, in one of my former letters that wherever I\r\n   went I found myself able to say what I pleased as to the\r\n   peculiarities of this very peculiar people. I am not now\r\n   going to contradict what I said then. Wherever I go I do\r\n   speak out, and my eyes are still in my head and my head\r\n   is on my shoulders. But I have to acknowledge to myself\r\n   that I give offence. Mr. Morton, whom you knew at the\r\n   British Embassy in Washington,--and who I fear is now\r\n   very ill,--parted from me, when last I saw him, in\r\n   anger because of certain opinions I had expressed in a\r\n   clergyman\'s house, not as being ill-founded but as being\r\n   antagonistic to the clergyman himself. This I feel to be\r\n   unreasonable. And in the neighbourhood of Mr. Morton\'s\r\n   house, I have encountered the ill will of a great\r\n   many,--not for having spoken untruth, for that I have\r\n   never heard alleged,--but because I have not been reticent\r\n   in describing the things which I have seen.\r\n\r\n   I told you, I think, that I had returned to Mr. Morton\'s\r\n   neighbourhood with the view of defending an oppressed\r\n   man against the power of the lord who was oppressing him.\r\n   Unfortunately for me the lord, though a scapegrace, spends\r\n   his money freely and is a hospitable kindly-hearted honest\r\n   fellow; whereas the injured victim has turned out to be a\r\n   wretched scoundrel. Scoundrel though he is, he has still\r\n   been ill used; and the lord, though good-natured, has\r\n   been a tyrant. But the poor wretch has thrown me over and\r\n   sold himself to the other side and I have been held up to\r\n   ignominy by all the provincial newspapers. I have also had\r\n   to pay through the nose $175 for my quixotism--a sum which\r\n   I cannot very well afford. This money I have lost solely\r\n   with the view of defending the weak, but nobody with whom\r\n   I have discussed the matter seems to recognise the purity\r\n   of my object. I am only reminded that I have put myself\r\n   into the same boat with a rascal.\r\n\r\n   I feel from day to day how thoroughly I could have enjoyed\r\n   a sojourn in this country if I had come here without any\r\n   line of duty laid down for myself. Could I have swum with\r\n   the stream and have said yes or no as yes or no were\r\n   expected, I might have revelled in generous hospitality.\r\n   Nothing can be pleasanter than the houses here if you will\r\n   only be as idle as the owners of them. But when once you\r\n   show them that you have an object, they become afraid\r\n   of you. And industry,--in such houses as I now speak\r\n   of,--is a crime. You are there to glide through the\r\n   day luxuriously in the house,--or to rush through it\r\n   impetuously on horseback or with a gun if you be a\r\n   sportsman. Sometimes, when I have asked questions about\r\n   the most material institutions of the country, I have felt\r\n   that I was looked upon with absolute loathing. This is\r\n   disagreeable.\r\n\r\n   And yet I find it more easy in this country to sympathise\r\n   with the rich than with the poor. I do not here describe\r\n   my own actual sympathies, but only the easiness with which\r\n   they might be evoked. The rich are at any rate pleasant.\r\n   The poor are very much the reverse. There is no backbone\r\n   of mutiny in them against the oppression to which they are\r\n   subjected; but only the whining of a dog that knows itself\r\n   to be a slave and pleads with his soft paw for tenderness\r\n   from his master;--or the futile growlings of the caged\r\n   tiger who paces up and down before his bars and has\r\n   long ago forgotten to attempt to break them. They are a\r\n   long-suffering race, who only now and then feel themselves\r\n   stirred up to contest a point against their masters on the\r\n   basis of starvation. "We won\'t work but on such and such\r\n   terms, and, if we cannot get them, we will lie down and\r\n   die." That I take it is the real argument of a strike. But\r\n   they never do lie down and die. If one in every parish,\r\n   one in every county, would do so, then the agricultural\r\n   labourers of the country might live almost as well as the\r\n   farmers\' pigs.\r\n\r\n   I was present the other day at the opening of Parliament.\r\n   It was a very grand ceremony,--though the Queen did not\r\n   find herself well enough to do her duty in person. But the\r\n   grandeur was everything. A royal programme was read from\r\n   the foot of the throne, of which even I knew all the\r\n   details beforehand, having read them in the newspapers.\r\n   Two opening speeches were then made by two young\r\n   lords,--not after all so very young,--which sounded like\r\n   lessons recited by schoolboys. There was no touch of\r\n   eloquence,--no approach to it. It was clear that either of\r\n   them would have been afraid to attempt the idiosyncrasy of\r\n   passionate expression. But they were exquisitely dressed\r\n   and had learned their lessons to a marvel. The flutter of\r\n   the ladies\' dresses, and the presence of the peers, and\r\n   the historic ornamentation of the house were all very\r\n   pleasant;--but they reminded me of a last year\'s nut,\r\n   of which the outside appearance has been mellowed and\r\n   improved by time,--but the fruit inside has withered away\r\n   and become tasteless.\r\n\r\n   Since that I have been much interested with an attempt,--a\r\n   further morsel of cobbling,--which is being done to\r\n   improve the representation of the people. Though it be\r\n   but cobbling, if it be in the right direction one is glad\r\n   of it. I do not know how far you may have studied the\r\n   theories and system of the British House of Commons, but,\r\n   for myself, I must own that it was not till the other day\r\n   that I was aware that, though it acts together as one\r\n   whole, it is formed of two distinct parts. The one part\r\n   is sent thither from the towns by household suffrage; and,\r\n   this, which may be said to be the healthier of the two\r\n   as coming more directly from the people, is nevertheless\r\n   disfigured by a multitude of anomalies. Population hardly\r\n   bears upon the question. A town with 15,000 inhabitants\r\n   has two members,--whereas another with 400,000 has only\r\n   three, and another with 50,000 has one. But there is\r\n   worse disorder than this. In the happy little village\r\n   of Portarlington 200 constituents choose a member among\r\n   them, or have one chosen for them by their careful\r\n   lord;--whereas in the great city of London something like\r\n   25,000 registered electors only send four to Parliament.\r\n   With this the country is presumed to be satisfied. But\r\n   in the counties, which by a different system send up\r\n   the other part of the House, there exists still a heavy\r\n   property qualification for voting. There is, apparent to\r\n   all, a necessity for change here;--but the change proposed\r\n   is simply a reduction of the qualification, so that\r\n   the rural labourer,--whose class is probably the\r\n   largest, as it is the poorest, in the country,--is still\r\n   disfranchised, and will remain so, unless it be his chance\r\n   to live within the arbitrary line of some so-called\r\n   borough. For these boroughs, you must know, are sometimes\r\n   strictly confined to the aggregations of houses which\r\n   constitute the town, but sometimes stretch out their arms\r\n   so as to include rural districts. The divisions I am\r\n   assured were made to suit the aspirations of political\r\n   magnates when the first Reform Bill was passed! What is\r\n   to be expected of a country in which such absurdities are\r\n   loved and sheltered?\r\n\r\n   I am still determined to express my views on these matters\r\n   before I leave England, and am with great labour preparing\r\n   a lecture on the subject. I am assured that I shall not\r\n   be debarred from my utterances because that which I say\r\n   is unpopular. I am told that as long as I do not touch\r\n   Her Majesty or Her Majesty\'s family, or the Christian\r\n   religion,--which is only the second Holy of Holies,--I may\r\n   say anything. Good taste would save me from the former\r\n   offence, and my own convictions from the latter. But my\r\n   friend who so informs me doubts whether many will come\r\n   to hear me. He tells me that the serious American is not\r\n   popular here, whereas the joker is much run after. Of\r\n   that I must take my chance. In all this I am endeavouring\r\n   to do a duty,--feeling every day more strongly my own\r\n   inadequacy. Were I to follow my own wishes I should return\r\n   by the next steamer to my duties at home.\r\n\r\n   Believe me to be,\r\n   Dear Sir,\r\n   With much sincerity,\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n\r\n   ELIAS GOTOBED.\r\n\r\n   The Honble. Josiah Scroome,\r\n   125 Q Street,\r\n   Minnesota Avenue,\r\n   Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE INTERFERES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle was carried on very fiercely in Mr. Masters\' house in\r\nDillsborough, to the misery of all within it; but the conviction\r\ngained ground with every one there that Mary was to be sent to\r\nCheltenham for some indefinite time. Dolly and Kate seemed to think\r\nthat she was to go, never to return. Six months, which had been\r\nvaguely mentioned as the proposed period of her sojourn, was to them\r\nalmost as indefinite as eternity. The two girls had been intensely\r\nanxious for the marriage, wishing to have Larry for a brother,\r\nlooking forward with delight to their share in the unrestricted\r\nplenteousness of Chowton Farm, longing to be allowed to consider\r\nthemselves at home among the ricks and barns and wide fields; but\r\nat this moment things had become so tragic that they were cowed and\r\nunhappy,--not that Mary should still refuse Larry Twentyman, but that\r\nshe should be going away for so long a time. They could quarrel with\r\ntheir elder sister while the assurance was still with them that she\r\nwould be there to forgive them;--but now that she was going away and\r\nthat it had come to be believed by both of them that poor Lawrence\r\nhad no chance, they were sad and downhearted. In all that misery\r\nthe poor attorney had the worst of it. Mary was free from her\r\nstepmother\'s zeal and her stepmother\'s persecution at any rate at\r\nnight;--but the poor father was hardly allowed to sleep. For Mrs.\r\nMasters never gave up her game as altogether lost. Though she might\r\nbe driven alternately into towering passion and prostrate hysterics,\r\nshe would still come again to the battle. A word of encouragement\r\nwould, she said, bring Larry Twentyman back to his courtship,\r\nand that word might be spoken, if Mary\'s visit to Cheltenham\r\nwere forbidden. What did the letter signify, or all the girl\'s\r\nprotestations? Did not everybody know how self-willed young women\r\nwere; but how they could be brought round by proper usage? Let Mary\r\nonce be made to understand that she would not be allowed to be a fine\r\nlady, and then she would marry Mr. Twentyman quick enough. But this\r\n"Ushanting," this journeying to Cheltenham in order that nothing\r\nmight be done, was the very way to promote the disease! This Mrs.\r\nMasters said in season and out of season, night and day, till the\r\npoor husband longed for his daughter\'s departure, in order that that\r\npoint might at any rate be settled. In all these disputes he never\r\nquite yielded. Though his heart sank within him he was still firm. He\r\nwould turn his back to his wife and let her run on with her arguments\r\nwithout a word of answer,--till at last he would bounce out of bed\r\nand swear that if she did not leave him alone he would go and lock\r\nhimself into the office and sleep with his head on the office desk.\r\n\r\nMrs. Masters was almost driven to despair;--but at last there came to\r\nher a gleam of hope, most unexpectedly. It had been settled that Mary\r\nshould make her journey on Friday the 12th February and that Reginald\r\nMorton was again to accompany her. This in itself was to Mrs. Masters\r\nan aggravation of the evil which was being done. She was not in\r\nthe least afraid of Reginald Morton; but this attendance on Mary\r\nwas in the eyes of her stepmother a cockering of her up, a making\r\na fine lady of her, which was in itself of all things the most\r\npernicious. If Mary must go to Cheltenham, why could she not go by\r\nherself, second class, like any other young woman? "Nobody would eat\r\nher,"--Mrs. Masters declared. But Reginald was firm in his purpose of\r\naccompanying her. He had no objection whatever to the second class,\r\nif Mr. Masters preferred it. But as he meant to make the journey on\r\nthe same day of course they would go together. Mr. Masters said that\r\nhe was very much obliged. Mrs. Masters protested that it was all\r\ntrash from beginning to the end.\r\n\r\nThen there came a sudden disruption to all these plans, and a sudden\r\nrenewal of her hopes to Mrs. Masters which for one half day nearly\r\nrestored her to good humour. Lady Ushant wrote to postpone the visit\r\nbecause she herself had been summoned to Bragton. Her letter to Mary,\r\nthough affectionate, was very short. Her grand-nephew John, the head\r\nof the family, had expressed a desire to see her, and with that wish\r\nshe was bound to comply. Of course, she said, she would see Mary at\r\nBragton; or if that were not possible, she herself would come into\r\nDillsborough. She did not know what might be the length of her visit,\r\nbut when it was over she hoped that Mary would return with her to\r\nCheltenham. The old lady\'s letter to Reginald was much longer;\r\nbecause in that she had to speak of the state of John Morton\'s\r\nhealth,--and of her surprise that she should be summoned to his\r\nbedside. Of course she would go,--though she could not look forward\r\nwith satisfaction to a meeting with the Honble. Mrs. Morton. Then she\r\ncould not refrain from alluding to the fact that if "anything were\r\nto happen" to John Morton, Reginald himself would be the Squire\r\nof Bragton. Reginald when he received this at once went over to\r\nthe attorney\'s house, but he did not succeed in seeing Mary. He\r\nlearned, however, that they were all aware that the journey had been\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Masters it seemed that all this had been a dispensation of\r\nProvidence. Lady Ushant\'s letter had been received on the Thursday\r\nand Mrs. Masters at once found it expedient to communicate with Larry\r\nTwentyman. She was not excellent herself at the writing of letters,\r\nand therefore she got Dolly to be the scribe. Before the Thursday\r\nevening the following note was sent to Chowton Farm;\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR LARRY,\r\n\r\n   Pray come and go to the club with father on Saturday. We\r\n   haven\'t seen you for so long! Mother has got something to\r\n   tell you.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n   DOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this was received the poor man was smoking his moody pipe in\r\nsilence as he roamed about his own farmyard in the darkness of the\r\nnight. He had not as yet known any comfort and was still firm in his\r\npurpose of selling the farm. He had been out hunting once or twice\r\nbut fancied that people looked at him with peculiar eyes. He could\r\nnot ride, though he made one or two forlorn attempts to break his\r\nneck. He did not care in the least whether they found or not; and\r\nwhen Captain Glomax was held to have disgraced himself thoroughly by\r\nwasting an hour in digging out and then killing a vixen, he had not a\r\nword to say about it. But, as he read Dolly\'s note, there came back\r\nsomething of life into his eyes. He had forsworn the club, but would\r\ncertainly go when thus invited. He wrote a scrawl to Dolly,--"I\'ll\r\ncome," and, having sent it off by the messenger, tried to trust that\r\nthere might yet be ground for hope. Mrs. Masters would not have\r\nallowed Dolly to send such a message without good reason.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday Mrs. Masters could not abstain from proposing that\r\nMary\'s visit to Cheltenham should be regarded as altogether out of\r\nthe question. She had no new argument to offer,--except this last\r\ninterposition of Providence in her favour. Mr. Masters said that he\r\ndid not see why Mary should not return with Lady Ushant. Various\r\nthings, however, might happen. John Morton might die, and then who\r\ncould tell whether Lady Ushant would ever return to Cheltenham? In\r\nthis way the short-lived peace soon came to an end, especially as\r\nMrs. Masters endeavoured to utilize for general family purposes\r\ncertain articles which had been purchased with a view to Mary\'s\r\nprolonged residence away from home. This was resented by the\r\nattorney, and the peace was short-lived.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday Larry came,--to the astonishment of Mr. Masters, who\r\nwas still in his office at half-past seven. Mrs. Masters at once got\r\nhold of him and conveyed him away into the sacred drawing-room. "Mary\r\nis not going," she said.\r\n\r\n"Not going to Cheltenham!"\r\n\r\n"It has all been put off. She shan\'t go at all if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"But why has it been put off, Mrs. Masters?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Ushant is coming to Bragton. I suppose that poor man is dying."\r\n\r\n"He is very ill certainly."\r\n\r\n"And if anything happens there who can say what may happen anywhere\r\nelse? Lady Ushant will have something else except Mary to think of,\r\nif her own nephew comes into all the property."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know she was such friends with the Squire as that."\r\n\r\n"Well;--there it is. Lady Ushant is coming to Bragton and Mary is not\r\ngoing to Cheltenham."\r\n\r\nThis she said as though the news must be of vital importance to Larry\r\nTwentyman. He stood for awhile scratching his head as he thought of\r\nit. At last it appeared to him that Mary\'s continual residence in\r\nDillsborough would of itself hardly assist him. "I don\'t see, Mrs.\r\nMasters, that that will make her a bit kinder to me.\'\r\n\r\n"Larry, don\'t you be a coward,--nor yet soft."\r\n\r\n"As for coward, Mrs. Masters, I don\'t know--"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you really do love the girl."\r\n\r\n"I do;--I think I\'ve shown that."\r\n\r\n"And you haven\'t changed your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I speak open to you. Don\'t you be afraid of her. What\'s\r\nthe letter which a girl like that writes? When she gets tantrums into\r\nher head of course she\'ll write a letter."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s somebody else, Mrs. Masters."\r\n\r\n"Who says so? I say there ain\'t nobody;--nobody. If anybody tells you\r\nthat it\'s only just to put you off. It\'s just poetry and books and\r\nrubbish. She wants to be a fine lady."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make her a lady."\r\n\r\n"You make her Mrs. Twentyman, and don\'t you be made by any one to\r\ngive it up. Go to the club with Mr. Masters now, and come here just\r\nthe same as usual. Come to-morrow and have a gossip with the girls\r\ntogether and show that you can keep your pluck up. That\'s the way\r\nto win her." Larry did go to the club and did think very much of it\r\nas he walked home. He had promised to come on the Sunday afternoon,\r\nbut he could not bring himself to believe in that theory of books\r\nand poetry put forward by Mrs. Masters. Books and poetry would not\r\nteach a girl like Mary to reject her suitor if she really loved him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nLADY USHANT AT BRAGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday Larry came into Dillsborough and had "his gossip with\r\nthe girls" according to order;--but it was not very successful. Mrs.\r\nMasters who opened the door for him instructed him in a special\r\nwhisper "to talk away just as though he did not care a fig for Mary."\r\nHe made the attempt manfully,--but with slight effect. His love was\r\ntoo genuine, too absorbing, to leave with him the power which Mrs.\r\nMasters assumed him to have when she gave him such advice. A man\r\ncannot walk when he has broken his ankle-bone, let him be ever so\r\nbrave in the attempt. Larry\'s heart was so weighed that he could not\r\nhide the weight. Dolly and Kate had also received hints and struggled\r\nhard to be merry. In the afternoon a walk was suggested, and Mary\r\ncomplied; but when an attempt was made by the younger girls to leave\r\nthe lover and Mary together, she resented it by clinging closely to\r\nDolly;--and then all Larry\'s courage deserted him. Very little good\r\nwas done on the occasion by Mrs. Masters\' manoeuvres.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning, in compliance with a request made by Lady\r\nUshant, Mary walked over to Bragton to see her old friend. Mrs.\r\nMasters had declared the request to be very unreasonable. "Who is to\r\nwalk five miles and back to see an old woman like that?" To this Mary\r\nhad replied that the distance across the fields to Bragton was only\r\nfour miles and that she had often walked it with her sisters for\r\nthe very pleasure of the walk. "Not in weather like this," said Mrs.\r\nMasters. But the day was well enough. Roads in February are often a\r\nlittle wet, but there was no rain falling. "I say it\'s unreasonable,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Masters. "If she can\'t send a carriage she oughtn\'t to\r\nexpect it." This coming from Mrs. Masters, whose great doctrine it\r\nwas that young women ought not to be afraid of work, was so clearly\r\nthe effect of sheer opposition that Mary disdained to answer it. Then\r\nshe was accused of treating her stepmother with contempt.\r\n\r\nShe did walk to Bragton, taking the path by the fields and over the\r\nbridge, and loitering for a few minutes as she leant upon the rail.\r\nIt was there and there only that she had seen together the two men\r\nwho between them seemed to cloud all her life,--the man whom she\r\nloved and the man who loved her. She knew now,--she thought that she\r\nknew quite well,--that her feelings for Reginald Morton were of such\r\na nature that she could not possibly become the wife of any one else.\r\nBut had she not seen him for those few minutes on this spot, had he\r\nnot fired her imagination by telling her of his desire to go back\r\nwith her over the sites which they had seen together when she was\r\na child, she would not, she thought, have been driven to make to\r\nherself so grievous a confession. In that case it might have been\r\nthat she would have brought herself to give her hand to the suitor of\r\nwhom all her friends approved.\r\n\r\nAnd then with infinite tenderness she thought of all Larry\'s\r\nvirtues,--and especially of that great virtue in a woman\'s eyes, the\r\nconstancy of his devotion to herself. She did love him,--but with a\r\nvaried love,--a love which was most earnest in wishing his happiness,\r\nwhich would have been desirous of the closest friendship if only\r\nnothing more were required. She swore to herself a thousand times\r\nthat she did not look down upon him because he was only a farmer,\r\nthat she did not think herself in any way superior to him. But it\r\nwas impossible that she should consent to be his wife. And then she\r\nthought of the other man,--with feelings much less kind. Why had he\r\nthrust himself upon her life and disturbed her? Why had he taught her\r\nto think herself unfit to mate with this lover who was her equal? Why\r\nhad he assured her that were she to do so her old friends would be\r\nrevolted? Why had he exacted from her a promise,--a promise which was\r\nsacred to her,--that she would not so give herself away? Yes;--the\r\npromise was certainly sacred; but he had been cold and cruel in\r\nforcing it from her lips. What business was it of his? Why should he\r\nhave meddled with her? In the shallow streamlet of her lowly life the\r\nwaters might have glided on, slow but smoothly, had he not taught\r\nthem to be ambitious of a rapider, grander course. Now they were\r\ndisturbed by mud, and there could be no pleasure in them.\r\n\r\nShe went on over the bridge, and round by the shrubbery to the hall\r\ndoor which was opened to her by Mrs. Hopkins. Yes, Lady Ushant was\r\nthere;--but the young Squire was very ill and his aunt was then with\r\nhim. Mr. Reginald was in the library. Would Miss Masters be shown in\r\nthere, or would she go up to Lady Ushant\'s own room? Of course she\r\nreplied that she would go up-stairs and there wait for Lady Ushant.\r\n\r\nWhen she was found by her friend she was told at length the story\r\nof all the circumstances which had brought Lady Ushant to Bragton.\r\nWhen John Morton had first been taken ill,--before any fixed idea of\r\ndanger had occurred to himself or to others,--his grandmother had\r\ncome to him. Then, as he gradually became weaker he made various\r\npropositions which were all of them terribly distasteful to the\r\nold woman. In the first place he had insisted on sending for Miss\r\nTrefoil. Up to this period Mary Masters had hardly heard the name of\r\nMiss Trefoil, and almost shuddered as she was at once immersed in\r\nall these family secrets. "She is to be here to-morrow," said Lady\r\nUshant.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear,--how sad!"\r\n\r\n"He insists upon it, and she is coming. She was here before, and it\r\nnow turns out that all the world knew that they were engaged. That\r\nwas no secret, for everybody had heard it."\r\n\r\n"And where is Mrs. Morton now?" Then Lady Ushant went on with her\r\nstory. The sick man had insisted on making his will and had declared\r\nhis purpose of leaving the property to his cousin Reginald. As Lady\r\nUshant said, there was no one else to whom he could leave it with any\r\npropriety;--but this had become matter for bitter contention between\r\nthe old woman and her grandson.\r\n\r\n"Who did she think should have it?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that I don\'t know. That he has never told me. But she has had\r\nthe wickedness to say,--oh,--such things of Reginald. I knew all that\r\nbefore;--but that she should repeat them now is terrible. I suppose\r\nshe wanted it for some of her own people. But it was so horrible you\r\nknow,--when he was so ill! Then he said that he should send for me,\r\nso that what is left of the family might be together. After that she\r\nwent away in anger. Mrs. Hopkins says that she did not even see him\r\nthe morning she left Bragton."\r\n\r\n"She was always high-tempered," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"And dictatorial beyond measure. She nearly broke my poor dear\r\nfather\'s heart. And then she left the house because he would not shut\r\nhis doors against Reginald\'s mother. And now I hardly know what I\r\nam to do here, or what I must say to this young lady when she comes\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Is she coming alone?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t know. She has a mother, Lady Augustus Trefoil,--but whether\r\nLady Augustus will accompany her daughter we have not heard. Reginald\r\nsays certainly not, or they would have told us so. You have seen\r\nReginald?"\r\n\r\n"No, Lady Ushant."\r\n\r\n"You must see him. He is here now. Think what a difference it will\r\nmake to him."\r\n\r\n"But Lady Ushant,--is he so bad?"\r\n\r\n"Dr. Fanning almost says that there is no hope. This poor young woman\r\nthat is coming;--what am I to say to her? He has made his will. That\r\nwas done before I came. I don\'t know why he shouldn\'t have sent for\r\nyour father, but he had a gentleman down from town. I suppose he will\r\nleave her something; but it is a great thing that Bragton should\r\nremain in the family. Oh dear, oh dear,--if any one but a Morton were\r\nto be here it would break my heart. Reginald is the only one left now\r\nof the old branch. He\'s getting old and he ought to marry. It is so\r\nserious when there\'s an old family property."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he will--only--"\r\n\r\n"Yes; exactly. One can\'t even think about it while this poor young\r\nman is lying so ill. Mrs. Morton has been almost like his mother, and\r\nhas lived upon the Bragton property,--absolutely lived upon it,--and\r\nnow she is away from him because he chooses to do what he likes with\r\nhis own. Is it not awful? And she would not put her foot in the house\r\nif she knew that Reginald was here. She told Mrs. Hopkins as much,\r\nand she said that she wouldn\'t so much as write a line to me. Poor\r\nfellow; he wrote it himself. And now he thinks so much about it.\r\nWhen Dr. Fanning went back to London yesterday I think he took some\r\nmessage to her."\r\n\r\nMary remained there till lunch was announced but refused to go down\r\ninto the parlour, urging that she was expected home for dinner. "And\r\nthere is no chance for Mr. Twentyman?" asked Lady Ushant. Mary shook\r\nher head. "Poor man! I do feel sorry for him as everybody speaks\r\nso well of him. Of course, my dear, I have nothing to say about it.\r\nI don\'t think girls should ever be in a hurry to marry, and if you\r\ncan\'t love him--"\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Ushant, it is quite settled."\r\n\r\n"Poor young man! But you must go and see Reginald." Then she was\r\ntaken into the library and did see Reginald. Were she to avoid\r\nhim,--specially,--she would tell her tale almost as plainly as\r\nthough she were to run after him. He greeted her kindly, almost\r\naffectionately, expressing his extreme regret that his visit to\r\nCheltenham should have been postponed and a hope that she would be\r\nmuch at Bragton. "The distance is so great, Reginald," said Lady\r\nUshant.\r\n\r\n"I can drive her over. It is a long walk, and I had made up my mind\r\nto get Runciman\'s little phaeton. I shall order it for to-morrow if\r\nMiss Masters will come." But Miss Masters would not agree to this.\r\nShe would walk over again some day as she liked the walk, but no\r\ndoubt she would only be in the way if she were to come often.\r\n\r\n"I have told her about Miss Trefoil," said Lady Ushant. "You know, my\r\ndear, I look upon you almost as one of ourselves because you lived\r\nhere so long. But perhaps you had better postpone coming again till\r\nshe has gone."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Lady Ushant."\r\n\r\n"It might be difficult to explain. I don\'t suppose she will stay\r\nlong. Perhaps she will go back the same day. I am sure I shan\'t know\r\nwhat to say to her. But when anything is fixed I will send you in\r\nword by the postman."\r\n\r\nReginald would have walked back with her across the bridge but that\r\nhe had promised to go to his cousin immediately after lunch. As it\r\nwas he offered to accompany her a part of the way, but was stopped by\r\nhis aunt, greatly to Mary\'s comfort. He was now more beyond her reach\r\nthan ever,--more utterly removed from her. He would probably become\r\nSquire of Bragton, and she, in her earliest days, had heard the\r\nlate Squire spoken of as though he were one of the potentates of\r\nthe earth. She had never thought it possible; but now it was less\r\npossible than ever. There was something in his manner to her almost\r\nprotective, almost fatherly,--as though he had some authority over\r\nher. Lady Ushant had authority once, but he had none. In every tone\r\nof his voice she felt that she heard an expression of interest in her\r\nwelfare,--but it was the interest which a grown-up person takes in a\r\nchild, or a superior in an inferior. Of course he was her superior,\r\nbut yet the tone of his voice was distasteful to her. As she walked\r\nback to Dillsborough she told herself that she would not go again to\r\nBragton without assuring herself that he was not there.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached home many questions were asked of her, but she told\r\nnothing of the secrets of the Morton family which had been so openly\r\nconfided to her. She would only say that she was afraid that Mr. John\r\nMorton was very ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nARABELLA AGAIN AT BRAGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabella Trefoil had adhered without flinching to the purpose she had\r\nexpressed of going down to Bragton to see the sick man. And yet at\r\nthat very time she was in the midst of her contest with Lord Rufford.\r\nShe was aware that a correspondence was going on between her father\r\nand the young lord and that her father had demanded an interview.\r\nShe was aware also that the matter had been discussed at the family\r\nmansion in Piccadilly, the Duke having come up to London for the\r\npurpose, and that the Duke and his brother, who hardly ever spoke to\r\neach other, had absolutely had a conference. And this conference had\r\nhad results. The Duke had not himself consented to interfere, but he\r\nhad agreed to a compromise proposed by his son. Lord Augustus should\r\nbe authorised to ask Lord Rufford to meet him in the library of the\r\nPiccadilly mansion,--so that there should be some savour of the\r\ndukedom in what might be done and said there. Lord Rufford would\r\nby the surroundings be made to feel that in rejecting Arabella he\r\nwas rejecting the Duke and all the Mayfair belongings, and that in\r\naccepting her he would be entitled to regard himself as accepting\r\nthem all. But by allowing thus much the Duke would not compromise\r\nhimself,--nor the Duchess, nor Lord Mistletoe. Lord Mistletoe, with\r\nthat prudence which will certainly in future years make him a useful\r\nassistant to some minister of the day, had seen all this, and so it\r\nhad been arranged.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of these doings, Arabella had insisted on complying\r\nwith John Morton\'s wish that she go down and visit him in his bed\r\nat Bragton. Her mother, who in these days was driven almost to\r\ndesperation by her daughter\'s conduct, tried her best to prevent the\r\nuseless journey, but tried in vain. "Then," she said in wrath to\r\nArabella, "I will tell your father, and I will tell the Duke, and\r\nI will tell Lord Rufford that they need not trouble themselves any\r\nfurther." "You know, mamma, that you will do nothing of the kind,"\r\nsaid Arabella. And the poor woman did do nothing of the kind. "What\r\nis it to them whether I see the man or not?" the girl said. "They are\r\nnot such fools as to suppose that because Lord Rufford has engaged\r\nhimself to me now I was never engaged to any one before. There isn\'t\r\none of them doesn\'t know that you had made up an engagement between\r\nus and had afterwards tried to break it off." When she heard this\r\nthe unfortunate mother raved, but she raved in vain. She told her\r\ndaughter that she would not supply her with money for the expenses\r\nof her journey, but her daughter replied that she would have no\r\ndifficulty in finding her way to a pawn shop. "What is to be got by\r\nit?" asked the unfortunate mother. In reply to this Arabella would\r\nsay, "Mamma, you have no heart;--absolutely none. You ought to\r\nmanoeuvre better than you do, for your feelings never stand in your\r\nway for a moment." All this had to be borne, and the old woman was\r\nforced at last not only to yield but to promise that she would\r\naccompany her daughter to Bragton. "I know how all this will end,"\r\nshe said to Arabella. "You will have to go your way and I must go\r\nmine." "Just so," replied the daughter. "I do not often agree with\r\nyou, mamma; but I do there altogether."\r\n\r\nLady Augustus was absolutely at a loss to understand what were the\r\nmotives and what the ideas which induced her daughter to take the\r\njourney. If the man were to die no good could come of it. If he\r\nwere to live then surely that love which had induced him to make\r\nso foolish a petition would suffice to ensure the marriage, if the\r\nmarriage should then be thought desirable. But, at the present\r\nmoment, Arabella was still hot in pursuit of Lord Rufford;--to whom\r\nthis journey, as soon as it should be known to him, would give the\r\neasiest mode of escape! How would it be possible that they two should\r\nget out at the Dillsborough Station and be taken to Bragton without\r\nall Rufford knowing it. Of course there would be hymns sung in praise\r\nof Arabella\'s love and constancy, but such hymns would be absolutely\r\nruinous to her. It was growing clear to Lady Augustus that her\r\ndaughter was giving up the game and becoming frantic as she thought\r\nof her age, her failure, and her future. If so it would be well that\r\nthey should separate.\r\n\r\nOn the day fixed a close carriage awaited them at the Dillsborough\r\nStation. They arrived both dressed in black and both veiled,--and\r\nwith but one maid between them. This arrangement had been made with\r\nsome vague idea of escaping scrutiny rather than from economy. They\r\nhad never hitherto been known to go anywhere without one apiece.\r\nThere were no airs on the station now as on that former occasion,--no\r\nloud talking; not even a word spoken. Lady Augustus was asking\r\nherself why,--why she should have been put into so lamentable a\r\nposition, and Arabella was endeavouring to think what she would say\r\nto the dying man.\r\n\r\nShe did think that he was dying. It was not the purport of her\r\npresent visit to strengthen her position by making certain of the\r\nman\'s hand should he live. When she said that she was not as yet\r\nquite so hard-hearted as her mother, she spoke the truth. Something\r\nof regret, something of penitence had at times crept over her in\r\nreference to her conduct to this man. He had been very unlike others\r\non whom she had played her arts. None of her lovers, or mock lovers,\r\nhad been serious and stern and uncomfortable as he. There had been\r\nno other who had ever attempted to earn his bread. To her the\r\nbutterflies of the world had been all in all, and the working bees\r\nhad been a tribe apart with which she was no more called upon to mix\r\nthan is my lady\'s spaniel with the kennel hounds. But the chance had\r\ncome. She had consented to exhibit her allurements before a man of\r\nbusiness and the man of business had at once sat at her feet. She\r\nhad soon repented,--as the reader has seen. The alliance had been\r\ndistasteful to her. She had found that the man\'s ways were in no wise\r\nlike her ways,--and she had found also that were she to become his\r\nwife, he certainly would not change. She had looked about for a means\r\nof escape,--but as she did so she had recognized the man\'s truth. No\r\ndoubt he had been different from the others, less gay in his attire,\r\nless jocund in his words, less given to flattery and sport and gems\r\nand all the little wickednesses which she had loved. But they,--those\r\nothers had, one and all, struggled to escape from her. Through all\r\nthe gems and mirth and flattery there had been the same purpose. They\r\nliked the softness of her hand, they liked the flutter of her silk,\r\nthey liked to have whispered in their ears the bold words of her\r\npractised raillery. Each liked for a month or two to be her special\r\nfriend. But then, after that, each had deserted her as had done the\r\none before; till in each new alliance she felt that such was to be\r\nher destiny, and that she was rolling a stone which would never\r\nsettle itself, straining for waters which would never come lip high.\r\nBut John Morton, after once saying that he loved her, had never\r\ntired, had never wished to escape. He had been so true to his love,\r\nso true to his word, that he had borne from her usage which would\r\nhave fully justified escape had escape been to his taste. But to the\r\nlast he had really loved her, and now, on his death bed, he had sent\r\nfor her to come to him. She would not be coward enough to refuse his\r\nrequest. "Should he say anything to you about his will don\'t refuse\r\nto hear him, because it may be of the greatest importance," Lady\r\nAugustus whispered to her daughter as the carriage was driven up to\r\nthe front door.\r\n\r\nIt was then four o\'clock, and it was understood that the two ladies\r\nwere to stay that one night at Bragton, a letter having been received\r\nby Lady Ushant that morning informing her that the mother as well\r\nas the daughter was coming. Poor Lady Ushant was almost beside\r\nherself,--not knowing what she would do with the two women, and\r\nhaving no one in the house to help her. Something she had heard of\r\nLady Augustus, but chiefly from Mrs. Hopkins who certainly had not\r\nadmired her master\'s future mother-in-law. Nor had Arabella been\r\npopular; but of her Mrs. Hopkins had only dared to say that she was\r\nvery handsome and "a little upstartish." How she was to spend the\r\nevening with them Lady Ushant could not conceive,--it having been\r\ndecided, in accordance with the doctor\'s orders, that the interview\r\nshould not take place till the next morning. When they were shown in\r\nLady Ushant stood just within the drawing-room door and muttered a\r\nfew words as she gave her hand to each. "How is he?" asked Arabella,\r\nthrowing up her veil boldly, as soon as the door was closed. Lady\r\nUshant only shook her head. "I knew it would be so. It is always so\r\nwith anything I care for."\r\n\r\n"She is so distressed, Lady Ushant," said the mother, "that she\r\nhardly knows what she does." Arabella shook her head. "It is so, Lady\r\nUshant."\r\n\r\n"Am I to go to him now?" said Arabella. Then the old lady explained\r\nthe doctor\'s orders, and offered to take them to their rooms.\r\n"Perhaps I might say a word to you alone? I will stay here if you\r\nwill go with mamma." And she did stay till Lady Ushant came down to\r\nher. "Do you mean to say it is certain," she asked,--"certain that he\r\nmust--die?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I do not say that."\r\n\r\n"It is possible that he may recover?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly it is possible. What is not possible with God?"\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that means that he will die." Then she sat herself down and\r\nalmost unconsciously took off her bonnet and laid it aside. Lady\r\nUshant, then looking into her face for the first time, was at a loss\r\nto understand what she had heard of her beauty. Could it be the same\r\ngirl of whom Mrs. Hopkins had spoken and of whose brilliant beauty\r\nReginald had repeated what he had heard? She was haggard, almost old,\r\nwith black lines round her eyes. There was nothing soft or gracious\r\nin the tresses of her hair. When Lady Ushant had been young men\r\nhad liked hair such as was that of Mary Masters. Arabella\'s yellow\r\nlocks,--whencesoever they might have come,--were rough and uncombed.\r\nBut it was the look of age, and the almost masculine strength of the\r\nlower face which astonished Lady Ushant the most. "Has he spoken to\r\nyou about me?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Not to me." Then Lady Ushant went on to explain that though she was\r\nthere now as the female representative of the family she had never\r\nbeen so intimate with John Morton as to admit of such confidence as\r\nthat suggested.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether he can love me," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"Assuredly he does, Miss Trefoil. Why else should he send for you?"\r\n\r\n"Because he is an honest man. I hardly think that he can love me\r\nmuch. He was to have been my husband, but he will escape that. If I\r\nthought that he would live I would tell him that he was free."\r\n\r\n"He would not want to be--free."\r\n\r\n"He ought to want it. I am not fit for him. I have come here, Lady\r\nUshant, because I want to tell him the truth."\r\n\r\n"But you love him?" Arabella made no answer, but sat looking steadily\r\ninto Lady Ushant\'s face. "Surely you do love him."\r\n\r\n"I do not know. I don\'t think I did love him,--though now I may. It\r\nis so horrible that he should die, and die while all this is going\r\non. That softens one you know. Have you ever heard of Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford;--the young man?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--the young man."\r\n\r\n"Never particularly. I knew his father."\r\n\r\n"But not this man? Mr. Morton never spoke to you of him."\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"I have been engaged to him since I became engaged to your nephew."\r\n\r\n"Engaged to Lord Rufford,--to marry him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--indeed."\r\n\r\n"And will you marry him?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say. I tell you this, Lady Ushant, because I must tell\r\nsomebody in this house. I have behaved very badly to Mr. Morton, and\r\nLord Rufford is behaving as badly to me."\r\n\r\n"Did John know of this?"\r\n\r\n"No;--but I meant to tell him. I determined that I would tell him had\r\nhe lived. When he sent for me I swore that I would tell him. If he is\r\ndying,--how can I say it?" Lady Ushant sat bewildered, thinking over\r\nit, understanding nothing of the world in which this girl had lived,\r\nand not knowing now how things could have been as she described them.\r\nIt was not as yet three months since, to her knowledge, this young\r\nwoman had been staying at Bragton as the affianced bride of the\r\nowner of the house,--staying there with her own mother and his\r\ngrandmother,--and now she declared that since that time she had\r\nbecome engaged to another man and that that other man had already\r\njilted her! And yet she was here that she might make a deathbed\r\nparting with the man who regarded himself as her affianced husband.\r\n"If I were sure that he were dying, why should I trouble him?" she\r\nsaid again.\r\n\r\nLady Ushant found herself utterly unable to give any counsel to such\r\na condition of circumstances. Why should she be asked? This young\r\nwoman had her mother with her. Did her mother know all this, and\r\nnevertheless bring her daughter to the house of a man who had been so\r\ntreated! "I really do not know what to say," she replied at last.\r\n\r\n"But I was determined that I would tell some one. I thought that Mrs.\r\nMorton would have been here." Lady Ushant shook her head. "I am glad\r\nshe is not, because she was not civil to me when I was here before.\r\nShe would have said hard things to me,--though not perhaps harder\r\nthan I have deserved. I suppose I may still see him to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; he expects it."\r\n\r\n"I shall not tell him now. I could not tell him if I thought he were\r\ndying. If he gets better you must tell him all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I could do that, Miss Trefoil."\r\n\r\n"Pray do;--pray do. I call upon you to tell him everything."\r\n\r\n"Tell him that you will be married to Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"No;--not that. If Mr. Morton were well to-morrow I would have\r\nhim,--if he chose to take me after what I have told you."\r\n\r\n"You do love him then?"\r\n\r\n"At any rate I like no one better."\r\n\r\n"Not the young lord?"\r\n\r\n"No! why should I like him? He does not love me. I hate him. I would\r\nmarry Mr. Morton to-morrow, and go with him to Patagonia, or anywhere\r\nelse,--if he would have me after hearing what I have done." Then she\r\nrose from her chair; but before she left the room she said a word\r\nfurther. "Do not speak a word to my mother about this. Mamma knows\r\nnothing of my purpose. Mamma only wants me to marry Lord Rufford, and\r\nto throw Mr. Morton over. Do not tell anyone else, Lady Ushant; but\r\nif he is ever well enough then you must tell him." After that she\r\nwent, leaving Lady Ushant in the room astounded by the story she had\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME III.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n"I HAVE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING."\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening was very long and very sad to the three ladies assembled\r\nin the drawing-room at Bragton Park, but it was probably more so\r\nto Lady Augustus than the other two. She hardly spoke to either of\r\nthem; nor did they to her; while a certain amount of conversation\r\nin a low tone was carried on between Lady Ushant and Miss Trefoil.\r\nWhen Arabella came down to dinner she received a message from the\r\nsick man. He sent his love, and would so willingly have seen her\r\ninstantly,--only that the doctor would not allow it. But he was so\r\nglad,--so very glad that she had come! This Lady Ushant said to her\r\nin a whisper, and seemed to say it as though she had heard nothing of\r\nthat frightful story which had been told to her not much more than\r\nan hour ago. Arabella did not utter a word in reply, but put out her\r\nhand, secretly as it were, and grasped that of the old lady to whom\r\nshe had told the tale of her later intrigues. The dinner did not keep\r\nthem long, but it was very grievous to them all. Lady Ushant might\r\nhave made some effort to be at least a complaisant hostess to Lady\r\nAugustus had she not heard this story,--had she not been told that\r\nthe woman, knowing her daughter to be engaged to John Morton, had\r\nwanted her to marry Lord Rufford. The story having come from the lips\r\nof the girl herself had moved some pity in the old woman\'s breast\r\nin regard to her; but for Lady Augustus she could feel nothing but\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Lady Augustus sat alone, not even pretending to open\r\na book or to employ her fingers. She seated herself on one side of\r\nthe fire with a screen in her hand, turning over such thoughts in her\r\nmind as were perhaps customary to her. Would there ever come a period\r\nto her misery, an hour of release in which she might be in comfort\r\nere she died? Hitherto from one year to another, from one decade to\r\nthe following, it had all been struggle and misery, contumely and\r\ncontempt. She thought that she had done her duty by her child, and\r\nher child hated and despised her. It was but the other day that\r\nArabella had openly declared that in the event of her marriage she\r\nwould not have her mother as a guest in her own house. There could be\r\nno longer hope for triumph and glory;--but how might she find peace\r\nso that she might no longer be driven hither and thither by this\r\nungrateful tyrant child? Oh, how hard she had worked in the world,\r\nand how little the world had given her in return!\r\n\r\nLady Ushant and Arabella sat at the other side of the fire, at some\r\ndistance from it, on a sofa, and carried on a fitful conversation in\r\nwhispers, of which a word would now and then reach the ears of the\r\nwretched mother. It consisted chiefly of a description of the man\'s\r\nillness, and of the different sayings which had come from the doctors\r\nwho had attended him. It was marvellous to Lady Augustus, as she\r\nsat there listening, that her daughter should condescend to take an\r\ninterest in such details. What could it be to her now how the fever\r\nhad taken him, or why or when? On the very next day, the very morning\r\non which she would go and sit,--ah so uselessly,--by the dying man\'s\r\nbedside, her father was to meet Lord Rufford at the ducal mansion in\r\nPiccadilly, to see if anything could be done in that quarter! It was\r\nimpossible that she should really care whether John Morton\'s lease of\r\nlife was to be computed at a week\'s purchase or at that of a month!\r\nAnd yet Arabella sat there asking sick-room questions and listening\r\nto sick-room replies as though her very nature had been changed. Lady\r\nAugustus heard her daughter inquire what food the sick man took, and\r\nthen Lady Ushant at great length gave the list of his nourishment.\r\nWhat sickening hypocrisy! thought Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\nLady Augustus must have known her daughter well; and yet it was not\r\nhypocrisy. The girl\'s nature, which had become thoroughly evil from\r\nthe treatment it had received, was not altered. Such sudden changes\r\ndo not occur more frequently than other miracles. But zealously\r\nas she had practised her arts she had not as yet practised them\r\nlong enough not to be cowed by certain outward circumstances. There\r\nwere moments when she still heard in her imagination the sound of\r\nthat horse\'s foot as it struck the skull of the unfortunate fallen\r\nrider;--and now the prospect of the death of this man whom she had\r\nknown so intimately and who had behaved so well to her,--to whom her\r\nown conduct had been so foully false,--for a time brought her back to\r\nhumanity. But Lady Augustus had got beyond that and could not at all\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nBy nine they had all retired for the night. It was necessary that\r\nLady Ushant should again visit her nephew, and the mother and\r\ndaughter went to their own rooms. "I cannot in the least make out\r\nwhat you are doing," said Lady Augustus in her most severe voice.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I have been brought here, at a terrible sacrifice--"\r\n\r\n"Sacrifice! What sacrifice? You are as well here as anywhere else."\r\n\r\n"I say I have been brought here at a terrible sacrifice for no\r\npurpose whatever. What use is it to be? And then you pretend to care\r\nwhat this poor man is eating and drinking and what physic he is\r\ntaking when, the last time you were in his company, you wouldn\'t so\r\nmuch as look at him for fear you should make another man jealous."\r\n\r\n"He was not dying then."\r\n\r\n"Psha!"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. I know all that. I do feel a little ashamed of myself when I\r\nam almost crying for him."\r\n\r\n"As if you loved him!"\r\n\r\n"Dear mamma, I do own that it is foolish. Having listened to you on\r\nthese subjects for a dozen years at least I ought to have got rid of\r\nall that. I don\'t suppose I do love him. Two or three weeks ago I\r\nalmost thought I loved Lord Rufford, and now I am quite sure that I\r\nhate him. But if I heard to-morrow that he had broken his neck out\r\nhunting, I ain\'t sure but what I should feel something. But he would\r\nnot send for me as this man has done."\r\n\r\n"It was very impertinent."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it was ill-bred, as he must have suspected something as to\r\nLord Rufford. However we are here now."\r\n\r\n"I will never allow you to drag me anywhere again."\r\n\r\n"It will be for yourself to judge of that. If I want to go anywhere,\r\nI shall go. What\'s the good of quarrelling? You know that I mean to\r\nhave my way."\r\n\r\nThe next morning neither Lady Augustus nor Miss Trefoil came down to\r\nbreakfast, but at ten o\'clock Arabella was ready, as appointed, to\r\nbe taken into the sick man\'s bedroom. She was still dressed in black\r\nbut had taken some trouble with her face and hair. She followed Lady\r\nUshant in, and silently standing by the bedside put her hand upon\r\nthat of John Morton which was laying outside on the bed. "I will\r\nleave you now, John," said Lady Ushant retiring, "and come again in\r\nhalf an hour."\r\n\r\n"When I ring," he said.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t let him talk for more than that," said the old lady to\r\nArabella as she went.\r\n\r\nIt was more than an hour afterwards when Arabella crept into her\r\nmother\'s room, during which time Lady Ushant had twice knocked at her\r\nnephew\'s door and had twice been sent away. "It is all over, mamma!"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nLady Augustus looked into her daughter\'s eyes and saw that she had\r\nreally been weeping. "All over!"\r\n\r\n"I mean for me,--and you. We have only got to go away."\r\n\r\n"Will he--die?"\r\n\r\n"It will make no matter though he should live for ever. I have told\r\nhim everything. I did not mean to do it because I thought that he\r\nwould be weak; but he has been strong enough for that."\r\n\r\n"What have you told him?"\r\n\r\n"Just everything--about you and Lord Rufford and myself,--and what an\r\nescape he had had not to marry me. He understands it all now."\r\n\r\n"It is a great deal more than I do."\r\n\r\n"He knows that Lord Rufford has been engaged to me." She clung to\r\nthis statement so vehemently that she had really taught herself to\r\nbelieve that it was so.\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"And he knows also how his lordship is behaving to me. Of course he\r\nthinks that I have deserved it. Of course I have deserved it. We have\r\nnothing to do now but to go back to London."\r\n\r\n"You have brought me here all the way for that."\r\n\r\n"Only for that! As the man was dying I thought that I would be honest\r\njust for once. Now that I have told him I don\'t believe that he will\r\ndie. He does not look to be so very ill."\r\n\r\n"And you have thrown away that chance!"\r\n\r\n"Altogether. You didn\'t like Bragton you know, and therefore it can\'t\r\nmatter to you."\r\n\r\n"Like it!"\r\n\r\n"To be sure you would have got rid of me had I gone to Patagonia. But\r\nhe will not go to Patagonia now even if he gets well; and so there\r\nwas nothing to be gained. The carriage is to be here at two to take\r\nus to the station and you may as well let Judith come and put the\r\nthings up."\r\n\r\nJust before they took their departure Lady Ushant came to Arabella\r\nsaying that Mr. Morton wanted to speak one other word to her before\r\nshe went. So she returned to the room and was again left alone at the\r\nman\'s bedside. "Arabella," he said, "I thought that I would tell you\r\nthat I have forgiven everything."\r\n\r\n"How can you have forgiven me? There are things which a man cannot\r\nforgive."\r\n\r\n"Give me your hand," he said,--and she gave him her hand. "I do\r\nforgive it all. Even should I live it would be impossible that we\r\nshould be man and wife."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"But nevertheless I love you. Try,--try to be true to some one."\r\n\r\n"There is no truth left in me, Mr. Morton. I should not dishonour my\r\nhusband if I had one, but still I should be a curse to him. I shall\r\nmarry some day I suppose, and I know it will be so. I wish I could\r\nchange with you,--and die."\r\n\r\n"You are unhappy now."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am. I am always unhappy. I do not think you can tell what\r\nit is to be so wretched. But I am glad that you have forgiven me."\r\nThen she stooped down and kissed his hand. As she did so he touched\r\nher brow with his hot lips, and then she left him again. Lady Ushant\r\nwas waiting outside the door. "He knows it all," said Arabella. "You\r\nneed not trouble yourself with the message I gave you. The carriage\r\nis at the door. Good-bye. You need not come down. Mamma will not\r\nexpect it." Lady Ushant, hardly knowing how she ought to behave, did\r\nnot go down. Lady Augustus and her daughter got into Mr. Runciman\'s\r\ncarriage without any farewells, and were driven back from the park\r\nto the Dillsborough Station. To poor Lady Ushant the whole thing had\r\nbeen very terrible. She sat silent and unoccupied the whole of that\r\nevening wondering at the horror of such a history. This girl had\r\nabsolutely dared to tell the dying man all her own disgrace,--and had\r\ntravelled down from London to Bragton with the purpose of doing so!\r\nWhen next she crept into the sick-room she almost expected that her\r\nnephew would speak to her on the subject;--but he only asked whether\r\nthat sound of wheels which he heard beneath his window had come\r\nfrom the carriage which had taken them away, and then did not say a\r\nfurther word of either Lady Augustus or her daughter.\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean to do now?" said Lady Augustus as the train\r\napproached the London terminus.\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"You have given up Lord Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have not."\r\n\r\n"Your journey to Bragton will hardly help you much with him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want it to help me at all. What have I done that Lord\r\nRufford can complain of? I have not abandoned Lord Rufford for the\r\nsake of Mr. Morton. Lord Rufford ought only to be too proud if he\r\nknew it all."\r\n\r\n"Of course he could make use of such an escapade as this?"\r\n\r\n"Let him try. I have not done with Lord Rufford yet, and so I can\r\ntell him. I shall be at the Duke\'s in Piccadilly to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"That will be impossible, Arabella."\r\n\r\n"They shall see whether it is impossible. I have got beyond caring\r\nvery much what people say now. I know the kind of way papa would be\r\nthrown over if there is no one there to back him. I shall be there\r\nand I will ask Lord Rufford to his face whether we did not become\r\nengaged when we were at Mistletoe."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t let you in."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll find a way to make my way in. I shall never be his wife. I\r\ndon\'t know that I want it. After all what\'s the good of living with a\r\nman if you hate each other,--or living apart like you and papa?"\r\n\r\n"He has income enough for anything!" exclaimed Lady Augustus, shocked\r\nat her daughter\'s apparent blindness.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that I\'m thinking of, but I\'ll have my revenge on him.\r\nLiar! To write and say that I had made a mistake! He had not the\r\ncourage to get out of it when we were together; but when he had run\r\naway in the night, like a thief, and got into his own house, then\r\nhe could write and say that I had made a mistake! I have sometimes\r\npitied men when I have seen girls hunting them down, but upon my word\r\nthey deserve it." This renewal of spirit did something to comfort\r\nLady Augustus. She had begun to fear that her daughter, in her\r\ndespair, would abandon altogether the one pursuit of her life;--but\r\nit now seemed that there was still some courage left for the battle.\r\n\r\nThat night nothing more was said, but Arabella applied all her mind\r\nto the present condition of her circumstances. Should she or should\r\nshe not go to the house in Piccadilly on the following morning? At\r\nlast she determined that she would not do so, believing that should\r\nher father fail she might make a better opportunity for herself\r\nafterwards. At her uncle\'s house she would hardly have known where or\r\nhow to wait for the proper moment of her appearance. "So you are not\r\ngoing to Piccadilly," said her mother on the following morning.\r\n\r\n"It appears not," said Arabella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n"NOW WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY?"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be a question whether Lord Augustus Trefoil or Lord Rufford\r\nlooked forward to the interview which was to take place at the Duke\'s\r\nmansion with the greater dismay. The unfortunate father whose only\r\nprinciple in life had been that of avoiding trouble would have rather\r\nthat his daughter should have been jilted a score of times than that\r\nhe should have been called upon to interfere once. There was in this\r\ndemand upon him a breach of a silent but well-understood compact. His\r\nwife and daughter had been allowed to do just what they pleased and\r\nto be free of his authority, upon an understanding that they were\r\nnever to give him any trouble. She might have married Lord Rufford,\r\nor Mr. Morton, or any other man she might have succeeded in catching,\r\nand he would not have troubled her either before or after her\r\nmarriage. But it was not fair that he should be called upon to\r\ninterfere in her failures. And what was he to say to this young lord?\r\nBeing fat and old and plethoric he could not be expected to use a\r\nstick and thrash the young lord. Pistols were gone,--a remembrance\r\nof which fact perhaps afforded some consolation. Nobody now need be\r\nafraid of anybody, and the young lord would not be afraid of him.\r\nArabella declared that there had been an engagement. The young lord\r\nwould of course declare that there had been none. Upon the whole he\r\nwas inclined to believe it most probable that his daughter was lying.\r\nHe did not think it likely that Lord Rufford should have been such a\r\nfool. As for taking Lord Rufford by the back of his neck and shaking\r\nhim into matrimony, he knew that that would be altogether out of\r\nhis power. And then the hour was so wretchedly early. It was that\r\nlittle fool Mistletoe who had named ten o\'clock,--a fellow who took\r\nParliamentary papers to bed with him, and had a blue book brought\r\nto him every morning at half-past seven with a cup of tea. By ten\r\no\'clock Lord Augustus would not have had time to take his first glass\r\nof soda and brandy preparatory to the labour of getting into his\r\nclothes. But he was afraid of his wife and daughter, and absolutely\r\ndid get into a cab at the door of his lodgings in Duke Street, St.\r\nJames\', precisely at a quarter past ten. As the Duke\'s house was\r\nclose to the corner of Clarges Street the journey he had to make was\r\nnot long.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford would not have agreed to the interview but that it was\r\nforced upon him by his brother-in-law. "What good can it do?" Lord\r\nRufford had asked. But his brother-in-law had held that that was a\r\nquestion to be answered by the other side. In such a position Sir\r\nGeorge thought that he was bound to concede as much as this,--in fact\r\nto concede almost anything short of marriage. "He can\'t do the girl\r\nany good by talking," Lord Rufford had said. Sir George assented to\r\nthis, but nevertheless thought that any friend deputed by her should\r\nbe allowed to talk, at any rate once. "I don\'t know what he\'ll say.\r\nDo you think he\'ll bring a big stick?" Sir George who knew Lord\r\nAugustus did not imagine that a stick would be brought. "I couldn\'t\r\nhit him, you know. He\'s so fat that a blow would kill him." Lord\r\nRufford wanted his brother-in-law to go with him;--but Sir George\r\nassured him that this was impossible. It was a great bore. He had to\r\ngo up to London all alone,--in February, when the weather was quite\r\nopen and hunting was nearly coming to an end. And for what? Was it\r\nlikely that such a man as Lord Augustus should succeed in talking\r\nhim into marrying any girl? Nevertheless he went, prepared to be\r\nvery civil, full of sorrow at the misunderstanding, but strong in\r\nhis determination not to yield an inch. He arrived at the mansion\r\nprecisely at ten o\'clock and was at once shown into a back room on\r\nthe ground floor. He saw no one but a very demure old servant who\r\nseemed to look upon him as one who was sinning against the Trefoil\r\nfamily in general, and who shut the door upon him, leaving him as it\r\nwere in prison. He was so accustomed to be the absolute master of his\r\nown minutes and hours that he chafed greatly as he walked up and down\r\nthe room for what seemed to him the greater part of a day. He looked\r\nrepeatedly at his watch, and at half-past ten declared to himself\r\nthat if that fat old fool did not come within two minutes he would\r\nmake his escape.\r\n\r\n"The fat old fool" when he reached the house asked for his nephew\r\nand endeavoured to persuade Lord Mistletoe to go with him to the\r\ninterview. But Lord Mistletoe was as firm in refusing as had been\r\nSir George Penwether. "You are quite wrong," said the young man\r\nwith well-informed sententious gravity. "I could do nothing to help\r\nyou. You are Arabella\'s father and no one can plead her cause but\r\nyourself." Lord Augustus dropped his eyebrows over his eyes as this\r\nwas said. They who knew him well and had seen the same thing done\r\nwhen his partner would not answer his call at whist or had led up\r\nto his discard were aware that the motion was tantamount to a very\r\nstrong expression of disgust. He did not, however, argue the matter\r\nany further, but allowed himself to be led away slowly by the same\r\nsolemn servant. Lord Rufford had taken up his hat preparatory to his\r\ndeparture when Lord Augustus was announced just five minutes after\r\nthe half hour.\r\n\r\nWhen the elder man entered the room the younger one put down his hat\r\nand bowed. Lord Augustus also bowed and then stood for a few moments\r\nsilent with his fat hands extended on the round table in the middle\r\nof the room. "This is a very disagreeable kind of thing, my Lord," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Very disagreeable, and one that I lament above all things," answered\r\nLord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well;--very well indeed;--but, damme, what\'s the\r\nmeaning of it all? That\'s what I want to ask. What\'s the meaning\r\nof it all?" Then he paused as though he had completed the first\r\npart of his business,--and might now wait awhile till the necessary\r\nexplanation had been given. But Lord Rufford did not seem disposed to\r\ngive any immediate answer. He shrugged his shoulders, and, taking up\r\nhis hat, passed his hand once or twice round the nap. Lord Augustus\r\nopened his eyes very wide as he waited and looked at the other man;\r\nbut it seemed that the other man had nothing to say for himself. "You\r\ndon\'t mean to tell me, I suppose, that what my daughter says isn\'t\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\n"Some unfortunate mistake, Lord Augustus;--most unfortunate."\r\n\r\n"Mistake be ----." He stopped himself before the sentence was\r\ncompleted, remembering that such an interview should be conducted\r\non the part of him, as father, with something of dignity. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand anything about mistakes. Ladies don\'t make mistakes of\r\nthat kind. I won\'t hear of mistakes." Lord Rufford again shrugged his\r\nshoulders. "You have engaged my daughter\'s affections."\r\n\r\n"I have the greatest regard for Miss Trefoil."\r\n\r\n"Regard be ----." Then again he remembered himself. "Lord Rufford,\r\nyou\'ve got to marry her. That\'s the long and the short of it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I ought to be proud."\r\n\r\n"So you ought."\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know the meaning of but, my Lord. I want to know what you\r\nmean to do."\r\n\r\n"Marriage isn\'t in my line at all."\r\n\r\n"Then what the d---- business have you to go about and talk to a\r\ngirl like that? Marriage not in your line! Who cares for your line?\r\nI never heard such impudence in all my life. You get yourself\r\nengaged to a young lady of high rank and position and then you say\r\nthat--marriage isn\'t in your line." Upon that he opened his eyes\r\nstill wider, and glared upon the offender wrathfully.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t admit that I was ever engaged to Miss Trefoil."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you make love to her?"\r\n\r\nThe poor victim paused a moment before he answered this question,\r\nthereby confessing his guilt before he denied it. "No, my Lord; I\r\ndon\'t think I ever did."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think! You don\'t know whether you asked my daughter to\r\nmarry you or not! You don\'t think you made love to her!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I didn\'t ask her to marry me."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you did. And now what have you got to say?" Here there was\r\nanother shrug of the shoulders. "I suppose you think because you are\r\na rich man that you may do whatever you please. But you\'ll have to\r\nlearn the difference. You must be exposed, Sir."\r\n\r\n"I hope for the lady\'s sake that as little as possible may be said of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"D---- the ----!" Lord Augustus in his assumed wrath was about to be\r\nvery severe on his daughter, but he checked himself again. "I\'m not\r\ngoing to stop here talking all day," he said. "I want to hear your\r\nexplanation and then I shall know how to act." Up to this time he had\r\nbeen standing, which was unusual with him. Now he flung himself into\r\nan armchair.\r\n\r\n"Really, Lord Augustus, I don\'t know what I\'ve got to say. I admire\r\nyour daughter exceedingly. I was very much honoured when she and her\r\nmother came to my house at Rufford. I was delighted to be able to\r\nshow her a little sport. It gave me the greatest satisfaction when\r\nI met her again at your brother\'s house. Coming home from hunting we\r\nhappened to be thrown together. It\'s a kind of thing that will occur,\r\nyou know. The Duchess seemed to think a great deal of it; but what\r\ncan one do? We could have had two postchaises, of course,--only one\r\ndoesn\'t generally send a young lady alone. She was very tired and\r\nfainted with the fatigue. That I think is about all."\r\n\r\n"But,--damme, Sir, what did you say to her?" Lord Rufford again\r\nrubbed the nap of his hat. "What did you say to her first of all, at\r\nyour own house?"\r\n\r\n"A poor fellow was killed out hunting and everybody was talking about\r\nthat. Your daughter saw it herself."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Lord Rufford, if I say that that\'s what we used to call\r\nshuffling, at school. Because a man broke his neck out hunting--"\r\n\r\n"It was a kick on the head, Lord Augustus."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care where he was kicked. What has that to do with your\r\nasking my daughter to be your wife?"\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I say you did,--over and over again." Here Lord Augustus got out\r\nof his chair, and made a little attempt to reach the recreant\r\nlover;--but he failed and fell back again into his armchair. "It was\r\nfirst at Rufford, and then you made an appointment to meet her at\r\nMistletoe. How do you explain that?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Trefoil is very fond of hunting."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe she ever went out hunting in her life before she saw\r\nyou. You mounted her,--and gave her a horse,--and took her out,--and\r\nbrought her home. Everybody at Mistletoe knew all about it. My\r\nbrother and the Duchess were told of it. It was one of those things\r\nthat are plain to everybody as the nose on your face. What did you\r\nsay to her when you were coming home in that postchaise?"\r\n\r\n"She was fainting."\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it? I don\'t care whether she fainted or\r\nnot. I don\'t believe she fainted at all. When she got into that\r\ncarriage she was engaged to you, and when she got out of it she was\r\nengaged ever so much more. The Duchess knew all about it. Now what\r\nhave you got to say?" Lord Rufford felt that he had nothing to say.\r\n"I insist upon having an answer."\r\n\r\n"It\'s one of the most unfortunate mistakes that ever were made."\r\n\r\n"By G----!" exclaimed Lord Augustus, turning his eyes up against the\r\nwall, and appealing to some dark ancestor who hung there. "I never\r\nheard of such a thing in all my life; never!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I might as well go now," said Lord Rufford after a pause.\r\n\r\n"You may go to the D----, Sir,--for the present." Then Lord Rufford\r\ntook his departure leaving the injured parent panting with his\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nAs Lord Rufford went away he felt that that difficulty had been\r\novercome with much more ease than he had expected. He hardly knew\r\nwhat it was that he had dreaded, but he had feared something much\r\nworse than that. Had an appeal been made to his affections he would\r\nhardly have known how to answer. He remembered well that he had\r\nassured the lady that he loved her, and had a direct question been\r\nasked him on that subject he would not have lied. He must have\r\nconfessed that such a declaration had been made by him. But he had\r\nescaped that. He was quite sure that he had never uttered a hint in\r\nregard to marriage, and he came away from the Duke\'s house almost\r\nwith an assurance that he had done nothing that was worthy of much\r\nblame.\r\n\r\nLord Augustus looked at his watch, rang the bell, and ordered a cab.\r\nHe must now go and see his daughter, and then he would have done with\r\nthe matter--for ever. But as he was passing through the hall his\r\nnephew caught hold of him and took him back into the room. "What does\r\nhe say for himself?" asked Lord Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he says. Of course he swears that he never spoke a\r\nword to her."\r\n\r\n"My mother saw him paying her the closest attention."\r\n\r\n"How can I help that? What can I do? Why didn\'t your mother pin\r\nhim then and there? Women can always do that kind of thing if they\r\nchoose."\r\n\r\n"It is all over, then?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make a man marry if he won\'t. He ought to be thrashed within\r\nan inch of his life. But if one does that kind of thing the police\r\nare down upon one. All the same, I think the Duchess might have\r\nmanaged it if she had chosen." After that he went to the lodgings\r\nin Orchard Street, and there repeated his story. "I have done all I\r\ncan," he said, "and I don\'t mean to interfere any further. Arabella\r\nshould know how to manage her own affairs."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t mean to punish him?" asked the mother.\r\n\r\n"Punish him! How am I to punish him? If I were to throw a decanter at\r\nhis head, what good would that do?"\r\n\r\n"And you mean to say that she must put up with it?" Arabella was\r\nsitting by as these questions were asked.\r\n\r\n"He says that he never said a word to her. Whom am I to believe?"\r\n\r\n"You did believe him, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Who said so, Miss? But I don\'t see why his word isn\'t as good as\r\nyours. There was nobody to hear it, I suppose. Why didn\'t you get it\r\nin writing, or make your uncle fix him at once? If you mismanage your\r\nown affairs I can\'t put them right for you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, papa. I am so much obliged to you. You come back and tell\r\nme that every word he says is to be taken for gospel, and that you\r\ndon\'t believe a word I have spoken. That is so kind of you! I suppose\r\nhe and you will be the best friends in the world now. But I don\'t\r\nmean to let him off in that way. As you won\'t help me, I must help\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"What did you expect me to do?"\r\n\r\n"Never to leave him till you had forced him to keep his word. I\r\nshould have thought that you would have taken him by the throat in\r\nsuch a cause. Any other father would have done so."\r\n\r\n"You are an impudent, wicked girl, and I don\'t believe he was ever\r\nengaged to you at all," said Lord Augustus as he took his leave.\r\n\r\n"Now you have made your father your enemy," said the mother.\r\n\r\n"Everybody is my enemy," said Arabella. "There are no such things as\r\nlove and friendship. Papa pretends that he does not believe me, just\r\nbecause he wants to shirk the trouble. I suppose you\'ll say you don\'t\r\nbelieve me next."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMRS. MORTON RETURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after that on which Lady Augustus and her daughter left\r\nBragton old Mrs. Morton returned to that place. She had gone away\r\nin very bitterness of spirit against her grandson in the early days\r\nof his illness. For some period antecedent to that there had been\r\ncauses for quarrelling. John Morton had told her that he had been\r\nto Reginald\'s house, and she, in her wrath, replied that he had\r\ndisgraced himself by doing so. When those harsh words had been\r\nforgotten, or at any rate forgiven, other causes of anger had sprung\r\nup. She had endeavoured to drive him to repudiate Arabella Trefoil,\r\nand in order that she might do so effectually had contrived to find\r\nout something of Arabella\'s doings at Rufford and at Mistletoe. Her\r\nefforts in this direction had had an effect directly contrary to that\r\nwhich she had intended. There had been moments in which Morton had\r\nbeen willing enough to rid himself of that burden. He had felt the\r\nlady\'s conduct in his own house, and had seen it at Rufford. He,\r\ntoo, had heard something of Mistletoe. But the spirit within him\r\nwas aroused at the idea of dictation, and he had been prompted to\r\ncontradict the old woman\'s accusation against his intended bride, by\r\nthe very fact that they were made by her. And then she threatened\r\nhim. If he did these things,--if he would consort with an outcast\r\nfrom the family such as Reginald Morton, and take to himself such\r\na bride as Arabella Trefoil, he could never more be to her as her\r\nchild. This of course was tantamount to saying that she would leave\r\nher money to some one else,--money which, as he well knew, had all\r\nbeen collected from the Bragton property. He had ever been to her as\r\nher son, and yet he was aware of a propensity on her part to enrich\r\nher own noble relatives with her hoards,--a desire from gratifying\r\nwhich she had hitherto been restrained by conscience. Morton had been\r\nanxious enough for his grandmother\'s money, but, even in the hope of\r\nreceiving it, would not bear indignity beyond a certain point. He had\r\ntherefore declared it to be his purpose to marry Arabella Trefoil,\r\nand because he had so declared he had almost brought himself to\r\nforgive that young lady\'s sins against him. Then, as his illness\r\nbecame serious, there arose the question of disposing of the property\r\nin the event of his death. Mrs. Morton was herself very old, and was\r\nnear her grave. She was apt to speak of herself as one who had but a\r\nfew days left to her in this world. But, to her, property was more\r\nimportant than life or death;--and rank probably more important than\r\neither. She was a brave, fierce, evil-minded, but conscientious old\r\nwoman,--one, we may say, with very bad lights indeed, but who was\r\nsteadfastly minded to walk by those lights, such as they were. She\r\ndid not scruple to tell her grandson that it was his duty to leave\r\nthe property away from his cousin Reginald, nor to allege as a reason\r\nfor his doing so that in all probability Reginald Morton was not the\r\nlegitimate heir of his great-grandfather, Sir Reginald. For such an\r\nassertion John Morton knew there was not a shadow of ground. No one\r\nbut this old woman had ever suspected that the Canadian girl whom\r\nReginald\'s father had brought with him to Bragton had been other\r\nthan his honest wife;--and her suspicions had only come from vague\r\nassertions, made by herself in blind anger till at last she had\r\nlearned to believe them. Then, when in addition to this, he asserted\r\nhis purpose of asking Arabella Trefoil to come to him at Bragton, the\r\ncup of her wrath was overflowing, and she withdrew from the house\r\naltogether. It might be that he was dying. She did in truth believe\r\nthat he was dying. But there were things more serious to her than\r\nlife or death. Should she allow him to trample upon all her feelings\r\nbecause he was on his death-bed,--when perhaps in very truth he\r\nmight not be on his death-bed at all? She, at any rate, was near her\r\ndeath,--and she would do her duty. So she packed up her things--to\r\nthe last black skirt of an old gown, so that every one at Bragton\r\nmight know that it was her purpose to come back no more. And she went\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThen Lady Ushant came to take her place, and with Lady Ushant came\r\nReginald Morton. The one lived in the house and the other visited\r\nit daily. And, as the reader knows, Lady Augustus came with her\r\ndaughter. Mrs. Morton, though she had gone,--for ever,--took care to\r\nknow of the comings and goings at Bragton. Mrs. Hopkins was enjoined\r\nto write to her and tell her everything; and though Mrs. Hopkins with\r\nall her heart took the side of Lady Ushant and Reginald, she had\r\nnever been well inclined to Miss Trefoil. Presents too were given\r\nand promises were made; and Mrs. Hopkins, not without some little\r\ntreachery, did from time to time send to the old lady a record of\r\nwhat took place at Bragton. Arabella came and went, and Mrs. Hopkins\r\nthought that her coming had not led to much. Lady Ushant was always\r\nwith Mr. John,--such was the account given by Mrs. Hopkins;--and the\r\ngeneral opinion was that the squire\'s days were numbered.\r\n\r\nThen the old woman\'s jealousy was aroused, and, perhaps, her heart\r\nwas softened. It was still hard black winter, and she was living\r\nalone in lodgings in London. The noble cousin, a man nearly as old as\r\nherself whose children she was desirous to enrich, took but little\r\nnotice of her, nor would she have been happy had she lived with\r\nhim. Her life had been usually solitary,--with little breaks to its\r\nloneliness occasioned by the visits to England of him whom she had\r\ncalled her child. That this child should die before her, should die\r\nin his youth, did not shock her much. Her husband had done so, and\r\nher own son, and sundry of her noble brothers and sisters. She was\r\nhardened against death. Life to her had never been joyous, though the\r\ntrappings of life were so great in her eyes. But it broke her heart\r\nthat her child should die in the arms of another old woman who had\r\nalways been to her as an enemy. Lady Ushant, in days now long gone by\r\nbut still remembered as though they were yesterday, had counselled\r\nthe reception of the Canadian female. And Lady Ushant, when the\r\nCanadian female and her husband were dead, had been a mother to the\r\nboy whom she, Mrs. Morton, would so fain have repudiated altogether.\r\nLady Ushant had always been "on the other side;" and now Lady Ushant\r\nwas paramount at Bragton.\r\n\r\nAnd doubtless there was some tenderness, though Mrs. Morton was\r\nunwilling to own even to herself that she was moved by any such\r\nfeeling. If she had done her duty in counselling him to reject both\r\nReginald Morton and Arabella Trefoil,--as to which she admitted\r\nno doubt in her own mind;--and if duty had required her to absent\r\nherself when her counsel was spurned, then would she be weak and\r\nunmindful of duty should she allow any softness of heart to lure\r\nher back again. It was so she reasoned. But still some softness was\r\nthere; and when she heard that Miss Trefoil had gone, and that her\r\nvisit had not, in Mrs. Hopkins\'s opinion, "led to much," she wrote\r\nto say that she would return. She made no request and clothed her\r\nsuggestion in no words of tenderness; but simply told her grandson\r\nthat she would come back--as the Trefoils had left him.\r\n\r\nAnd she did come. When the news were first told to Lady Ushant by the\r\nsick man himself, that Lady proposed that she should at once go back\r\nto Cheltenham. But when she was asked whether her animosity to Mrs.\r\nMorton was so great that she could not consent to remain under the\r\nsame roof, she at once declared that she had no animosity whatsoever.\r\nThe idea of animosity running over nearly half a century was horrible\r\nto her; and therefore, though she did in her heart of hearts dread\r\nthe other old woman, she consented to stay. "And what shall Reginald\r\ndo?" she asked. John Morton had thought about this too, and expressed\r\na wish that Reginald should come regularly,--as he had come during\r\nthe last week or two.\r\n\r\nIt was just a week from the day on which the Trefoils had gone that\r\nMrs. Morton was driven up to the door in Mr. Runciman\'s fly. This was\r\nat four in the afternoon, and had the old woman looked out of the fly\r\nwindow she might have seen Reginald making his way by the little path\r\nto the bridge which led back to Dillsborough. It was at this hour\r\nthat he went daily, and he had not now thought it worth his while\r\nto remain to welcome Mrs. Morton. And she might also have seen, had\r\nshe looked out, that with him was walking a young woman. She would\r\nnot have known Mary Masters; but had she seen them both, and had she\r\nknown the young woman, she would have declared in her pride that\r\nthey were fit associates. But she saw nothing of this, sitting there\r\nbehind her veil, thinking whether she might still do anything, and\r\nif so, what she might do to avert the present evil destination of\r\nthe Bragton estate. There was an honourable nephew of her own,--or\r\nrather a great-nephew,--who might easily take the name, who would so\r\nwillingly take the name! Or if this were impracticable, there was a\r\ndistant Morton, very distant, whom she had never seen and certainly\r\ndid not love, but who was clearly a Morton, and who would certainly\r\nbe preferable to that enemy of forty years\' standing. Might there\r\nnot be some bargain made? Would not her dying grandson be alive to\r\nthe evident duty of enriching the property and leaving behind him a\r\nwealthy heir? She could enrich the property and make the heir wealthy\r\nby her money.\r\n\r\n"How is he?" That of course was the first question when Mrs. Hopkins\r\nmet her in the hall. Mrs. Hopkins only shook her head and said that\r\nperhaps he had taken his food that day a little better than on the\r\nlast. Then there was a whisper, to which Mrs. Hopkins whispered back\r\nher answer. Yes,--Lady Ushant was in the house,--was at this moment\r\nin the sick man\'s room. Mr. Reginald was not staying there,--had\r\nnever stayed there,--but came every day. He had only just left. "And\r\nis he to come still?" asked Mrs. Morton with wrath in her eyes. Mrs.\r\nHopkins did not know but was disposed to think that Mr. Reginald\r\nwould come every day. Then Mrs. Morton went up to her own room,--and\r\nwhile she prepared herself for her visit to the sick room Lady Ushant\r\nretired. She had a cup of tea, refusing all other refreshment,\r\nand then, walking erect as though she had been forty instead of\r\nseventy-five, she entered her grandson\'s chamber and took her old\r\nplace at his bedside.\r\n\r\nNothing was then said about Arabella, nor, indeed, at any future time\r\nwas her name mentioned between them;--nor was anything then said\r\nabout the future fate of the estate. She did not dare to bring up the\r\nsubject at once, though, on the journey down from London, she had\r\ndetermined that she would do so. But she was awed by his appearance\r\nand by the increased appanages of his sick-bed. He spoke, indeed, of\r\nthe property, and expressed his anxiety that Chowton Farm should be\r\nbought, if it came into market. He thought that the old acres should\r\nbe redeemed, if the opportunity arose,--and if the money could be\r\nfound. "Chowton Farm!" exclaimed the old woman, who remembered well\r\nthe agony which had attended the alienation of that portion of the\r\nMorton lands.\r\n\r\n"It may be that it will be sold."\r\n\r\n"Lawrence Twentyman sell Chowton Farm! I thought he was well off."\r\nLittle as she had been at Bragton she knew all about Chowton\r\nFarm,--except that its owner was so wounded by vain love as to be\r\nlike a hurt deer. Her grandson did not tell her all the story, but\r\nexplained to her that Lawrence Twentyman, though not poor, had other\r\nplans of life and thought of leaving the neighbourhood. She, of\r\ncourse, had the money; and as she believed that land was the one\r\nproper possession for an English gentleman of ancient family, she\r\ndoubtless would have been willing to buy it had she approved of the\r\nhands into which it would fall. It seemed to her that it was her duty\r\nto do as much for the estate with which all her fortune had been\r\nconcerned. "Yes," she said; "it should be bought,--if other things\r\nsuited. We will talk of it to-morrow, John." Then he spoke of his\r\nmission to Patagonia and of his regret that it should be abandoned.\r\nEven were he ever to be well again his strength would return to him\r\ntoo late for this purpose. He had already made known to the Foreign\r\nOffice his inability to undertake that service. But she could\r\nperceive that he had not in truth abandoned his hopes of living, for\r\nhe spoke much of his ambition as to the public service. The more he\r\nthought of it, he said, the more certain he became that it would suit\r\nhim better to go on with his profession than to live the life of a\r\ncountry squire in England. And yet she could see the change which had\r\ntaken place since she was last there and was aware that he was fading\r\naway from day to day.\r\n\r\nIt was not till they were summoned to dine together that she saw Lady\r\nUshant. Very many years had passed since last they were together, and\r\nyet neither seemed to the other to be much changed. Lady Ushant was\r\nstill soft, retiring, and almost timid; whereas Mrs. Morton showed\r\nher inclination to domineer even in the way in which she helped\r\nherself to salt. While the servant was with them very little was said\r\non either side. There was a word or two from Mrs. Morton to show that\r\nshe considered herself the mistress there,--and a word from the other\r\nlady proclaiming that she had no pretensions of that kind. But after\r\ndinner in the little drawing-room they were more communicative.\r\nSomething of course was said as to the health of the invalid. Lady\r\nUshant was not the woman to give a pronounced opinion on such a\r\nsubject. She used doubtful, hesitating words, and would in one minute\r\nalmost contradict what she had said in the former. But Mrs. Morton\r\nwas clever enough to perceive that Lady Ushant was almost without\r\nhope. Then she made a little speech with a fixed purpose. "It must be\r\na great trouble to you, Lady Ushant, to be so long away from home."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Lady Ushant in perfect innocence. "I have nothing\r\nto bind me anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I shall think it my duty to remain here now,--till the end."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. He has always been almost the same to you as your\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"Quite so; quite the same. He is my own." And yet,--thought Lady\r\nUshant,--she left him in his illness! She, too, had heard something\r\nfrom Mrs. Hopkins of the temper in which Mrs. Morton had last left\r\nBragton. "But you are not bound to him in that way."\r\n\r\n"Not in that way certainly."\r\n\r\n"In no way, I may say. It was very kind of you to come when business\r\nmade it imperative on me to go to town, but I do not think we can\r\ncall upon you for further sacrifice."\r\n\r\n"It is no sacrifice, Mrs. Morton." Lady Ushant was as meek as a worm,\r\nbut a worm will turn. And, though innocent, she was quick enough to\r\nperceive that at this, their first meeting, the other old woman was\r\nendeavouring to turn her out of the house.\r\n\r\n"I mean that it can hardly be necessary to call upon you to give up\r\nyour time."\r\n\r\n"What has an old woman to do with her time, Mrs. Morton?"\r\n\r\nHitherto Mrs. Morton had smiled. The smile indeed had been grim, but\r\nit had been intended to betoken outward civility. Now there came a\r\nfrown upon her brow which was more grim and by no means civil. "The\r\ntruth is that at such a time one who is almost a stranger--"\r\n\r\n"I am no stranger," said Lady Ushant.\r\n\r\n"You had not seen him since he was an infant."\r\n\r\n"My name was Morton as is his, and my dear father was the owner of\r\nthis house. Your husband, Mrs. Morton, was his grandfather and my\r\nbrother. I will allow no one to tell me that I am a stranger at\r\nBragton. I have lived here many more years than you."\r\n\r\n"A stranger to him, I meant. And now that he is ill--"\r\n\r\n"I shall stay with him--till he desires me to go away. He asked\r\nme to stay and that is quite enough." Then she got up and left\r\nthe room with more dignity,--as also she had spoken with more\r\nearnestness,--than Mrs. Morton had given her credit for possessing.\r\nAfter that the two ladies did not meet again till the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO OLD LADIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Mrs. Morton did not come down to breakfast,\r\nbut sat alone upstairs nursing her wrath. During the night she\r\nhad made up her mind to one or two things. She would never enter\r\nher grandson\'s chambers when Lady Ushant was there. She would not\r\nspeak to Reginald Morton, and should he come into her presence\r\nwhile she was at Bragton she would leave the room. She would do her\r\nbest to make the house, in common parlance, "too hot" to hold that\r\nother woman. And she would make use of those words which John had\r\nspoken concerning Chowton Farm as a peg on which she might hang her\r\ndiscourse in reference to his will. If in doing all this she should\r\nreceive that dutiful assistance which she thought that he owed\r\nher,--then she should stand by his bed-side, and be tender to him,\r\nand nurse him to the last as a mother would nurse a child. But if, as\r\nshe feared, he were headstrong in disobeying, then she would remember\r\nthat her duty to her family, if done with a firm purpose, would have\r\nlasting results, while his life might probably be an affair of a few\r\nweeks,--or even days.\r\n\r\nAt about eleven Lady Ushant was with her patient when a message was\r\nbrought by Mrs. Hopkins. Mrs. Morton wished to see her grandson and\r\ndesired to know whether it would suit him that she should come now.\r\n"Why not?" said the sick man, who was sitting up in his bed. Then\r\nLady Ushant collected her knitting and was about to depart. "Must\r\nyou go because she is coming?" Morton asked. Lady Ushant, shocked\r\nat the necessity of explaining to him the ill feeling that existed,\r\nsaid that perhaps it would be best. "Why should it be best?" Lady\r\nUshant shook her head, and smiled, and put her hand upon the\r\ncounterpane,--and retired. As she passed the door of her rival\'s room\r\nshe could see the black silk dress moving behind the partly open\r\ndoor, and as she entered her own she heard Mrs. Morton\'s steps\r\nupon the corridor. The place was already almost "too hot" for her.\r\nAnything would be better than scenes like this in the house of a\r\ndying man.\r\n\r\n"Need my aunt have gone away?" he asked after the first greeting.\r\n\r\n"I did not say so."\r\n\r\n"She seemed to think that she was not to stay."\r\n\r\n"Can I help what she thinks, John? Of course she feels that she is--"\r\n\r\n"Is what?"\r\n\r\n"An interloper--if I must say it."\r\n\r\n"But I have sent for her, and I have begged her to stay."\r\n\r\n"Of course she can stay if she wishes. But, dear John, there must be\r\nmuch to be said between you and me which,--which cannot interest her;\r\nor which, at least, she ought not to hear." He did not contradict\r\nthis in words, feeling himself to be too weak for contest; but\r\nwithin his own mind he declared that it was not so. The things which\r\ninterested him now were as likely to interest his great-aunt as his\r\ngrandmother, and to be as fit for the ears of the one as for those of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nAn hour had passed after this during which she tended him, giving him\r\nfood and medicine, and he had slept before she ventured to allude to\r\nthe subject which was nearest to her heart. "John," she said at last,\r\n"I have been thinking about Chowton Farm."\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"It certainly should be bought."\r\n\r\n"If the man resolves on selling it."\r\n\r\n"Of course; I mean that. How much would it be?" Then he mentioned the\r\nsum which Twentyman had named, saying that he had inquired and had\r\nbeen told that the price was reasonable. "It is a large sum of money,\r\nJohn."\r\n\r\n"There might be a mortgage for part of it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like mortgages. The property would not be yours at all if\r\nit were mortgaged, as soon as bought. You would pay 5 per cent. for\r\nthe money and only get 3 per cent. from the land." The old lady\r\nunderstood all about it.\r\n\r\n"I could pay it off in two years," said the sick man.\r\n\r\n"There need be no paying off, and no mortgage, if I did it. I almost\r\nbelieve I have got enough to do it." He knew very well that she\r\nhad much more than enough. "I think more of this property than of\r\nanything in the world, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Chowton Farm could be yours, you know."\r\n\r\n"What should I do with Chowton Farm? I shall probably be in my grave\r\nbefore the slow lawyer would have executed the deeds." And I in mine,\r\nthought he to himself, before the present owner has quite made up his\r\nmind to part with his land. "What would a little place like that do\r\nfor me? But in my father-in-law\'s time it was part of the Bragton\r\nproperty. He sold it to pay the debts of a younger son, forgetting,\r\nas I thought, what he owed to the estate;"--It had in truth been sold\r\non behalf of the husband of this old woman who was now complaining.\r\n"And if it can be recovered it is our duty to get it back again. A\r\nproperty like this should never be lessened. It is in that way that\r\nthe country is given over to shopkeepers and speculators and is made\r\nto be like France or Italy. I quite think that Chowton Farm should be\r\nbought. And though I might die before it was done, I would find the\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"I knew what your feeling would be."\r\n\r\n"Yes, John. You could not but know it well. But--" Then she paused a\r\nmoment, looking into his face. "But I should wish to know what would\r\nbecome of it--eventually."\r\n\r\n"If it were yours you could do what you pleased with it."\r\n\r\n"But it would be yours."\r\n\r\n"Then it would go with the rest of the property."\r\n\r\n"To whom would it go? We have all to die, my dear, and who can say\r\nwhom it may please the Almighty to take first?"\r\n\r\n"In this house, ma\'am, every one can give a shrewd guess. I know\r\nmy own condition. If I die without children of my own every acre I\r\npossess will go to the proper heir. Thinking as you do, you ought to\r\nagree with me in that."\r\n\r\n"But who is the proper heir?"\r\n\r\n"My cousin Reginald. Do not let us contest it, ma\'am. As certainly as\r\nI lie here he will have Bragton when I am gone."\r\n\r\n"Will you not listen to me, John?"\r\n\r\n"Not about that. How could I die in peace were I to rob him?"\r\n\r\n"It is all your own,--to do as you like with."\r\n\r\n"It is all my own, but not to do as I like with. With your feelings,\r\nwith your ideas, how can you urge me to such an injustice?"\r\n\r\n"Do I want it for myself? I do not even want it for any one belonging\r\nto me. There is your cousin Peter."\r\n\r\n"If he were the heir he should have it,--though I know nothing of him\r\nand believe him to be but a poor creature and very unfit to have the\r\ncustody of a family property."\r\n\r\n"But he is his father\'s son."\r\n\r\n"I will believe nothing of that," said the sick man raising himself\r\nin his bed. "It is a slander;--it is based on no evidence whatsoever.\r\nNo one even thought of it but you."\r\n\r\n"John, is that the way to speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"It is the way to speak of an assertion so injurious." Then he fell\r\nback again on his pillows and she sat by his bedside for a full half\r\nhour speechless, thinking of it all. At the end of that time she had\r\nresolved that she would not yet give it up. Should he regain his\r\nhealth and strength,--and she would pray fervently night and day that\r\nGod would be so good to him,--then everything would be well. Then he\r\nwould marry and have children, and Bragton would descend in the right\r\nline. But were it to be ordained otherwise,--should it be God\'s will\r\nthat he must die,--then, as he grew weaker, he would become more\r\nplastic in her hands, and she might still prevail. At present he\r\nwas stubborn with the old stubbornness, and would not see with her\r\neyes. She would bide her time and be careful to have a lawyer ready.\r\nShe turned it all over in her mind, as she sat there watching him in\r\nhis sleep. She knew of no one but Mr. Masters whom she distrusted\r\nas being connected with the other side of the family,--whose\r\nfather had made that will by which the property in Dillsborough had\r\nbeen dissevered from Bragton. But Mr. Masters would probably obey\r\ninstructions if they were given to him definitely.\r\n\r\nShe thought of it all and then went down to lunch. She did not dare\r\nto refuse altogether to meet the other woman lest such resolve on\r\nher part might teach those in the house to think that Lady Ushant\r\nwas the mistress. She took her place at the head of the table and\r\ninterchanged a few words with her grandson\'s guest,--which of course\r\nhad reference to his health. Lady Ushant was very ill able to carry\r\non a battle of any sort and was willing to show her submission in\r\neverything,--unless she were desired to leave the house. While they\r\nwere still sitting at table, Reginald Morton walked into the room.\r\nIt had been his habit to do so regularly for the last week. A daily\r\nvisitor does not wait to have himself announced. Reginald had\r\nconsidered the matter and had determined that he would follow his\r\npractice just as though Mrs. Morton were not there. If she were civil\r\nto him then would he be very courteous to her. It had never occurred\r\nto him to expect conduct such as that with which she greeted him. The\r\nold woman got up and looked at him sternly. "My nephew, Reginald,"\r\nsaid Lady Ushant, supposing that some introduction might be\r\nnecessary. Mrs. Morton gathered the folds of her dress together and\r\nwithout a word stalked out of the room. And yet she believed,--she\r\ncould not but believe,--that her grandson was on his deathbed in the\r\nroom above!\r\n\r\n"O Reginald, what are we to do?" said Lady Ushant.\r\n\r\n"Is she like that to you?"\r\n\r\n"She told me last night that I was a stranger, and that I ought to\r\nleave the house."\r\n\r\n"And what did you say?"\r\n\r\n"I told her I should stay while he wished me to stay. But it is all\r\nso terrible, that I think I had better go."\r\n\r\n"I would not stir a step--on her account."\r\n\r\n"But why should she be so bitter? I have done nothing to offend her.\r\nIt is more than half of even my long lifetime since I saw her. She is\r\nnothing; but I have to think of his comfort. I suppose she is good\r\nto him; and though he may bid me stay such scenes as this in the\r\nhouse must be a trouble to him." Nevertheless Reginald was strong\r\nin opinion that Lady Ushant ought not to allow herself to be driven\r\naway, and declared his own purpose of coming daily as had of late\r\nbeen his wont.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Reginald was summoned to go upstairs and he again met\r\nthe angry woman in the passage, passing her of course without a word.\r\nAnd then Mary came to see her friend, and she also encountered Mrs.\r\nMorton, who was determined that no one should come into that house\r\nwithout her knowledge. "Who is that young woman?" said Mrs. Morton to\r\nthe old housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"That is Miss Masters, my Lady."\r\n\r\n"And who is Miss Masters,--and why does she come here at such a time\r\nas this?"\r\n\r\n"She is the daughter of Attorney Masters, my Lady. It was she as was\r\nbrought up here by Lady Ushant."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--that young person."\r\n\r\n"She\'s come here generally of a day now to see her ladyship."\r\n\r\n"And is she taken up to my grandson?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no, my Lady. She sits with Lady Ushant for an hour or so\r\nand then goes back with Mr. Reginald."\r\n\r\n"Oh--that is it, is it? The house is made use of for such purposes as\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there is any purposes, my Lady," said Mrs. Hopkins,\r\nalmost roused to indignation, although she was talking to the\r\nacknowledged mistress of the house whom she always called "my lady."\r\n\r\nLady Ushant told the whole story to her young friend, bitterly\r\nbewailing her position. "Reginald tells me not to go, but I do\r\nnot think that I can stand it. I should not mind the quarrel so\r\nmuch,--only that he is so ill."\r\n\r\n"She must be a very evil-minded person."\r\n\r\n"She was always arrogant and always hard. I can remember her just the\r\nsame; but that was so many years ago. She left Bragton then because\r\nshe could not banish his mother from the house. But to bear it all in\r\nher heart so long is not like a human being,--let alone a woman. What\r\ndid he say to you going home yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Lady Ushant."\r\n\r\n"Does he know that it will all be his if that poor young man should\r\ndie? He never speaks to me as if he thought of it."\r\n\r\n"He would certainly not speak to me about it. I do not think he\r\nthinks of it. He is not like that."\r\n\r\n"Men do consider such things. And they are only cousins; and they\r\nhave never known each other! Oh, Mary!"\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of, Lady Ushant?"\r\n\r\n"Men ought not to care for money or position, but they do. If he\r\ncomes here, all that I have will be yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Ushant!"\r\n\r\n"It is not much but it will be enough."\r\n\r\n"I do not want to hear about such things now."\r\n\r\n"But you ought to be told. Ah, dear;--if it could be as I wish!" The\r\nimprudent, weak-minded, loving old woman longed to hear a tale of\r\nmutual love,--longed to do something which should cause such a tale\r\nto be true on both sides. And yet she could not quite bring herself\r\nto express her wish either to the man or to the woman.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary almost understood it, but was not quite sure of her\r\nfriend\'s meaning. She was, however, quite sure that if such were the\r\nwish of Lady Ushant\'s heart, Lady Ushant was wishing in vain. She had\r\ntwice walked back to Dillsborough with Reginald Morton, and he had\r\nbeen more sedate, more middle-aged, less like a lover than ever. She\r\nknew now that she might safely walk with him, being sure that he was\r\nno more likely to talk of love than would have been old Dr. Nupper\r\nhad she accepted the offer which he had made her of a cast in his\r\ngig. And now that Reginald would probably become Squire of Bragton\r\nit was more impossible than ever. As Squire of Bragton he would seek\r\nsome highly born bride, quite out of her way, whom she could never\r\nknow. And then she would see neither him--nor Bragton any more. Would\r\nit not have been better that she should have married Larry Twentyman\r\nand put an end to so many troubles beside her own?\r\n\r\nAgain she walked back with him to Dillsborough, passing as they\r\nalways did across the little bridge. He seemed to be very silent as\r\nhe went, more so than usual,--and as was her wont with him she only\r\nspoke to him when he addressed her. It was only when he got out on\r\nthe road that he told her what was on his mind. "Mary," he said, "how\r\nwill it be with me if that poor fellow dies?"\r\n\r\n"In what way, Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"All that place will be mine. He told me so just now."\r\n\r\n"But that would be of course."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. He might give it to you if he pleased. He could not have\r\nan heir who would care for it less. But it is right that it should\r\nbe so. Whether it would suit my taste or not to live as Squire of\r\nBragton,--and I do not think it would suit my taste well,--it ought\r\nto be so. I am the next, and it will be my duty."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you do not want him to die."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. If I could save him by my right hand,--if I could save\r\nhim by my life, I would do it."\r\n\r\n"But of all lives it must surely be the best."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so? What is such a one likely to do? But then what do I\r\ndo, as it is? It is the sort of life you would like,--if you were a\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--if I were a man," said Mary. Then he again relapsed into\r\nsilence and hardly spoke again till he left her at her father\'s door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST EFFORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mary reached her home she was at once met by her stepmother\r\nin the passage with tidings of importance. "He is up-stairs in\r\nthe drawing-room," said Mrs. Masters. Mary whose mind was laden\r\nwith thoughts of Reginald Morton asked who was the he. "Lawrence\r\nTwentyman," said Mrs. Masters. "And now, my dear, do, do think of it\r\nbefore you go to him." There was no anger now in her stepmother\'s\r\nface,--but entreaty and almost love. She had not called Mary "my\r\ndear" for many weeks past,--not since that journey to Cheltenham. Now\r\nshe grasped the girl\'s hand as she went on with her prayer. "He is\r\nso good and so true! And what better can there be for you? With your\r\nadvantages, and Lady Ushant, and all that, you would be quite the\r\nlady at Chowton. Think of your father and sisters;--what a good you\r\ncould do them! And think of the respect they all have for him, dining\r\nwith Lord Rufford the other day and all the other gentlemen. It isn\'t\r\nonly that he has got plenty to live on, but he knows how to keep it\r\nas a man ought. He\'s sure to hold up his head and be as good a squire\r\nas any of \'em." This was a very different tale;--a note altogether\r\nchanged! It must not be said that the difference of the tale and\r\nthe change of the note affected Mary\'s heart; but her stepmother\'s\r\nmanner to her did soften her. And then why should she regard herself\r\nor her own feelings? Like others she had thought much of her own\r\nhappiness, had made herself the centre of her own circle, had, in her\r\nimagination, built castles in the air and filled them according to\r\nher fancy. But her fancies had been all shattered into fragments;\r\nnot a stone of her castles was standing; she had told herself\r\nunconsciously that there was no longer a circle and no need for a\r\ncentre. That last half-hour which she had passed with Reginald Morton\r\non the road home had made quite sure that which had been sure enough\r\nbefore. He was now altogether out of her reach, thinking only of the\r\nnew duties which were coming to him. She would never walk with him\r\nagain; never put herself in the way of indulging some fragment of an\r\nillusory hope. She was nothing now,--nothing even to herself. Why\r\nshould she not give herself and her services to this young man if the\r\nyoung man chose to take her as she was? It would be well that she\r\nshould do something in the world. Why should she not look after his\r\nhouse, and mend his shirts, and reign over his poultry yard? In this\r\nway she would be useful, and respected by all,--unless perhaps by the\r\nman she loved. "Mary, say that you will think of it once more,"\r\npleaded Mrs. Masters.\r\n\r\n"I may go up-stairs,--to my own room?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly; do;--go up and smooth your hair. I will tell him that\r\nyou are coming to him. He will wait. But he is so much in earnest\r\nnow,--and so sad,--that I know he will not come again."\r\n\r\nThen Mary went up-stairs, determined to think of it. She began\r\nat once, woman-like, to smooth her hair as her stepmother had\r\nrecommended, and to remove the dust of the road from her face and\r\ndress. But not the less was she thinking of it the while. Could she\r\ndo it, how much pain would be spared even to herself! How much that\r\nwas now bitter as gall in her mouth would become,--not sweet,--but\r\ntasteless. There are times in one\'s life in which the absence of all\r\nsavour seems to be sufficient for life in this world. Were she to do\r\nthis thing she thought that she would have strength to banish that\r\nother man from her mind,--and at last from her heart. He would be\r\nthere, close to her, but of a different kind and leading a different\r\nlife. Mrs. Masters had told her that Larry would be as good a\r\nsquire as the best of them; but it should be her care to keep him\r\nand herself in their proper position, to teach him the vanity of\r\nsuch aspirations. And the real squire opposite, who would despise\r\nher,--for had he not told her that she would be despicable if she\r\nmarried this man,--would not trouble her then. They might meet on the\r\nroads, and there would be a cold question or two as to each other\'s\r\nwelfare, and a vain shaking of hands,--but they would know nothing\r\nand care for nothing as to each other\'s thoughts. And there would\r\ncome some stately dame who hearing how things had been many years\r\nago, would perhaps--. But no;--the stately dame should be received\r\nwith courtesy, but there should be no patronising. Even in these few\r\nminutes up-stairs she thought much of the stately dame and was quite\r\nsure that she would endure no patronage from Bragton.\r\n\r\nShe almost thought that she could do it. There were hideous ideas\r\nafflicting her soul dreadfully, but which she strove to banish. Of\r\ncourse she could not love him,--not at first. But all those who\r\nwished her to marry him, including himself, knew that;--and still\r\nthey wished her to marry him. How could that be disgraceful which all\r\nher friends desired? Her father, to whom she was, as she knew well,\r\nthe very apple of his eye, wished her to marry this man;--and yet her\r\nfather knew that her heart was elsewhere. Had not women done it by\r\nhundreds, by thousands, and had afterwards performed their duties\r\nwell as mothers and wives. In other countries, as she had read, girls\r\ntook the husbands found for them by their parents as a matter of\r\ncourse. As she left the room, and slowly crept down-stairs, she\r\nalmost thought she would do it. She almost thought;--but yet, when\r\nher hand was on the lock, she could not bring herself to say that it\r\nshould be so.\r\n\r\nHe was not dressed as usual. In the first place, there was a round\r\nhat on the table, such as men wear in cities. She had never before\r\nseen such a hat with him except on a Sunday. And he wore a black\r\ncloth coat, and dark brown pantaloons, and a black silk handkerchief.\r\nShe observed it all, and thought that he had not changed for\r\nthe better. As she looked into his face, it seemed to her more\r\ncommon,--meaner than before. No doubt he was good-looking,--but his\r\ngood-looks were almost repulsive to her. He had altogether lost his\r\nlittle swagger;--but he had borne that little swagger well, and in\r\nher presence it had never been offensive. Now he seemed as though\r\nhe had thrown aside all the old habits of his life, and was pining\r\nto death from the loss of them. "Mary," he said, "I have come to\r\nyou,--for the last time. I thought I would give myself one more\r\nchance, and your father told me that I might have it." He paused, as\r\nthough expecting an answer. But she had not yet quite made up her\r\nmind. Had she known her mind, she would have answered him frankly.\r\nShe was quite resolved as to that. If she could once bring herself to\r\ngive him her hand, she would not coy it for a moment. "I will be your\r\nwife, Larry." That was the form on which she had determined, should\r\nshe find herself able to yield. But she had not brought herself to\r\nit as yet. "If you can take me, Mary, you will,--well,--save me from\r\nlifelong misery, and make the man who loves you the best-contented\r\nand the happiest man in England."\r\n\r\n"But, Larry, I do not love you."\r\n\r\n"I will make you love me. Good usage will make a wife love her\r\nhusband. Don\'t you think you can trust me?"\r\n\r\n"I do believe that I can trust you for everything good."\r\n\r\n"Is that nothing?"\r\n\r\n"It is a great deal, Larry, but not enough;--not enough to bring\r\ntogether a man and woman as husband and wife. I would sooner marry a\r\nman I loved, though I knew he would ill-use me."\r\n\r\n"Would you?"\r\n\r\n"To marry either would be wrong."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think, dearest, that if I could talk better I should be\r\nbetter able to persuade you."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think you talk so well that I ought to be\r\npersuaded;--but I can\'t. It is not lack of talking."\r\n\r\n"What is it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Just this;--my heart does not turn itself that way. It is the same\r\nchance that has made you--partial to me."\r\n\r\n"Partial! Why, I love the very air you breathe. When I am near you,\r\neverything smells sweet. There isn\'t anything that belongs to you but\r\nI think I should know it, though I found it a hundred miles away. To\r\nhave you in the room with me would be like heaven,--if I only knew\r\nthat you were thinking kindly of me."\r\n\r\n"I always think kindly of you, Larry."\r\n\r\n"Then say that you will be my wife." She paused, and became red up to\r\nthe roots of her hair. She seated herself on a chair, and then rose\r\nagain,--and again sat down. The struggle was going on within her, and\r\nhe perceived something of the truth. "Say the word once, Mary;--say\r\nit but once." And as he prayed to her he came forward and went down\r\nupon his knees.\r\n\r\n"I cannot do it," she replied at last, speaking very hoarsely, not\r\nlooking at him, not even addressing herself to him.\r\n\r\n"Mary!"\r\n\r\n"Larry, I cannot do it. I have tried, but I cannot do it. O Larry,\r\ndear Larry, do not ask me again. Larry, I have no heart to give.\r\nAnother man has it all."\r\n\r\n"Is it so?" She bowed her head in token of assent. "Is it that young\r\nparson?" exclaimed Larry, in anger.\r\n\r\n"It is not. But, Larry, you must ask no questions now. I have told\r\nyou my secret that all this might be set at rest. But if you are\r\ngenerous, as I know you are, you will keep my secret, and will ask no\r\nquestions. And, Larry, if you are unhappy, so am I. If your heart is\r\nsore, so is mine. He knows nothing of my love, and cares nothing for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Then throw him aside."\r\n\r\nShe smiled and shook her head. "Do you think I would not if I could?\r\nWhy do you not throw me aside?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mary!"\r\n\r\n"Cannot I love as well as you? You are a man, and have the liberty to\r\nspeak of it. Though I cannot return it, I can be proud of your love\r\nand feel grateful to you. I cannot tell mine. I cannot think of it\r\nwithout blushing. But I can feel it, and know it, and be as sure that\r\nit has trodden me down and got the better of me as you can. But you\r\ncan go out into the world and teach yourself to forget."\r\n\r\n"I must go away from here then."\r\n\r\n"You have your business and your pleasures, your horses and your\r\nfields and your friends. I have nothing,--but to remain here and know\r\nthat I have disobliged all those that love me. Do you think, Larry, I\r\nwould not go and be your wife if I could? I have told you all, Larry,\r\nand now do not ask me again."\r\n\r\n"Is it so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is so."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall cut it all. I shall sell Chowton and go away. You tell\r\nme I have my horses and my pleasures! What pleasures? I know nothing\r\nof my horses,--not whether they are lame or sound. I could not tell\r\nyou of one of them whether he is fit to go to-morrow. Business! The\r\nplace may farm itself for me, for I can\'t stay there. Everything\r\nsickens me to look at it. Pleasures indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Is that manly, Larry?"\r\n\r\n"How can a man be manly when the manliness is knocked out of him?\r\nA man\'s courage lies in his heart;--but if his heart is broken\r\nwhere will his courage be then? I couldn\'t hold my head up here any\r\nmore,--and I shall go."\r\n\r\n"You must not do that," she said, getting up and laying hold of his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"But I must do it."\r\n\r\n"For my sake you must stay here, Larry;--so that I may not have to\r\nthink that I have injured you so deeply. Larry, though I cannot be\r\nyour wife I think I could die of sorrow if you were always unhappy.\r\nWhat is a poor girl that you should grieve for her in that way? I\r\nthink if I were a man I would master my love better than that." He\r\nshook his head and faintly strove to drag his arm from out of her\r\ngrasp. "Promise me that you will take a year to think of it before\r\nyou go."\r\n\r\n"Will you take a year to think of me?" said he, rising again to\r\nsudden hope.\r\n\r\n"No, Larry, no. I should deceive you were I to say so. I deceived\r\nyou before when I put it off for two months. But you can promise me\r\nwithout deceit. For my sake, Larry?" And she almost embraced him as\r\nshe begged for his promise. "I know you would wish to spare me pain.\r\nThink what will be my sufferings if I hear that you have really gone\r\nfrom Chowton. You will promise me, Larry?"\r\n\r\n"Promise what?"\r\n\r\n"That the farm shall not be sold for twelve months."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--I\'ll promise. I don\'t care for the farm."\r\n\r\n"And stay there if you can. Don\'t leave the place to strangers. And\r\ngo about your business,--and hunt,--and be a man. I shall always\r\nbe thinking of what you do. I shall always watch you. I shall\r\nalways love you,--always,--always,--always. I always have loved\r\nyou;--because you are so good. But it is a different love. And now,\r\nLarry, good-bye." So saying, she raised her face to look into his\r\neyes. Then he suddenly put his arm round her waist, kissed her\r\nforehead, and left the room without another word.\r\n\r\nMrs. Masters saw him as he went, and must have known from his\r\ngait what was the nature of the answer he had received. But yet\r\nshe went quickly upstairs to inquire. The matter was one of too\r\nmuch consequence for a mere inference. Mary had gone from the\r\nsitting-room, but her stepmother followed her upstairs to her\r\nbed-chamber. "Mamma," she said, "I couldn\'t do it;--I couldn\'t do\r\nit. I did try. Pray do not scold me. I did try, but I could not\r\ndo it." Then she threw herself into the arms of the unsympathetic\r\nwoman,--who, however, was now somewhat less unsympathetic than she\r\nhad hitherto been.\r\n\r\nMrs. Masters did not understand it at all; but she did perceive that\r\nthere was something which she did not understand. What did the girl\r\nmean by saying that she had tried and could not do it? Try to do\r\nit! If she tried why could she not tell the man that she would have\r\nhim? There was surely some shamefacedness in this, some overstrained\r\nmodesty which she, Mrs. Masters, could not comprehend. How could she\r\nhave tried to accept a man who was so anxious to marry her, and have\r\nfailed in the effort? "Scolding I suppose will be no good now," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Oh no!"\r\n\r\n"But--. Well; I suppose we must put up with it. Everything on earth\r\nthat a girl could possibly wish for! He was that in love that it\'s my\r\nbelief he\'d have settled it all on you if you\'d only asked him."\r\n\r\n"Let it go, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Let it go! It\'s gone I suppose. Well;--I ain\'t going to say any more\r\nabout it. But as for not sorrowing, how is a woman not to sorrow when\r\nso much has been lost? It\'s your poor father I\'m thinking of, Mary."\r\nThis was so much better than she had expected that poor Mary almost\r\nfelt that her heart was lightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAGAIN AT MISTLETOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will have been aware that Arabella Trefoil was not a\r\nfavourite at Mistletoe. She was so much disliked by the Duchess that\r\nthere had almost been words about her between her Grace and the Duke\r\nsince her departure. The Duchess always submitted, and it was the\r\nrule of her life to submit with so good a grace that her husband,\r\nnever fearing rebellion, should never be driven to assume the tyrant.\r\nBut on this occasion the Duke had objected to the term "thoroughly\r\nbad girl" which had been applied by his wife to his niece. He had\r\nsaid that "thoroughly bad girl" was strong language, and when the\r\nDuchess defended the phrase he had expressed his opinion that\r\nArabella was only a bad girl and not a thoroughly bad girl. The\r\nDuchess had said that it was the same thing. "Then," said the Duke,\r\n"why use a redundant expletive against your own relative?" The\r\nDuchess, when she was accused of strong language, had not minded\r\nit much; but her feelings were hurt when a redundant expletive was\r\nattributed to her. The effect of all this had been that the Duke\r\nin a mild way had taken up Arabella\'s part, and that the Duchess,\r\nfollowing her husband at last, had been brought round to own that\r\nArabella, though bad, had been badly treated. She had disbelieved,\r\nand then believed, and had again disbelieved Arabella\'s own statement\r\nas to the offer of marriage. But the girl had certainly been in\r\nearnest when she had begged her aunt to ask her uncle to speak to\r\nLord Rufford. Surely when she did she must have thought that an offer\r\nhad been made to her. Such offer, if made, had no doubt been produced\r\nby very hard pressure;--but still an offer of marriage is an offer,\r\nand a girl, if she can obtain it, has a right to use such an offer as\r\nso much property. Then came Lord Mistletoe\'s report after his meeting\r\nwith Arabella up in London. He had been unable to give his cousin\r\nany satisfaction, but he was clearly of opinion that she had been\r\nill-used. He did not venture to suggest any steps, but did think that\r\nLord Rufford was bound as a gentleman to marry the young lady. After\r\nthat Lord Augustus saw her mother up in town and said that it was a\r\nd---- shame. He in truth had believed nothing and would have been\r\ndelighted to allow the matter to drop. But as this was not permitted,\r\nhe thought it easier to take his daughter\'s part than to encounter\r\nfamily enmity by entering the lists against her. So it came to pass\r\nthat down at Mistletoe there grew an opinion that Lord Rufford ought\r\nto marry Arabella Trefoil.\r\n\r\nBut what should be done? The Duke was alive to the feeling that as\r\nthe girl was certainly his niece and as she was not to be regarded\r\nas a thoroughly bad girl, some assistance was due to her from the\r\nfamily. Lord Mistletoe volunteered to write to Lord Rufford; Lord\r\nAugustus thought that his brother should have a personal interview\r\nwith his young brother peer and bring his strawberry leaves to\r\nbear. The Duke himself suggested that the Duchess should see Lady\r\nPenwether,--a scheme to which her Grace objected strongly, knowing\r\nsomething of Lady Penwether and being sure that her strawberry leaves\r\nwould have no effect whatever on the baronet\'s wife. At last it was\r\ndecided that a family meeting should be held, and Lord Augustus was\r\nabsolutely summoned to meet Lord Mistletoe at the paternal mansion.\r\n\r\nIt was now some years since Lord Augustus had been at Mistletoe. As\r\nhe had never been separated,--that is formally separated,--from his\r\nwife he and she had been always invited there together. Year after\r\nyear she had accepted the invitation,--and it had been declined on\r\nhis behalf, because it did not suit him and his wife to meet each\r\nother. But now he was obliged to go there,--just at the time of\r\nthe year when whist at his club was most attractive. To meet the\r\nconvenience of Lord Mistletoe,--and the House of Commons--a Saturday\r\nafternoon was named for the conference, which made it worse for Lord\r\nAugustus as he was one of a little party which had private gatherings\r\nfor whist on Sunday afternoons. But he went to the conference,\r\ntravelling down by the same train with his nephew; but not in the\r\nsame compartment, as he solaced with tobacco the time which Lord\r\nMistletoe devoted to parliamentary erudition.\r\n\r\nThe four met in her Grace\'s boudoir, and the Duke began by declaring\r\nthat all this was very sad. Lord Augustus shook his head and put his\r\nhands in his trousers pockets,--which was as much as to say that his\r\nfeelings as a British parent were almost too strong for him. "Your\r\nmother and I think, that something ought to be done," said the Duke\r\nturning to his son.\r\n\r\n"Something ought to be done," said Lord Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n"They won\'t let a fellow go out with a fellow now," said Lord\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid!" said the Duchess, raising both her hands.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking, Mistletoe, that your mother might have met Lady\r\nPenwether."\r\n\r\n"What could I do with Lady Penwether, Duke? Or what could she do with\r\nhim? A man won\'t care for what his sister says to him. And I don\'t\r\nsuppose she\'d undertake to speak to Lord Rufford on the subject."\r\n\r\n"Lady Penwether is an honourable and an accomplished woman."\r\n\r\n"I dare say;--though she gives herself abominable airs."\r\n\r\n"Of course, if you don\'t like it, my dear, it shan\'t be pressed."\r\n\r\n"I thought, perhaps, you\'d see him yourself," said Lord Augustus,\r\nturning to his brother. "You\'d carry more weight than anybody."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will if it be necessary; but it would be\r\ndisagreeable,--very disagreeable. The appeal should be made to\r\nhis feelings, and that I think would better come through female\r\ninfluence. As far as I know the world a man is always more prone to\r\nbe led in such matters by a woman than by another man."\r\n\r\n"If you mean me," said the Duchess, "I don\'t think I could see him.\r\nOf course, Augustus, I don\'t wish to say anything hard of Arabella.\r\nThe fact that we have all met here to take her part will prove that,\r\nI think. But I didn\'t quite approve of all that was done here."\r\n\r\nLord Augustus stroked his beard and looked out of the window. "I\r\ndon\'t think, my dear, we need go into that just now," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said the Duchess, "and I don\'t intend to say a word.\r\nOnly if I were to meet Lord Rufford he might refer to things\r\nwhich,--which,--which--. In point of fact I had rather not."\r\n\r\n"I might see him," suggested Lord Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n"No doubt that might be done with advantage," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Only that, as he is my senior in age, what I might say to him would\r\nlack that weight which any observations which might be made on such a\r\nmatter should carry with them."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t care a straw for me," said Lord Augustus.\r\n\r\n"And then," continued Lord Mistletoe, "I so completely agree with\r\nwhat my father says as to the advantage of female influence! With a\r\nman of Lord Rufford\'s temperament female influence is everything. If\r\nmy aunt were to try it?" Lord Augustus blew the breath out of his\r\nmouth and raised his eyebrows. Knowing what he did of his wife, or\r\nthinking that he knew what he did, he did not conceive it possible\r\nthat a worse messenger should be chosen. He had known himself to be a\r\nvery bad one, but he did honestly believe her to be even less fitted\r\nfor the task than he himself. But he said nothing,--simply wishing\r\nthat he had not left his whist for such a purpose as this.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Lady Augustus had better see him," said the Duke. The\r\nDuchess, who did not love hypocrisy, would not actually assent to\r\nthis, but she said nothing. "I suppose my sister-in-law would not\r\nobject, Augustus?"\r\n\r\n"G---- Almighty only knows," said the younger brother. The Duchess,\r\ngrievously offended by the impropriety of this language, drew herself\r\nup haughtily.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you would not mind suggesting it to her, sir," said Lord\r\nMistletoe.\r\n\r\n"I could do that by letter," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"And when she has assented, as of course she will, then perhaps you\r\nwouldn\'t mind writing a line to him to make an appointment. If you\r\nwere to do so he could not refuse." To this proposition the Duke\r\nreturned no immediate answer; but looked at it round and round\r\ncarefully. At last, however, he acceded to this also, and so the\r\nmatter was arranged. All these influential members of the ducal\r\nfamily met together at the ducal mansion on Arabella\'s behalf,\r\nand settled their difficulty by deputing the work of bearding the\r\nlion, of tying the bell on the cat, to an absent lady whom they all\r\ndespised and disliked.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the Duke, with the assistance of his son, who was a\r\ngreat writer of letters, prepared an epistle to his sister-in-law and\r\nanother to Lord Rufford, which was to be sent as soon as Lady Augusta\r\nhad agreed to the arrangement. In the former letter a good deal was\r\nsaid as to a mother\'s solicitude for her daughter. It had been felt,\r\nthe letter said, that no one could speak for a daughter so well as a\r\nmother;--that no other\'s words would so surely reach the heart of a\r\nman who was not all evil but who was tempted by the surroundings of\r\nthe world to do evil in this particular case. The letter began "My\r\ndear sister-in-law," and ended "Your affectionate brother-in-law,\r\nMayfair," and was in fact the first letter that the Duke had ever\r\nwritten to his brother\'s wife. The other letter was more difficult,\r\nbut it was accomplished at last, and confined itself to a request\r\nthat Lord Rufford would meet Lady Augustus Trefoil at a place and at\r\na time, both of which were for the present left blank.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday Lord Augustus and Lord Mistletoe were driven to the\r\nstation in the same carriage, and on this occasion the uncle said a\r\nfew strong words to his nephew on the subject. Lord Augustus, though\r\nperhaps a coward in the presence of his brother, was not so with\r\nother members of the family. "It may be very well you know, but it\'s\r\nall d---- nonsense."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry that you should think so, uncle."\r\n\r\n"What do you suppose her mother can do?--a thoroughly vulgar woman.\r\nI never could live with her. As far as I can see wherever she goes\r\neverybody hates her."\r\n\r\n"My dear uncle!"\r\n\r\n"Rufford will only laugh at her. If Mayfair would have gone himself,\r\nit is just possible that he might have done something."\r\n\r\n"My father is so unwilling to mix himself up in these things."\r\n\r\n"Of course he is. Everybody knows that. What the deuce was the good\r\nthen of our going down there? I couldn\'t do anything, and I knew\r\nhe wouldn\'t. The truth is, Mistletoe, a man now-a-days may do just\r\nwhat he pleases. You ain\'t in that line and it won\'t do you any good\r\nknowing it, but since we did away with pistols everybody may do just\r\nwhat he likes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like brute force," said Lord Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n"You may call it what you please:--but I don\'t know that it was so\r\nbrutal after all." At the station they separated again, as Lord\r\nAugustus was panting for tobacco and Lord Mistletoe for parliamentary\r\nerudition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SUCCESS OF LADY AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Augustus was still staying with the Connop Greens in Hampshire\r\nwhen she received the Duke\'s letter and Arabella was with her. The\r\nstory of Lord Rufford\'s infidelity had been told to Mrs. Connop\r\nGreen,--and, of course through her to Mr. Connop Green. Both the\r\nmother and daughter affected to despise the Connop Greens;--but it is\r\nso hard to restrain oneself from confidences when difficulties arise!\r\nArabella had by this time quite persuaded herself that there had been\r\nan absolute engagement, and did in truth believe that she had been\r\nmost cruelly ill-used. She was headstrong, fickle, and beyond measure\r\ninsolent to her mother. She had, as we know, at one time gone down\r\nto the house of her former lover, thereby indicating that she had\r\nabandoned all hope of catching Lord Rufford. But still the Connop\r\nGreens either felt or pretended to feel great sympathy with her, and\r\nshe would still declare from time to time that Lord Rufford had not\r\nheard the last of her. It was now more than a month since she had\r\nseen that perjured lord at Mistletoe, and more than a week since her\r\nfather had brought him so uselessly up to London. Though determined\r\nthat Lord Rufford should hear more of her, she hardly knew how\r\nto go to work, and on these days spent most of her time in idle\r\ndenunciations of her false lover. Then came her uncle\'s letter, which\r\nwas of course shown to her.\r\n\r\nShe was quite of opinion that they must do as the Duke directed. It\r\nwas so great a thing to have the Duke interesting himself in the\r\nmatter, that she would have assented to anything proposed by him.\r\nThe suggestion even inspired some temporary respect, or at any rate\r\nobservance, towards her mother. Hitherto her mother had been nobody\r\nto her in the matter, a person belonging to her whom she had to\r\nregard simply as a burden. She could not at all understand how the\r\nDuke had been guided in making such a choice of a new emissary;--but\r\nthere it was under his own hand, and she must now in some measure\r\nsubmit herself to her mother unless she were prepared to repudiate\r\naltogether the Duke\'s assistance. As to Lady Augustus herself, the\r\nsuggestion gave to her quite a new life. She had no clear conception\r\nwhat she should say to Lord Rufford if the meeting were arranged,\r\nbut it was gratifying to her to find herself brought back into\r\nauthority over her daughter. She read the Duke\'s letter to Mrs.\r\nConnop Green, with certain very slight additions,--or innuendos as to\r\nadditions,--and was pleased to find that the letter was taken by Mrs.\r\nConnop Green as positive proof of the existence of the engagement.\r\nShe wrote begging the Duke to allow her to have the meeting at the\r\nfamily house in Piccadilly, and to this prayer the Duke was obliged\r\nto assent. "It would," she said, "give her so much assistance in\r\nspeaking to Lord Rufford!" She named a day also, and then spent her\r\ntime in preparing herself for the interview by counsel with Mrs.\r\nGreen and by exacting explanations from her daughter.\r\n\r\nThis was a very bad time for Arabella,--so bad, that had she known to\r\nwhat she would be driven, she would probably have repudiated the Duke\r\nand her mother altogether. "Now, my dear," she began, "you must tell\r\nme everything that occurred first at Rufford, and then at Mistletoe."\r\n\r\n"You know very well what occurred, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it, and unless everything is told me I will\r\nnot undertake this mission. Your uncle evidently thinks that by my\r\ninterference the thing may be arranged. I have had the same idea all\r\nthrough myself, but as you have been so obstinate I have not liked to\r\nsay so. Now, Arabella, begin from the beginning. When was it that he\r\nfirst suggested to you the idea of marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, mamma!"\r\n\r\n"I must have it from the beginning to the end. Did he speak of\r\nmarriage at Rufford? I suppose he did because you told me that you\r\nwere engaged to him when you went to Mistletoe."\r\n\r\n"So I was."\r\n\r\n"What had he said?"\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! How am I to remember what he said? As if a girl ever\r\nknows what a man says to her."\r\n\r\n"Did he kiss you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"At Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot stand this, mamma. If you like to go you may go. My uncle\r\nseems to think it is the best thing, and so I suppose it ought to be\r\ndone. But I won\'t answer such questions as you are asking for Lord\r\nRufford and all that he possesses."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say then? How am I to call back to his recollection the\r\nfact that he committed himself, unless you will tell me how and when\r\nhe did so?"\r\n\r\n"Ask him if he did not assure me of his love when we were in the\r\ncarriage together."\r\n\r\n"What carriage?"\r\n\r\n"Coming home from hunting."\r\n\r\n"Was that at Mistletoe or Rufford?"\r\n\r\n"At Mistletoe, mamma," replied Arabella, stamping her foot.\r\n\r\n"But you must let me know how it was that you became engaged to him\r\nat Rufford."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, you mean to drive me mad," exclaimed Arabella as she bounced\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nThere was very much more of this, till at last Arabella found herself\r\ncompelled to invent facts. Lord Rufford, she said, had assured her\r\nof his everlasting affection in the little room at Rufford, and had\r\nabsolutely asked her to be his wife coming home in the carriage with\r\nher to Stamford. She told herself that though this was not strictly\r\ntrue, it was as good as true,--as that which was actually done and\r\nsaid by Lord Rufford on those occasions could have had no other\r\nmeaning. But before her mother had completed her investigation,\r\nArabella had become so sick of the matter that she shut herself up in\r\nher room and declared that nothing on earth should induce her to open\r\nher mouth on the subject again.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Rufford received the letter he was aghast with new disgust.\r\nHe had begun to flatter himself that his interview with Lord Augustus\r\nwould be the end of the affair. Looking at it by degrees with\r\ncoolness he had allowed himself to think that nothing very terrible\r\ncould be done to him. Some few people, particularly interested in\r\nthe Mistletoe family, might give him a cold shoulder, or perhaps cut\r\nhim directly; but such people would not belong to his own peculiar\r\ncircle, and the annoyance would not be great. But if all the family,\r\none after another, were to demand interviews with him up in London,\r\nhe did not see when the end of it would be. There would be the Duke\r\nhimself, and the Duchess, and Mistletoe. And the affair would in this\r\nway become gossip for the whole town. He was almost minded to write\r\nto the Duke saying that such an interview could do no good; but at\r\nlast he thought it best to submit the matter to his mentor, Sir\r\nGeorge Penwether. Sir George was clearly of opinion that it was Lord\r\nRufford\'s duty to see Lady Augustus. "Yes, you must have interviews\r\nwith all of them, if they ask it," said Sir George. "You must show\r\nthat you are not afraid to hear what her friends have got to say.\r\nWhen a man gets wrong he can\'t put himself right without some little\r\nannoyance."\r\n\r\n"Since the world began," said Lord Rufford, "I don\'t think that there\r\nwas ever a man born so well adapted for preaching sermons as you\r\nare." Nevertheless he did as he was bid, and consented to meet Lady\r\nAugustus in Piccadilly on the day named by her. On that very day\r\nthe hounds met at Impington and Lord Rufford began to feel his\r\npunishment. He assented to the proposal made and went up to London,\r\nleaving the members of the U. R. U. to have the run of the season\r\nfrom the Impington coverts.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Augustus was sitting in the back room of the mansion\r\nwaiting for Lord Rufford she was very much puzzled to think what she\r\nwould say to him when he came. With all her investigation she had\r\nreceived no clear idea of the circumstances as they occurred. That\r\nher daughter had told her a fib in saying that she was engaged when\r\nshe went to Mistletoe, she was all but certain. That something had\r\noccurred in the carriage which might be taken for an offer she\r\nthought possible. She therefore determined to harp upon the carriage\r\nas much as possible and to say as little as might be as to the doings\r\nat Rufford. Then as she was trying to arrange her countenance and her\r\ndress and her voice, so that they might tell on his feelings, Lord\r\nRufford was announced. "Lady Augustus," said he at once, beginning\r\nthe lesson which he had taught himself, "I hope I see you quite well.\r\nI have come here because you have asked me, but I really don\'t know\r\nthat I have anything to say."\r\n\r\n"Lord Rufford, you must hear me."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I will hear you certainly, only this kind of thing is so\r\npainful to all parties, and I don\'t see the use of it."\r\n\r\n"Are you aware that you have plunged me and my daughter into a state\r\nof misery too deep to be fathomed?"\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to think that."\r\n\r\n"How can it be otherwise? When you assure a girl in her position in\r\nlife that you love her--a lady whose rank is quite as high as your\r\nown--"\r\n\r\n"Quite so,--quite so."\r\n\r\n"And when in return for that assurance you have received vows of love\r\nfrom her,--what is she to think, and what are her friends to think?"\r\nLord Rufford had always kept in his mind a clear remembrance of the\r\ntransaction in the carriage, and was well aware that the young lady\'s\r\nmother had inverted the circumstances, or, as he expressed it to\r\nhimself, had put the cart before the horse. He had assured the young\r\nlady that he loved her, and he had also been assured of her love;\r\nbut her assurance had come first. He felt that this made all the\r\ndifference in the world; so much difference that no one cognisant in\r\nsuch matters would hold that his assurance, obtained after such a\r\nfashion, meant anything at all. But how was he to explain this to the\r\nlady\'s mother? "You will admit that such assurances were given?"\r\ncontinued Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t know. There was a little foolish talk, but it\r\nmeant nothing."\r\n\r\n"My lord!"\r\n\r\n"What am I to say? I don\'t want to give offence, and I am heartily\r\nsorry that you and your daughter should be under any misapprehension.\r\nBut as I sit here there was no engagement between us;--nor, if I must\r\nspeak out, Lady Augustus, could your daughter have thought that there\r\nwas an engagement."\r\n\r\n"Did you not--embrace her?"\r\n\r\n"I did. That\'s the truth."\r\n\r\n"And after that you mean to say--"\r\n\r\n"After that I mean to say that nothing more was intended." There was\r\na certain meanness of appearance about the mother which emboldened\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"What a declaration to make to the mother of a young lady, and that\r\nyoung lady the niece of the Duke of Mayfair!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the first time such a thing has been done, Lady Augustus."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about that,--nothing. I don\'t know whom you may have\r\nlived with. It never was done to her before."\r\n\r\n"If I understand right she was engaged to marry Mr. Morton when she\r\ncame to Rufford."\r\n\r\n"It was all at an end before that."\r\n\r\n"At any rate you both came from his house."\r\n\r\n"Where he had been staying with Mrs. Morton."\r\n\r\n"And where she has been since,--without Mrs. Morton."\r\n\r\n"Lady Ushant was there, Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"But she has been staying at the house of this gentleman to whom you\r\nadmit that she was engaged a short time before she came to us."\r\n\r\n"He is on his death-bed, and he thought that he had behaved badly to\r\nher. She did go to Bragton the other day, at his request,--merely\r\nthat she might say that she forgave him."\r\n\r\n"I only hope that she will forgive me too. There is really nothing\r\nelse to be said. If there were anything I could do to atone to her\r\nfor this--trouble."\r\n\r\n"If you only could know the brightness of the hopes you have\r\nshattered,--and the purity of that girl\'s affection for yourself!"\r\n\r\nIt was then that an idea--a low-minded idea occurred to Lord Rufford.\r\nWhile all this was going on he had of course made various inquiries\r\nabout this branch of the Trefoil family and had learned that Arabella\r\nwas altogether portionless. He was told too that Lady Augustus was\r\nmuch harassed by impecuniosity. Might it be possible to offer a\r\nrecompense? "If I could do anything else, Lady Augustus;--but really\r\nI am not a marrying man." Then Lady Augustus wept bitterly; but while\r\nshe was weeping, a low-minded idea occurred to her also. It was\r\nclear to her that there could be no marriage. She had never expected\r\nthat there would be a marriage. But if this man who was rolling in\r\nwealth should offer some sum of money to her daughter,--something so\r\nconsiderable as to divest the transaction of the meanness which would\r\nbe attached to a small bribe,--something which might be really useful\r\nthroughout life, would it not be her duty, on behalf of her dear\r\nchild, to accept such an offer? But the beginnings of such dealings\r\nare always difficult. "Couldn\'t my lawyer see yours, Lady Augustus?"\r\nsaid Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want the family lawyer to know anything about it," said Lady\r\nAugustus. Then there was silence between them for a few moments. "You\r\ndon\'t know what we have to bear, Lord Rufford. My husband has spent\r\nall my fortune,--which was considerable; and the Duke does nothing\r\nfor us." Then he took a bit of paper and, writing on it the figures\r\n"L6,000," pushed it across the table. She gazed at the scrap for a\r\nminute, and then, borrowing his pencil without a word, scratched out\r\nhis Lordship\'s figures and wrote "L8,000," beneath them; and then\r\nadded, "No one to know it." After that he held the scrap for two or\r\nthree minutes in his hands, and then wrote beneath the figures, "Very\r\nwell. To be settled on your daughter. No one shall know it." She\r\nbowed her head, but kept the scrap of paper in her possession. "Shall\r\nI ring for your carriage?" he asked. The bell was rung, and Lady\r\nAugustus was taken back to the lodgings in Orchard Street in the\r\nhired brougham. As she went she told herself that if everything else\r\nfailed, L400 a year would support her daughter, or that in the event\r\nof any further matrimonial attempt such a fortune would be a great\r\nassistance. She had been sure that there could be no marriage, and\r\nwas disposed to think that she had done a good morning\'s work on\r\nbehalf of her unnatural child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n"WE SHALL KILL EACH OTHER."\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Augustus as she was driven back to Orchard Street and as she\r\nremained alone during the rest of that day and the next in London,\r\nbecame a little afraid of what she had done. She began to think how\r\nshe should communicate her tidings to her daughter, and thinking\r\nof it grew to be nervous and ill at ease. How would it be with her\r\nshould Arabella still cling to the hope of marrying the lord? That\r\nany such hope would be altogether illusory Lady Augustus was now\r\nsure. She had been quite certain that there was no ground for such\r\nhope when she had spoken to the man of her own poverty. She was\r\nalmost certain that there had never been an offer of marriage made.\r\nIn the first place Lord Rufford\'s word went further with her than\r\nArabella\'s,--and then his story had been consistent and probable,\r\nwhereas hers had been inconsistent and improbable. At any rate ropes\r\nand horses would not bring Lord Rufford to the hymeneal altar. That\r\nbeing so was it not natural that she should then have considered\r\nwhat result would be next best to a marriage? She was very poor,\r\nhaving saved only some few hundreds a year from the wreck of her own\r\nfortune. Independently of her her daughter had nothing. And in spite\r\nof this poverty Arabella was very extravagant, running up bills for\r\nfinery without remorse wherever credit could be found, and excusing\r\nherself by saying that on this or that occasion such expenditure was\r\njustified by the matrimonial prospects which it opened out to her.\r\nAnd now, of late, Arabella had been talking of living separately from\r\nher mother. Lady Augustus, who was thoroughly tired of her daughter\'s\r\ncompany, was not at all averse to such a scheme;--but any such scheme\r\nwas impracticable without money. By a happy accident the money would\r\nnow be forthcoming. There would be L400 a year for ever and nobody\r\nwould know whence it came. She was confident that they might trust\r\nto the lord\'s honour for secrecy. As far as her own opinion went the\r\nresult of the transaction would be most happy. But still she feared\r\nArabella. She felt that she would not know how to tell her story when\r\nshe got back to Marygold Place. "My dear, he won\'t marry you; but\r\nhe is to give you L8,000." That was what she would have to say, but\r\nshe doubted her own courage to put her story into words so curt and\r\nexplanatory. Even at thirty L400 a year has not the charms which\r\naccompany it to eyes which have seen sixty years. She remained\r\nin town that night and the next day, and went down by train to\r\nBasingstoke on the following morning with her heart not altogether\r\nfree from trepidation.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford, the very moment that the interview was over, started\r\noff to his lawyer. Considering how very little had been given to him\r\nthe sum he was to pay was prodigious. In his desire to get rid of\r\nthe bore of these appeals, he had allowed himself to be foolishly\r\ngenerous. He certainly never would kiss a young lady in a carriage\r\nagain,--nor even lend a horse to a young lady till he was better\r\nacquainted with her ambition and character. But the word had gone\r\nfrom him and he must be as good as his word. The girl must have her\r\nL8,000 and must have it instantly. He would put the matter into such\r\na position that if any more interviews were suggested, he might with\r\nperfect safety refer the suggester back to Miss Trefoil. There was to\r\nbe secrecy, and he would be secret as the grave. But in such matters\r\none\'s lawyer is the grave. He had proposed that two lawyers should\r\narrange it. Objection had been made to this, because Lady Augustus\r\nhad no lawyer ready;--but on his side some one must be employed.\r\nSo he went to his own solicitor and begged that the thing might be\r\ndone quite at once. He was very definite in his instructions, and\r\nwould listen to no doubts. Would the lawyer write to Miss Trefoil on\r\nthat very day;--or rather not on that very day but the next. As he\r\nsuggested this he thought it well that Lady Augustus should have an\r\nopportunity of explaining the transaction to her daughter before the\r\nlawyer\'s letter should be received. He had, he said, his own reason\r\nfor such haste. Consequently the lawyer did prepare the letter to\r\nMiss Trefoil at once, drafting it in his noble client\'s presence.\r\nIn what way should the money be disposed so as best to suit her\r\nconvenience? The letter was very short with an intimation that\r\nLady Augustus would no doubt have explained the details of the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Augustus reached Marygold the family were at lunch, and as\r\nstrangers were present nothing was said as to the great mission. The\r\nmother had already bethought herself how she must tell this and that\r\nlie to the Connop Greens, explaining that Lord Rufford had confessed\r\nhis iniquity but had disclosed that, for certain mysterious reasons,\r\nhe could not marry Arabella,--though he loved her better than all the\r\nworld. Arabella asked some questions about her mother\'s shopping and\r\ngeneral business in town, and did not leave the room till she could\r\ndo so without the slightest appearance of anxiety. Mrs. Connop Green\r\nmarvelled at her coolness knowing how much must depend on the answer\r\nwhich her mother had brought back from London, and knowing nothing of\r\nthe contents of the letter which Arabella had received that morning\r\nfrom the lawyer. In a moment or two Lady Augustus followed her\r\ndaughter upstairs, and on going into her own room found the damsel\r\nstanding in the middle of it with an open paper in her hand. "Mamma,"\r\nshe said, "shut the door." Then the door was closed. "What is the\r\nmeaning of this?" and she held out the lawyer\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"The meaning of what?" said Lady Augustus, trembling.\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt you know, but you had better read it."\r\n\r\nLady Augustus read the letter and attempted to smile. "He has been\r\nvery quick," she said. "I thought I should have been the first to\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of it? Why is the man to give me all that\r\nmoney?"\r\n\r\n"Is it not a good escape from so great a trouble? Think what L8,000\r\nwill do. It will enable you to live in comfort wherever you may\r\nplease to go."\r\n\r\n"I am to understand then you have sold me,--sold all my hopes and my\r\nvery name and character, for L8,000!"\r\n\r\n"Your name and character will not be touched, my dear. As for his\r\nmarrying you I soon found that that was absolutely out of the\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"This is what has come of sending you to see him! Of course I shall\r\ntell my uncle everything."\r\n\r\n"You will do no such thing. Arabella, do not make a fool of\r\nyourself. Do you know what L8,000 will do for you? It is to be your\r\nown,--absolutely beyond my reach or your father\'s."\r\n\r\n"I would sooner go into the Thames off Waterloo Bridge than touch a\r\nfarthing of his money," said Arabella with a spirit which the other\r\nwoman did not at all understand. Hitherto in all these little dirty\r\nways they had run with equal steps. The pretences, the subterfuges,\r\nthe lies of the one had always been open to the other. Arabella,\r\nearnest in supplying herself with gloves from the pockets of her male\r\nacquaintances, had endured her mother\'s tricks with complacency. She\r\nhad condescended when living in humble lodgings to date her letters\r\nfrom a well-known hotel, and had not feared to declare that she had\r\ndone so in their family conversations. Together they had fished in\r\nturbid waters for marital nibbles and had told mutual falsehoods to\r\nunbelieving tradesmen. And yet the younger woman, when tempted with a\r\nbribe worth lies and tricks as deep and as black as Acheron, now\r\nstood on her dignity and her purity and stamped her foot with honest\r\nindignation!\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you can understand it," said Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\n"I can understand this,--that you have betrayed me; and that I shall\r\ntell him so in the plainest words that I can use. To get his lawyer\r\nto write and offer me money!"\r\n\r\n"He should not have gone to his lawyer. I do think he was wrong\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"But you settled it with him;--you, my mother;--a price at which he\r\nshould buy himself off! Would he have offered me money if he did not\r\nknow that he had bound himself to me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth would make him marry you. I would not for a moment\r\nhave allowed him to allude to money if that had not been quite\r\ncertain."\r\n\r\n"Who proposed the money first?"\r\n\r\nLady Augustus considered a moment before she answered. "Upon my word,\r\nmy dear, I can\'t say. He wrote the figures on a bit of paper; that\r\nwas the way." Then she produced the scrap. "He wrote the figures\r\nfirst,--and then I altered them, just as you see. The proposition\r\ncame first from him, of course."\r\n\r\n"And you did not spit at him!" said Arabella as she tore the scrap\r\ninto fragments.\r\n\r\n"Arabella," said the mother, "it is clear that you do not look into\r\nthe future. How do you mean to live? You are getting old."\r\n\r\n"Old!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my love,--old. Of course I am willing to do everything for you,\r\nas I always have done,--for so many years, but there isn\'t a man in\r\nLondon who does not know how long you have been about it."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, mamma," said Arabella jumping up.\r\n\r\n"That is all very well, but the truth has to be spoken. You and I\r\ncannot go on as we have been doing."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I would sooner be in a workhouse."\r\n\r\n"And here there is provided for you an income on which you can live.\r\nNot a soul will know anything about it. Even your own father need\r\nnot be told. As for the lawyer, that is nothing. They never talk of\r\nthings. It would make a man comparatively poor quite a fit match. Or,\r\nif you do not marry, it would enable you to live where you pleased\r\nindependently of me. You had better think twice of it before you\r\nrefuse it."\r\n\r\n"I will not think of it at all. As sure as I am living here I will\r\nwrite to Rufford this very evening and tell him in what light I\r\nregard both him and you."\r\n\r\n"And what will you do then?"\r\n\r\n"Hang myself."\r\n\r\n"That is all very well, Arabella, but hanging yourself and jumping\r\noff Waterloo Bridge do not mean anything. You must live, and you must\r\npay your debts. I can\'t pay them for you. You go into your own room,\r\nand think of it all, and be thankful for what Providence has sent\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You may as well understand that I am in earnest," the daughter said\r\nas she left the room. "I shall write to Lord Rufford to-day and tell\r\nhim what I think of him and his money. You need not trouble yourself\r\nas to what shall be done with it, for I certainly shall not take it."\r\n\r\nAnd she did write to Lord Rufford as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I have been much astonished by a letter I have received\r\n   from a gentleman in London, Mr. Shaw, who I presume is\r\n   your lawyer. When I received it I had not as yet seen\r\n   mamma. I now understand that you and she between you have\r\n   determined that I should be compensated by a sum of money\r\n   for the injury you have done me! I scorn your money. I\r\n   cannot think where you found the audacity to make such\r\n   a proposal, or how you have taught yourself to imagine\r\n   that I should listen to it. As to mamma, she was not\r\n   commissioned to act for me, and I have nothing to do with\r\n   anything she may have said. I can hardly believe that she\r\n   should have agreed to such a proposal. It was very little\r\n   like a gentleman in you to offer it.\r\n\r\n   Why did you offer it? You would not have proposed to give\r\n   me a large sum of money like that without some reason.\r\n   I have been shocked to hear that you have denied that\r\n   you ever engaged yourself to me. You know that you were\r\n   engaged to me. It would have been more honest and more\r\n   manly if you had declared at once that you repented of\r\n   your engagement. But the truth is that till I see you\r\n   myself and hear what you have to say out of your own mouth\r\n   I cannot believe what other people tell me. I must ask you\r\n   to name some place where we can meet. As for this offer\r\n   of money, it goes for nothing. You must have known that I\r\n   would not take it.\r\n\r\n   ARABELLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now just the end of February, and the visit of the Trefoil\r\nladies to the Connop Greens had to come to an end. They had already\r\noverstaid the time at first arranged, and Lady Augustus, when she\r\nhinted that another week at Marygold,--"just till this painful affair\r\nwas finally settled,"--would be beneficial to her, was informed that\r\nthe Connop Greens themselves were about to leave home. Lady Augustus\r\nhad reported to Mrs. Connop Green that Lord Rufford was behaving very\r\nbadly, but that the matter was still in a "transition state." Mrs.\r\nConnop Green was very sorry, but--. So Lady Augustus and Arabella\r\nbetook themselves to Orchard Street, being at that moment unable to\r\nenter in upon better quarters.\r\n\r\nWhat a home it was,--and what a journey up to town! Arabella had\r\ntold her mother that the letter to Lord Rufford had been written and\r\nposted, and since that hardly a word had passed between them. When\r\nthey left Marygold in the Connop Green carriage they smiled, and\r\nshook hands, and kissed their friends in unison, and then sank back\r\ninto silence. At the station they walked up and down the platform\r\ntogether for the sake of appearance, but did not speak. In the train\r\nthere were others with them and they both feigned to be asleep. Then\r\nthey were driven to their lodgings in a cab, still speechless. It was\r\nthe mother who first saw that the horror of this if continued would\r\nbe too great to be endured. "Arabella," she said in a hoarse voice,\r\n"why don\'t you speak?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'ve got nothing to say."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense. There is always something to say."\r\n\r\n"You have ruined me, mamma; just ruined me."\r\n\r\n"I did for you the very best I could. If you would have been advised\r\nby me, instead of being ruined, you would have had a handsome\r\nfortune. I have slaved for you for the last twelve years. No mother\r\never sacrificed herself for her child more than I have done for you,\r\nand now see the return I get. I sometimes think that it will kill\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense."\r\n\r\n"Everything I say is nonsense,--while you tell me one day that you\r\nare going to hang yourself, and another day that you will drown\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"So I would if I dared. What is it that you have brought me to? Who\r\nwill have me in their houses when they hear that you consented to\r\ntake Lord Rufford\'s money?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody will hear it unless you tell them."\r\n\r\n"I shall tell my uncle and my aunt and Mistletoe, in order that they\r\nmay know how it is that Lord Rufford has been allowed to escape.\r\nI say that you have ruined me. If it had not been for your vulgar\r\nbargain with him, he must have been brought to keep his word at last.\r\nOh, that he should have ever thought it was possible that I was to be\r\nbought off for a sum of money!"\r\n\r\nLater on in the evening, the mother again implored her daughter to\r\nspeak to her. "What\'s the use, mamma, when you know what we think of\r\neach other? What\'s the good of pretending? There is nobody here to\r\nhear us." Later on still she herself began. "I don\'t know how much\r\nyou\'ve got, mamma; but whatever it is, we\'d better divide it. After\r\nwhat you did in Piccadilly we shall never get on together again."\r\n\r\n"There is not enough to divide," said Lady Augustus.\r\n\r\n"If I had not you to go about with me I could get taken in pretty\r\nnearly all the year round."\r\n\r\n"Who\'d take you?"\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me. I would manage it, and you could join with some\r\nother old person. We shall kill each other if we stay like this,"\r\nsaid Arabella as she took up her candle.\r\n\r\n"You have pretty nearly killed me as it is," said the old woman as\r\nthe other shut the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCHANGES AT BRAGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay after day old Mrs. Morton urged her purpose with her grandson at\r\nBragton, not quite directly as she had done at first, but by gradual\r\napproaches and little soft attempts made in the midst of all the\r\ntenderness which, as a nurse, she was able to display. It soon came\r\nto pass that the intruders were banished from the house, or almost\r\nbanished. Mary\'s daily visits were discontinued immediately after\r\nthat last walk home with Reginald Morton which has been described.\r\nTwice in the course of the next week she went over, but on both\r\noccasions she did so early in the day, and returned alone just as he\r\nwas reaching the house. And then, before a week was over, early in\r\nMarch, Lady Ushant told the invalid that she would be better away.\r\n"Mrs. Morton doesn\'t like me," she said, "and I had better go. But I\r\nshall stay for a while at Hoppet Hall, and come in and see you from\r\ntime to time till you get better." John Morton replied that he should\r\nnever get better; but though he said so then, there was at times\r\nevidence that he did not yet quite despond as to himself. He could\r\nstill talk to Mrs. Morton of buying Chowton Farm, and was very\r\nanxious that he should not be forgotten at the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nLady Ushant had herself driven to Hoppet Hall, and there took up her\r\nresidence with her nephew. Every other day Mr. Runciman\'s fly came\r\nfor her and carried her backwards and forwards to Bragton. On those\r\noccasions she would remain an hour with the invalid, and then would\r\ngo back again, never even seeing Mrs. Morton, though always seen by\r\nher. And twice after this banishment Reginald walked over. But on the\r\nsecond occasion there was a scene. Mrs. Morton to whom he had never\r\nspoken since he was a boy, met him in the hall and told him that his\r\nvisits only disturbed his sick cousin. "I certainly will not disturb\r\nhim," Reginald had said. "In the condition in which he is now he\r\nshould not see many people," rejoined the lady. "If you will ask Dr.\r\nFanning he will tell you the same." Dr. Fanning was the London doctor\r\nwho came down once a week, whom it was improbable that Reginald\r\nshould have an opportunity of consulting. But he remembered or\r\nthought that he remembered, that his cousin had been fretful and\r\nill-pleased during his last visit, and so turned himself round and\r\nwent home without another word.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid there may be--I don\'t know what," said Lady Ushant to\r\nhim in a whisper the next morning.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I mean. Perhaps I ought not to say a word. Only so\r\nmuch does depend on it!"\r\n\r\n"If you are thinking about the property, aunt, wipe it out of your\r\nmind. Let him do what he pleases and don\'t think about it. No one\r\nshould trouble their minds about such things. It is his, to do what\r\nhe pleases with it."\r\n\r\n"It is not him that I fear, Reginald."\r\n\r\n"If he chooses to be guided by her, who shall say that he is wrong?\r\nGet it out of your mind. The very thinking about such things is\r\ndirtiness!" The poor old lady submitted to the rebuke and did not\r\ndare to say another word.\r\n\r\nDaily Lady Ushant would send over for Mary Masters, thinking it cruel\r\nthat her young friend should leave her alone and yet understanding\r\nin part the reason why Mary did not come to her constantly at Hoppet\r\nHall. Poor Mary was troubled much by these messages. Of course\r\nshe went now and again. She had no alternative but to go, and yet,\r\nfeeling that the house was his house, she was most unwilling to enter\r\nit. Then grew within her a feeling, which she could not analyse, that\r\nhe had ill-used her. Of course she was not entitled to his love. She\r\nwould acknowledge to herself over and over again that he had never\r\nspoken a word to her which could justify her in expecting his love.\r\nBut why had he not let her alone? Why had he striven by his words and\r\nhis society to make her other than she would have been had she been\r\nleft to the atmosphere of her stepmother\'s home? Why had he spoken so\r\nstrongly to her as to that young man\'s love? And then she was almost\r\nangry with him because, by a turn in the wheel of fortune, he was\r\nabout to become, as she thought, Squire of Bragton. Had he remained\r\nsimply Mr. Morton of Hoppet Hall it would still have been impossible.\r\nBut this exaltation of her idol altogether out of her reach was an\r\nadded injustice. She could remember, not the person, but all the\r\nrecent memories of the old Squire, the veneration with which he was\r\nnamed, the masterdom which was attributed to him, the unequalled\r\nnobility of his position in regard to Dillsborough. His successor\r\nwould be to her as some one crowned, and removed by his crown\r\naltogether from her world. Then she pictured to herself the stately\r\ndame who would certainly come, and she made fresh resolutions with a\r\nsore heart.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should be so very little with me," said Lady\r\nUshant, almost whining. "When I was at Cheltenham you wanted to come\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"There are so many things to be done at home."\r\n\r\n"And yet you would have come to Cheltenham."\r\n\r\n"We were in great trouble then, Lady Ushant. Of course I would like\r\nto be with you. You ought not to scold me, because you know how I\r\nlove you."\r\n\r\n"Has the young man gone away altogether now, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Altogether."\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Masters is satisfied?"\r\n\r\n"She knows it can never be, and therefore she is quiet about it."\r\n\r\n"I was sorry for that young man, because he was so true."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t be more sorry than I was, Lady Ushant. I love him as\r\nthough he were a brother. But--"\r\n\r\n"Mary, dear Mary, I fear you are in trouble."\r\n\r\n"I think it is all trouble," said Mary, rushing forward and hiding\r\nher face in her old friend\'s lap as she knelt on the ground before\r\nher. Lady Ushant longed to ask a question, but she did not dare. And\r\nMary Masters longed to have one friend to whom she could confide her\r\nsecret,--but neither did she dare.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, very early in the morning, there came a note from\r\nMrs. Morton to Mr. Masters, the attorney. Could Mr. Masters come\r\nout on that day to Bragton and see Mrs. Morton. The note was very\r\nparticular in saying that Mrs. Morton was to be the person seen.\r\nThe messenger who waited for an answer, brought back word that Mr.\r\nMasters would be there at noon. The circumstance was one which\r\nagitated him considerably, as he had not been inside the house at\r\nBragton since the days immediately following the death of the old\r\nSquire. As it happened, Lady Ushant was going to Bragton on the same\r\nday, and at the suggestion of Mr. Runciman, whose horses in the\r\nhunting season barely sufficed for his trade, the old lady and the\r\nlawyer went together. Not a word was said between them as to the\r\ncause which took either of them on their journey, but they spoke much\r\nof the days in which they had known each other, when the old Squire\r\nwas alive, and Mr. Masters thanked Lady Ushant for her kindness to\r\nhis daughter. "I love her almost as though she were my own," said\r\nLady Ushant. "When I am dead she will have half of what I have got."\r\n\r\n"She will have no right to expect that," said the gratified father.\r\n\r\n"She will have half or the whole,--just as Reginald may be situated\r\nthen. I don\'t know why I shouldn\'t tell her father what it is I mean\r\nto do." The attorney knew to a shilling the amount of Lady Ushant\'s\r\nincome and thought that this was the best news he had heard for many\r\na day.\r\n\r\nWhile Lady Ushant was in the sick man\'s room, Mrs. Morton was\r\ncloseted with the attorney. She had thought much of this step before\r\nshe had dared to take it and even now doubted whether it would avail\r\nher anything. As she entered the book-room in which Mr. Masters\r\nwas seated she almost repented. But the man was there and she was\r\ncompelled to go on with her scheme. "Mr. Masters," she said, "it is\r\nI think a long time since you have been employed by this family."\r\n\r\n"A very long time, Madam."\r\n\r\n"And I have now sent for you under circumstances of great\r\ndifficulty," she answered; but as he said nothing she was forced to\r\ngo on. "My grandson made his will the other day up in London, when he\r\nthought that he was going out to Patagonia." Mr. Masters bowed. "It\r\nwas done when he was in sound health, and he is now not satisfied\r\nwith it." Then there was another bow, but not a word was spoken. "Of\r\ncourse you know that he is very ill."\r\n\r\n"We have all been very much grieved to hear it."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you would be, for the sake of old days. When Dr. Fanning\r\nwas last here he thought that my grandson was something better. He\r\nheld out stronger hopes than before. But still he is very ill. His\r\nmind has never wavered for a moment, Mr. Masters." Again Mr. Masters\r\nbowed. "And now he thinks that some changes should be made;--indeed\r\nthat there should be a new will."\r\n\r\n"Does he wish me to see him, Mrs. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"Not to-day, I think. He is not quite prepared to-day. But I wanted\r\nto ask whether you could come at a moment\'s notice,--quite at a\r\nmoment\'s notice. I thought it better, so that you should know why we\r\nsent for you if we did send,--so that you might be prepared. It could\r\nbe done here, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"It would be possible, Mrs. Morton."\r\n\r\n"And you could do it?"\r\n\r\nThen there was a long pause. "Altering a will is a very serious\r\nthing, Mrs. Morton. And when it is done on what perhaps may be a\r\ndeath-bed, it is a very serious thing indeed. Mr. Morton, I believe,\r\nemploys a London solicitor. I know the firm and more respectable\r\ngentlemen do not exist. A telegram would bring down one of the firm\r\nfrom London by the next train."\r\n\r\nA frown, a very heavy frown, came across the old woman\'s brow.\r\nShe would have repressed it had it been possible;--but she could\r\nnot command herself, and the frown was there. "If that had been\r\npracticable, Mr. Masters," she said, "we should not have sent for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I was only suggesting, madame, what might be the best course."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. And of course I am much obliged. But if we are driven to\r\ncall upon you for your assistance, we shall find it?"\r\n\r\n"Madame," said the attorney very slowly, "it is of course part of my\r\nbusiness to make wills, and when called upon to do so, I perform my\r\nbusiness to the best of my ability. But in altering a will during\r\nillness great care is necessary. A codicil might be added--"\r\n\r\n"A new will would be necessary."\r\n\r\nA new will, thought the attorney, could only be necessary for\r\naltering the disposition of the whole estate. He knew enough of the\r\nfamily circumstances to be aware that the property should go to\r\nReginald Morton whether with or without a will,--and also enough to\r\nbe aware that this old lady was Reginald\'s bitter enemy. He did not\r\nthink that he could bring himself to take instructions from a dying\r\nman,--from the Squire of Bragton on his death-bed,--for an instrument\r\nwhich should alienate the property from the proper heir. He too had\r\nhis strong feelings, perhaps his prejudices, about Bragton. "I would\r\nwish that the task were in other hands, Mrs. Morton."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"It is hard to measure the capacity of an invalid."\r\n\r\n"His mind is as clear as yours."\r\n\r\n"It might be so,--and yet I might not be able to satisfy myself that\r\nit was so. I should have to ask long and tedious questions, which\r\nwould be offensive. And I should find myself giving advice,--which\r\nwould not be called for. For instance, were your grandson to wish to\r\nleave this estate away from the heir--"\r\n\r\n"I am not discussing his wishes, Mr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Morton, for making the suggestion;--but as I\r\nsaid before, I should prefer that he should employ--some one else."\r\n\r\n"You refuse then?"\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Morton were to send for me, I should go to him instantly.\r\nBut I fear I might be slow in taking his instructions;--and it is\r\npossible that I might refuse to act on them." Then she got up from\r\nher chair and bowing to him with stately displeasure left the room.\r\n\r\nAll this she had done without any authority from her grandson, simply\r\nencouraged in her object by his saying in his weakness that he would\r\nthink of her proposition. So intent was she on her business that\r\nshe was resolved to have everything ready if only he could once be\r\nbrought to say that Peter Morton should be his heir. Having abandoned\r\nall hopes for her noble cousin she could tell her conscience that she\r\nwas instigated simply by an idea of justice. Peter Morton was at any\r\nrate the legitimate son of a well-born father and a well-born mother.\r\nWhat had she or any one belonging to her to gain by it? But forty\r\nyears since a brat had been born at Bragton in opposition to her\r\nwishes,--by whose means she had been expelled from the place; and now\r\nit seemed to her to be simple justice that he should on this account\r\nbe robbed of that which would otherwise be naturally his own. As\r\nMr. Masters would not serve her turn she must write to the London\r\nlawyers. The thing would be more difficult; but, nevertheless, if\r\nthe sick man could once be got to say that Peter should be his heir\r\nshe thought that she could keep him to his word. Lady Ushant and Mr.\r\nMasters went back to Dillsborough in Runciman\'s fly, and it need\r\nhardly be said that the attorney said nothing of the business which\r\nhad taken him to Bragton.\r\n\r\nThis happened on a Wednesday,--Wednesday the 3rd of March. On Friday\r\nmorning, at 4 o\'clock, during the darkness of the night, John Morton\r\nwas lying dead on his bed, and the old woman was at his bedside. She\r\nhad done her duty by him as far as she knew how in tending him,--had\r\nbeen assiduous with the diligence of much younger years; but now as\r\nshe sat there, having had the fact absolutely announced to her by Dr.\r\nNupper, her greatest agony arose from the feeling that the roof which\r\ncovered her, probably the chair in which she sat, were the property\r\nof Reginald Morton--"Bastard!" she said to herself between her teeth;\r\nbut she so said it that neither Dr. Nupper, who was in the room, nor\r\nthe woman who was with her should hear it.\r\n\r\nDr. Nupper took the news into Dillsborough, and as the folk sat down\r\nto breakfast they all heard that the Squire of Bragton was dead.\r\nThe man had been too little known, had been too short a time in the\r\nneighbourhood, to give occasion for tears. There was certainly more\r\nof interest than of grief in the matter. Mr. Masters said to himself\r\nthat the time had been too short for any change in the will, and\r\ntherefore felt tolerably certain that Reginald would be the heir.\r\nBut for some days this opinion was not general in Dillsborough. Mr.\r\nMainwaring had heard that Reginald had been sent away from Bragton\r\nwith a flea in his ear, and was pretty certain that when the will was\r\nread it would be found that the property was to go to Mrs. Morton\'s\r\nfriends. Dr. Nupper was of the same opinion. There were many in\r\nDillsborough with whom Reginald was not popular;--and who thought\r\nthat some man of a different kind would do better as Squire of\r\nBragton. "He don\'t know a fox when he sees \'un," said Tony Tuppett to\r\nLarry Twentyman, whom he had come across the county to call upon and\r\nto console.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE WILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that Saturday the club met at Dillsborough,--even though the\r\nSquire of Bragton had died on Friday morning. Through the whole of\r\nthat Saturday the town had been much exercised in its belief and\r\nexpressions, as to the disposition of the property. The town knew\r\nvery well that Mr. Masters, the attorney, had been sent for to\r\nBragton on the previous Wednesday,--whence the deduction as to a new\r\nwill, made of course under the auspices of Mrs. Morton,--would have\r\nbeen quite plain to the town, had not a portion of the town heard\r\nthat the attorney had not been for a moment with the dying man during\r\nhis visit. This latter piece of information had come through Lady\r\nUshant, who had been in her nephew\'s bedroom the whole time;--but\r\nLady Ushant had not much personal communication with the town\r\ngenerally, and would probably have said nothing on this subject had\r\nnot Mr. Runciman walked up to Hoppet Hall behind the fly, after\r\nMr. Masters had left it; and, while helping her ladyship out, made\r\ninquiry as to the condition of things at Bragton generally. "I was\r\nsorry to hear of their sending for any lawyer," said Mr. Runciman.\r\nThen Lady Ushant protested that the lawyer had not been sent for by\r\nher nephew, and that her nephew had not even seen him. "Oh, indeed,"\r\nsaid Mr. Runciman, who immediately took a walk round his own paddock\r\nwith the object of putting two and two together. Mr. Runciman was a\r\ndiscreet man, and did not allow this piece of information to spread\r\nitself generally. He told Dr. Nupper, and Mr. Hampton, and Lord\r\nRufford,--for the hounds went out on Friday, though the Squire of\r\nBragton was lying dead;--but he did not tell Mr. Mainwaring, whom he\r\nencountered in the street of the town as he was coming home early,\r\nand who was very keen to learn whatever news there was.\r\n\r\nReginald Morton on Friday did not go near Bragton. That of course\r\nwas palpable to all, and was a great sign that he himself did not\r\nregard himself as the heir. He had for awhile been very intimate at\r\nthe house, visiting it daily--and during a part of that time the\r\ngrandmother had been altogether absent. Then she had come back, and\r\nhe had discontinued his visits. And now he did not even go over to\r\nseal up the drawers and to make arrangements as to the funeral. He\r\ndid not at any rate go on the Friday,--nor on the Saturday. And on\r\nthe Saturday Mr. Wobytrade, the undertaker, had received orders from\r\nMrs. Morton to go at once to Bragton. All this was felt to be strong\r\nagainst Reginald. But when it was discovered that on the Saturday\r\nafternoon Mrs. Morton herself had gone up to London, not waiting even\r\nfor the coming of any one else to take possession of the house,--and\r\nthat she had again carried all her own personal luggage with\r\nher,--then opinion in Dillsborough again veered. Upon the whole the\r\nbetting was a point or two in favour of Reginald, when the club met.\r\n\r\nMrs. Masters, who had been much quelled of late, had been urgent\r\nwith her husband to go over to the Bush; but he was unwilling, he\r\nsaid, to be making jolly while the Squire of Bragton was lying\r\nunburied. "He was nothing to you, Gregory," said his wife, who had\r\nin vain endeavoured to learn from him why he had been summoned to\r\nBragton--"You will hear something over there, and it will relieve\r\nyour spirits." So instigated he did go across, and found all the\r\naccustomed members of the club congregated in the room. Even Larry\r\nTwentyman was present, who of late had kept himself aloof from all\r\nsuch meetings. Both the Botseys were there, and Nupper and Harry\r\nStubbings, and Ribbs the butcher. Runciman himself of course was in\r\nthe room, and he had introduced on this occasion Captain Glomax, the\r\nmaster of the hunt, who was staying at his house that night,--perhaps\r\nwith a view to hunting duties on the Monday, perhaps in order that he\r\nmight hear something as to the Bragton property. It had already been\r\nsuggested to him that he might possibly hire the house for a year or\r\ntwo at little more than a nominal rent, that the old kennels might\r\nbe resuscitated, and that such arrangements would be in all respects\r\nconvenient. He was the master of the hunt, and of course there was no\r\ndifficulty as to introducing him to the club.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glomax was speaking in a somewhat dictatorial voice,--as\r\nbecomes a Master of Hounds when in the field, though perhaps it\r\nshould be dropped afterwards--when the Attorney entered. There was\r\na sudden rise of voices striving to interrupt the Captain, as it\r\nwas felt by them all that Mr. Masters must be in possession of\r\ninformation; but the Captain himself went on. "Of course it is the\r\nplace for the hounds. Nobody can doubt that who knows the country and\r\nunderstands the working of it. The hunt ought to have subscribed and\r\nhired the kennels and stables permanently."\r\n\r\n"There would have wanted two to that bargain, Captain," said Mr.\r\nRunciman.\r\n\r\n"Of course there would, but what would you think of a man who would\r\nrefuse such a proposition when he didn\'t want the place himself?\r\nDo you think if I\'d been there foxes would have been poisoned in\r\nDillsborough wood? I\'d have had that fellow Goarly under my thumb."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d have had an awful blackguard under your thumb, Captain\r\nGlomax," said Larry, who could not restrain his wrath when Goarly\'s\r\nname was mentioned.\r\n\r\n"What does that matter, if you get foxes?" continued the Master. "But\r\nthe fact is, gentlemen in a county like this always want to have\r\neverything done for them, and never to do anything for themselves.\r\nI\'m sick of it, I know. Nobody is fonder of hunting a country than I\r\nam, and I think I know what I\'m about."\r\n\r\n"That you do," said Fred Botsey, who, like most men, was always ready\r\nto flatter the Master.\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t care how hard I work. From the first of August till the\r\nend of May I never have a day to myself, what with cubbing and then\r\nthe season, and entering the young hounds, and buying and selling\r\nhorses, by George I\'m at it the whole year!"\r\n\r\n"A Master of Hounds looks for that, Captain," said the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n"Looks for it! Yes; he must look for it. But I wouldn\'t mind that,\r\nif I could get gentlemen to pull a little with me. I can\'t stand\r\nbeing out of pocket as I have been, and so I must let them know.\r\nIf the country would get the kennels and the stables, and lay out\r\na few pounds so that horses and hounds and men could go into them,\r\nI wouldn\'t mind having a shot for the house. It\'s killing work\r\nwhere I am now, the other side of Rufford, you may say." Then he\r\nstopped;--but no one would undertake to answer him. The meaning of\r\nit was that Captain Glomax wanted L500 a year more than he received,\r\nand every one there knew that there was not L500 a year more to be\r\ngot out of the country,--unless Lord Rufford would put his hand into\r\nhis pocket. Now the present stables and the present kennels had been\r\n"made comfortable" by Lord Rufford, and it was not thought probable\r\nthat he would pay for the move to Bragton.\r\n\r\n"When\'s the funeral to be, Mr. Masters?" asked Runciman,--who knew\r\nvery well the day fixed, but who thought it well to get back to the\r\nsubject of real interest in the town.\r\n\r\n"Next Thursday, I\'m told."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no hurry with weather like this," said Nupper\r\nprofessionally.\r\n\r\n"They can\'t open the will till the late squire is buried," continued\r\nthe innkeeper, "and there will be one or two very anxious to know\r\nwhat is in it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it will all go to the man who lives up here at Hoppet\r\nHall," said the Captain,--"a man that was never outside a horse in\r\nhis life!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s not a bad fellow," said Runciman.\r\n\r\n"He is a very good fellow," said the Attorney, "and I trust he may\r\nhave the property. If it be left away from him, I for one shall think\r\nthat a great injustice has been done." This was listened to with\r\nattention, as every one there thought that Mr. Masters must know.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand," said Glomax, "how any man can be considered a\r\ngood fellow as a country gentleman who does not care for sport. Just\r\nlook at it all round. Suppose others were like him what would become\r\nof us all?"\r\n\r\n"Yes indeed, what would become of us?" asked the two Botseys in a\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Ho\'d \'ire our \'orses, Runciman?" suggested Harry Stubbings with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Think what England would be!" said the Captain. "When I hear of a\r\ncountry gentleman sticking to books and all that, I feel that the\r\nglory is departing from the land. Where are the sinews of war to come\r\nfrom? That\'s what I want to know."\r\n\r\n"Who will it be, Mr. Masters, if the gent don\'t get it?" asked Ribbs\r\nfrom his corner on the sofa.\r\n\r\nThis was felt to be a pushing question. "How am I to know, Mr.\r\nRibbs?" said the Attorney. "I didn\'t make the late squire\'s\r\nwill;--and if I did you don\'t suppose I should tell you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m told that the next is Peter Morton," said Fred Botsey. "He\'s\r\nsomething in a public office up in London."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t go to him," said Fred\'s brother. "That old lady has\r\nrelations of her own who have had their mouths open for the last\r\nforty years."\r\n\r\n"Away from the Mortons altogether!" said Harry. "That would be an\r\nawful shame!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what good the Mortons have done this last half century,"\r\nsaid the Captain.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t remember the old squire, Captain," said the innkeeper,\r\n"and I don\'t remember him well. Indeed I was only a little chap when\r\nthey buried him. But there\'s that feeling left behind him to this\r\nday, that not a poor man in the country wouldn\'t be sorry to think\r\nthat there wasn\'t a Morton left among \'em. Of course a hunting\r\ngentleman is a good thing."\r\n\r\n"About the best thing out," said the Captain.\r\n\r\n"But a hunting gentleman isn\'t everything. I know nothing of the old\r\nlady\'s people,--only this that none of their money ever came into\r\nDillsborough. I\'m all for Reginald Morton. He\'s my landlord as it is,\r\nand he\'s a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"I hate foreigners coming," said Ribbs.\r\n\r\n"\'E ain\'t too old to take it yet," said Harry. Fred Botsey declared\r\nthat he didn\'t believe in men hunting unless they began young.\r\nWhereupon Dr. Nupper declared that he had never ridden over a fence\r\ntill he was forty-five, and that he was ready now to ride Fred across\r\ncountry for a new hat. Larry suggested that a man might be a good\r\nfriend to sport though he didn\'t ride much himself;--and Runciman\r\nagain asserted that hunting wasn\'t everything. Upon the whole\r\nReginald was the favourite. But the occasion was so special that a\r\nlittle supper was ordered, and I fear the attorney did not get home\r\ntill after twelve.\r\n\r\nTill the news reached Hoppet Hall that Mrs. Morton had taken herself\r\noff to London, there was great doubt there as to what ought to be\r\ndone, and even then the difficulty was not altogether over. Till she\r\nwas gone neither Lady Ushant nor her nephew would go there, and he\r\ncould only declare his purpose of attending the funeral whether he\r\nwere asked or not. When his aunt again spoke of the will he desired\r\nher with much emphasis not to allude to the subject. "If the property\r\nis to come to me," he said, "anything of good that may be in it\r\ncannot be much sweeter by anticipation. And if it is not I shall only\r\nencourage disappointment by thinking of it."\r\n\r\n"But it would be such a shame."\r\n\r\n"That I deny altogether. It was his own to do as he liked with it.\r\nHad he married I should not have expected it because I am the heir.\r\nBut, if you please, aunt, do not say a word more about it."\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday morning he heard that Mrs. Morton was gone to London,\r\nand then he walked over to Bragton. He found that she had locked and\r\nsealed up everything with so much precision that she must have worked\r\nhard at the task from the hour of his death almost to that of her\r\ndeparture. "She never rested herself all day," said Mrs. Hopkins,\r\n"till I thought she would sink from very weariness." She had gone\r\ninto every room and opened every drawer, and had had every piece of\r\nplate through her fingers, and then Mrs. Hopkins told him that just\r\nas she was departing she had said that the keys would be given to the\r\nlawyer. After that he wandered about the place, thinking what his\r\nlife would be should he find himself the owner of Bragton. At this\r\nmoment he almost felt that he disliked the place, though there had\r\nbeen times in which he had thought that he loved it too well. Of one\r\nthing he was conscious,--that if Bragton should become his, it would\r\nbe his duty to live there. He must move his books, and pipes, and\r\nother household gods from Hoppet Hall and become an English Squire.\r\nWould it be too late for him to learn to ride to hounds? Would it be\r\npossible that he should ever succeed in shooting a pheasant, if he\r\nwere to study the art patiently? Could he interest himself as to the\r\nprevalence or decadence of ground game? And what must he do with his\r\nneighbours? Of course he would have to entertain Mr. Mainwaring and\r\nthe other parsons, and perhaps once in the year to ask Lord Rufford\r\nto dine with him. If Lord Rufford came, what on earth would he say to\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nAnd then there arose another question. Would it not be his duty to\r\nmarry,--and, if so, whom? He had been distinctly told that Mary\r\nMasters had given her heart to some one, and he certainly was not the\r\nman to ask for the hand of a girl who had not a heart to give. And\r\nyet he thought that it would be impossible that he should marry any\r\nother person. He spent hours in walking about the grounds, looking at\r\nthe garden and belongings which would so probably be his own within a\r\nweek, and thinking whether it would be possible that he should bring\r\na mistress to preside over them. Before he reached home he had made\r\nup his mind that only one mistress would be possible, and that she\r\nwas beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday he received a scrawl from Mrs. Hopkins with a letter\r\nfrom the lawyer--addressed to her. The lawyer wrote to say that he\r\nwould be down on Wednesday evening, would attend the funeral, and\r\nread his client\'s will after they had performed the ceremony. He\r\nwent on to add that in obedience to Mrs. Morton\'s directions he\r\nhad invited Mr. Peter Morton to be present on the occasion. On the\r\nWednesday Reginald again went over, but left before the arrival of\r\nthe two gentlemen. On the Thursday he was there early, and of course\r\ntook upon himself the duty of chief mourner. Peter Morton was there\r\nand showed, in a bewildered way, that he had been summoned rather to\r\nthe opening of the will than to the funeral of a man he had never\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThen the will was read. There were only two names mentioned in it.\r\nJohn Morton left L5,000 and his watch and chain and rings to Arabella\r\nTrefoil, and everything else of which he was possessed to his cousin\r\nReginald Morton.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t know why they sent for me," said the other\r\ncousin, Peter.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Morton seemed to think that you would like to pay a tribute of\r\nrespect," said the lawyer. Peter looked at him and went upstairs and\r\npacked his portmanteau. The lawyer handed over the keys to the new\r\nsquire, and then everything was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW MINISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Poor old Paragon!" exclaimed Archibald Currie, as he stood with his\r\nback to the fire among his colleagues at the Foreign Office on the\r\nday after John Morton\'s death.\r\n\r\n"Poor young Paragon! that\'s the pity of it," said Mounser Green. "I\r\ndon\'t suppose he was turned thirty, and he was a useful man,--a very\r\nuseful man. That\'s the worst of it. He was just one of those men that\r\nthe country can\'t afford to lose, and whom it is so very hard to\r\nreplace." Mounser Green was always eloquent as to the needs of the\r\npublic service, and did really in his heart of hearts care about his\r\noffice. "Who is to go to Patagonia, I\'m sure I don\'t know. Platitude\r\nwas asking me about it, and I told him that I couldn\'t name a man."\r\n\r\n"Old Platitude always thinks that the world is coming to an end,"\r\nsaid Currie. "There are as good fish in the sea as ever were caught."\r\n\r\n"Who is there? Monsoon won\'t go, even if they ask him. The Paragon\r\nwas just the fellow for it. He had his heart in the work. An immense\r\ndeal depends on what sort of man we have in Patagonia at the present\r\nmoment. If Paraguay gets the better of the Patagonese all Brazil will\r\nbe in a ferment, and you know how that kind of thing spreads among\r\nhalf-caste Spaniards and Portuguese. Nobody can interfere but the\r\nBritish Minister. When I suggested Morton I knew I had the right man\r\nif he\'d only take it."\r\n\r\n"And now he has gone and died!" said Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n"And now he has gone and died," continued Mounser Green. "\'I never\r\nnursed a dear gazelle,\' and all the rest of it. Poor Paragon! I fear\r\nhe was a little cut about Miss Trefoil."\r\n\r\n"She was down with him the day before he died," said young Glossop.\r\n"I happen to know that."\r\n\r\n"It was before he thought of going to Patagonia that she was at\r\nBragton," said Currie.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all you know about it, old fellow," said the indignant young\r\none. "She was there a second time, just before his death. I had it\r\nfrom Lady Penwether who was in the neighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"My dear little boy," said Mounser Green, "that was exactly what was\r\nlikely to happen, and he yet may have broken his heart. I have seen\r\na good deal of the lady lately, and under no circumstances would she\r\nhave married him. When he accepted the mission that at any rate was\r\nall over."\r\n\r\n"The Rufford affair had begun before that," said Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n"The Rufford affair as you call it," said Glossop, "was no affair at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?" asked Currie.\r\n\r\n"I mean that Rufford was never engaged to her,--not for an instant,"\r\nsaid the lad, urgent in spreading the lesson which he had received\r\nfrom his cousin. "It was all a dead take-in."\r\n\r\n"Who was taken in?" asked Mounser Green.\r\n\r\n"Well;--nobody was taken in as it happened. But I suppose there can\'t\r\nbe a doubt that she tried her best to catch him, and that the Duke\r\nand Duchess and Mistletoe, and old Trefoil, all backed her up. It was\r\na regular plant. The only thing is, it didn\'t come off."\r\n\r\n"Look here, young shaver;"--this was Mounser Green again;--"when you\r\nspeak of a young lady do you be a little more discreet."\r\n\r\n"But didn\'t she do it, Green?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s more than you or I can tell. If you want to know what I\r\nthink, I believe he paid her a great deal of attention and then\r\nbehaved very badly to her."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t behave badly at all," said young Glossop.\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, when you are as old as I am, you will have learned how\r\nvery hard it is to know everything. I only say what I believe, and\r\nperhaps I may have better ground for believing than you. He certainly\r\npaid her a great deal of attention, and then her friends,--especially\r\nthe Duchess,--went to work."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve wanted to get her off their hands these six or eight years,"\r\nsaid Currie.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense again," continued the new advocate, "for there is no\r\ndoubt she might have married Morton all the time had she pleased."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--but Rufford!--a fellow with sixty thousand a year!" said\r\nGlossop.\r\n\r\n"About a third of that would be nearer the mark, Glossy. Take my\r\nword for it, you don\'t know everything yet, though you have so many\r\nadvantages." After that Mounser Green retreated to his own room with\r\na look and tone as though he were angry.\r\n\r\n"What makes him so ferocious about it?" asked Glossop when the door\r\nwas shut.\r\n\r\n"You are always putting your foot in it," said Currie. "I kept on\r\nwinking to you but it was no good. He sees her almost every day now.\r\nShe\'s staying with old Mrs. Green in Portugal Street. There has been\r\nsome break up between her and her mother, and old Mrs. Green has\r\ntaken her in. There\'s some sort of relationship. Mounser is the old\r\nwoman\'s nephew, and she is aunt by marriage to the Connop Greens down\r\nin Hampshire, and Mrs. Connop Green is first cousin to Lady\r\nAugustus."\r\n\r\n"If Dick\'s sister married Tom\'s brother what relation would Dick\r\nbe to Tom\'s mother? That\'s the kind of thing, isn\'t it?" suggested\r\nHoffmann.\r\n\r\n"At any rate there she is, and Mounser sees her every day."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t make any difference about Rufford," said young Glossop\r\nstoutly.\r\n\r\nAll this happened before the will had been declared,--when Arabella\r\ndid not dream that she was an heiress. A day or two afterwards she\r\nreceived a letter from the lawyer, telling her of her good fortune,\r\nand informing her that the trinkets would be given up to her and the\r\nmoney paid,--short of legacy duty,--whenever she would fix a time and\r\nplace. The news almost stunned her. There was a moment in which she\r\nthought that she was bound to reject this money, as she had rejected\r\nthat tendered to her by the other man. Poor as she was, greedy as\r\nshe was, alive as she was to the necessity of doing something for\r\nherself,--still this legacy was to her at first bitter rather than\r\nsweet. She had never treated any man so ill as she had treated this\r\nman;--and it was thus that he punished her! She was alive to the\r\nfeeling that he had always been true to her. In her intercourse with\r\nother men there had been generally a battle carried on with some\r\nfairness. Diamond had striven to cut diamond. But here the dishonesty\r\nhad all been on one side, and she was aware that it had been so. In\r\nher later affair with Lord Rufford, she really did think that she had\r\nbeen ill used; but she was quite alive to the fact that her treatment\r\nof John Morton had been abominable. The one man, in order that he\r\nmight escape without further trouble, had in the grossest manner,\r\nsent to her the offer of a bribe. The other,--in regard to whose end\r\nher hard heart was touched, even her conscience seared,--had named\r\nher in his will as though his affection was unimpaired. Of course\r\nshe took the money, but she took it with inward groans. She took the\r\nmoney and the trinkets, and the matter was all arranged for her by\r\nMounser Green.\r\n\r\n"So after all the Paragon left her whatever he could leave," said\r\nCurrie in the same room at the Foreign Office. A week had passed\r\nsince the last conversation, and at this moment Mounser Green was not\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear no," said young Glossy. "She doesn\'t have Bragton. That\r\ngoes to his cousin."\r\n\r\n"That was entailed, Glossy, my boy."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it. Everybody thought he would leave the place\r\nto another Morton, a fellow he\'d never seen, in one of those\r\nSomerset House Offices. He and this fellow who is to have it, were\r\nenemies,--but he wouldn\'t put it out of the right line. It\'s all very\r\nwell for Mounser to be down on me, but I do happen to know what goes\r\non in that country. She gets a pot of money, and no end of family\r\njewels; but he didn\'t leave her the estate as he might have done."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mounser Green came into the room. It was rather later\r\nthan usual, being past one o\'clock;--and he looked as though he were\r\nflurried. He didn\'t speak for a few minutes, but stood before the\r\nfire smoking a cigar. And there was a general silence,--there being\r\nnow a feeling among them that Arabella Trefoil was not to be talked\r\nabout in the old way before Mounser Green. At last he spoke himself.\r\n"I suppose you haven\'t heard who is to go to Patagonia after all?"\r\n\r\n"Is it settled?" asked Currie.\r\n\r\n"Anybody we know?" asked Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n"I hope it\'s no d---- outsider," said the too energetic Glossop.\r\n\r\n"It is settled;--and it is somebody you know;--and it is not a d----\r\noutsider; unless, indeed, he may be considered to be an outsider in\r\nreference to that branch of the service."\r\n\r\n"It\'s some consul," said Currie. "Backstairs from Panama, I\'ll bet a\r\ncrown."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t Backstairs, it isn\'t a consul. Gentlemen, get out your\r\npocket-handkerchiefs. Mounser Green has consented to be expatriated\r\nfor the good of his country."\r\n\r\n"You going to Patagonia!" said Currie. "You\'re chaffing," said\r\nGlossop. "I never was so shot in my life," said Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true, my dear boys."\r\n\r\n"I never was so sorry for anything in all my born days," said\r\nGlossop, almost crying. "Why on earth should you go to Patagonia?"\r\n\r\n"Patagonia!" ejaculated Currie. "What will you do in Patagonia?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s an opening, my dear fellow," said Mounser Green leaning\r\naffectionately on Glossop\'s shoulder. "What should I do by remaining\r\nhere? When Drummond asked me I saw he wanted me to go. They don\'t\r\nforget that kind of thing." At that moment a messenger opened the\r\ndoor, and the Senator Gotobed, almost without being announced,\r\nentered the room. He had become so intimate of late at the Foreign\r\nOffice, and his visits were so frequent, that he was almost able to\r\ndispense with the assistance of any messenger. Perhaps Mounser Green\r\nand his colleagues were a little tired of him;--but yet, after their\r\nfashion, they were always civil to him, and remembered, as they were\r\nbound to do, that he was one of the leading politicians of a great\r\nnation. "I have secured the hall," he said at once, as though aware\r\nthat no news could be so important as the news he thus conveyed.\r\n\r\n"Have you indeed?" said Currie.\r\n\r\n"Secured it for the fifteenth. Now the question is--"\r\n\r\n"What do you think," said Glossop, interrupting him without the\r\nslightest hesitation. "Mounser Green is going to Patagonia, in place\r\nof the poor Paragon."\r\n\r\n"I beg to congratulate Mr. Green with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"By George I don\'t," said the juvenile clerk. "Fancy congratulating\r\na fellow on going to Patagonia! It\'s what I call an awful sell for\r\neverybody."\r\n\r\n"But as I was saying I have the hall for the fifteenth."\r\n\r\n"You mean to lecture then after all," said Green.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do; I am not going to be deterred from doing my duty\r\nbecause I am told there is a little danger. What I want to know is\r\nwhether I can depend on having a staff of policemen."\r\n\r\n"Of course there will be police," said Green.\r\n\r\n"But I mean some extra strength. I don\'t mind for myself, but I\r\nshould be so unhappy if there were anything of a commotion." Then he\r\nwas assured that the officers of the police force would look to that,\r\nand was assured also that Mounser Green and the other gentlemen in\r\nthe room would certainly attend the lecture. "I don\'t suppose I shall\r\nbe gone by that time," said Mounser Green in a melancholy tone of\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n"I MUST GO."\r\n\r\n\r\n   Rufford, March 5th.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL,\r\n\r\n   I am indeed sorry that I should have offended you by\r\n   acceding to a suggestion which, I think I may say,\r\n   originated with your mother. When she told me that her\r\n   circumstances and yours were not in a pecuniary point of\r\n   view so comfortable as they might be, I did feel that it\r\n   was in my power to alleviate that trouble. The sum of\r\n   money mentioned by my lawyer was certainly named by your\r\n   mother. At any rate pray believe that I meant to be of\r\n   service.\r\n\r\n   As to naming a place where we might meet, it really could\r\n   be of no service. It would be painful to both of us and\r\n   could have no good result. Again apologizing for having\r\n   inadvertently offended you by adopting the views which\r\n   Lady Augustus entertained, I beg to assure you that I am,\r\n\r\n   Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n   RUFFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter came from the peer himself, without assistance. After his\r\ninterview with Lady Augustus he simply told his Mentor, Sir George,\r\nthat he had steadfastly denied the existence of any engagement,\r\nnot daring to acquaint him with the offer he had made. Neither,\r\ntherefore, could he tell Sir George of the manner in which the young\r\nlady had repudiated the offer. That she should have repudiated it was\r\nno doubt to her credit. As he thought of it afterwards he felt that\r\nhad she accepted it she would have been base indeed. And yet, as he\r\nthought of what had taken place at the house in Piccadilly, he was\r\nconfident that the proposition had in some way come from her mother.\r\nNo doubt he had first written a sum of money on the fragment of\r\npaper which she had preserved;--and the evidence would so far go\r\nagainst him. But Lady Augustus had spoken piteously of their joint\r\npoverty,--and had done so in lieu of insisting with a mother\'s\r\nindignation on her daughter\'s rights. Of course she had intended to\r\nask for money. What other purpose could she have had? It was so he\r\nhad argued at the moment, and so he had argued since. If it were so\r\nhe would not admit that he had behaved unlike a gentleman in offering\r\nthe money. Yet he did not dare to tell Sir George, and therefore was\r\nobliged to answer Arabella\'s letter without assistance.\r\n\r\nHe was not altogether sorry to have his L8000, being fully as much\r\nalive to the value of money as any brother peer in the kingdom, but\r\nhe would sooner have paid the money than be subject to an additional\r\ninterview. He had been forced up to London to see first the father\r\nand then the mother, and thought that he had paid penalty enough\r\nfor any offence that he might have committed. An additional\r\ninterview with the young lady herself would distress him beyond\r\nanything,--would be worse than any other interview. He would sooner\r\nleave Rufford and go abroad than encounter it. He promised himself\r\nthat nothing should induce him to encounter it. Therefore, he wrote\r\nthe above letter.\r\n\r\nArabella, when she received it, had ceased to care very much about\r\nthe insult of the offer. She had then quarrelled with her mother, and\r\nhad insisted on some separation even without any arrangement as to\r\nfunds. Requiring some confidant, she had told a great deal, though\r\nnot quite all, to Mrs. Connop Green, and that lady had passed her on\r\nfor a while to her husband\'s aunt in London. At this time she had\r\nheard nothing of John Morton\'s will, and had perhaps thought with\r\nsome tender regret of the munificence of her other lover, which she\r\nhad scorned. But she was still intent on doing something. The fury of\r\nher despair was still on her, so that she could not weigh the injury\r\nshe might do herself against some possible gratification to her\r\nwounded spirit. Up to this moment she had formed no future hope. At\r\nthis epoch she had no string to her bow. John Morton was dead;--and\r\nshe had absolutely wept for him in solitude, though she had certainly\r\nnever loved him. Nor did she love Lord Rufford. As far as she knew\r\nhow to define her feelings, she thought that she hated him. But\r\nshe told herself hourly that she had not done with him. She was\r\ninstigated by the true feminine Medea feeling that she would find\r\nsome way to wring his heart,--even though in the process she might\r\nsuffer twice as much as he did. She had convinced herself that in\r\nthis instance he was the offender. "Painful to both of us!" No doubt!\r\nBut because it would be painful to him, it should be exacted. Though\r\nhe was a coward and would fain shirk such pain, she could be brave\r\nenough. Even though she should be driven to catch him by the arm in\r\nthe open street, she would have it out with him. He was a liar and a\r\ncoward, and she would, at any rate, have the satisfaction of telling\r\nhim so.\r\n\r\nShe thought much about it before she could resolve on what she would\r\ndo. She could not ask old Mrs. Green to help her. Mrs. Green was a\r\nkind old woman, who had lived much in the world, and would wish to\r\nsee much of it still, had age allowed her. Arabella Trefoil was at\r\nany rate the niece of a Duke, and the Duke, in this affair with Lord\r\nRufford, had taken his niece\'s part. She opened her house and as much\r\nof her heart as was left to Arabella, and was ready to mourn with\r\nher over the wicked lord. She could sympathise with her too, as to\r\nthe iniquities of her mother, whom none of the Greens loved. But she\r\nwould have been frightened by any proposition as to Medean vengeance.\r\n\r\nIn these days,--still winter days, and not open to much feminine\r\ngaiety in London, even if, in the present constitution of her\r\ncircumstances, gaiety would have come in her way,--in these days the\r\nhours in her life which interested her most, were those in which Mr.\r\nMounser Green was dutifully respectful to his aunt. Patagonia had not\r\nyet presented itself to him. Some four or five hundred a year, which\r\nthe old lady had at her own disposal, had for years past contributed\r\nto Mounser\'s ideas of duty. And now Arabella\'s presence at the\r\nsmall house in Portugal Street certainly added a new zest to those\r\nideas. The niece of the Duke of Mayfair, and the rejected of Lord\r\nRufford, was at the present moment an interesting young woman in\r\nMounser Green\'s world. There were many who thought that she had been\r\nill-used. Had she succeeded, all the world would have pitied Lord\r\nRufford;--but as he had escaped, there was a strong party for the\r\nlady. And gradually Mounser Green, who some weeks ago had not thought\r\nvery much of her, became one of the party. She had brought her maid\r\nwith her; and when she found that Mounser Green came to the house\r\nevery evening, either before or after dinner, she had recourse\r\nto her accustomed lures. She would sit quiet, dejected, almost\r\nbroken-hearted in the corner of a sofa; but when he spoke to her she\r\nwould come to life and raise her eyes,--not ignoring the recognised\r\ndejection of her jilted position, not pretending to this minor stag\r\nof six tines that she was a sprightly unwooed young fawn, fresh out\r\nof the forest,--almost asking him to weep with her, and playing her\r\naccustomed lures, though in a part which she had not hitherto filled.\r\n\r\nBut still she was resolved that her Jason should not as yet be quit\r\nof his Medea. So she made her plot. She would herself go down to\r\nRufford and force her way into her late lover\'s presence in spite of\r\nall obstacles. It was possible that she should do this and get back\r\nto London the same day,--but, to do so, she must leave London by an\r\nearly train at 7 A.M., stay seven or eight hours at Rufford, and\r\nreach the London station at 10 P.M. For such a journey there must be\r\nsome valid excuse made to Mrs. Green. There must be some necessity\r\nshown for such a journey. She would declare that a meeting was\r\nnecessary with her mother, and that her mother was at any town she\r\nchose to name at the requisite distance from London. In this way she\r\nmight start with her maid before daylight, and get back after dark,\r\nand have the meeting with her mother--or with Lord Rufford as the\r\ncase might be. But Mounser Green knew very well that Lady Augustus\r\nwas in Orchard Street, and knew also that Arabella was determined not\r\nto see her mother. And if she declared her purpose, without a caution\r\nto Mounser Green, the old woman would tell her nephew, and the nephew\r\nwould unwittingly expose the deceit. It was necessary therefore that\r\nshe should admit Mounser Green to, at any rate, half a confidence.\r\nThis she did. "Don\'t ask me any questions," she said. "I know I can\r\ntrust you. I must be out of town the whole day, and perhaps the next.\r\nAnd your aunt must not know why I am going or where. You will help\r\nme?" Of course he said that he would help her; and the lie, with a\r\nvast accompaniment of little lies, was told. There must be a meeting\r\non business matters between her and her mother, and her mother was\r\nnow in the neighbourhood of Birmingham. This was the lie told to Mrs.\r\nGreen. She would go down, and, if possible, be back on the same day.\r\nShe would take her maid with her. She thought that in such a matter\r\nas that she could trust her maid, and was in truth afraid to travel\r\nalone. "I will come in the morning and take Miss Trefoil to the\r\nstation," said Mounser, "and will meet her in the evening." And so\r\nthe matter was arranged.\r\n\r\nThe journey was not without its drawbacks and almost its perils.\r\nSummer or winter Arabella Trefoil was seldom out of bed before nine.\r\nIt was incumbent on her now to get up on a cold March morning,--when\r\nthe lion had not as yet made way for the lamb,--at half-past five.\r\nThat itself seemed to be all but impossible to her. Nevertheless she\r\nwas ready and had tried to swallow half a cup of tea, when Mounser\r\nGreen came to the door with a cab a little after six. She had\r\nendeavoured to dispense with this new friend\'s attendance, but he\r\nhad insisted, assuring her that without some such aid no cab would\r\nbe forthcoming. She had not told him and did not intend that he\r\nshould know to what station she was going. "You begged me to ask no\r\nquestions," he said when he was in the cab with her, the maid having\r\nbeen induced most unwillingly to seat herself with the cabman on the\r\nbox,--"and I have obeyed you. But I wish I knew how I could help\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You have helped me, and you are helping me. But do not ask anything\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"Will you be angry with me if I say that I fear you are intending\r\nsomething rash?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I am. How could it be otherwise with me? Don\'t you think\r\nthere are turns in a person\'s life when she must do something rash.\r\nThink of yourself. If everybody crushed you; if you were ill-treated\r\nbeyond all belief; if the very people who ought to trust you doubted\r\nyou, wouldn\'t you turn upon somebody and rend him?"\r\n\r\n"Are you going to rend anybody?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know as yet."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would let me go down with you."\r\n\r\n"No; that you certainly cannot. You must not come even into the\r\nstation with me. You have been very good to me. You will not now turn\r\nagainst me."\r\n\r\n"I certainly will do nothing but what you tell me."\r\n\r\n"Then here we are,--and now you must go. Jane can carry my hand-bag\r\nand cloak. If you choose to come in the evening at ten it will be an\r\nadditional favour."\r\n\r\n"I certainly will do so. But Miss Trefoil, one word." They were now\r\nstanding under cover of the portico in front of the railway station,\r\ninto which he was not to be allowed to enter. "What I fear is\r\nthis;--that in your first anger you may be tempted to do something\r\nwhich may be injurious to--to your prospects in life."\r\n\r\n"I have no prospects in life, Mr. Green."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that is just it. There are for most of us moments of\r\nunhappiness in which we are tempted by our misery to think that we\r\nare relieved at any rate from the burden of caution, because nothing\r\nthat can occur to us can make us worse than we are."\r\n\r\n"Nothing can make me worse than I am."\r\n\r\n"But in a few months or weeks," continued Mounser Green, bringing up\r\nin his benevolence all the wisdom of his experience, "we have got a\r\nnew footing amidst our troubles, and then we may find how terrible\r\nis the injury which our own indiscretion has brought on us. I do not\r\nwant to ask any questions, but--it might be so much better that you\r\nshould abandon your intention, and go back with me."\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be almost undecided for a moment as she thought over\r\nhis words. But she remembered her pledge to herself that Lord Rufford\r\nshould find that she had not done with him yet. "I must go," she said\r\nin a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n"If you must--"\r\n\r\n"I must go. I have no way out of it. Good-bye, Mr. Green; I cannot\r\ntell you how much obliged to you I am." Then he turned back and she\r\nwent into the station and took two first-class tickets for Rufford.\r\nAt that moment Lord Rufford was turning himself comfortably in his\r\nbed. How would he have sprung up, and how would he have fled, had he\r\nknown the evil that was coming upon him! This happened on a Thursday,\r\na day on which, as Arabella knew, the U. R. U. did not go out;--the\r\nvery Thursday on which John Morton was buried and the will was read\r\nat Bragton.\r\n\r\nShe was fully determined to speak her mind to the man and to be\r\nchecked by no feminine squeamishness. She would speak her mind to him\r\nif she could force her way into his presence. And in doing this she\r\nwould be debarred by no etiquette. It might be that she would fail,\r\nthat he would lack the courage to see her, and would run away, even\r\nbefore all his servants, when he should hear who was standing in his\r\nhall. But if he did so she would try again, even though she should\r\nhave to ride out into the hunting-field after him. Face to face she\r\nwould tell him that he was a liar and a slanderer and no gentleman,\r\nthough she should have to run round the world to catch him. When she\r\nreached Rufford she went to the town and ordered breakfast and a\r\ncarriage. As soon as she had eaten the meal she desired the driver in\r\na clear voice to take her to Rufford Hall. Was her maid to go with\r\nher? No. She would be back soon, and her maid would wait there till\r\nshe had returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nIN THE PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis thing that she was doing required an infinite amount of\r\npluck,--of that sort of hardihood which we may not quite call\r\ncourage, but which in a world well provided with policemen is\r\ninfinitely more useful than courage. Lord Rufford himself was endowed\r\nwith all the ordinary bravery of an Englishman, but he could have\r\nflown as soon as run into a lion\'s den as Arabella was doing. She had\r\nlearned that Lady Penwether and Miss Penge were both at Rufford Hall,\r\nand understood well the difficulty there would be in explaining her\r\nconduct should she find herself in their presence. And there were\r\nall the servants there to stare at her, and the probability that she\r\nmight be shown to the door and told that no one there would speak to\r\nher. She saw it all before her, and knew how bitter it might be;--but\r\nher heart was big enough to carry her through it. She was dressed\r\nvery simply, but still by no means dowdily, in a black silk dress,\r\nand though she wore a thick veil when she got out of the fly and rang\r\nthe door bell, she had been at some pains with her hair before she\r\nleft the inn. Her purpose was revenge; but still she had an eye to\r\nthe possible chance,--the chance barely possible of bringing the man\r\nto submit.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was opened she raised her veil and asked for Lord\r\nRufford;--but as she did so she walked on through the broad passage\r\nwhich led from the front door into a wide central space which they\r\ncalled the billiard-room but which really was the hall of the house.\r\nThis she did as a manifesto that she did not mean to leave the house\r\nbecause she might be told that he was out or could not be seen, or\r\nthat he was engaged. It was then nearly one o\'clock, and no doubt\r\nhe would be there for luncheon. Of course he might be in truth away\r\nfrom home, but she must do her best to judge of that by the servant\'s\r\nmanner. The man knew her well, and not improbably had heard something\r\nof his master\'s danger. He was, however, very respectful and told her\r\nthat his lordship was out in the grounds;--but that Lady Penwether\r\nwas in the drawing-room. Then a sudden thought struck her, and she\r\nasked the man whether he would show her in what part of the grounds\r\nshe might find Lord Rufford. Upon that he took her to the front door\r\nand pointing across the park to a belt of trees, showed her three or\r\nfour men standing round some piece of work. He believed, he said,\r\nthat one of those men was his lordship.\r\n\r\nShe bowed her thanks and was descending the steps on her way to join\r\nthe group, when whom should she see but Lady Penwether coming into\r\nthe house with her garden-hat and gloves. It was unfortunate; but\r\nshe would not allow herself to be stopped by Lady Penwether. She\r\nbowed stiffly and would have passed on without a word, but that was\r\nimpossible. "Miss Trefoil!" said Lady Penwether with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Your brother is just across the park. I think I see him and will go\r\nto him."\r\n\r\n"I had better send and tell him that you are here," said her\r\nladyship.\r\n\r\n"I need not trouble you so far. I can be my own messenger.\r\nPerhaps you will allow the fly to be sent round to the yard for\r\nhalf-an-hour." As she said this she was still passing down the steps.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Penwether knew that it behoved her to prevent this if it\r\nmight be possible. Of late she had had little or no conversation\r\nwith her brother about Miss Trefoil, but she had heard much from her\r\nhusband. She would be justified, she thought, in saying or in doing\r\nalmost anything which would save him from such an encounter. "I\r\nreally think," she said, "that he had better be told that you are\r\nhere," and as she spoke she strove to put herself in the visitor\'s\r\nway. "You had better come in, Miss Trefoil, and he shall be informed\r\nat once."\r\n\r\n"By no means, Lady Penwether. I would not for worlds give him or you\r\nso much trouble. I see him and I will go to him." Then Lady Penwether\r\nabsolutely put out her hand to detain her; but Arabella shook it\r\noff angrily and looked into the other woman\'s face with fierce eyes.\r\n"Allow me," she said, "to conduct myself at this moment as I may\r\nthink best. I shall do so at any rate." Then she stalked on and Lady\r\nPenwether saw that any contest was hopeless. Had she sent the servant\r\non with all his speed, so as to gain three or four moments, her\r\nbrother could hardly have fled through the trees in face of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford, who was busy planning the prolongation of a ha-ha\r\nfence, saw nothing of all this; but, after a while he was aware that\r\na woman was coming to him, and then gradually he saw who that woman\r\nwas. Arabella when she had found herself advancing closer went slowly\r\nenough. She was sure of her prey now, and was wisely mindful that\r\nit might be well that she should husband her breath. The nearer she\r\ndrew to him the slower became her pace, and more majestic. Her veil\r\nwas well thrown back, and her head was raised in the air. She knew\r\nthese little tricks of deportment and could carry herself like a\r\nqueen. He had taken a moment or two to consider. Should he fly? It\r\nwas possible. He might vault over a railed fence in among the trees,\r\nat a spot not ten yards from her, and then it would be impossible\r\nthat she should run him down. He might have done it had not the men\r\nbeen there to see it. As it was he left them in the other direction\r\nand came forward to meet her. He tried to smile pleasantly as he\r\nspoke to her. "So I see that you would not take my advice," he said.\r\n\r\n"Neither your advice nor your money, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Ah,--I was so sorry about that! But, indeed, indeed,--the fault was\r\nnot mine."\r\n\r\n"They were your figures that I saw upon the paper, and by your\r\norders, no doubt, that the lawyer acted. But I have not come to say\r\nmuch of that. You meant I suppose to be gracious."\r\n\r\n"I meant to be--goodnatured."\r\n\r\n"I daresay. You were willing enough to give away what you did not\r\nwant. But there must be more between us than any question of money.\r\nLord Rufford you have treated me most shamefully."\r\n\r\n"I hope not. I think not."\r\n\r\n"And you yourself must be well aware of it,--quite as well aware of\r\nit as I am. You have thrown me over and absolutely destroyed me;--and\r\nwhy?" He shrugged his shoulders. "Because you have been afraid of\r\nothers; because your sister has told you that you were mistaken in\r\nyour choice. The women around you have been too many for you, and\r\nhave not allowed you to dispose of your hand, and your name, and\r\nyour property as you pleased. I defy you to say that this was not\r\nyour sister\'s doing." He was too much astounded to contradict her\r\nrapidly, and then she passed on, not choosing to give him time for\r\ncontradiction. "Will you have the hardihood to say that you did\r\nnot love me?" Then she paused thinking that he would not dare to\r\ncontradict her then, feeling that in that she was on strong ground.\r\n"Were you lying when you told me that you did? What did you mean when\r\nI was in your arms up in the house there? What did you intend me to\r\nthink that you meant?" Then she stopped, standing well in front of\r\nhim, and looking fixedly into his face.\r\n\r\nThis was the very thing that he had feared. Lord Augustus had been a\r\ntrouble. The Duke\'s letter had been a trouble. Lady Augustus had been\r\na trouble; and Sir George\'s sermons had been troublesome. But what\r\nwere they all when compared to this? How is it possible that a man\r\nshould tell a girl that he has not loved her, when he has embraced\r\nher again and again? He may know it, and she may know it,--and each\r\nmay know that the other knows it;--but to say that he does not and\r\ndid not then love her is beyond the scope of his audacity,--unless he\r\nbe a heartless Nero. "No one can grieve about this so much as I do,"\r\nhe said weakly.\r\n\r\n"Cannot I grieve more, do you think,--I who told all my relatives\r\nthat I was to become your wife, and was justified in so telling them?\r\nWas I not justified?"\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"You think not! What did you mean then? What were you thinking of\r\nwhen we were coming back in the carriage from Stamford,--when with\r\nyour arms round me you swore that you loved me better than all the\r\nworld? Is that true? Did you so swear?" What a question for a man to\r\nhave to answer! It was becoming clear to him that there was nothing\r\nfor him but to endure and be silent. Even to this interview the gods\r\nwould at last give an end. The hour would pass, though, alas, so\r\nslowly, and she could not expect that he should stand there to be\r\nrated much after the accustomed time for feeding. "You acknowledge\r\nthat, and do you dare to say that I had no right to tell my friends?"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment in which he thought it was almost a pity that\r\nhe had not married her. She was very beautiful in her present\r\nform,--more beautiful he thought than ever. She was the niece of a\r\nDuke, and certainly a very clever woman. He had not wanted money and\r\nwhy shouldn\'t he have married her? As for hunting him,--that was a\r\nmatter of course. He was as much born and bred to be hunted as a fox.\r\nHe could not do it now as he had put too much power into the hands of\r\nthe Penwethers, but he almost wished that he had. "I never intended\r\nit," he said.\r\n\r\n"What did you intend? After what has occurred I suppose I have a\r\nright to ask such a question. I have made a somewhat unpleasant\r\njourney to-day, all alone, on purpose to ask that question. What did\r\nyou intend?" In his great annoyance he struck his shovel angrily\r\nagainst the ground. "And I will not leave you till I get an answer to\r\nthe question. What did you intend, Lord Rufford?" There was nothing\r\nfor him but silence and a gradual progress back towards the house.\r\n\r\nBut from the latter resource she cut him off for a time. "You will do\r\nme the favour to remain with me here till this conversation is ended.\r\nYou cannot refuse me so slight a request as that, seeing the trouble\r\nto which you have put me. I never saw a man so forgetful of words.\r\nYou cannot speak. Have you no excuse to offer, not a word to say in\r\nexplanation of conduct so black that I don\'t think here in England I\r\never heard a case to equal it? If your sister had been treated so!"\r\n\r\n"It would have been impossible."\r\n\r\n"I believe it. Her cautious nature would have trusted no man as\r\nI trusted you. Her lips, doubtless, were never unfrozen till the\r\nsettlements had been signed. With her it was a matter of bargain, not\r\nof love. I can well believe that."\r\n\r\n"I will not talk about my sister."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me, Lord Rufford, that you object to talk about\r\nanything. You certainly have been very uncommunicative with reference\r\nto yourself. Were you lying when you told me that you loved me?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Did I lie when I told the Duchess that you had promised me your\r\nlove? Did I lie when I told my mother that in these days a man does\r\nnot always mention marriage when he asks a girl to be his wife? You\r\nsaid you loved me, and I believed you, and the rest was a thing of\r\ncourse. And you meant it. You know you meant it. When you held me in\r\nyour arms in the carriage you know you meant me to suppose that it\r\nwould always be so. Then the fear of your sister came upon you, and\r\nof your sister\'s husband,--and you ran away! I wonder whether you\r\nthink yourself a man!" And yet she felt that she had not hit him yet.\r\nHe was wretched enough; and she could see that he was wretched;--but\r\nthe wretchedness would pass away as soon as she was gone. How could\r\nshe stab him so that the wound would remain? With what virus could\r\nshe poison her arrow, so that the agony might be prolonged? "And such\r\na coward too! I began to suspect it when you started that night from\r\nMistletoe,--though I did not think then that you could be all mean,\r\nall cowardly. From that day to this, you have not dared to speak a\r\nword of truth. Every word has been a falsehood."\r\n\r\n"By heavens, no."\r\n\r\n"Every word a falsehood! and I, a lady,--a lady whom you have so\r\ndeeply injured, whose cruel injury even you have not the face to\r\ndeny,--am forced by your cowardice to come to you here, because you\r\nhave not dared to come out to meet me. Is that true!"\r\n\r\n"What good can it do?"\r\n\r\n"None to me, God knows. You are such a thing that I would not have\r\nyou now I know you, though you were twice Lord Rufford. But I have\r\nchosen to speak my mind to you and to tell you what I think. Did you\r\nsuppose that when I said I would meet you face to face I was to be\r\ndeterred by such girl\'s excuses as you made? I chose to tell you to\r\nyour face that you are false, a coward, and no gentleman, and though\r\nyou had hidden yourself under the very earth I would have found you."\r\nThen she turned round and saw Sir George Penwether standing close to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford had seen him approaching for some time, and had made\r\none or two futile attempts to meet him. Arabella\'s back had been\r\nturned to the house, and she had not heard the steps or observed the\r\ndirection of her companion\'s eyes. He came so near before he was seen\r\nthat he heard her concluding words. Then Lord Rufford with a ghastly\r\nattempt at pleasantry introduced them. "George," he said, "I do not\r\nthink you know Miss Trefoil. Sir George Penwether;--Miss Trefoil."\r\n\r\nThe interview had been watched from the house and the husband had\r\nbeen sent down by his wife to mitigate the purgatory which she knew\r\nthat her brother must be enduring. "My wife," said Sir George, "has\r\nsent me to ask Miss Trefoil whether she will not come into lunch."\r\n\r\n"I believe it is Lord Rufford\'s house," said Arabella.\r\n\r\n"If Miss Trefoil\'s frame of mind will allow her to sit at table with\r\nme I shall be proud to see her," said Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"Miss Trefoil\'s frame of mind will not allow her to eat or to drink\r\nwith such a dastard," said she turning away in the direction of the\r\npark gates. "Perhaps, Sir George, you will be kind enough to direct\r\nthe man who brought me here to pick me up at the lodge." And so she\r\nwalked away--a mile across the park,--neither of them caring to\r\nfollow her.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her as she stood at the lodge gate, having obstinately\r\nrefused to enter the house, to be an eternity before the fly came to\r\nher. When it did come she felt as though her strength would barely\r\nenable her to climb into it. And when she was there she wept, with\r\nbitter throbbing woe, all the way to Rufford. It was over now at any\r\nrate. Now there was not a possible chance on which a gleam of hope\r\nmight be made to settle. And how handsome he was, and how beautiful\r\nthe place, and how perfect would have been the triumph could she have\r\nachieved it! One more word,--one other pressure of the hand in the\r\npost-chaise, might have done it! Had he really promised her marriage\r\nshe did not even now think that he would have gone back from his\r\nword. If that heavy stupid duke would have spoken to him that night\r\nat Mistletoe, all would have been well! But now,--now there was\r\nnothing for her but weeping and gnashing of teeth. He was gone, and\r\npoor Morton was gone; and all those others, whose memories rose like\r\nghosts before her;--they were all gone. And she wept as she thought\r\nthat she might perhaps have made a better use of the gifts which\r\nProvidence had put in her way.\r\n\r\nWhen Mounser Green met her at the station she was beyond measure\r\nweary. Through the whole journey she had been struggling to restrain\r\nher sobs so that her maid should neither hear nor see them. "Don\'t\r\nmind me, Mr. Green; I am only tired,--so tired," she said as she got\r\ninto the carriage which he had brought.\r\n\r\nHe had with him a long, formal-looking letter addressed to herself.\r\nBut she was too weary to open it that night. It was the letter\r\nconveying the tidings of the legacy which Morton had made in her\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nLORD RUFFORD\'S MODEL FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Senator Gotobed was paying a second visit to Rufford\r\nHall. In the matter of Goarly and Scrobby he had never given way an\r\ninch. He was still strongly of opinion that a gentleman\'s pheasants\r\nhad no right to eat his neighbour\'s corn, and that if damage were\r\nadmitted, the person committing the injury should not take upon\r\nhimself to assess the damage. He also thought,--and very often\r\ndeclared his thoughts,--that Goarly was justified in shooting not\r\nonly foxes but hounds also when they came upon his property, and in\r\nmoments of excitement had gone so far as to say that not even horses\r\nshould be held sacred. He had, however, lately been driven to admit\r\nthat Goarly himself was not all that a man should be, and that Mrs.\r\nGoarly\'s goose was an impostor. It was the theory,--the principle\r\nfor which he combated, declaring that the evil condition of the man\r\nhimself was due to the evil institutions among which he had been\r\nreared. By degrees evidence had been obtained of Scrobby\'s guilt\r\nin the matter of the red herrings, and he was to be tried for the\r\noffence of putting down poison. Goarly was to be the principal\r\nwitness against his brother conspirator. Lord Rufford, instigated by\r\nhis brother-in-law, and liking the spirit of the man, had invited\r\nthe Senator to stay at the Hall while the case was being tried at\r\nthe Rufford Quarter Sessions. I am afraid the invitation was given\r\nin a spirit of triumph over the Senator rather than with genuine\r\nhospitality. It was thought well that the American should be made to\r\nsee in public the degradation of the abject creature with whom he had\r\nsympathised. Perhaps there were some who thought that in this way\r\nthey would get the Senator\'s neck under their heels. If there were\r\nsuch they were likely to be mistaken, as the Senator was not a man\r\nprone to submit himself to such treatment.\r\n\r\nHe was seated at table with Lady Penwether and Miss Penge when Lord\r\nRufford and his brother-in-law came into the room, after parting\r\nwith Miss Trefoil in the manner described in the last chapter. Lady\r\nPenwether had watched their unwelcome visitor as she took her way\r\nacross the park and had whispered something to Miss Penge. Miss Penge\r\nunderstood the matter thoroughly, and would not herself have made the\r\nslightest allusion to the other young lady. Had the Senator not been\r\nthere the two gentlemen would have been allowed to take their places\r\nwithout a word on the subject. But the Senator had a marvellous gift\r\nof saying awkward things and would never be reticent. He stood for\r\na while at the window in the drawing-room before he went across the\r\nhall, and even took up a pair of field-glasses to scrutinise the\r\nlady; and when they were all present he asked whether that was not\r\nMiss Trefoil whom he had seen down by the new fence. Lady Penwether,\r\nwithout seeming to look about her, did look about her for a few\r\nseconds to see whether the question might be allowed to die away\r\nunanswered. She perceived, from the Senator\'s face, that he intended\r\nto have an answer.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "that was Miss Trefoil. I am very glad that she is\r\nnot coming in to disturb us."\r\n\r\n"A great blessing," said Miss Penge.\r\n\r\n"Where is she staying?" asked the Senator.\r\n\r\n"I think she drove over from Rufford," said the elder lady.\r\n\r\n"Poor young lady! She was engaged to marry my friend, Mr. John\r\nMorton. She must have felt his death very bitterly. He was an\r\nexcellent young man; rather opinionated and perhaps too much\r\nwedded to the traditions of his own country; but, nevertheless, a\r\npainstaking, excellent young man. I had hoped to welcome her as Mrs.\r\nMorton in America."\r\n\r\n"He was to have gone to Patagonia," said Lord Rufford, endeavouring\r\nto come to himself after the sufferings of the morning.\r\n\r\n"We should have seen him back in Washington, Sir. Whenever you have\r\nanything good in diplomacy you generally send him to us. Poor young\r\nlady! Was she talking about him?"\r\n\r\n"Not particularly," said his lordship.\r\n\r\n"She must have remembered that when she was last here he was of\r\nthe party, and it was but a few weeks ago,--only a little before\r\nChristmas. He struck me as being cold in his manner as an affianced\r\nlover. Was not that your idea, Lady Penwether?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I observed him especially."\r\n\r\n"I have reason to believe that he was much attached to her. She\r\ncould be sprightly enough; but at times there seemed to come a cold\r\nmelancholy upon her too. It is I fancy so with most of your English\r\nladies. Miss Trefoil always gave me the idea of being a good type\r\nof the English aristocracy." Lady Penwether and Miss Penge drew\r\nthemselves up very stiffly. "You admired her, I think, my Lord."\r\n\r\n"Very much indeed," said Lord Rufford, filling his mouth with\r\npigeon-pie as he spoke, and not lifting his eyes from his plate.\r\n\r\n"Will she be back to dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no," said Lady Penwether. There was something in her tone\r\nwhich at last startled the Senator into perceiving that Miss Trefoil\r\nwas not popular at Rufford Hall.\r\n\r\n"She only came for a morning call," said Lord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"Poor young woman. She has lost her husband, and, I am afraid, now\r\nhas lost her friends also. I am told that she is not well off;--and\r\nfrom what I see and hear, I fancy that here in England a young lady\r\nwithout a dowry cannot easily replace a lover. I suppose, too, Miss\r\nTrefoil is not quite in her first youth."\r\n\r\n"If you have done, Caroline," said Lady Penwether to Miss Penge, "I\r\nthink we\'ll go into the other room."\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Sir George asked the Senator to accompany him for\r\na walk. Sir George was held to be responsible for the Senator\'s\r\npresence, and was told by the ladies that he must do something with\r\nhim. The next day, which was Friday, would be occupied by the affairs\r\nof Scrobby and Goarly, and on the Saturday he was to return to town.\r\nThe two started about three with the object of walking round the\r\npark and the home farm--the Senator intent on his duty of examining\r\nthe ways of English life to the very bottom. "I hope I did not say\r\nanything amiss about Miss Trefoil," he remarked, as they passed\r\nthrough a shrubbery gate into the park.\r\n\r\n"No; I think not."\r\n\r\n"I thought your good lady looked as though she did not like the\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"I am not sure that Miss Trefoil is very popular with the ladies up\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a handsome young woman and clever, though, as I said before,\r\ngiven to melancholy, and sometimes fastidious. When we were all here\r\nI thought that Lord Rufford admired her, and that poor Mr. Morton was\r\na little jealous."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t at Rufford then. Here we get out of the park on to the home\r\nfarm. Rufford does it very well,--very well indeed."\r\n\r\n"Looks after it altogether himself?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot quite say that. He has a land-bailiff who lives in the\r\nhouse there."\r\n\r\n"With a salary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; L120 a year I think the man has."\r\n\r\n"And that house?" asked the Senator. "Why, the house and garden are\r\nworth L50 a year."\r\n\r\n"I dare say they are. Of course it costs money. It\'s near the park\r\nand had to be made ornamental."\r\n\r\n"And does it pay?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; I should think not. In point of fact I know it does not.\r\nHe loses about the value of the ground."\r\n\r\nThe Senator asked a great many more questions and then began his\r\nlecture. "A man who goes into trade and loses by it, cannot be doing\r\ngood to himself or to others. You say, Sir George, that it is a model\r\nfarm;--but it\'s a model of ruin. If you want to teach a man any\r\nother business, you don\'t specially select an example in which the\r\nproprietors are spending all their capital without any return. And if\r\nyou would not do this in shoemaking, why in farming?"\r\n\r\n"The neighbours are able to see how work should be done."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Sir George, but it seems to me that they are enabled to\r\nsee how work should not be done. If his lordship would stick up over\r\nhis gate a notice to the effect that everything seen there was to be\r\navoided, he might do some service. If he would publish his accounts\r\nhalf-yearly in the village newspaper--"\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t a village newspaper."\r\n\r\n"In the _Rufford Gazette_. There is a _Rufford Gazette_, and Rufford\r\nisn\'t much more than a village. If he would publish his accounts\r\nhalf-yearly in the _Rufford Gazette_, honestly showing how much he\r\nhad lost by his system, how much capital had been misapplied, and how\r\nmuch labour wasted, he might serve as an example, like the pictures\r\nof \'The Idle Apprentice.\' I don\'t see that he can do any other\r\ngood,--unless it be to the estimable gentleman who is allowed to\r\noccupy the pretty house. I don\'t think you\'d see anything like that\r\nmodel farm in our country, Sir."\r\n\r\n"Your views, Mr. Gotobed, are utilitarian rather than picturesque."\r\n\r\n"Oh!--if you say that it is done for the picturesque, that is\r\nanother thing. Lord Rufford is a wealthy lord, and can afford to be\r\npicturesque. A green sward I should have thought handsomer, as well\r\nas less expensive, than a ploughed field, but that is a matter of\r\ntaste. Only why call a pretty toy a model farm? You might mislead the\r\nBritish rustics."\r\n\r\nThey had by this time passed through a couple of fields which formed\r\npart of the model farm, and had come to a stile leading into a large\r\nmeadow. "This I take it," said the Senator looking about him, "is\r\nbeyond the limits of my Lord\'s plaything."\r\n\r\n"This is Shugborough," said Sir George, "and there is John Runce, the\r\noccupier, on his pony. He at any rate is a model farmer." As he spoke\r\nMr. Runce slowly trotted up to them touching his hat, and Mr. Gotobed\r\nrecognized the man who had declined to sit next to him at the hunting\r\nbreakfast. Runce also thought that he knew the gentleman. "Do you\r\nhunt to-morrow, Mr. Runce?" asked Sir George.\r\n\r\n"Well, Sir George, no; I think not. I b\'lieve I must go to Rufford\r\nand hear that fellow Scrobby get it hot and heavy."\r\n\r\n"We seem all to be going that way. You think he\'ll be convicted,\r\nSir?"\r\n\r\n"If there\'s a juryman left in the country worth his salt, he\'ll be\r\nconvicted," said Mr. Runce, almost enraged at the doubt. "But that\r\nother fellow;--he\'s to get off. That\'s what kills me, Sir George."\r\n\r\n"You\'re alluding to Mr. Goarly, Sir?" said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it, certainly," said Runce, still looking very\r\nsuspiciously at his companion.\r\n\r\n"I almost think he is the bigger rogue of the two," said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Runce; "well! I don\'t know as he ain\'t. Six of one and\r\nhalf a dozen of the other! That\'s about it." But he was evidently\r\npacified by the opinion.\r\n\r\n"Goarly is certainly a rascal all round," continued the Senator.\r\nRunce looked at him to make sure whether he was the man who had\r\nuttered such fearful blasphemies at the breakfast-table. "I think we\r\nhad a little discussion about this before, Mr. Runce."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to see you have changed your principles, Sir."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it. I am too old to change my principles, Mr. Runce.\r\nAnd much as I admire this country I don\'t think it\'s the place in\r\nwhich I should be induced to do so." Runce looked at him again with a\r\nscowl on his face and with a falling mouth. "Mr. Goarly is certainly\r\na blackguard."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I rather think he is."\r\n\r\n"But a blackguard may have a good cause. Put it in your own case, Mr.\r\nRunce. If his Lordship\'s pheasants ate up your wheat--"\r\n\r\n"They\'re welcome;--they\'re welcome! The more the merrier. But they\r\ndon\'t. Pheasants know when they\'re well off."\r\n\r\n"Or if a crowd of horsemen rode over your fences, don\'t you think--"\r\n\r\n"My fences! They\'d be welcome in my wife\'s bedroom if the fox took\r\nthat way. My fences! It\'s what I has fences for,--to be ridden over."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t exactly hear what I have to say, Mr. Runce."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t want. No offence, sir, if you be a friend of my\r\nLord\'s;--but if his Lordship was to say hisself that Goarly was\r\nright, I wouldn\'t listen to him. A good cause,--and he going about\r\nat dead o\'night with his pockets full of p\'ison! Hounds and foxes\r\nall one!--or little childer either for the matter o\' that, if they\r\nhappened on the herrings!"\r\n\r\n"I have not said his cause was good, Mr. Runce."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wish you good evening, Sir George," said the farmer, reining\r\nhis pony round. "Good evening to you, sir." And Mr. Runce trotted or\r\nrather ambled off, unable to endure another word.\r\n\r\n"An honest man, I dare say," said the Senator.\r\n\r\n"Certainly;--and not a bad specimen of a British farmer."\r\n\r\n"Not a bad specimen of a Briton generally;--but still, perhaps, a\r\nlittle unreasonable." After that Sir George said as little as he\r\ncould, till he had brought the Senator back to the hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s all over now," said Lady Penwether to Miss Penge, when\r\nthe gentlemen had left them alone in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope so,--for his sake. What a woman to come here by\r\nherself, in that way!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he ever cared for her in the least."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that I have troubled myself much about that," replied\r\nMiss Penge. "For the sake of the family generally, and the property,\r\nand all that, I should be very very sorry to think that he was going\r\nto make her Lady Rufford. I dare say he has amused himself with her."\r\n\r\n"There was very little of that, as far as I can learn;--very little\r\nencouragement indeed! What we saw here was the worst of it. He was\r\nhardly with her at all at Mistletoe."\r\n\r\n"I hope it will make him more cautious;--that\'s all," said Miss\r\nPenge. Miss Penge was now a great heiress, having had her lawsuit\r\nrespecting certain shares in a Welsh coal-mine settled since we last\r\nsaw her. As all the world knows she came from one of the oldest\r\nCommoner\'s families in the West of England, and is, moreover, a\r\nhandsome young woman, only twenty-seven years of age. Lady Penwether\r\nthinks that she is the very woman to be mistress of Rufford, and I do\r\nnot know that Miss Penge herself is averse to the idea. Lord Rufford\r\nhas been too lately wounded to rise at the bait quite immediately;\r\nbut his sister knows that her brother is impressionable and that a\r\nlittle patience will go a long way. They have, however, all agreed at\r\nthe hall that Arabella\'s name shall not again be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSCROBBY\'S TRIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nRufford was a good deal moved as to the trial of Mr. Scrobby. Mr.\r\nScrobby was a man who not long since had held his head up in Rufford\r\nand had the reputation of a well-to-do tradesman. Enemies had perhaps\r\ndoubted his probity; but he had gone on and prospered, and, two or\r\nthree years before the events which are now chronicled, had retired\r\non a competence. He had then taken a house with a few acres of\r\nland, lying between Rufford and Rufford Hall,--the property of Lord\r\nRufford, and had commenced genteel life. Many in the neighbourhood\r\nhad been astonished that such a man should have been accepted as a\r\ntenant in such a house; and it was generally understood that Lord\r\nRufford himself had been very angry with his agent. Mr. Scrobby\r\ndid not prosper greatly in his new career. He became a guardian of\r\nthe poor and quarrelled with all the Board. He tried to become a\r\nmunicipal counsellor in the borough, but failed. Then he quarrelled\r\nwith his landlord, insisted on making changes in the grounds which\r\nwere not authorised by the terms of his holding, would not pay his\r\nrent, and was at last ejected,--having caused some considerable\r\namount of trouble. Then he occupied a portion of his leisure with\r\nspreading calumnies as to his Lordship, and was generally understood\r\nto have made up his mind to be disagreeable. As Lord Rufford was a\r\nsportsman rather than anything else Scrobby studied how he might best\r\ngive annoyance in that direction, and some time before the Goarly\r\naffair had succeeded in creating considerable disturbance. When a man\r\nwill do this pertinaciously, and when his selected enemy is wealthy\r\nand of high standing, he will generally succeed in getting a party\r\nround him. In Rufford there were not a few who thought that Lord\r\nRufford\'s pheasants and foxes were a nuisance,--though probably these\r\npersons had never suffered in any way themselves. It was a grand\r\nthing to fight a lord,--and so Scrobby had a party.\r\n\r\nWhen the action against his Lordship was first threatened by Goarly,\r\nand when it was understood that Scrobby had backed him with money,\r\nthere was a feeling that Scrobby was doing rather a fine thing. He\r\nhad not, indeed, used his money openly, as the Senator had afterwards\r\ndone; but that was not Scrobby\'s way. If Goarly had been ill-used any\r\nhelp was legitimate, and the party as a party was proud of their man.\r\nBut when it came to pass that poison had been laid down, "wholesale"\r\nas the hunting men said, in Dillsborough Wood, in the close vicinity\r\nof Goarly\'s house, then the party hesitated. Such strategy as that\r\nwas disgusting;--but was there reason to think that Scrobby had been\r\nconcerned in the matter? Scrobby still had an income, and ate roast\r\nmeat or boiled every day for his dinner. Was it likely that such a\r\nman should deal in herrings and strychnine?\r\n\r\nNickem had been at work for the last three months, backed up by funds\r\nwhich had latterly been provided by the lord\'s agent, and had in\r\ntruth run the matter down. Nickem had found out all about it, and\r\nin his pride had resigned his stool in Mr. Masters\' office. But the\r\nScrobby party in Rufford could not bring itself to believe that\r\nNickem was correct. That Goarly\'s hand had actually placed the\r\nherrings no man either at Rufford or Dillsborough had doubted. Such\r\nwas now Nickem\'s story. But of what avail would be the evidence of\r\nsuch a man as Goarly against such a man as Scrobby? It would be\r\nutterly worthless unless corroborated, and the Scrobby party was not\r\nyet aware how clever Nickem had been. Thus all Rufford was interested\r\nin the case.\r\n\r\nLord Rufford, Sir George Penwether, his Lordship\'s agent, and Mr.\r\nGotobed, had been summoned as witnesses,--the expenditure of money by\r\nthe Senator having by this time become notorious; and on the morning\r\nof the trial they all went into the town in his Lordship\'s drag. The\r\nSenator, as the guest, was on the box-seat with his Lordship, and as\r\nthey passed old Runce trotting into Rufford on his nag, Mr. Gotobed\r\nbegan to tell the story of yesterday\'s meeting, complaining of the\r\nabsurdity of the old farmer\'s anger.\r\n\r\n"Penwether told me about it," said the Lord.\r\n\r\n"I suppose your tenant is a little crazy."\r\n\r\n"By no means. I thought he was right in what he said, if I understood\r\nPenwether."\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t have been right. He turned from me in disgust simply\r\nbecause I tried to explain to him that a rogue has as much right to\r\nbe defended by the law as an honest man."\r\n\r\n"Runce looks upon these men as vermin which ought to be hunted down."\r\n\r\n"But they are not vermin. They are men;--and till they have been\r\nfound guilty they are innocent men."\r\n\r\n"If a man had murdered your child, would he be innocent in your eyes\r\ntill he was convicted?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so;--but I should be very anxious to bring home the crime\r\nagainst him. And should he be found guilty even then he should not be\r\nmade subject to other punishment than that the law awards. Mr. Runce\r\nis angry with me because I do not think that Goarly should be crushed\r\nunder the heels of all his neighbours. Take care, my Lord. Didn\'t we\r\ncome round that corner rather sharp?"\r\n\r\nThen Lord Rufford emphatically declared that such men as Scrobby\r\nand Goarly should be crushed, and the Senator, with an inward sigh\r\ndeclared that between landlord and tenant, between peer and farmer,\r\nbetween legislator and rustic, there was, in capacity for logical\r\ninference, no difference whatever. The British heart might be all\r\nright; but the British head was,--ah,--hopelessly wooden! It would\r\nbe his duty to say so in his lecture, and perhaps some good might be\r\ndone to so gracious but so stolid a people, if only they could be got\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\nScrobby had got down a barrister from London, and therefore the case\r\nwas allowed to drag itself out through the whole day. Lord Rufford,\r\nas a magistrate, went on to the bench himself,--though he explained\r\nthat he only took his seat there as a spectator. Sir George and Mr.\r\nGotobed were also allowed to sit in the high place,--though the\r\nSenator complained even of this. Goarly and Scrobby were not allowed\r\nto be there, and Lord Rufford, in his opinion, should also have been\r\ndebarred from such a privilege. A long time was occupied before\r\neven a jury could be sworn, the barrister earning his money by\r\nbrow-beating the provincial bench and putting various obstacles in\r\nthe way of the trial. As he was used to practice at the assizes of\r\ncourse he was able to domineer. This juror would not do, nor that.\r\nThe chairman was all wrong in his law. The officers of the Court\r\nknew nothing about it. At first there was quite a triumph for the\r\nScrobbyites, and even Nickem himself was frightened. But at last\r\nthe real case was allowed to begin, and Goarly was soon in the\r\nwitness-box. Goarly did not seem to enjoy the day, and was with\r\ndifficulty got to tell his own story even on his own side. But the\r\nstory when it was told was simple enough. He had met Mr. Scrobby\r\naccidentally in Rufford and they two had together discussed the\r\naffairs of the young Lord. They came to an agreement that the young\r\nLord was a tyrant and ought to be put down, and Scrobby showed how\r\nit was to be done. Scrobby instigated the action about the pheasants,\r\nand undertook to pay the expenses if Goarly would act in the other\r\nlittle matter. But, when he found that the Senator\'s money was\r\nforthcoming, he had been anything but as good as his word. Goarly\r\nswore that in hard cash he had never seen more than four shillings\r\nof Scrobby\'s money. As to the poison, Goarly declared that he knew\r\nnothing about it; but he certainly had received a parcel of herrings\r\nfrom Scrobby\'s own hands, and in obedience to Scrobby\'s directions,\r\nhad laid them down in Dillsborough Wood the very morning on which\r\nthe hounds had come there. He owned that he supposed that there\r\nmight be something in the herrings, something that would probably be\r\ndeleterious to hounds as well as foxes,--or to children should the\r\nherrings happen to fall into children\'s hands; but he assured the\r\nCourt that he had no knowledge of poison,--none whatever. Then he was\r\nmade by the other side to give a complete and a somewhat prolonged\r\naccount of his own life up to the present time,--this information\r\nbeing of course required by the learned barrister on the other side;\r\nin listening to which the Senator did become thoroughly ashamed of\r\nthe Briton whom he had assisted with his generosity.\r\n\r\nBut all this would have been nothing had not Nickem secured the old\r\nwoman who had sold the herrings,--and also the chemist, from whom the\r\nstrychnine had been purchased as much as three years previously. This\r\nlatter feat was Nickem\'s great triumph,--the feeling of the glory\r\nof which induced him to throw up his employment in Mr. Masters\'\r\noffice, and thus brought him and his family to absolute ruin within\r\na few months in spite of the liberal answers which were made by Lord\r\nRufford to many of his numerous appeals. Away in Norrington the\r\npoison had been purchased as much as three years ago, and yet Nickem\r\nhad had the luck to find it out. When the Scrobbyites heard that\r\nScrobby had gone all the way to Norrington to buy strychnine to kill\r\nrats they were Scrobbyites no longer. "I hope they\'ll hang \'un. I\r\ndo hope they\'ll hang \'un," said Mr. Runce quite out loud from his\r\ncrowded seat just behind the attorney\'s bench.\r\n\r\nThe barrister of course struggled hard to earn his money. Though he\r\ncould not save his client he might annoy the other side. He insisted\r\ntherefore on bringing the whole affair of the pheasants before the\r\nCourt, and examined the Senator at great length. He asked the Senator\r\nwhether he had not found himself compelled to sympathise with the\r\nwrongs he had witnessed. The Senator declared that he had witnessed\r\nno wrongs. Why then had he interfered? Because he had thought that\r\nthere might be wrong, and because he wished to see what power a\r\npoor man in this country would have against a rich one. He was\r\ninduced still to think that Goarly had been ill-treated about the\r\npheasants;--but he could not take upon himself to say that he had\r\nwitnessed any wrong done. But he was quite sure that the system on\r\nwhich such things were managed in England was at variance with that\r\neven justice which prevailed in his own country! Yes;--by his own\r\ncountry he did mean Mickewa. He could tell that learned gentleman\r\nin spite of his sneers, and in spite of his evident ignorance of\r\ngeography, that nowhere on the earth\'s surface was justice more\r\npurely administered than in the great Western State of Mickewa. It\r\nwas felt by everybody that the Senator had the best of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Scrobby was sent into durance for twelve months with hard labour,\r\nand Goarly was conveyed away in the custody of the police lest he\r\nshould be torn to pieces by the rough lovers of hunting who were\r\ncongregated outside. When the sentence had reached Mr. Runce\'s ears,\r\nand had been twice explained to him, first by one neighbour and then\r\nby another, his face assumed the very look which it had worn when\r\nhe carried away his victuals from the Senator\'s side at Rufford\r\nHall, and when he had turned his pony round on his own land on the\r\nprevious evening. The man had killed a fox and might have killed a\r\ndozen hounds, and was to be locked up only for twelve months! He\r\nindignantly asked his neighbour what had come of Van Diemen\'s Land,\r\nand what was the use of Botany Bay.\r\n\r\nOn their way back to Rufford Hall, Lord Rufford would have been\r\ntriumphant, had not the Senator checked him. "It\'s a bad state of\r\nthings altogether," he said. "Of course the promiscuous use of\r\nstrychnine is objectionable."\r\n\r\n"Rather," said his Lordship.\r\n\r\n"But is it odd that an utterly uneducated man, one whom his country\r\nhas left to grow up in the ignorance of a brute, should have recourse\r\nto any measure, however objectionable, when the law will absolutely\r\ngive him no redress against the trespass made by a couple of hundred\r\nhorsemen?" Lord Rufford gave it up, feeling the Senator to be a man\r\nwith whom he could not argue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAT LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen once Mrs. Morton had taken her departure for London, on the\r\nday after her grandson\'s death, nothing further was heard of her at\r\nBragton. She locked up everything and took all the keys away, as\r\nthough still hoping,--against hope,--that the will might turn out to\r\nbe other than she expected. But when the lawyer came down to read the\r\ndocument he brought the keys back with him, and no further tidings\r\nreached Dillsborough respecting the old woman. She still drew her\r\nincome as she had done for half a century, but never even came to\r\nlook at the stone which Reginald put up on the walls of Bragton\r\nchurch to perpetuate the memory of his cousin. What moans she made\r\nshe made in silent obscurity, and devoted the remainder of her years\r\nto putting together money for members of her own family who took no\r\nnotice of her.\r\n\r\nAfter the funeral, Lady Ushant returned to the house at the request\r\nof her nephew, who declared his purpose of remaining at Hoppet Hall\r\nfor the present. She expostulated with him and received from him an\r\nassurance that he would take up his residence as squire at Bragton as\r\nsoon as he married a wife,--should he ever do so. In the meantime he\r\ncould, he thought, perform his duties from Hoppet Hall as well as on\r\nthe spot. As a residence for a bachelor he preferred, he said, Hoppet\r\nHall to the park. Lady Ushant yielded and returned once again to her\r\nold home,--the house in which she had been born,--and gave up her\r\nlodgings at Cheltenham. The word that he said about his possible\r\nmarriage set her mind at work, and induced her to put sundry\r\nquestions to him. "Of course you will marry?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Men who have property to leave behind them usually do marry, and\r\nas I am not wiser than others, I probably may do so. But I will not\r\nadmit that it is a matter of course. I may escape yet."\r\n\r\n"I do hope you will marry. I hope it may be before I die, so that I\r\nmay see her."\r\n\r\n"And disapprove of her, ten to one."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I shall not if you tell me that you love her."\r\n\r\n"Then I will tell you so,--to prevent disagreeable results."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure there must be somebody that you like, Reginald," she\r\nsaid after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Are you? I don\'t know that I have shown any very strong preference.\r\nI am not disposed to praise myself for many things, but I really do\r\nthink that I have been as undemonstrative as most men of my age."\r\n\r\n"Still I did hope--"\r\n\r\n"What did you hope?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t mention any name. I don\'t think it is right. I have observed\r\nthat more harm than good comes of such talking, and I have determined\r\nalways to avoid it. But--." Then there was another pause. "Remember\r\nhow old I am, Reginald, and when it is to be done give me at any rate\r\nthe pleasure of knowing it." Of course he knew to whom she alluded,\r\nand of course he laughed at her feeble caution. But he would not\r\nsay a word to encourage her to mention the name of Mary Masters. He\r\nthought that he was sure that were the girl free he would now ask her\r\nto be his wife. If he loved any one it was her. If he had ever known\r\na woman with whom he thought it would be pleasant to share the joy\r\nand labours of life, it was Mary Masters. If he could imagine that\r\nany one constant companion would be a joy to him, she would be that\r\nperson. But he had been distinctly informed that she was in love with\r\nsome one, and not for worlds would he ask for that which had been\r\ngiven to another. And not for worlds would he hazard the chance of\r\na refusal. He thought that he could understand the delight, that\r\nhe could thoroughly enjoy the rapture, of hearing her whisper with\r\ndowncast eyes, that she could love him. He had imagination enough to\r\nbuild castles in the air in which she reigned as princess, in which\r\nshe would lie with her head upon his bosom and tell him that he was\r\nher chosen prince. But he would hardly know how to bear himself\r\nshould he ask in vain. He believed he could love as well as Lawrence\r\nTwentyman, but he was sure that he could not continue his quest as\r\nthat young man had done.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Ushant had been a day or two at the house she asked him\r\nwhether she might invite Mary there as her guest,--as her perpetual\r\nguest.--"I have no objection in life," he said;--"but take care that\r\nyou don\'t interfere with her happiness."\r\n\r\n"Because of her father and sisters?" suggested the innocent old lady.\r\n\r\n   "\'Has she a father, has she a mother;\r\n     Or has she a dearer one still than all other?\'"\r\n\r\nsaid Reginald laughing.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she has."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t interfere with her happiness in that direction. How is\r\nshe to have a lover come to see her out here?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? I don\'t see why she shouldn\'t have a lover here as well as\r\nin Dillsborough. I don\'t object to lovers, if they are of the proper\r\nsort;--and I am sure Mary wouldn\'t have anything else." Reginald told\r\nher she might do as she pleased and made no further inquiry as to\r\nMary\'s lovers.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards Mary went with her boxes to Bragton,--Mrs.\r\nMasters repeating her objections, but repeating them with but little\r\nenergy. Just at this time a stroke of good fortune befell the Masters\r\nfamily generally which greatly reduced her power over her husband.\r\nReginald Morton had spent an hour in the attorney\'s office, and had\r\ndeclared his purpose of restoring Mr. Masters to his old family\r\nposition in regard to the Bragton estate. When she heard it she felt\r\nat once that her dominion was gone. She had based everything on the\r\ngrowing inferiority of her husband\'s position, and now he was about\r\nto have all his glory back again! She had inveighed against gentlemen\r\nfrom the day of her marriage,--and here he was, again to be immersed\r\nup to his eyes in the affairs of a gentleman. And then she had been\r\nso wrong about Goarly, and Lord Rufford had been so much better a\r\nclient! And ready money had been so much more plentiful of late,\r\nowing to poor John Morton\'s ready-handed honesty! She had very little\r\nto say about it when Mary packed her boxes and was taken in Mr.\r\nRunciman\'s fly to Bragton.\r\n\r\nSince the old days, the old days of all, since the days to which\r\nReginald had referred when he asked her to pass over the bridge with\r\nhim, she had never yet walked about the Bragton grounds. She had\r\noften been to the house, visiting Lady Ushant; but she had simply\r\ngone thither and returned. And indeed, when the house had been empty,\r\nthe walk from Dillsborough to the bridge and back had been sufficient\r\nexercise for herself and her sisters. But now she could go whither\r\nshe listed and bring her memory to all the old spots. With the\r\ntenacity as to household matters which characterised the ladies of\r\nthe country some years since, Lady Ushant employed all her mornings\r\nand those of her young friend in making inventories of everything\r\nthat was found in the house; but her afternoons were her own, and she\r\nwandered about with a freedom she had never known before. At this\r\ntime Reginald Morton was up in London and had been away nearly a\r\nweek. He had gone intending to be absent for some undefined time, so\r\nthat Lady Ushant and Mrs. Hopkins were free from all interruption. It\r\nwas as yet only the middle of March and the lion had not altogether\r\ndisappeared; but still Mary could get out. She did not care much\r\nfor the wind; and she roamed about among the leafless shrubberies,\r\nthinking,--probably not of many things,--meaning always to think of\r\nthe past, but unable to keep her mind from the future, the future\r\nwhich would so soon be the present. How long would it be before the\r\ncoming of that stately dame? Was he in quest of her now? Had he\r\nperhaps postponed his demand upon her till fortune had made him rich?\r\nOf course she had no right to be sorry that he had inherited the\r\nproperty which had been his almost of right;--but yet, had it been\r\notherwise, might she not have had some chance? But, oh, if he had\r\nsaid a word to her, only a word more than he had spoken already,--a\r\nword that might have sounded like encouragement to others beside\r\nherself, and then have been obliged to draw back because of the duty\r\nwhich he owed to the property,--how much worse would that have been!\r\nShe did own to herself that the squire of Bragton should not look for\r\nhis wife in the house of a Dillsborough attorney. As she thought of\r\nthis a tear ran down her cheek and trickled down on to the wooden\r\nrail of the little bridge.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one to give you an excuse now, and you must come and walk\r\nround with me," said a voice, close to her ear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Morton, how you have startled me!"\r\n\r\n"Is there anything the matter, Mary?" said he, looking up into her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Only you have startled me so."\r\n\r\n"Has that brought tears into your eyes?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--I suppose so," she said trying to smile. "You were so very\r\nquiet and I thought you were in London."\r\n\r\n"So I was this morning, and now I am here. But something else has\r\nmade you unhappy."\r\n\r\n"No; nothing."\r\n\r\n"I wish we could be friends, Mary. I wish I could know your secret.\r\nYou have a secret."\r\n\r\n"No," she said boldly.\r\n\r\n"Is there nothing?"\r\n\r\n"What should there be, Mr. Morton!"\r\n\r\n"Tell me why you were crying."\r\n\r\n"I was not crying. Just a tear is not crying. Sometimes one does\r\nget melancholy. One can\'t cry when there is any one to look, and so\r\none does it alone. I\'d have been laughing if I knew that you were\r\ncoming."\r\n\r\n"Come round by the kennels. You can get over the wall;--can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll go down the old orchard, and get out by the corner of the\r\npark fence." Then he walked and she followed him, hardly keeping\r\nclose by his side, and thinking as she went how foolish she had\r\nbeen not to have avoided the perils and fresh troubles of such a\r\nwalk. When he was helping her over the wall he held her hands for a\r\nmoment and she was aware of unusual pressure. It was the pressure of\r\nlove,--or of that pretence of love which young men, and perhaps old\r\nmen, sometimes permit themselves to affect. In an ordinary way Mary\r\nwould have thought as little of it as another girl. She might feel\r\ndislike to the man, but the affair would be too light for resentment.\r\nWith this man it was different. He certainly was not justified in\r\nmaking the slightest expression of factitious affection. He at any\r\nrate should have felt himself bound to abstain from any touch of\r\npeculiar tenderness. She would not say a word. She would not even\r\nlook at him with angry eyes. But she twitched both her hands away\r\nfrom him as she sprang to the ground. Then there was a passage across\r\nthe orchard,--not more than a hundred yards, and after that a stile.\r\nAt the stile she insisted on using her own hand for the custody of\r\nher dress. She would not even touch his outstretched arm. "You are\r\nvery independent," he said.\r\n\r\n"I have to be so."\r\n\r\n"I cannot make you out, Mary. I wonder whether there is still\r\nanything rankling in your bosom against me."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no. What should rankle with me?"\r\n\r\n"What indeed;--unless you resent my--regard."\r\n\r\n"I am not so rich in friends as to do that, Mr. Morton."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose there can be many people who have the same sort of\r\nfeeling for you that I have."\r\n\r\n"There are not many who have known me so long, certainly."\r\n\r\n"You have some friend, I know," he said.\r\n\r\n"More than one I hope."\r\n\r\n"Some special friend. Who is he, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean, Mr. Morton." She then thought that he\r\nwas still alluding to Lawrence Twentyman.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Mary."\r\n\r\n"What am I to tell you?"\r\n\r\n"Your father says that there is some one."\r\n\r\n"Papa!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--your father."\r\n\r\nThen she remembered it all;--how she had been driven into a half\r\nconfession to her father. She could not say there was nobody. She\r\ncertainly could not say who that some one was. She could not be\r\nsilent, for by silence she would be confessing a passion for some\r\nother man,--a passion which certainly had no existence. "I don\'t know\r\nwhy papa should talk about me," she said, "and I certainly don\'t know\r\nwhy you should repeat what he said."\r\n\r\n"But there is some one?" She clenched her fist, and hit out at the\r\nair with her parasol, and knit her brows as she looked up at him with\r\na glance of fire in her eye which he had never seen there before.\r\n"Believe me, Mary," he said;--"if ever a girl had a sincere friend,\r\nyou have one in me. I would not tease you by impertinence in such a\r\nmatter. I will be as faithful to you as the sun. Do you love any\r\none?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said turning round at him with ferocity and shouting out\r\nher answer as she pressed on.\r\n\r\n"Who is he, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"What right have you to ask me? What right can any one have? Even\r\nyour aunt would not press me as you are doing."\r\n\r\n"My aunt could not have the same interest. Who is he, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I will not tell you."\r\n\r\nHe paused a few moments and walked on a step or two before he spoke\r\nagain. "I would it were I," he said.\r\n\r\n"What!" she ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"I would it were I," he repeated.\r\n\r\nOne glance of her eye stole itself round into his face, and then her\r\nface was turned quickly to the ground. Her parasol which had been\r\nraised drooped listless from her hand. All unconsciously she hastened\r\nher steps and became aware that the tears were streaming from\r\nher eyes. For a moment or two it seemed to her that all was still\r\nhopeless. If he had no more to say than that, certainly she had not a\r\nword. He had made her no tender of his love. He had not told her that\r\nin very truth she was his chosen one. After all she was not sure that\r\nshe understood the meaning of those words "I would it were I." But\r\nthe tears were coming so quick that she could see nothing of the\r\nthings around her, and she did not dare even to put her hand up to\r\nher eyes. If he wanted her love,--if it was possible that he really\r\nwished for it,--why did he not ask for it? She felt his footsteps\r\nclose to hers, and she was tempted to walk on quicker even than\r\nbefore. Then there came the fingers of a hand round her waist,\r\nstealing gradually on till she felt the pressure of his body on her\r\nshoulders. She put her hand up weakly, to push back the intruding\r\nfingers,--only to leave it tight in his grasp. Then,--then was the\r\nfirst moment in which she realized the truth. After all he did love\r\nher. Surely he would not hold her there unless he meant her to know\r\nthat he loved her. "Mary," he said. To speak was impossible, but she\r\nturned round and looked at him with imploring eyes. "Mary,--say that\r\nyou will be my wife."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n"MY OWN, OWN HUSBAND."\r\n\r\n\r\nYes;--it had come at last. As one may imagine to be the certainty\r\nof paradise to the doubting, fearful, all but despairing soul when\r\nit has passed through the gates of death and found in new worlds a\r\nreality of assured bliss, so was the assurance to her, conveyed by\r\nthat simple request, "Mary, say that you will be my wife." It did not\r\nseem to her that any answer was necessary. Will it be required that\r\nthe spirit shall assent to its entrance into Elysium? Was there room\r\nfor doubt? He would never go back from his word now. He would not\r\nhave spoken the word had he not been quite, quite certain. And he had\r\nloved her all that time,--when she was so hard to him! It must have\r\nbeen so. He had loved her, this bright one, even when he thought\r\nthat she was to be given to that clay-bound rustic lover! Perhaps\r\nthat was the sweetest of it all, though in draining the sweet draught\r\nshe had to accuse herself of hardness, blindness and injustice.\r\nCould it be real? Was it true that she had her foot firmly placed\r\nin Paradise? He was there, close to her, with his arm still round\r\nher, and her fingers grasped within his. The word wife was still\r\nin her ears,--surely the sweetest word in all the language! What\r\nprotestation of love could have been so eloquent as that question?\r\n"Will you be my wife?" No true man, she thought, ever ought to ask\r\nthe question in any other form. But her eyes were still full of\r\ntears, and as she went she knew not where she was going. She had\r\nforgotten all her surroundings, being only aware that he was with\r\nher, and that no other eyes were on them.\r\n\r\nThen there was another stile on reaching which he withdrew his arm\r\nand stood facing her with his back leaning against it. "Why do you\r\nweep?" he said;--"and, Mary, why do you not answer my question? If\r\nthere be anybody else you must tell me now."\r\n\r\n"There is nobody else," she said almost angrily. "There never was.\r\nThere never could be."\r\n\r\n"And yet there was somebody!" She pouted her lips at him, glancing up\r\ninto his face for half a second, and then again hung her head down.\r\n"Mary, do not grudge me my delight."\r\n\r\n"No;--no;--no!"\r\n\r\n"But you do."\r\n\r\n"No. If there can be delight to you in so poor a thing, have it all."\r\n\r\n"Then you must kiss me, dear." She gently came to him,--oh so\r\ngently,--and with her head still hanging, creeping towards his\r\nshoulder, thinking perhaps that the motion should have been his, but\r\nstill obeying him, and then, leaning against him, seemed as though\r\nshe would stoop with her lips to his hand. But this he did not\r\nendure. Seizing her quickly in his arms he drew her up, till her not\r\nunwilling face was close to his, and there he kept her till she was\r\nalmost frightened by his violence. "And now, Mary, what do you say to\r\nmy question? It has to be answered."\r\n\r\n"You know."\r\n\r\n"But that will not do, I will have it in words. I will not be shorn\r\nof my delight."\r\n\r\nThat it should be a delight to him, was the very essence of her\r\nheaven. "Tell me what to say," she answered. "How may I say it best?"\r\n\r\n"Reginald Morton," he began.\r\n\r\n"Reginald," she repeated it after him, but went no farther in naming\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Because I love you better than any other being in the world--"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but say it."\r\n\r\n"Because I love you, oh, so much better than all the world besides."\r\n\r\n"Therefore, my own, own husband--"\r\n\r\n"Therefore, my own, own--" Then she paused.\r\n\r\n"Say the word."\r\n\r\n"My own, own husband."\r\n\r\n"I will be your true wife."\r\n\r\n"I will be your own true loving wife." Then he kissed her again.\r\n\r\n"That," he said, "is our little marriage ceremony under God\'s sky,\r\nand no other can be more binding. As soon as you, in the plentitude\r\nof your maiden power, will fix a day for the other one, and when we\r\ncan get that over, then we will begin our little journey together."\r\n\r\n"But Reginald!"\r\n\r\n"Well, dear!"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t said anything."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I? I thought I had said it all."\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t said it for yourself!"\r\n\r\n"You say what you want,--and I\'ll repeat it quite as well as you\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do that. Say it yourself."\r\n\r\n"I will be your true husband for the rest of the journey;--by which\r\nI mean it to be understood that I take you into partnership on equal\r\nterms, but that I am to be allowed to manage the business just as I\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that you shall," she said, quite in earnest.\r\n\r\n"Only as you are practical and I am vague, I don\'t doubt that\r\neverything will fall into your hands before five years are over, and\r\nthat I shall have to be told whether I can afford to buy a new book,\r\nand when I am to ask all the gentry to dinner."\r\n\r\n"Now you are laughing at me because I shall know so little about\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Come, dear; let us get over the stile and go on for another field,\r\nor we shall never get round the park." Then she jumped over after\r\nhim, just touching his hand. "I was not laughing at you at all. I\r\ndon\'t in the least doubt that in a very little time you will know\r\neverything about everything."\r\n\r\n"I am so much afraid."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be. I know you well enough for that. But suppose I\r\nhad taken such a one as that young woman who was here with my poor\r\ncousin. Oh, heavens!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you ought to have done so."\r\n\r\n"I thank the Lord that hath delivered me."\r\n\r\n"You ought,--you ought to have chosen some lady of high standing,"\r\nsaid Mary, thinking with ineffable joy of the stately dame who was\r\nnot to come to Bragton. "Do you know what I was thinking only the\r\nother day about it?--that you had gone up to London to look for some\r\nproper sort of person."\r\n\r\n"And how did you mean to receive her?"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have received her at all. I should have gone away. You\r\ncan\'t do it now."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"What were you thanking the Lord for so heartily?"\r\n\r\n"For you."\r\n\r\n"Were you? That is the sweetest thing you have said yet. My own;--my\r\ndarling;--my dearest! If only I can so live that you may be able to\r\nthank the Lord for me in years to come!"\r\n\r\nI will not trouble the reader with all that was said at every stile.\r\nNo doubt very much of what has been told was repeated again and\r\nagain so that the walk round the park was abnormally long. At last,\r\nhowever, they reached the house, and as they entered the hall, Mary\r\nwhispered to him, "Who is to tell your aunt?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Come along," he replied striding upstairs to his aunt\'s bedroom,\r\nwhere he knew she would be at this time. He opened the door without\r\nany notice and, having waited till Mary had joined him, led her\r\nforcibly into the middle of the room. "Here she is," he said;--"my\r\nwife elect."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Reginald!"\r\n\r\n"We have managed it all, and there needn\'t be any more said about it\r\nexcept to settle the day. Mary has been looking about the house and\r\nlearning her duty already. She\'ll be able to have every bedstead and\r\nevery chair by heart, which is an advantage ladies seldom possess."\r\nThen Mary rushed forward and was received into the old woman\'s arms.\r\n\r\nWhen Reginald left them, which he did very soon after the\r\nannouncement was made, Lady Ushant had a great deal to say. "I have\r\nbeen thinking of it, my dear,--oh,--for years;--ever since he came to\r\nHoppet Hall. But I am sure the best way is never to say anything. If\r\nI had interfered there is no knowing how it might have been."\r\n\r\n"Then, dear Lady Ushant, I am so glad you didn\'t," said Mary,--being\r\ntolerably sure at the same time within her own bosom that her loving\r\nold friend could have done no harm in that direction.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t say a word though I was always thinking of it. But then\r\nhe is so odd, and no one can know what he means sometimes. That\'s\r\nwhat made me think when Mr. Twentyman was so very pressing--"\r\n\r\n"That couldn\'t--couldn\'t have been possible."\r\n\r\n"Poor young man!"\r\n\r\n"But I always told him it was impossible."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether you cared about Reginald all that time." In answer\r\nto this Mary only hid her face in the old woman\'s lap. "Dear me! I\r\nsuppose you did all along. But I am sure it was better not to say\r\nanything, and now what will your papa and mamma say?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ll hardly believe it at first."\r\n\r\n"I hope they\'ll be glad."\r\n\r\n"Glad! Why what do you suppose they would want me to do? Dear papa!\r\nAnd dear mamma too, because she has really been good to me. I wonder\r\nwhen it must be?" Then that question was discussed at great length,\r\nand Lady Ushant had a great deal of very good advice to bestow.\r\nShe didn\'t like long engagements, and it was very essential for\r\nReginald\'s welfare that he should settle himself at Bragton as soon\r\nas possible. Mary\'s pleas for a long day were not very urgent.\r\n\r\nThat evening at Bragton was rather long and rather dull. It was\r\nalmost the first that she had ever passed in company with Reginald,\r\nand there now seemed to be a necessity of doing something peculiar,\r\nwhereas there was nothing peculiar to be done. It was his custom to\r\nbetake himself to his books after dinner; but he could hardly do so\r\nwith ease in company with the girl who had just promised him to be\r\nhis wife. Lady Ushant too wished to show her extreme joy, and made\r\nflattering but vain attempts to be ecstatic. Mary, to tell the truth,\r\nwas longing for solitude, feeling that she could not yet realise her\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nNot even when she was in bed could she reduce her mind to order.\r\nIt would have been all but impossible even had he remained the\r\ncomparatively humble lord of Hoppet Hall;--but that the squire of\r\nBragton should be her promised husband was a marvel so great that\r\nfrom every short slumber, she waked with fear of treacherous dreams.\r\nA minute\'s sleep might rob her of her joy and declare to her in the\r\nmoment of waking that it was all an hallucination. It was not that he\r\nwas dearer to her, or that her condition was the happier, because of\r\nhis position and wealth;--but that the chance of his inheritance had\r\nlifted him so infinitely above her! She thought of the little room\r\nat home which she generally shared with one of her sisters, of her\r\nall too scanty wardrobe, of her daily tasks about the house, of her\r\nstepmother\'s late severity, and of her father\'s cares. Surely he\r\nwould not hinder her from being good to them; surely he would let the\r\nyoung girls come to her from time to time! What an added happiness\r\nit would be if he would allow her to pass on to them some sparks of\r\nthe prosperity which he was bestowing on her. And then her thoughts\r\ntravelled on to poor Larry. Would he not be more contented now;--now,\r\nwhen he would be certain that no further frantic efforts could avail\r\nhim anything. Poor Larry! Would Reginald permit her to regard him as\r\na friend? And would he submit to friendly treatment? She could look\r\nforward and see him happy with his wife, the best loved of their\r\nneighbours;--for who was there in the world better than Larry? But\r\nshe did not know how two men who had both been her lovers, would\r\nallow themselves to be brought together. But, oh, what peril had been\r\nthere! It was but the other day she had striven so hard to give the\r\nlie to her love and to become Larry\'s wife. She shuddered beneath the\r\nbedclothes as she thought of the danger she had run. One word would\r\nhave changed all her Paradise into a perpetual wail of tears and\r\nwaste of desolation. When she woke in the morning from her long sleep\r\nan effort was wanting to tell her that it was all true. Oh, if it had\r\nslipped from her then;--if she had waked after such a dream to find\r\nherself loving in despair with a sore bosom and angry heart!\r\n\r\nShe met him downstairs, early, in the study, having her first request\r\nto make to him. Might she go in at once after breakfast and tell them\r\nall? "I suppose I ought to go to your father," he said. "Let me go\r\nfirst," she pleaded, hanging on his arm. "I would not think that I\r\nwas not mindful of them from the very beginning." So she was driven\r\ninto Dillsborough in the pony carriage which had been provided for\r\nold Mrs. Morton\'s use, and told her own story. "Papa," she said,\r\ngoing to the office door. "Come into the house;--come at once." And\r\nthen, within her father\'s arms, while her stepmother listened, she\r\ntold them of her triumph. "Mr. Reginald Morton wants me to be his\r\nwife, and he is coming here to ask you."\r\n\r\n"The Lord in heaven be good to us," said Mrs. Masters, holding up\r\nboth her hands. "Is it true, child?"\r\n\r\n"The squire!"\r\n\r\n"It is true, papa,--and,--and--"\r\n\r\n"And what, my love?"\r\n\r\n"When he comes to you, you must say I will be."\r\n\r\nThere was not much danger on that score. "Was it he that you told me\r\nof?" said the attorney. To this she only nodded her assent. "It was\r\nReginald Morton all the time? Well!"\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t it be he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, my dear! You are a most fortunate girl,--most fortunate! But\r\nsomehow I never thought of it, that a child of mine should come to\r\nlive at Bragton and have it, one may say, partly as her own! It is\r\nodd after all that has come and gone. God bless you, my dear, and\r\nmake you happy. You are a very fortunate child."\r\n\r\nMrs. Masters was quite overpowered. She had thrown herself on to the\r\nold family sofa, and was fanning herself with her handkerchief. She\r\nhad been wrong throughout, and was now completely humiliated by the\r\nfamily success; and yet she was delighted, though she did not dare\r\nto be triumphant. She had so often asked both father and daughter\r\nwhat good gentlemen would do to either of them; and now the girl was\r\nengaged to marry the richest gentleman in the neighbourhood! In any\r\nexpression of joy she would be driven to confess how wrong she had\r\nalways been. How often had she asked what would come of Ushanting.\r\nThis it was that had come of Ushanting. The girl had been made fit to\r\nbe the companion of such a one as Reginald Morton, and had now fallen\r\ninto the position which was suited to her. "Of course we shall see\r\nnothing of you now," she said in a whimpering voice. It was not a\r\ngracious speech, but it was almost justified by disappointments.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, you know that I shall never separate myself from you and the\r\ngirls."\r\n\r\n"Poor Larry!" said the woman sobbing. "Of course it is all for the\r\nbest; but I don\'t know what he\'ll do now."\r\n\r\n"You must tell him, papa," said Mary; "and give him my love and bid\r\nhim be a man."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n"BID HIM BE A MAN."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little phaeton remained in Dillsborough to take Mary back to\r\nBragton. As soon as she was gone the attorney went over to the Bush\r\nwith the purpose of borrowing Runciman\'s pony, so that he might ride\r\nover to Chowton Farm and at once execute his daughter\'s last request.\r\nIn the yard of the inn he saw Runciman himself, and was quite unable\r\nto keep his good news to himself. "My girl has just been with me," he\r\nsaid, "and what do you think she tells me?"\r\n\r\n"That she is going to take poor Larry after all. She might do worse,\r\nMr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"Poor Larry! I am sorry for him. I have always liked Larry Twentyman.\r\nBut that is all over now."\r\n\r\n"She\'s not going to have that tweedledum young parson, surely?"\r\n\r\n"Reginald Morton has made her a set offer."\r\n\r\n"The squire!" Mr. Masters nodded his head three times. "You don\'t say\r\nso. Well, Mr. Masters, I don\'t begrudge it you. He might do worse.\r\nShe has taken her pigs well to market at last!"\r\n\r\n"He is to come to me at four this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Well done, Miss Mary! I suppose it\'s been going on ever so long?"\r\n\r\n"We fathers and mothers," said the attorney, "never really know what\r\nthe young ones are after. Don\'t mention it just at present, Runciman.\r\nYou are such an old friend that I couldn\'t help telling you."\r\n\r\n"Poor Larry!"\r\n\r\n"I can have the pony, Runciman?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly you can, Mr. Masters. Tell him to come in and talk it\r\nall over with me. If we don\'t look to it he\'ll be taking to drink\r\nregular." At that last meeting at the club, when the late squire\'s\r\nwill was discussed, at which, as the reader may perhaps remember,\r\na little supper was also discussed in honour of the occasion, poor\r\nLarry had not only been present, but had drunk so pottle-deep that\r\nthe landlord had been obliged to put him to bed at the inn, and he\r\nhad not been at all as he ought to have been after Lord Rufford\'s\r\ndinner. Such delinquencies were quite outside the young man\'s\r\naccustomed way of his life. It had been one of his recognised virtues\r\nthat, living as he did a good deal among sporting men and with a full\r\ncommand of means, he had never drank. But now he had twice sinned\r\nbefore the eyes of all Dillsborough, and Runciman thought that he\r\nknew how it would be with a young man in his own house who got drunk\r\nin public to drown his sorrow. "I wouldn\'t see Larry go astray and\r\nspoil himself with liquor," said the good-natured publican, "for more\r\nthan I should like to name." Mr. Masters promised to take the hint,\r\nand rode off on his mission.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to Chowton Farm and Bragton gate were nearly opposite,\r\nthe latter being perhaps a furlong nearer to Dillsborough. The\r\nattorney when he got to the gate stopped a moment and looked up the\r\navenue with pardonable pride. The great calamity of his life, the\r\nstunning blow which had almost unmanned him when he was young, and\r\nfrom which he had never quite been able to rouse himself, had been\r\nthe loss of the management of the Bragton property. His grandfather\r\nand his father had been powerful at Bragton, and he had been brought\r\nup in the hope of walking in their paths. Then strangers had come in,\r\nand he had been dispossessed. But how was it with him now? It had\r\nalmost made a young man of him again when Reginald Morton, stepping\r\ninto his office, asked him as a favour to resume his old task. But\r\nwhat was that in comparison with this later triumph? His own child\r\nwas to be made queen of the place! His grandson, should she be\r\nfortunate enough to be the mother of a son, would be the squire\r\nhimself! His visits to the place for the last twenty years had\r\nbeen very rare indeed. He had been sent for lately by old Mrs.\r\nMorton,--for a purpose which if carried out would have robbed him of\r\nall his good fortune,--but he could not remember when, before that,\r\nhe had even passed through the gateway. Now it would all become\r\nfamiliar to him again. That pony of Runciman\'s was pleasant in his\r\npaces, and he began to calculate whether the innkeeper would part\r\nwith the animal. He stood thus gazing at the place for some minutes\r\ntill he saw Reginald Morton in the distance turning a corner of the\r\nroad with Mary at his side. He had taken her from the phaeton and had\r\nthen insisted on her coming out with him before she took off her hat.\r\nMr. Masters as soon as he saw them trotted off to Chowton Farm.\r\n\r\nFinding Larry lounging at the little garden gate Mr. Masters got off\r\nthe pony and taking the young man\'s arm, walked off with him towards\r\nDillsborough Wood. He told all his news at once, almost annihilating\r\npoor Larry by the suddenness of the blow. "Larry, Mr. Reginald Morton\r\nhas asked my girl to marry him, and she has accepted him."\r\n\r\n"The new squire!" said Larry, stopping himself on the path, and\r\nlooking as though a gentle wind would suffice to blow him over.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it has been that way all along, Larry, though we have not\r\nknown it."\r\n\r\n"It was Mr. Morton then that she told me of?"\r\n\r\n"She did tell you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course there was no chance for me if he wanted her. But why\r\ndidn\'t they speak out, so that I could have gone away? Oh, Mr.\r\nMasters!"\r\n\r\n"It was only yesterday she knew it herself."\r\n\r\n"She must have guessed it."\r\n\r\n"No;--she knew nothing till he declared himself. And to-day, this\r\nvery morning, she has bade me come to you and let you know it. And\r\nshe sent you her love."\r\n\r\n"Her love!" said Larry, chucking the stick which he held in his hands\r\ndown to the ground and then stooping to pick it up again.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--her love. Those were her words, and I am to tell you from\r\nher--to be a man."\r\n\r\n"Did she say that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I was to come out to you at once, and bring you that as a\r\nmessage from her."\r\n\r\n"Be a man! I could have been a man right enough if she would have\r\nmade me one;--as good a man as Reginald Morton, though he is squire\r\nof Bragton. But of course I couldn\'t have given her a house like\r\nthat, nor a carriage, nor made her one of the county people. If it\r\nwas to go in that way, what could I hope for?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be unjust to her, Larry."\r\n\r\n"Unjust to her! If giving her every blessed thing I had in the world\r\nat a moment\'s notice was unjust, I was ready to be unjust any day of\r\nthe week or any hour of the day."\r\n\r\n"What I mean is that her heart was fixed that way before Reginald\r\nMorton was squire of Bragton. What shall I say in answer to her\r\nmessage? You will wish her happiness;--will you not?"\r\n\r\n"Wish her happiness! Oh, heavens!" He could not explain what was in\r\nhis mind. Wish her happiness! yes;--the happiness of the angels. But\r\nnot him,--nor yet with him! And as there could be no arranging of\r\nthis, he must leave his wishes unsettled. And yet there was a certain\r\nrelief to him in the tidings he had heard. There was now no more\r\ndoubt. He need not now remain at Chowton thinking it possible that\r\nthe girl might even yet change her mind.\r\n\r\n"And you will bear in mind that she wishes you to be a man."\r\n\r\n"Why did she not make me one? But that is all, all over. You tell\r\nher from me that I am not the man to whimper because I am hurt. What\r\nought a man to do that I can\'t do?"\r\n\r\n"Let her know that you are going about your old pursuits. And, Larry,\r\nwould you wish her to know how it was with you at the club last\r\nSaturday?"\r\n\r\n"Did she hear of that?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure she has not heard of it. But if that kind of thing becomes\r\na habit, of course she will hear of it. All Dillsborough would hear\r\nof it, if that became common. At any rate it is not manly to drown it\r\nin drink."\r\n\r\n"Who says I do that? Nothing will drown it."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t speak if I had not known you so long, and loved you so\r\nwell. What she means is that you should work."\r\n\r\n"I do work."\r\n\r\n"And hunt. Go out to-morrow and show yourself to everybody."\r\n\r\n"If I could break my neck I would."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let every farmer\'s son in the county say that Lawrence\r\nTwentyman was so mastered by a girl that he couldn\'t ride on\r\nhorseback when she said him nay."\r\n\r\n"Everybody knows it, Mr. Masters."\r\n\r\n"Go among them as if nobody knew it. I\'ll warrant that nobody will\r\nspeak of it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think any one of \'em would dare to do that," said Larry\r\nbrandishing his stick.\r\n\r\n"Where is it that the hounds are to-morrow, Larry?"\r\n\r\n"Here; at the old kennel."\r\n\r\n"Go out and let her see that you have taken her advice. She is there\r\nat the house, and she will recognise you in the park. Remember that\r\nshe sends her love to you, and bids you be a man. And, Larry, come in\r\nand see us sometimes. The time will come, I don\'t doubt, when you and\r\nthe squire will be fast friends."\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"You do not know what time can do. I\'ll just go back now because he\r\nis to come to me this afternoon. Try and bear up and remember that\r\nit is she who bids you be a man." The attorney got upon his pony and\r\nrode back to Dillsborough.\r\n\r\nLarry who had come back to the yard to see his friend off, returned\r\nby the road into the fields, and went wandering about for a while\r\nin Dillsborough Wood. "Bid him be a man!" Wasn\'t he a man? Was it\r\ndisgraceful to him as a man to be broken-hearted, because a woman\r\nwould not love him? If he were provoked he would fight,--perhaps\r\nbetter than ever, because he would be reckless. Would he not be ready\r\nto fight Reginald Morton with any weapon which could be thought of\r\nfor the possession of Mary Masters? If she were in danger would he\r\nnot go down into the deep, or through fire to save her? Were not his\r\nold instincts of honesty and truth as strong in him as ever? Did\r\nmanliness require that his heart should be invulnerable? If so he\r\ndoubted whether he could ever be a man.\r\n\r\nBut what if she meant that manliness required him to hide the wound?\r\nThen there did come upon him a feeling of shame as he remembered how\r\noften he had spoken of his love to those who were little better than\r\nstrangers to him, and thought that perhaps such loquacity was opposed\r\nto the manliness which she recommended. And his conscience smote him\r\nas it brought to his recollection the condition of his mind as he\r\nwoke in Runciman\'s bed at the Bush on last Sunday morning. That at\r\nany rate had not been manly. How would it be with him if he made up\r\nhis mind never to speak again to her, and certainly not to him, and\r\nto take care that that should be the only sign left of his suffering?\r\nHe would hunt, and be keener than ever;--he would work upon the land\r\nwith increased diligence; he would give himself not a moment to\r\nthink of anything. She should see and hear what he could do;--but\r\nhe would never speak to her again. The hounds would be at the old\r\nkennels to-morrow. He would be there. The place no doubt was Morton\'s\r\nproperty, but on hunting mornings all the lands of the county,--and\r\nof the next counties if they can be reached,--are the property of the\r\nhunt. Yes; he would be there; and she would see him in his scarlet\r\ncoat, and smartest cravat, with his boots and breeches neat as those\r\nof Lord Rufford;--and she should know that he was doing as she bade\r\nhim. But he would never speak to her again!\r\n\r\nAs he was returning round the wood, whom should he see skulking round\r\nthe corner of it but Goarly?\r\n\r\n"What business have you in here?" he said, feeling half-inclined to\r\ntake the man by the neck and drag him out of the copse.\r\n\r\n"I saw you, Mr. Twentyman, and I wanted just to have a word with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You are the biggest rascal in all Rufford," said Larry. "I wonder\r\nthe lads have left you with a whole bone in your skin."\r\n\r\n"What have I done worse than any other poor man, Mr. Twentyman? When\r\nI took them herrings I didn\'t know there was p\'ison; and if I hadn\'t\r\ntook \'em, another would. I am going to cut it out of this, Mr.\r\nTwentyman."\r\n\r\n"May the ---- go along with you!" said Larry, wishing his neighbour\r\na very unpleasant companion.\r\n\r\n"And of course I must sell the place. Think what it would be to you!\r\nI shouldn\'t like it to go into his Lordship\'s hands. It\'s all through\r\nBean I know, but his Lordship has had a down on me ever since he came\r\nto the property. It\'s as true as true about my old woman\'s geese.\r\nThere\'s forty acres of it. What would you say to L40 an acre?"\r\n\r\nThe idea of having the two extra fields made Larry\'s mouth water, in\r\nspite of all his misfortunes. The desire for land among such as Larry\r\nTwentyman is almost a disease in England. With these two fields he\r\nwould be able to walk almost round Dillsborough Wood without quitting\r\nhis own property. He had been talking of selling Chowton within\r\nthe last week or two. He had been thinking of selling it at the\r\nmoment when Mr. Masters rode up to him. And yet now he was almost\r\ntempted to a new purchase by this man. But the man was too utterly a\r\nblackguard,--was too odious to him.\r\n\r\n"If it comes into the market, I may bid for it as well as another,"\r\nhe said, "but I wouldn\'t let myself down to have any dealings with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr. Larry, you shall never have a sod of it," said Goarly,\r\ndropping himself over the fence on to his own field.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards Larry met Bean, and told him that Goarly had\r\nbeen in the wood. "If I catch him, Mr. Twentyman, I\'ll give him sore\r\nbones," said Bean. "I wonder how he ever got back to his own place\r\nalive that day." Then Bean asked Larry whether he meant to be at the\r\nmeet to-morrow, and Larry said that he thought he should. "Tony\'s\r\nalmost afraid to bring them in even yet," said Bean; "but if there\'s\r\na herring left in this wood, I\'ll eat it myself--strychnine and all."\r\n\r\nAfter that Larry went and looked at his horses, and absolutely gave\r\nhis mare "Bicycle" a gallop round the big grass field himself. Then\r\nthose who were about the place knew that something had happened, and\r\nthat he was in a way to be cured. "You\'ll hunt to-morrow, won\'t you,\r\nLarry?" said his mother affectionately.\r\n\r\n"Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody told me;--but you will, Larry; won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"May be I will." Then, as he was leaving the room, when he was in the\r\ndoor-way, so that she should not see his face, he told her the news.\r\n"She\'s going to marry the squire, yonder."\r\n\r\n"Mary Masters!"\r\n\r\n"I always hated him from the first moment I saw him. What do you\r\nexpect from a fellow who never gets a-top of a horse?" Then he turned\r\naway, and was not seen again till long after tea-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n"IS IT TANTI?"\r\n\r\n\r\nReginald Morton entertained serious thoughts of cleansing himself\r\nfrom the reproach which Larry cast upon him when describing his\r\ncharacter to his mother. "I think I shall take to hunting," he said\r\nto Mary.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll tumble off, dear."\r\n\r\n"No doubt I shall, and I must try to begin in soft places. I don\'t\r\nsee why I shouldn\'t do it gradually in a small way. I shouldn\'t ever\r\nbecome a Nimrod, like Lord Rufford or your particular friend Mr.\r\nTwentyman."\r\n\r\n"He is my particular friend."\r\n\r\n"So I perceive. I couldn\'t shine as he shines, but I might gradually\r\nlearn to ride after him at a respectful distance. A man at Rome ought\r\nto do as the Romans do."\r\n\r\n"Why wasn\'t Hoppet Hall Rome as much as Bragton?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--it wasn\'t. While fortune enabled me to be happy at Hoppet\r\nHall--"\r\n\r\n"That is unkind, Reg."\r\n\r\n"While fortune oppressed me with celibate misery at Hoppet Hall,\r\nnobody hated me for not hunting;--and as I could not very well\r\nafford it, I was not considered to be entering a protest against the\r\namusement. As it is now I find that unless I consent to risk my neck\r\nat any rate five or six times every winter, I shall be regarded in\r\nthat light."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be frightened into doing anything I didn\'t like," said\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n"How do you know that I shan\'t like it? The truth is I have had a\r\nletter this morning from a benevolent philosopher which has almost\r\nsettled the question for me. He wants me to join a society for the\r\nsuppression of British sports as being barbarous and antipathetic to\r\nthe intellectual pursuits of an educated man. I would immediately\r\nshoot, fish, hunt and go out ratting, if I could hope for the least\r\nsuccess. I know I should never shoot anything but the dog and the\r\ngamekeepers, and that I should catch every weed in the river; but I\r\nthink that in the process of seasons I might jump over a hedge."\r\n\r\n"Kate will show you the way to do that."\r\n\r\n"With Kate and Mr. Twentyman to help me, and a judicious system of\r\nliberal tips to Tony Tuppett, I could make my way about on a quiet\r\nold nag, and live respected by my neighbours. The fact is I hate with\r\nmy whole heart the trash of the philanimalist."\r\n\r\n"What is a--a--I didn\'t quite catch the thing you hate?"\r\n\r\n"The thing is a small knot of self-anxious people who think that they\r\npossess among them all the bowels of the world."\r\n\r\n"Possess all the what, Reginald?"\r\n\r\n"I said bowels,--using an ordinary but very ill-expressed metaphor.\r\nThe ladies and gentlemen to whom I allude, not looking very clearly\r\ninto the systems of pains and pleasures in accordance with which\r\nwe have to live, put their splay feet down now upon this ordinary\r\noperation and now upon that, and call upon the world to curse the\r\ncruelty of those who will not agree with them. A lady whose tippet is\r\nmade from the skins of twenty animals who have been wired in the snow\r\nand then left to die of starvation--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Reginald!"\r\n\r\n"That is the way of it. I am not now saying whether it is right\r\nor wrong. The lady with the tippet will justify the wires and the\r\nstarvation because, as she will say, she uses the fur. An honest\r\nblanket would keep her just as warm. But the fox who suffers perhaps\r\nten minutes of agony should he not succeed as he usually does in\r\ngetting away,--is hunted only for amusement! It is true that the\r\none fox gives amusement for hours to perhaps some hundred;--but it\r\nis only for amusement. What riles me most is that these would-be\r\nphilosophers do not or will not see that recreation is as necessary\r\nto the world as clothes or food, and the providing of the one is as\r\nlegitimate a business as the purveying of the other."\r\n\r\n"People must eat and wear clothes."\r\n\r\n"And practically they must be amused. They ignore the great doctrine\r\nof \'tanti.\'"\r\n\r\n"I never heard of it."\r\n\r\n"You shall, dear, some day. It is the doctrine by which you should\r\nregulate everything you do and every word you utter. Now do you and\r\nKate put on your hats and we\'ll walk to the bridge."\r\n\r\nThis preaching of a sermon took place after breakfast at Bragton on\r\nthe morning of Saturday, and the last order had reference to a scheme\r\nthey had on foot to see the meet at the old kennels. On the previous\r\nafternoon Reginald Morton had come into Dillsborough and had very\r\nquietly settled everything with the attorney. Having made up his\r\nmind to do the thing he was very quick in the doing of it. He hated\r\nthe idea of secrecy in such an affair, and when Mrs. Masters asked\r\nhim whether he had any objection to have the marriage talked about,\r\nexpressed his willingness that she should employ the town crier to\r\nmake it public if she thought it expedient. "Oh, Mr. Morton, how very\r\nfunny you are," said the lady. "Quite in earnest, Mrs. Masters," he\r\nreplied. Then he kissed the two girls who were to be his sisters, and\r\nfinished the visit by carrying off the younger to spend a day or two\r\nwith her sister at Bragton. "I know," he said, whispering to Mary as\r\nhe left the front door, "that I ought not to go out hunting so soon\r\nafter my poor cousin\'s death; but as he was a cousin once removed, I\r\nbelieve I may walk as far as the bridge without giving offence."\r\n\r\nWhen they were there they saw all the arrivals just as they were seen\r\non the same spot a few months earlier by a very different party. Mary\r\nand Kate stood on the bridge together, while he remained a little\r\nbehind leaning on the stile. She, poor girl, had felt some shame in\r\nshowing herself, knowing that some who were present would have heard\r\nof her engagement, and that others would be told of it as soon as she\r\nwas seen. "Are you ashamed of what you are going to do?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Ashamed! I don\'t suppose that there is a girl in England so proud as\r\nI am at this minute."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that there is anything to be proud of, but if you\r\nare not ashamed, why shouldn\'t you show yourself? Marriage is an\r\nhonourable state!" She could only pinch his arm, and do as he bade\r\nher.\r\n\r\nGlomax in his tandem, and Lord Rufford in his drag, were rather late.\r\nFirst there came one or two hunting men out of the town, Runciman,\r\nDr. Nupper, and the hunting saddler. Then there arrived Henry\r\nStubbings with a string of horses, mounted by little boys, ready for\r\nhis customers, and full of wailing to his friend Runciman. Here was\r\nnearly the end of March and the money he had seen since Christmas\r\nwas little more, as he declared, than what he could put into his eye\r\nand see none the worse. "Charge \'em ten per cent. interest," said\r\nRunciman. "Then they thinks they can carry on for another year," said\r\nStubbings despondingly. While this was going on, Larry walked his\r\nfavourite mare "Bicycle" on to the ground, dressed with the utmost\r\ncare, but looking very moody, almost fierce, as though he did not\r\nwish anybody to speak to him. Tony Tuppett, who had known him since\r\na boy, nodded at him affectionately, and said how glad he was to see\r\nhim;--but even this was displeasing to Larry. He did not see the\r\ngirls on the bridge, but took up his place near them. He was thinking\r\nso much of his own unhappiness and of what he believed others would\r\nsay of him, that he saw almost nothing. There he sat on his mare,\r\ncarrying out the purpose to which he had been led by Mary\'s message,\r\nbut wishing with all his heart that he was back again, hidden within\r\nhis own house at the other side of the wood.\r\n\r\nMary, as soon as she saw him, blushed up to her eyes, then turning\r\nround looked with wistful eyes into the face of the man she was\r\nengaged to marry, and with rapid step walked across the bridge up to\r\nthe side of Larry\'s horse, and spoke to him with her sweet low voice.\r\n"Larry," she said. He turned round to her very quickly, showing how\r\nmuch he was startled. Then she put up her hand to him, and of course\r\nhe took it. "Larry, I am so glad to see you. Did papa give you a\r\nmessage?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Masters. He told me, I know it all."\r\n\r\n"Say a kind word to me, Larry."\r\n\r\n"I--I--I--You know very well what\'s in my mind. Though it were to\r\nkill me, I should wish you well."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll have a good hunt, Larry." Then she retired back to\r\nthe bridge and again looked to her lover to know whether he would\r\napprove. There were so few there, and Larry had been so far apart\r\nfrom the others, that she was sure no one had heard the few words\r\nwhich had passed between them; nor could anyone have observed what\r\nshe had done, unless it were old Nupper, or Mr. Runciman, or Tony\r\nTuppett. But yet she thought that it perhaps was bold, and that he\r\nwould be angry. But he came up to her, and placing himself between\r\nher and Kate, whispered into her ear, "Bravely done, my girl. After a\r\nlittle I will try to be as brave, but I could never do it as well."\r\nLarry in the meantime had moved his mare away, and before the Master\r\nhad arrived, was walking slowly up his own road to Chowton Farm.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was soon there, and Lord Rufford with his friends, and\r\nHarry Stubbings\' string, and Tony were set in motion. But before they\r\nstirred there was a consultation,--to which Bean the gamekeeper was\r\ncalled,--as to the safety of Dillsborough Wood. Dillsborough Wood had\r\nnot been drawn yet since Scrobby\'s poison had taken effect on the old\r\nfox, and there were some few who affected to think that there still\r\nmight be danger. Among these was the Master himself, who asked Fred\r\nBotsey with a sneer whether he thought that such hounds as those\r\nwere to be picked up at every corner. But Bean again offered to eat\r\nany herring that might be there, poison included, and Lord Rufford\r\nlaughed at the danger. "It\'s no use my having foxes, Glomax, if you\r\nwon\'t draw the cover." This the Lord said with a touch of anger,\r\nand the Lord\'s anger, if really roused, might be injurious. It was\r\ntherefore decided that the hounds should again be put through the\r\nBragton shrubberies,--just for compliment to the new squire;--and\r\nthat then they should go off to Dillsborough Wood as rapidly as might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nLarry walked his beast all the way up home very slowly, and getting\r\noff her, put her into the stable and went into the house.\r\n\r\n"Is anything wrong?" asked the mother.\r\n\r\n"Everything is wrong." Then he stood with his back to the kitchen\r\nfire for nearly half an hour without speaking a word. He was trying\r\nto force himself to follow out her idea of manliness, and telling\r\nhimself that it was impossible. The first tone of her voice, the\r\nfirst glance at her face, had driven him home. Why had she called him\r\nLarry again and again, so tenderly, in that short moment, and looked\r\nat him with those loving eyes? Then he declared to himself, without\r\nuttering a word, that she did not understand anything about it; she\r\ndid not comprehend the fashion of his love when she thought, as she\r\ndid think, that a soft word would be compensation. He looked round\r\nto see if his mother or the servant were there, and when he found\r\nthat the coast was clear, he dashed his hands to his eyes and knocked\r\naway the tears. He threw up both his arms and groaned, and then he\r\nremembered her message, "Bid him be a man."\r\n\r\nAt that moment he heard the sound of horses, and going near the\r\nwindow, so as to be hidden from curious eyes as they passed, he saw\r\nthe first whip trot on, with the hounds after him, and Tony Tuppett\r\namong them. Then there was a long string of horsemen, all moving up\r\nto the wood, and a carriage or two, and after them the stragglers\r\nof the field. He let them all go by, and then he repeated the words\r\nagain, "Bid him be a man." He took up his hat, jammed it on his head,\r\nand went out into the yard. As he crossed to the stables Runciman\r\ncame up alone. "Why, Larry, you\'ll be late," he said.\r\n\r\n"Go on, Mr. Runciman, I\'ll follow."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wait till you are mounted. You\'ll be better for somebody with\r\nyou. You\'ve got the mare, have you? You\'ll show some of them your\r\nheels if they get away from here. Is she as fast as she was last\r\nyear, do you think?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t know," said Larry, as he dragged himself into\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\n"Shake yourself, old fellow, and don\'t carry on like that. What is\r\nshe after all but a girl?" The poor fellow looked at his intending\r\ncomforter, but couldn\'t speak a word. "A man shouldn\'t let hisself\r\nbe put upon by circumstances so as to be only half hisself. Hang it,\r\nman, cheer up, and don\'t let \'em see you going about like that. It\r\nain\'t what a fellow of your kidney ought to be. If they haven\'t found\r\nI\'m a nigger,--and by the holy he\'s away. Come along Larry and forget\r\nthe petticoats for half an hour." So saying, Runciman broke into a\r\ngallop, and Larry\'s mare doing the same, he soon passed the innkeeper\r\nand was up at the covert side just as Tony Tuppett with half a score\r\nof hounds round him, was forcing his way through the bushes, out of\r\nthe coverts into the open field. "There ain\'t no poison this time,\r\nMr. Twentyman," said the huntsman, as, setting his eye on a gap in\r\nthe further fence, he made his way across the field.\r\n\r\nThe fox headed away for a couple of miles towards Impington, as was\r\nthe custom with the Dillsborough foxes, and then turning to the left\r\nwas soon over the country borders into Ufford. The pace from the\r\nfirst starting was very good. Larry, under such provocation as that\r\nof course would ride, and he did ride. Up as far as the country\r\nbrook, many were well up. The land was no longer deep; and as the\r\nfield had not been scattered at the starting, all the men who usually\r\nrode were fairly well placed as they came to the brook; but it was\r\nacknowledged afterwards that Larry was over it the first. Glomax got\r\ninto it,--as he always does into brooks, and young Runce hurt his\r\nhorse\'s shoulder at the opposite bank. Lord Rufford\'s horse balked\r\nit, to the Lord\'s disgust; but took it afterwards, not losing very\r\nmuch ground. Tony went in and out, the crafty old dog knowing the one\r\nbit of hard ground. Then they crossed Purbeck field, as it is still\r\ncalled--which, twenty years since was a wide waste of land, but is\r\nnow divided by new fences, very grievous to half-blown horses. Sir\r\nJohn Purefoy got a nasty fall over some stiff timber, and here many\r\na half-hearted rider turned to the right into the lane. Hampton and\r\nhis Lordship, and Battersby, with Fred Botsey and Larry, took it all\r\nas it came, but through it all not one of them could give Larry a\r\nlead. Then there was manoeuvring into a wood and out of it again, and\r\nthat saddest of all sights to the riding man, a cloud of horsemen\r\non the road as well placed as though they had ridden the line\r\nthroughout. In getting out of the road Hampton\'s horse slipped up\r\nwith him, and, though he saw it all, he was never able again to\r\ncompete for a place. The fox went through the Hampton Wick coverts\r\nwithout hanging a moment, just throwing the hounds for two minutes\r\noff their scent at the gravel pits. The check was very useful to\r\nTony, who had got his second horse and came up sputtering, begging\r\nthe field for G----\'s sake to be,--in short to be anywhere but\r\nwhere they were. Then they were off again down the hill to the left,\r\nthrough Mappy springs and along the top of Ilveston copse, every yard\r\nof which is grass,--till the number began to be select. At last in a\r\nturnip field, three yards from the fence, they turned him over, and\r\nTony, as he jumped off his horse among the hounds, acknowledged to\r\nhimself that Larry might have had his hand first upon the animal had\r\nhe cared to do so.\r\n\r\n"Twentyman, I\'ll give you two hundred for your mare," said Lord\r\nRufford.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my Lord, there are two things that would about kill me."\r\n\r\n"What are they, Larry?" asked Harry Stubbings.\r\n\r\n"To offend his Lordship, or to part with the mare."\r\n\r\n"You shall do neither," said Lord Rufford; "but upon my word I think\r\nshe\'s the fastest thing in this county." All of which did not cure\r\npoor Larry, but it helped to enable him to be a man.\r\n\r\nThe fox had been killed close to Norrington, and the run was\r\nremembered with intense gratification for many a long day after.\r\n"It\'s that kind of thing that makes hunting beat everything else,"\r\nsaid Lord Rufford, as he went home. That day\'s sport certainly had\r\nbeen "tanti," and Glomax and the two counties boasted of it for the\r\nnext three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nBENEDICT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Penwether declared to her husband that she had never seen her\r\nbrother so much cowed as he had been by Miss Trefoil\'s visit to\r\nRufford. It was not only that he was unable to assert his usual\r\npowers immediately after the attack made upon him, but that on the\r\nfollowing day, at Scrobby\'s trial, on the Saturday when he started\r\nto the meet, and on the Sunday following when he allowed himself to\r\nbe easily persuaded to go to church, he was silent, sheepish, and\r\nevidently afraid of himself. "It is a great pity that we shouldn\'t\r\ntake the ball at the hop," she said to Sir George.\r\n\r\n"What ball;--and what hop?"\r\n\r\n"Get him to settle himself. There ought to be an end to this kind of\r\nthing now. He has got out of this mess, but every time it becomes\r\nworse and worse, and he\'ll be taken in horribly by some harpy if we\r\ndon\'t get him to marry decently. I fancy he was very nearly going in\r\nthis last affair." Sir George, in this matter, did not quite agree\r\nwith his wife. It was in his opinion right to avoid Miss Trefoil, but\r\nhe did not see why his brother-in-law should be precipitated into\r\nmatrimony with Miss Penge. According to his ideas in such matters a\r\nman should be left alone. Therefore, as was customary with him when\r\nhe opposed his wife, he held his tongue. "You have been called in\r\nthree or four times when he has been just on the edge of the cliff."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that that is any reason why he should be pushed over."\r\n\r\n"There is not a word to be said against Caroline. She has a fine\r\nfortune of her own, and some of the best blood in the kingdom."\r\n\r\n"But if your brother does not care for her,--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, George. As for liking, it\'s all the same to him.\r\nRufford is good-natured, and easily pleased, and can like any woman.\r\nCaroline is very good-looking,--a great deal handsomer than that\r\nhorrid creature ever was,--and with manners fit for any position.\r\nI\'ve no reason to wish to force a wife on him; but of course he\'ll\r\nmarry, and unless he\'s guided, he\'ll certainly marry badly."\r\n\r\n"Is Miss Penge in love with him?" asked Sir George in a tone of voice\r\nthat was intended to be provoking. His wife looked at him, asking him\r\nplainly by her countenance whether he was such a fool as that? Was\r\nit likely that any untitled young lady of eight-and-twenty should be\r\nwanting in the capacity of being in love with a young lord, handsome\r\nand possessed of forty thousand a year without encumbrances? Sir\r\nGeorge, though he did not approve, was not eager enough in his\r\ndisapproval to lay any serious embargo on his wife\'s proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe first steps taken were in the direction of the hero\'s personal\r\ncomfort. He was flattered and petted, as his sister knew how to\r\nflatter and pet him;--and Miss Penge in a quiet way assisted Lady\r\nPenwether in the operation. For a day or two he had not much to say\r\nfor himself;--but every word he did say was an oracle. His horses\r\nwere spoken of as demigods, and his projected fishing operations for\r\nJune and July became matters of most intense interest. Evil things\r\nwere said of Arabella Trefoil, but in all the evil things said no\r\nhint was given that Lord Rufford had behaved badly or had been in\r\ndanger. Lady Penwether, not quite knowing the state of his mind,\r\nthought that there might still be some lurking affection for the\r\nyoung lady. "Did you ever see anybody look so vulgar and hideous as\r\nshe did when she marched across the park?" asked Lady Penwether.\r\n\r\n"Thank goodness I did not see her," said Miss Penge.\r\n\r\n"I never saw her look so handsome as when she came up to me," said\r\nLord Rufford.\r\n\r\n"But such a thing to do!"\r\n\r\n"Awful!" said Miss Penge.\r\n\r\n"She is the pluckiest girl I ever came across in my life," said Lord\r\nRufford. He knew very well what they were at, and was already almost\r\ninclined to think that they might as well be allowed to have their\r\nway. Miss Penge was ladylike, quiet, and good, and was like a cool\r\nsalad in a man\'s mouth after spiced meat. And the money would enable\r\nhim to buy the Purefoy property which would probably be soon in the\r\nmarket. But he felt that he might as well give them a little trouble\r\nbefore he allowed himself to be hooked. It certainly was not by any\r\narrangement of his own that he found himself walking alone with Miss\r\nPenge that Sunday afternoon in the park;--nor did it seem to be by\r\nhers. He thought of that other Sunday at Mistletoe, when he had been\r\ncompelled to wander with Arabella, when he met the Duchess, and when,\r\nas he often told himself, a little more good-nature or a little more\r\ncourage on her grace\'s part would have completed the work entirely.\r\nCertainly had the Duke come to him that night, after the journey from\r\nStamford, he would have capitulated. As he walked along and allowed\r\nhimself to be talked to by Miss Penge, he did tell himself that she\r\nwould be the better angel of the two. She could not hunt with him,\r\nas Arabella would have done; but then a man does not want his wife\r\nto gallop across the country after him. She might perhaps object to\r\ncigars and soda water after eleven o\'clock, but then what assurance\r\nhad he that Arabella would not have objected still more loudly. She\r\nhad sworn that she would never be opposed to his little pleasures;\r\nbut he knew what such oaths were worth. Marriage altogether was a\r\nbore; but having a name and a large fortune, it was incumbent on him\r\nto transmit them to an immediate descendant. And perhaps it was a\r\nworse bore to grow old without having specially bound any other human\r\nbeing to his interests. "How well I recollect that spot," said Miss\r\nPenge. "It was there that Major Caneback took the fence."\r\n\r\n"That was not where he fell."\r\n\r\n"Oh no;--I did not see that. It would have haunted me for ever had I\r\ndone so. But it was there that I thought he must kill himself. That\r\nwas a terrible time, Lord Rufford."\r\n\r\n"Terrible to poor Caneback certainly."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and to all of us. Do you remember that fearful ball? We were\r\nall so unhappy,--because you suffered so much."\r\n\r\n"It was bad."\r\n\r\n"And that woman who persecuted you! We all knew that you felt it."\r\n\r\n"I felt that poor man\'s death."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and you felt the other nuisance too."\r\n\r\n"I remember that you told me that you would cling on to my legs."\r\n\r\n"Eleanor said so;--and when it was explained to me, what clinging on\r\nto your legs meant, I remember saying that I wished to be understood\r\nas being one to help. I love your sister so well that anything which\r\nwould break her heart would make me unhappy."\r\n\r\n"You did not care for my own welfare in the matter?"\r\n\r\n"What ought I say, Lord Rufford, in answer to that? Of course I did\r\ncare. But I knew that it was impossible that you should really set\r\nyour affections on such a person as Miss Trefoil. I told Eleanor that\r\nit would come to nothing. I was sure of it."\r\n\r\n"Why should it have come to nothing,--as you call it?"\r\n\r\n"Because you are a gentleman and because she--is not a lady. I don\'t\r\nknow that we women can quite understand how it is that you men amuse\r\nyourselves with such persons."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t amuse myself."\r\n\r\n"I never thought you did very much. There was something I suppose\r\nin her riding, something in her audacity, something perhaps in her\r\nvivacity;--but through it all I did not think that you were enjoying\r\nyourself. You may be sure of this, Lord Rufford, that when a woman is\r\nnot specially liked by any other woman, she ought not to be specially\r\nliked by any man. I have never heard that Miss Trefoil had a female\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\nFrom day to day there were little meetings and conversations of this\r\nkind till Lord Rufford found himself accustomed to Miss Penge\'s\r\nsolicitude for his welfare. In all that passed between them the lady\r\naffected a status that was altogether removed from that of making or\r\nreceiving love. There had come to be a peculiar friendship,--because\r\nof Eleanor. A week of this kind of thing had not gone by before\r\nMiss Penge found herself able to talk of and absolutely to describe\r\nthis peculiar feeling, and could almost say how pleasant was such\r\nfriendship, divested of the burden of all amatory possibilities. But\r\nthrough it all Lord Rufford knew that he would have to marry Miss\r\nPenge.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before he yielded in pure weariness. Who has not\r\nfelt, as he stood by a stream into which he knew that it was his\r\nfate to plunge, the folly of delaying the shock? In his present\r\ncondition he had no ease. His sister threatened him with a return of\r\nArabella. Miss Penge required from him sensational conversation. His\r\nbrother-in-law was laughing at him in his sleeve. His very hunting\r\nfriends treated him as though the time were come. In all that he did\r\nthe young lady took an interest which bored him excessively,--to put\r\nan end to which he only saw one certain way. He therefore asked her\r\nto be Lady Rufford before he got on his drag to go out hunting on\r\nthe last Saturday in March. "Rufford," she said, looking up into his\r\nface with her lustrous eyes, and speaking with a sweet, low, silvery\r\nvoice,--"are you sure of yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"Quite sure of yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Never so sure in my life."\r\n\r\n"Then dearest, dearest Rufford, I will not scruple to say that I also\r\nam sure." And so the thing was settled very much to his comfort.\r\nHe could hardly have done better had he sought through all England\r\nfor a bride. She will be true to him, and never give him cause for\r\na moment\'s jealousy. She will like his title, his house, and his\r\nproperty. She will never spend a shilling more than she ought to do.\r\nShe will look very sharply after him, but will not altogether debar\r\nhim from his accustomed pleasures. She will grace his table, nurse\r\nhis children, and never for a moment give him cause to be ashamed of\r\nher. He will think that he loves her, and after a lapse of ten or\r\nfifteen years will probably really be fond of her. From the moment\r\nthat she is Lady Rufford, she will love him,--as she loves everything\r\nthat is her own.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his antecedents no one doubted his faith in this\r\nengagement;--no one wished to hurry him very much. When the\r\nproposition had been made and accepted, and when the hero of it had\r\ngone off on his drag, Miss Penge communicated the tidings to her\r\nfriend. "I think he has behaved very wisely," said Lady Penwether.\r\n\r\n"Well;--feeling as I do of course I think he has. I hope he thinks\r\nthe same of me. I had many doubts about it, but I do believe that\r\nI can make him a good wife." Lady Penwether thought that her friend\r\nwas hardly sufficiently thankful, and strove to tell her so in her\r\nown gentle, friendly way. But Miss Penge held her head up and was\r\nvery stout, and would not acknowledge any cause for gratitude. Lady\r\nPenwether, when she saw how it was to be gave way a little. Close\r\nfriendship with her future sister-in-law would be very necessary to\r\nher comfort, and Miss Penge, since the law-suit was settled, had\r\nnever been given to yielding.\r\n\r\n"My dear Rufford," said the sister affectionately, "I congratulate\r\nyou with all my heart; I do indeed. I am quite sure that you could\r\nnot have done better."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I could."\r\n\r\n"She is a gem of inestimable price, and most warmly attached to you.\r\nAnd if this property is to be bought, of course the money will be a\r\ngreat thing."\r\n\r\n"Money is always comfortable."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is, and then there is nothing to be desired. If I had\r\nnamed the girl that I would have wished you to love, it would have\r\nbeen Caroline Penge." She need hardly have said this as she had in\r\nfact been naming the girl for the last three or four months. The news\r\nwas soon spread about the country and the fashionable world; and\r\neverybody was pleased,--except the Trefoil family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nARABELLA\'S SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Arabella Trefoil got back to Portugal Street after her visit\r\nto Rufford, she was ill. The effort she had made, the unaccustomed\r\nlabour, and the necessity of holding herself aloft before the man who\r\nhad rejected her, were together more than her strength could bear,\r\nand she was taken up to bed in a fainting condition. It was not till\r\nthe next morning that she was able even to open the letter which\r\ncontained the news of John Morton\'s legacy. When she had read the\r\nletter and realized the contents, she took to weeping in a fashion\r\nvery unlike her usual habits. She was still in bed, and there she\r\nremained for two or three days, during which she had time to think\r\nof her past life,--and to think also a little of the future. Old Mrs.\r\nGreen came to her once or twice a day, but she was necessarily left\r\nto the nursing of her own maid. Every evening Mounser Green called\r\nand sent up tender enquiries; but in all this there was very little\r\nto comfort her. There she lay with the letter in her hand, thinking\r\nthat the only man who had endeavoured to be of service to her was he\r\nwhom she had treated with unexampled perfidy. Other men had petted\r\nher, had amused themselves with her, and then thrown her over, had\r\nlied to her and laughed at her, till she had been taught to think\r\nthat a man was a heartless, cruel, slippery animal, made indeed to be\r\ncaught occasionally, but in the catching of which infinite skill was\r\nwanted, and in which infinite skill might be thrown away. But this\r\nman had been true to her to the last in spite of her treachery!\r\n\r\nShe knew that she was heartless herself, and that she belonged to a\r\nheartless world;--but she knew also that there was a world of women\r\nwho were not heartless. Such women had looked down upon her as from a\r\ngreat height, but she in return had been able to ridicule them. They\r\nhad chosen their part, and she had chosen hers,--and had thought that\r\nshe might climb to the glory of wealth and rank, while they would\r\nhave to marry hard-working clergymen and briefless barristers. She\r\nhad often been called upon to vindicate to herself the part she had\r\nchosen, and had always done so by magnifying in her own mind the sin\r\nof the men with whom she had to deal. At this moment she thought that\r\nLord Rufford had treated her villainously, whereas her conduct to\r\nhim had been only that which the necessity of the case required. To\r\nLord Rufford she had simply behaved after the manner of her class,\r\nheartless of course, but only in the way which the "custom of the\r\ntrade" justified. Each had tried to circumvent the other, and she as\r\nthe weaker had gone to the wall. But John Morton had believed in her\r\nand loved her. Oh, how she wished that she had deserted her class,\r\nand clung to him,--even though she should now have been his widow.\r\nThe legacy was a burden to her. Even she had conscience enough to be\r\nsorry for a day or two that he had named her in his will.\r\n\r\nAnd what would she do with herself for the future? Her quarrel\r\nwith her mother had been very serious, each swearing that under no\r\ncircumstances would she again consent to live with the other. The\r\ndaughter of course knew that the mother would receive her again\r\nshould she ask to be received. But in such case she must go back with\r\nshortened pinions and blunted beak. Her sojourn with Mrs. Green was\r\nto last for one month, and at the end of that time she must seek\r\nfor a home. If she put John Morton\'s legacy out to interest, she\r\nwould now be mistress of a small income;--but she understood money\r\nwell enough to know to what obduracy of poverty she would thus be\r\nsubjected. As she looked the matter closer in the face the horrors\r\nbecame more startling and more manifest. Who would have her in their\r\nhouses? Where should she find society,--where the possibility of\r\nlovers? What would be her life, and what her prospects? Must she\r\ngive up for ever the game for which she had lived, and own that she\r\nhad been conquered in the fight and beaten even to death? Then she\r\nthought over the long list of her past lovers, trying to see whether\r\nthere might be one of the least desirable at whom she might again\r\ncast her javelins. But there was not one.\r\n\r\nThe tender messages from Mounser Green came to her day by day.\r\nMounser Green, as the nephew of her hostess, had been very kind to\r\nher; but hitherto he had never appeared to her in the light of a\r\npossible lover. He was a clerk in the Foreign Office, waiting for his\r\naunt\'s money;--a man whom she had met in society and whom she knew to\r\nbe well thought of by those above him in wealth and rank; but she had\r\nnever regarded him as prey,--or as a man whom any girl would want to\r\nmarry. He was one of those of the other sex who would most probably\r\nlook out for prey,--who, if he married at all, would marry an\r\nheiress. She, in her time, had been on good terms with many such\r\na one,--had counted them among her intimate friends, had made use\r\nof them and been useful to them,--but she had never dreamed of\r\nmarrying any one of them. They were there in society for altogether\r\na different purpose. She had not hesitated to talk to Mounser Green\r\nabout Lord Rufford,--and though she had pretended to make a secret\r\nof the place to which she was going when he had taken her to the\r\nrailway, she had not at all objected to his understanding her\r\npurpose. Up to that moment there had certainly been no thought on\r\nher part of transferring what she was wont to call her affections to\r\nMounser Green as a suitor.\r\n\r\nBut as she lay in bed, thinking of her future life, tidings were\r\nbrought to her by Mrs. Green that Mounser had accepted the mission\r\nto Patagonia. Could it be that her destiny intended her to go out\r\nto Patagonia as the wife, if not of one minister, then of another?\r\nThere would be a career,--a way of living, if not exactly that which\r\nshe would have chosen. Of Patagonia, as a place of residence, she\r\nhad already formed ideas. In some of those moments in which she had\r\nforeseen that Lord Rufford would be lost to her, she had told herself\r\nthat it would be better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven. Among\r\nPatagonian women she would probably be the first. Among English\r\nladies it did not seem that at present she had prospect of a high\r\nplace. It would be long before Lord Rufford would be forgotten,--and\r\nshe had not space enough before her for forgettings which would\r\nrequire time for their accomplishment. Mounser Green had declared\r\nwith energy that Lord Rufford had behaved very badly. There are men\r\nwho feel it to be their mission to come in for the relief of ladies\r\nwho have been badly treated. If Mounser Green wished to be one of\r\nthem on her behalf, and to take her out with him to his very far-away\r\nemployment, might not this be the best possible solution of her\r\npresent difficulties?\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the third day after her return she was able to come\r\ndown-stairs and the line of thought which has been suggested for her\r\ninduced her to undertake some trouble with the white and pink robe,\r\nor dressing-gown in which she had appeared. "Well, my dear, you are\r\nsmart," the old lady said.\r\n\r\n   "\'Odious in woollen;--\'twould a saint provoke,\r\n     Were the last words which poor Narcissa spoke.\'"\r\n\r\nsaid Arabella, who had long since provided herself with this\r\nquotation for such occasions. "I hope I am not exactly dying, Mrs.\r\nGreen; but I don\'t see why I should not object to be \'frightful,\' as\r\nwell as the young lady who was."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s all done for Mounser\'s benefit?"\r\n\r\n"Partly for you, partly for Mounser, and a good deal for myself. What\r\na very odd name. Why did they call him Mounser? I used to think it\r\nwas because he was in the Foreign Office,--a kind of chaff, as being\r\nhalf a Frenchman."\r\n\r\n"My mother\'s maiden name was Mounser, and it isn\'t French at all. I\r\ndon\'t see why it should not be as good a Christian name as Willoughby\r\nor Howard."\r\n\r\n"Quite as good, and much more distinctive. There can\'t be another\r\nMounser Green in the world."\r\n\r\n"And very few other young men like him. At my time of life I find\r\nit very hard his going away. And what will he do in such a place as\r\nthat,--all alone and without a wife?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you make him take a wife?"\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t time now. He\'ll have to start in May."\r\n\r\n"Plenty of time. Trousseaus are now got up by steam, and girls are\r\nkept ready to marry at the shortest notice. If I were you I should\r\ncertainly advise him to take out some healthy young woman, capable of\r\nbearing the inclemencies of the Patagonian climate."\r\n\r\n"As for that the climate is delicious," said Mrs. Green, who\r\ncertainly was not led by her guest\'s manner to suspect the nature of\r\nher guest\'s more recent intentions.\r\n\r\nMounser Green on this afternoon came to Portugal Street before he\r\nhimself went out to dinner, choosing the hour at which his aunt was\r\nwont to adorn herself. "And so you are to be the hero of Patagonia?"\r\nsaid Arabella as she put out her hand to congratulate him on his\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about heroism, but it seems that I am to go there,"\r\nsaid Mounser with much melancholy in his voice.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought you were the last man to leave London\r\nwillingly."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I should have said so myself. And I do flatter myself\r\nI shall be missed. But what had I before me here? This may lead to\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you will be missed, Mr. Green."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of you to say so."\r\n\r\n"Patagonia! It is such a long way off!" Then she began to consider\r\nwhether he had ever heard of her engagement with the last\r\nMinister-elect to that country. That he should know all about Lord\r\nRufford was a matter of course; but what chance could there be for\r\nher if he also knew that other affair? "We were intimately acquainted\r\nwith Mr. Morton in Washington and were surprised that he should have\r\naccepted it."\r\n\r\n"Poor Morton. He was a friend of mine. We used to call him the\r\nParagon because he never made mistakes. I had heard that you and Lady\r\nAugusta were a good deal with him in Washington."\r\n\r\n"We were, indeed. You do not know my good news as yet, I suppose.\r\nYour Paragon, as you call him, has left me five thousand pounds." Of\r\ncourse it would be necessary that he should know it some day if this\r\nnew plan of hers were to be carried out;--and if the plan should\r\nfail, his knowing it could do no harm.\r\n\r\n"How very nice for you. Poor Morton!"\r\n\r\n"It is well that somebody should behave well, when others treat one\r\nso badly, Mr. Green. Yes; he has left me five thousand pounds." Then\r\nshe showed him the lawyer\'s letter. "Perhaps as I am so separated at\r\npresent from all my own people by this affair with Lord Rufford, you\r\nwould not mind seeing the man for me." Of course he promised to see\r\nthe lawyer and to do everything that was necessary. "The truth is,\r\nMr. Green, Mr. Morton was very warmly attached to me. I was a foolish\r\ngirl, and could not return it. I thought of it long and was then\r\nobliged to tell him that I could not entertain just that sort of\r\nfeeling for him. You cannot think now how bitter is my regret;--that\r\nI should have allowed myself to trust a man so false and treacherous\r\nas Lord Rufford, and that I should have perhaps added a pang to the\r\ndeathbed of one so good as Mr. Morton." And so she told her little\r\nstory;--not caring very much whether it were believed or not, but\r\nfinding it to be absolutely essential that some story should be told.\r\n\r\nDuring the next day or two Mounser Green thought a great deal about\r\nit. That the story was not exactly true, he knew very well. But it is\r\nnot to be expected that a girl before her marriage should be exactly\r\ntrue about her old loves. That she had been engaged to Lord Rufford\r\nand had been cruelly jilted by him he did believe. That she had at\r\none time been engaged to the Paragon he was almost sure. The fact\r\nthat the Paragon had left her money was a strong argument that she\r\nhad not behaved badly to him. But there was much that was quite\r\ncertain. The five thousand pounds were quite certain; and the money,\r\nthough it could not be called a large fortune for a young lady, would\r\npay his debts and send him out a free man to Patagonia. And the\r\nfamily honours were certainly true. She was the undoubted niece of\r\nthe Duke of Mayfair, and such a connection might in his career be\r\nof service to him. Lord Mistletoe was a prig, but would probably be\r\na member of the Government. Mounser Green liked Dukes, and loved a\r\nDuchess in his heart of hearts. If he could only be assured that this\r\nniece would not be repudiated he thought that the speculation might\r\nanswer in spite of any ambiguity in the lady\'s antecedents.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard about Arabella\'s good fortune?" young Glossop asked\r\nthe next morning at the office.\r\n\r\n"You forget, my boy," said Mounser Green, "that the young lady of\r\nwhom you speak is a friend of mine."\r\n\r\n"Oh lord! So I did. I beg your pardon, old fellow." There was no one\r\nelse in the room at the moment, and Glossop in asking the question\r\nhad in truth forgotten what he had heard of this new intimacy.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you learn to be ill-natured, Glossop. And remember that there\r\nis no form so bad as that of calling young ladies by their Christian\r\nnames. I do know that poor Morton has left Miss Trefoil a sum of\r\nmoney which is at any rate evidence that he thought well of her to\r\nthe last."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is. I didn\'t mean to offend you. I wouldn\'t do it for\r\nworlds,--as you are going away." That afternoon, when Green\'s back\r\nwas turned, Glossop gave it as his opinion that something particular\r\nwould turn up between Mounser and Miss Trefoil, an opinion which\r\nbrought down much ridicule upon him from both Hoffmann and Archibald\r\nCurrie. But before that week was over,--in the early days of\r\nApril,--they were forced to retract their opinion and to do honour to\r\nyoung Glossop\'s sagacity. Mounser Green was engaged to Miss Trefoil,\r\nand for a day or two the Foreign Office could talk of nothing else.\r\n\r\n"A very handsome girl," said Lord Drummond to one of his\r\nsubordinates. "I met her at Mistletoe. As to that affair with\r\nLord Rufford, he treated her abominably." And when Mounser showed\r\nhimself at the office, which he did boldly, immediately after the\r\nengagement was made known, they all received him with open arms and\r\ncongratulated him sincerely on his happy fortune. He himself was\r\nquite contented with what he had done and thought that he was taking\r\nout for himself the very wife for Patagonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the new two lovers, Mounser Green and Arabella Trefoil,\r\nunderstand each other, than they set their wits to work to make the\r\nbest of their natural advantages. The latter communicated the fact\r\nin a very dry manner to her father and mother. Nothing was to be got\r\nfrom them, and it was only just necessary that they should know what\r\nshe intended to do with herself. "My dear mamma. I am to be married\r\nsome time early in May to Mr. Mounser Green of the Foreign Office.\r\nI don\'t think you know him, but I daresay you have heard of him. He\r\ngoes to Patagonia immediately after the wedding, and I shall go with\r\nhim. Your affectionate daughter, Arabella Trefoil." That was all she\r\nsaid, and the letter to her father was word for word the same. But\r\nhow to make use of those friends who were more happily circumstanced\r\nwas matter for frequent counsel between her and Mr. Green. In these\r\ndays I do not think that she concealed very much from him. To tell\r\nhim all the little details of her adventures with Lord Rufford would\r\nhave been neither useful nor pleasant; but, as to the chief facts,\r\nreticence would have been foolish. To the statement that Lord Rufford\r\nhad absolutely proposed to her she clung fast, and really did believe\r\nit herself. That she had been engaged to John Morton she did not\r\ndeny; but she threw the blame of that matter on her mother, and\r\nexplained to him that she had broken off the engagement down at\r\nBragton, because she could not bring herself to regard the man with\r\nsufficient personal favour. Mounser was satisfied, but was very\r\nstrong in urging her to seek, yet once again, the favour of her\r\nmagnificent uncle and her magnificent aunt.\r\n\r\n"What good can they do us?" said Arabella, who was almost afraid to\r\nmake the appeal.\r\n\r\n"It would be everything for you to be married from Mistletoe," he\r\nsaid. "People would know then that you were not blamed about Lord\r\nRufford. And it might serve me very much in my profession. These\r\nthings do help very much. It would cost us nothing, and the proper\r\nkind of notice would then get into the newspapers. If you will write\r\ndirect to the Duchess, I will get at the Duke through Lord Drummond.\r\nThey know where we are going, and that we are not likely to want\r\nanything else for a long time."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think the Duchess would have mamma if it were ever so."\r\n\r\n"Then we must drop your mother for the time;--that\'s all. When my\r\naunt hears that you are to be married from the Duke\'s, she will be\r\nquite willing that you should remain with her till you go down to\r\nMistletoe."\r\n\r\nArabella, who perhaps knew a little more than her lover, could not\r\nbring herself to believe that the appeal would be successful, but she\r\nmade it. It was a very difficult letter to write, as she could not\r\nbut allude to the rapid transference of her affections. "I will not\r\nconceal from you," she said, "that I have suffered very much from\r\nLord Rufford\'s heartless conduct. My misery has been aggravated by\r\nthe feeling that you and my uncle will hardly believe him to be so\r\nfalse, and will attribute part of the blame to me. I had to undergo\r\nan agonizing revulsion of feeling, during which Mr. Green\'s behaviour\r\nto me was at first so considerate and then so kind that it has gone\r\nfar to cure the wound from which I have been suffering. He is so well\r\nknown in reference to foreign affairs, that I think my uncle cannot\r\nbut have heard of him; my cousin Mistletoe is certainly acquainted\r\nwith him; and I think that you cannot but approve of the match. You\r\nknow what is the position of my father and my mother, and how little\r\nable they are to give us any assistance. If you would be kind enough\r\nto let us be married from Mistletoe, you will confer on both of us\r\na very, very great favour." There was more of it, but that was the\r\nfirst of the prayer, and most of the words given above came from\r\nthe dictation of Mounser himself. She had pleaded against making\r\nthe direct request, but he had assured her that in the world, as at\r\npresent arranged, the best way to get a thing is to ask for it. "You\r\nmake yourself at any rate understood," he said, "and you may be sure\r\nthat people who receive petitions do not feel the hardihood of them\r\nso much as they who make them." Arabella, comforting herself by\r\ndeclaring that the Duchess at any rate could not eat her, wrote the\r\nletter and sent it.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess at first was most serious in her intention to refuse. She\r\nwas indeed made very angry by the request. Though it had been agreed\r\nat Mistletoe that Lord Rufford had behaved badly, the Duchess was\r\nthoroughly well aware that Arabella\'s conduct had been abominable.\r\nLord Rufford probably had made an offer, but it had been extracted\r\nfrom him by the vilest of manoeuvres. The girl had been personally\r\ninsolent to herself. And this rapid change, this third engagement\r\nwithin a few weeks,--was disgusting to her as a woman. But, unluckily\r\nfor herself, she would not answer the letter till she had consulted\r\nher husband. As it happened the Duke was in town, and while he was\r\nthere Lord Drummond got hold of him. Lord Drummond had spoken very\r\nhighly of Mounser Green, and the Duke, who was never dead to the\r\nfeeling that as the head of the family he should always do what he\r\ncould for the junior branches, had almost made a promise. "I never\r\ntake such things upon myself," he said, "but if the Duchess has no\r\nobjection, we will have them down to Mistletoe."\r\n\r\n"Of course if you wish it," said the Duchess,--with more acerbity in\r\nher tone than the Duke had often heard there.\r\n\r\n"Wish it? What do you mean by wishing it? It will be a great bore."\r\n\r\n"Terrible!"\r\n\r\n"But she is the only one there is, and then we shall have done with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Done with it! They will be back from Patagonia before you can turn\r\nyourself, and then of course we must have them here."\r\n\r\n"Drummond tells me that Mr. Green is one of the most useful men they\r\nhave at the Foreign Office;--just the man that one ought to give a\r\nlift to." Of course the Duke had his way. The Duchess could not bring\r\nherself to write the letter, but the Duke wrote to his dear niece\r\nsaying that "they" would be very glad to see her, and that if she\r\nwould name the day proposed for the wedding, one should be fixed for\r\nher visit to Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n"You had better tell your mother and your father," Mounser said to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use? The Duchess hates my mother, and my father never\r\ngoes near the place."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless tell them. People care a great deal for appearances."\r\nShe did as she was bid, and the result was that Lord Augustus and his\r\nwife, on the occasion of their daughter\'s marriage, met each other at\r\nMistletoe,--for the first time for the last dozen years.\r\n\r\nBefore the day came round Arabella was quite astonished to find how\r\npopular and fashionable her wedding was likely to be, and how the\r\nworld at large approved of what she was doing. The newspapers had\r\nparagraphs about alliances and noble families, and all the relatives\r\nsent tribute. There was a gold candlestick from the Duke, a gilt dish\r\nfrom the Duchess,--which came however without a word of personal\r\ncongratulation,--and a gorgeous set of scent-bottles from cousin\r\nMistletoe. The Connop Greens were lavish with sapphires, the De\r\nBrownes with pearls, and the Smijths with opal. Mrs. Gore sent a huge\r\ncarbuncle which Arabella strongly suspected to be glass. From her\r\npaternal parent there came a pair of silver nut-crackers, and from\r\nthe maternal a second-hand dressing-case newly done up. Old Mrs.\r\nGreen gave her a couple of ornamental butter-boats, and salt-cellars\r\ninnumerable came from distant Greens. But there was a diamond\r\nring--with a single stone,--from a friend, without a name, which she\r\nbelieved to be worth all the rest in money value. Should she send it\r\nback to Lord Rufford, or make a gulp and swallow it? How invincible\r\nmust be the good-nature of the man when he could send her such a\r\npresent after such a rating as she had given him in the park at\r\nRufford! "Do as you like," Mounser Green said when she consulted him.\r\n\r\nShe very much wished to keep it. "But what am I to say, and to whom?"\r\n\r\n"Write a note to the jewellers saying that you have got it." She did\r\nwrite to the jeweller saying that she had got the ring,--"from a\r\nfriend;" and the ring with the other tribute went to Patagonia. He\r\nhad certainly behaved very badly to her, but she was quite sure that\r\nhe would never tell the story of the ring to any one. Perhaps she\r\nthought that as she had spared him in the great matter of eight\r\nthousand pounds, she was entitled to take this smaller contribution.\r\n\r\nIt was late in April when she went down to Mistletoe, the marriage\r\nhaving been fixed for the 3rd of May. After that they were to spend a\r\nfortnight in Paris, and leave England for Patagonia at the end of the\r\nmonth. The only thing which Arabella dreaded was the meeting with the\r\nDuchess. When that was once over she thought that she could bear with\r\nequanimity all that could come after. The week before her marriage\r\ncould not be a pleasant week, but then she had been accustomed\r\nto endure evil hours. Her uncle would be blandly good-natured.\r\nMistletoe, should he be there, would make civil speeches to\r\ncompensate for his indifference when called upon to attack Lord\r\nRufford. Other guests would tender to her the caressing observance\r\nalways shown to a bride. But as she got out of the ducal carriage at\r\nthe front door, her heart was uneasy at the coming meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess herself almost went to bed when the time came, so much\r\ndid she dread the same thing. She was quite alone, having felt that\r\nshe could not bring herself to give the affectionate embrace which\r\nthe presence of others would require. She stood in the middle of the\r\nroom and then came forward three steps to meet the bride. "Arabella,"\r\nshe said, "I am very glad that everything has been settled so\r\ncomfortably for you."\r\n\r\n"That is so kind of you, aunt," said Arabella, who was watching the\r\nDuchess closely,--ready to jump into her aunt\'s arms if required to\r\ndo so, or to stand quite aloof.\r\n\r\nThen the Duchess signified her pleasure that her cheek should be\r\ntouched,--and it was touched. "Mrs. Pepper will show you your room.\r\nIt is the same you had when you were here before. Perhaps you know\r\nthat Mr. Green comes down to Stamford on the first, and that he will\r\ndine here on that day and on Sunday."\r\n\r\n"That will be very nice. He had told me how it was arranged."\r\n\r\n"It seems that he knows one of the clergymen in Stamford, and will\r\nstay at his house. Perhaps you will like to go upstairs now."\r\n\r\nThat was all there was, and that had not been very bad. During\r\nthe entire week the Duchess hardly spoke to her another word, and\r\ncertainly did not speak to her a word in private. Arabella now could\r\ngo where she pleased without any danger of meeting her aunt on her\r\nwalks. When Sunday came nobody asked her to go to church. She did go\r\ntwice, Mounser Green accompanying her to the morning service;--but\r\nthere was no restraint. The Duchess only thought of her as a\r\ndisagreeable ill-conducted incubus, who luckily was about to be taken\r\naway to Patagonia.\r\n\r\nIt had been settled on all sides that the marriage was to be very\r\nquiet. The bride was of course consulted about her bridesmaids, as\r\nto whom there was a little difficulty. But a distant Trefoil was\r\nfound willing to act, in payment for the unaccustomed invitation to\r\nMistletoe, and one Connop Green young lady, with one De Browne young\r\nlady, and one Smijth young lady came on the same terms. Arabella\r\nherself was surprised at the ease with which it was all done. On the\r\nSaturday Lady Augustus came, and on the Sunday Lord Augustus. The\r\nparents of course kissed their child, but there was very little said\r\nin the way either of congratulation or farewell. Lord Augustus did\r\nhave some conversation with Mounser Green, but it all turned on the\r\nprobability of there being whist in Patagonia. On the Monday morning\r\nthey were married, and then Arabella was taken off by the happy\r\nbridegroom.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony was over it was expected that Lady Augustus should\r\ntake herself away as quickly as possible,--not perhaps on that very\r\nafternoon, but at any rate, on the next morning. As soon as the\r\ncarriage was gone, she went to her own room and wept bitterly. It was\r\nall done now. Everything was over. Though she had quarrelled daily\r\nwith her daughter for the last twelve years,--to such an extent\r\nlately that no decently civil word ever passed between them,--still\r\nthere had been something to interest her. There had been something\r\nto fear and something to hope. The girl had always had some prospect\r\nbefore her, more or less brilliant. Her life had had its occupation,\r\nand future triumph was possible. Now it was all over. The link by\r\nwhich she had been bound to the world was broken. The Connop Greens\r\nand the Smijths would no longer have her,--unless it might be on\r\nshort and special occasions, as a great favour. She knew that she was\r\nan old woman, without money, without blood, and without attraction,\r\nwhom nobody would ever again desire to see. She had her things\r\npacked up, and herself taken off to London, almost without a word of\r\nfarewell to the Duchess, telling herself as she went that the world\r\nhad produced no other people so heartless as the family of the\r\nTrefoils.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what you will think of Patagonia," said Mounser Green as he\r\ntook his bride away.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose I shall think much. As far as I can see one place is\r\nalways like another."\r\n\r\n"But then you will have duties."\r\n\r\n"Not very heavy I hope."\r\n\r\nThen he preached her a sermon, expressing a hope as he went on, that\r\nas she was leaving the pleasures of life behind her, she would learn\r\nto like the work of life. "I have found the pleasures very hard,"\r\nshe said. He spoke to her of the companion he hoped to find, of the\r\npossible children who might be dependent on their mother, of the\r\nposition which she would hold, and of the manner in which she should\r\nfill it. She, as she listened to him, was almost stunned by the\r\nchange in the world around her. She need never again seem to be gay\r\nin order that men might be attracted. She made her promises and made\r\nthem with an intention of keeping them; but it may, we fear, be\r\ndoubted whether he was justified in expecting that he could get a\r\nwife fit for his purpose out of the school in which Arabella Trefoil\r\nhad been educated. The two, however, will pass out of our sight, and\r\nwe can only hope that he may not be disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SENATOR\'S LECTURE.--NO. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday, April 14th, was the day at last fixed for the Senator\'s\r\nlecture. His little proposal to set England right on all those\r\nmatters in which she had hitherto gone astray had created a\r\nconsiderable amount of attention. The Goarly affair with the\r\nsubsequent trial of Scrobby had been much talked about, and the\r\nSenator\'s doings in reference to it had been made matter of comment\r\nin the newspapers. Some had praised him for courage, benevolence, and\r\na steadfast purpose. Others had ridiculed his inability to understand\r\nmanners different from those of his own country. He had seen a good\r\ndeal of society both in London and in the country, and had never\r\nhesitated to express his opinions with an audacity which some had\r\ncalled insolence. When he had trodden with his whole weight hard\r\ndown on individual corns, of course he had given offence,--as\r\non the memorable occasion of the dinner at the parson\'s house in\r\nDillsborough. But, on the whole, he had produced for himself a\r\ngeneral respect among educated men which was not diminished by\r\nthe fact that he seemed to count quite as little on that as on\r\nthe ill-will and abuse of others. For some days previous to the\r\ndelivery of the lecture the hoardings in London were crowded with\r\nsesquipedalian notices of the entertainment, so that Senator\r\nGotobed\'s great oration on "The Irrationality of Englishmen" was\r\nlooked to with considerable interest.\r\n\r\nWhen an intelligent Japanese travels in Great Britain or an\r\nintelligent Briton in Japan, he is struck with no wonder at national\r\ndifferences. He is on the other hand rather startled to find how like\r\nhis strange brother is to him in many things. Crime is persecuted,\r\nwickedness is condoned, and goodness treated with indifference in\r\nboth countries. Men care more for what they eat than anything else,\r\nand combine a closely defined idea of meum with a lax perception as\r\nto tuum Barring a little difference of complexion and feature the\r\nEnglishman would make a good Japanese, or the Japanese a first-class\r\nEnglishman. But when an American comes to us or a Briton goes to\r\nthe States, each speaking the same language, using the same cookery,\r\ngoverned by the same laws, and wearing the same costume, the\r\ndifferences which present themselves are so striking that neither can\r\nlive six months in the country of the other without a holding up of\r\nthe hands and a torrent of exclamations. And in nineteen cases out of\r\ntwenty the surprise and the ejaculations take the place of censure.\r\nThe intelligence of the American, displayed through the nose, worries\r\nthe Englishman. The unconscious self-assurance of the Englishman, not\r\nalways unaccompanied by a sneer, irritates the American. They meet\r\nas might a lad from Harrow and another from Mr. Brumby\'s successful\r\nmechanical cramming establishment. The Harrow boy cannot answer a\r\nquestion, but is sure that he is the proper thing, and is ready to\r\nface the world on that assurance. Mr. Brumby\'s paragon is shocked\r\nat the other\'s inaptitude for examination, but is at the same time\r\ntortured by envy of he knows not what. In this spirit we Americans\r\nand Englishmen go on writing books about each other, sometimes with\r\nbitterness enough, but generally with good final results. But in the\r\nmeantime there has sprung up a jealousy which makes each inclined\r\nto hate the other at first sight. Hate is difficult and expensive,\r\nand between individuals soon gives place to love. "I cannot bear\r\nAmericans as a rule, though I have been very lucky myself with a few\r\nfriends." Who in England has not heard that form of speech, over and\r\nover again? And what Englishman has travelled in the States without\r\nhearing abuse of all English institutions uttered amidst the pauses\r\nof a free-handed hospitality which has left him nothing to desire?\r\n\r\nMr. Senator Gotobed had expressed his mind openly wheresoever he\r\nwent, but, being a man of immense energy, was not content with such\r\nprivate utterances. He could not liberate his soul without doing\r\nsomething in public to convince his cousins that in their general\r\npractices of life they were not guided by reason. He had no object of\r\nmaking money. To give him his due we must own that he had no object\r\nof making fame. He was impelled by that intense desire to express\r\nhimself which often amounts to passion with us, and sometimes to fury\r\nwith Americans, and he hardly considered much what reception his\r\nwords might receive. It was only when he was told by others that his\r\nlecture might give offence which possibly would turn to violence,\r\nthat he made inquiry as to the attendance of the police. But though\r\nthey should tear him to pieces he would say what he had to say. It\r\nshould not be his fault if the absurdities of a people whom he really\r\nloved were not exposed to light, so that they might be acknowledged\r\nand abandoned.\r\n\r\nHe had found time to travel to Birmingham, to Manchester, to\r\nLiverpool, to Glasgow, and to other places, and really thought that\r\nhe had mastered his great subject. He had worked very hard, but was\r\nprobably premature in thinking that he knew England thoroughly. He\r\nhad, however, undoubtedly dipped into a great many matters, and could\r\nprobably have told many Englishmen much that they didn\'t know about\r\ntheir own affairs. He had poked his nose everywhere, and had scrupled\r\nto ask no question. He had seen the miseries of a casual ward, the\r\ndespair of an expiring strike, the amenities of a city slum, and the\r\nstolid apathy of a rural labourer\'s home. He had measured the animal\r\nfood consumed by the working classes, and knew the exact amount of\r\nalcohol swallowed by the average Briton. He had seen also the luxury\r\nof baronial halls, the pearl-drinking extravagances of commercial\r\npalaces, the unending labours of our pleasure-seekers--as with Lord\r\nRufford, and the dullness of ordinary country life--as experienced by\r\nhimself at Bragton. And now he was going to tell the English people\r\nat large what he thought about it all.\r\n\r\nThe great room at St. James\'s Hall had been secured for the occasion,\r\nand Lord Drummond, the Minister of State in foreign affairs, had\r\nbeen induced to take the chair. In these days our governments are\r\nvery anxious to be civil to foreigners, and there is nothing that a\r\nrobust Secretary of State will not do for them. On the platform there\r\nwere many members of both Houses of Parliament, and almost everybody\r\nconnected with the Foreign Office. Every ticket had been taken\r\nfor weeks since. The front benches were filled with the wives and\r\ndaughters of those on the platform, and back behind, into the distant\r\nspaces in which seeing was difficult and hearing impossible, the\r\ncrowd was gathered at 2_s._ 6_d._ a head, all of which was going to\r\nsome great British charity. From half-past seven to eight Piccadilly\r\nand Regent Street were crammed, and when the Senator came himself\r\nwith his chairman he could hardly make his way in at the doors. A\r\ngreat treat was expected, but there was among the officers of police\r\nsome who thought that a portion of the audience would not bear\r\nquietly the hard things that would be said, and that there was an\r\nuncanny gathering of roughs about the street, who were not prepared\r\nto be on their best behaviour when they should be told that old\r\nEngland was being abused.\r\n\r\nLord Drummond opened the proceedings by telling the audience, in\r\na voice clearly audible to the reporters and the first half-dozen\r\nbenches, that they had come there to hear what a well-informed and\r\ndistinguished foreigner thought of their country. They would not,\r\nhe was sure, expect to be flattered. Than flattery nothing was more\r\nuseless or ignoble. This gentleman, coming from a new country, in\r\nwhich tradition was of no avail, and on which the customs of former\r\ncenturies had had no opportunities to engraft themselves, had seen\r\nmany things here which, in his eyes, could not justify themselves by\r\nreason. Lord Drummond was a little too prolix for a chairman, and\r\nat last concluded by expressing "his conviction that his countrymen\r\nwould listen to the distinguished Senator with that courtesy which\r\nwas due to a foreigner and due also to the great and brotherly nation\r\nfrom which he had come."\r\n\r\nThen the Senator rose, and the clapping of hands and kicking of\r\nheels was most satisfactory. There was at any rate no prejudice at\r\nthe onset. "English Ladies and Gentlemen," he said, "I am in the\r\nunenviable position of having to say hard things to you for about\r\nan hour and a half together, if I do not drive you from your seats\r\nbefore my lecture is done. And this is the more the pity because I\r\ncould talk to you for three hours about your country and not say an\r\nunpleasant word. His Lordship has told you that flattery is not my\r\npurpose. Neither is praise, which would not be flattery. Why should\r\nI collect three or four thousand people here to tell them of virtues\r\nthe consciousness of which is the inheritance of each of them? You\r\nare brave and generous,--and you are lovely to look at, with sweetly\r\npolished manners; but you know all that quite well enough without my\r\ntelling you. But it strikes me that you do not know how little prone\r\nyou are to admit the light of reason into either your public or\r\nprivate life, and how generally you allow yourselves to be guided\r\nby traditions, prejudices, and customs which should be obsolete. If\r\nyou will consent to listen to what one foreigner thinks,--though he\r\nhimself be a man of no account,--you may perchance gather from his\r\nwords something of the opinion of bystanders in general, and so be\r\nable, perhaps a little, to rectify your gait and your costume and the\r\ntones of your voice, as we are all apt to do when we come from our\r\nprivate homes, out among the eyes of the public."\r\n\r\nThis was received very well. The Senator spoke with a clear, sonorous\r\nvoice, no doubt with a twang, but so audibly as to satisfy the room\r\nin general. "I shall not," he said, "dwell much on your form of\r\ngovernment. Were I to praise a republic I might seem to belittle your\r\nthrone and the lady who sits on it,--an offence which would not be\r\nendured for a moment by English ears. I will take the monarchy as it\r\nis, simply remarking that its recondite forms are very hard to be\r\nunderstood by foreigners, and that they seem to me to be for the most\r\npart equally dark to natives. I have hardly as yet met two Englishmen\r\nwho were agreed as to the political power of the sovereign; and\r\nmost of those of whom I have enquired have assured me that the\r\nmatter is one as to which they have not found it worth their while\r\nto make inquiry." Here a voice from the end of the hall made some\r\nprotestation, but the nature of the protest did not reach the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\n"But," continued the Senator, now rising into energy, "tho\' I will\r\nnot meddle with your form of government, I may, I hope, be allowed\r\nto allude to the political agents by which it is conducted. You are\r\nproud of your Parliament."\r\n\r\n"We are," said a voice.\r\n\r\n"I wonder of which house. I do not ask the question that it may be\r\nanswered, because it is advisable at the present moment that there\r\nshould be only one speaker. That labour is, unfortunately for me, at\r\npresent in my hands, and I am sure you will agree with me that it\r\nshould not be divided. You mean probably that you are proud of your\r\nHouse of Commons,--and that you are so because it speaks with the\r\nvoice of the people. The voice of the people, in order that it may be\r\nheard without unjust preponderance on this side or on that, requires\r\nmuch manipulation. That manipulation has in latter years been\r\neffected by your Reform bills, of which during the last half century\r\nthere have in fact been four or five,--the latter in favour of the\r\nballot having been perhaps the greatest. There have been bills\r\nfor purity of elections,--very necessary; bills for creating\r\nconstituencies, bills for abolishing them, bills for dividing them,\r\nbills for extending the suffrage, and bills, if I am not mistaken,\r\nfor curtailing it. And what has been the result? How many men are\r\nthere in this room who know the respective nature of their votes?\r\nAnd is there a single woman who knows the political worth of her\r\nhusband\'s vote? Passing the other day from the Bank of this great\r\nmetropolis to its suburb called Brentford, journeying as I did the\r\nwhole way through continuous rows of houses, I found myself at first\r\nin a very ancient borough returning four members,--double the usual\r\nnumber,--not because of its population but because it has always been\r\nso. Here I was informed that the residents had little or nothing to\r\ndo with it. I was told, though I did not quite believe what I heard,\r\nthat there were no residents. The voters however, at any rate the\r\ninfluential voters, never pass a night there, and combine their city\r\nfranchise with franchises elsewhere. I then went through two enormous\r\nboroughs, one so old as to have a great political history of its own,\r\nand the other so new as to have none. It did strike me as odd that\r\nthere should be a new borough, with new voters, and new franchises,\r\nnot yet ten years old, in the midst of this city of London. But when\r\nI came to Brentford, everything was changed. I was not in a town at\r\nall though I was surrounded on all sides by houses. Everything around\r\nme was grim and dirty enough, but I am supposed to have reached,\r\npolitically, the rustic beauties of the country. Those around me, who\r\nhad votes, voted for the County of Middlesex. On the other side of\r\nthe invisible border I had just past the poor wretch with 3_s._ a day\r\nwho lived in a grimy lodging or a half-built hut, but who at any rate\r\npossessed the political privilege. Now I had suddenly emerged among\r\nthe aristocrats, and quite another state of things prevailed. Is\r\nthat a reasonable manipulation of the votes of the people? Does\r\nthat arrangement give to any man an equal share in his country? And\r\nyet I fancy that the thing is so little thought of that few among\r\nyou are aware that in this way the largest class of British labour\r\nis excluded from the franchise in a country which boasts of equal\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n"The chief object of your first Reform Bill was that of realising\r\nthe very fact of representation. Up to that time your members of the\r\nHouse of Commons were in truth deputies of the Lords or of other rich\r\nmen. Lord A, or Mr. B, or perhaps Lady C, sent whom she pleased to\r\nParliament to represent this or that town, or occasionally this or\r\nthat county. That absurdity is supposed to be past, and on evils\r\nthat have been cured no one should dwell. But how is it now? I have\r\na list,--in my memory, for I would not care to make out so black\r\na catalogue in legible letters,--of forty members who have been\r\nreturned to the present House of Commons by the single voices of\r\ninfluential persons. What will not forty voices do even in your\r\nParliament? And if I can count forty, how many more must there be\r\nof which I have not heard?" Then there was a voice calling upon the\r\nSenator to name those men, and other voices denying the fact. "I will\r\nname no one," said the Senator. "How could I tell what noble friend I\r\nmight put on a stool of repentance by doing so?" And he looked round\r\non the gentlemen on the platform behind him. "But I defy any member\r\nof Parliament here present to get up and say that it is not so." Then\r\nhe paused a moment. "And if it be so, is that rational? Is that in\r\naccordance with the theory of representation as to which you have all\r\nbeen so ardent, and which you profess to be so dear to you? Is the\r\ncountry not over-ridden by the aristocracy when Lord Lambswool not\r\nonly possesses his own hereditary seat in the House of Lords, but\r\nalso has a seat for his eldest son in the House of Commons?"\r\n\r\nThen a voice from the back called out, "What the deuce is all that to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SENATOR\'S LECTURE.--NO. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n"If I see a man hungry in the street," said the Senator, instigated\r\nby the question asked him at the end of the last chapter, "and give\r\nhim a bit of bread, I don\'t do it for my own sake but for his." Up to\r\nthis time the Britishers around him on the platform and those in the\r\nbenches near to him, had received what he said with a good grace. The\r\nallusion to Lord Lambswool had not been pleasant to them, but it had\r\nnot been worse than they had expected. But now they were displeased.\r\nThey did not like being told that they were taking a bit of bread\r\nfrom him in their own political destitution. They did not like that\r\nhe, an individual, should presume that he had bread to offer to them\r\nas a nation. And yet, had they argued it out in their own minds, they\r\nwould have seen that the Senator\'s metaphor was appropriate. His\r\npurpose in being there was to give advice, and theirs in coming to\r\nlisten to it. But it was unfortunate. "When I ventured to come before\r\nyou here, I made all this my business," continued the Senator. Then\r\nhe paused and glanced round the hall with a defiant look. "And now\r\nabout your House of Lords," he went on. "I have not much to say about\r\nthe House of Lords, because if I understand rightly the feeling of\r\nthis country it is already condemned." "No such thing." "Who told\r\nyou that?" "You know nothing about it." These and other words of\r\ncurt denial came from the distant corners, and a slight murmur of\r\ndisapprobation was heard even from the seats on the platform. Then\r\nLord Drummond got up and begged that there might be silence. Mr.\r\nGotobed had come there to tell them his views,--and as they had come\r\nthere expressly to listen to him, they could not without impropriety\r\ninterrupt him. "That such will be the feeling of the country before\r\nlong," continued the Senator, "I think no one can doubt who has\r\nlearned how to look to the signs of the times in such matters. Is it\r\npossible that the theory of an hereditary legislature can be defended\r\nwith reason? For a legislature you want the best and wisest of your\r\npeople." "You don\'t get them in America," said a voice which was\r\nbeginning to be recognised. "We try at any rate," said the Senator.\r\n"Now is it possible that an accident of birth should give you\r\nexcellence and wisdom? What is the result? Not a tenth of your\r\nhereditary legislators assemble in the beautiful hall that you have\r\nbuilt for them. And of that tenth the greater half consists of\r\ncounsellors of state who have been placed there in order that the\r\nbusiness of the country may not be brought to a standstill. Your\r\nhereditary chamber is a fiction supplemented by the element of\r\nelection,--the election resting generally in the very bosom of the\r\nHouse of Commons." On this subject, although he had promised to be\r\nshort, he said much more, which was received for the most part in\r\nsilence. But when he ended by telling them that they could have no\r\nright to call themselves a free people till every legislator in the\r\ncountry was elected by the votes of the people, another murmur was\r\nheard through the hall.\r\n\r\n"I told you," said he waxing more and more energetic, as he felt the\r\nopposition which he was bound to overcome, "that what I had to say\r\nto you would not be pleasant. If you cannot endure to hear me, let\r\nus break up and go away. In that case I must tell my friends at home\r\nthat the tender ears of a British audience cannot bear rough words\r\nfrom American lips. And yet if you think of it we have borne rough\r\nwords from you and have borne them with good-humour." Again he\r\npaused, but as none rose from their seats he went on, "Proceeding\r\nfrom hereditary legislature I come to hereditary property. It is\r\nnatural that a man should wish to give to his children after his\r\ndeath the property which he has enjoyed during their life. But let me\r\nask any man here who has not been born an eldest son himself, whether\r\nit is natural that he should wish to give it all to one son. Would\r\nany man think of doing so, by the light of his own reason,--out of\r\nhis own head as we say? Would any man be so unjust to those who are\r\nequal in his love, were he not constrained by law, and by custom more\r\niron-handed even than the law?" The Senator had here made a mistake\r\nvery common with Americans, and a great many voices were on him at\r\nonce. "What law?" "There is no law." "You know nothing about it." "Go\r\nback and learn."\r\n\r\n"What!" cried the Senator coming forward to the extreme verge of the\r\nplatform and putting down his foot as though there were strength\r\nenough in his leg to crush them all; "Will any one have the hardihood\r\nto tell me that property in this country is not affected by\r\nprimogeniture?" "Go back and learn the law." "I know the law perhaps\r\nbetter than most of you. Do you mean to assert that my Lord Lambswool\r\ncan leave his land to whom he pleases? I tell you that he has no\r\nmore than a life-interest in it, and that his son will only have the\r\nsame." Then an eager Briton on the platform got up and whispered\r\nto the Senator for a few minutes, during which the murmuring was\r\ncontinued. "My friend reminds me," said the Senator, "that the matter\r\nis one of custom rather than law; and I am obliged to him. But the\r\ncustom which is damnable and cruel, is backed by law which is equally\r\nso. If I have land I can not only give it all to my eldest son, but\r\nI can assure the right of primogeniture to his son, though he be not\r\nyet born. No one I think will deny that there must be a special law\r\nto enable me to commit an injustice so unnatural as that.\r\n\r\n"Hence it comes that you still suffer under an aristocracy almost as\r\ndominant, and in its essence as irrational, as that which created\r\nfeudalism." The gentlemen collected on the platform looked at each\r\nother and smiled, perhaps failing to catch the exact meaning of the\r\nSenator\'s words. "A lord here has a power, as a lord, which he cannot\r\nhimself fathom and of which he daily makes an unconscious but most\r\ndeleterious use. He is brought up to think it natural that he should\r\nbe a tyrant. The proclivities of his order are generous, and as a\r\nrule he gives more than he takes. But he is as injurious in the one\r\nprocess as in the other. Your ordinary Briton in his dealing with a\r\nlord expects payment in some shape for every repetition of the absurd\r\ntitle;--and payment is made. The titled aristocrat pays dearer for\r\nhis horse, dearer for his coat, dearer for his servant than other\r\npeople. But in return he exacts much which no other person can get.\r\nKnowing his own magnanimity he expects that his word shall not be\r\nquestioned. If I may be allowed I will tell a little story as to one\r\nof the most generous gentlemen I have had the happiness of meeting in\r\nthis country, which will explain my meaning."\r\n\r\nThen without mentioning names he told the story of Lord Rufford,\r\nGoarly, and Scrobby, in such a way as partly to redeem himself with\r\nhis audience. He acknowledged how absolutely he had been himself\r\nbefooled, and how he had been done out of his money by misplaced\r\nsympathy. He made Mrs. Goarly\'s goose immortal, and in imitating the\r\nindignation of Runce the farmer and Bean the gamekeeper showed that\r\nhe was master of considerable humour. But he brought it all round at\r\nlast to his own purpose, and ended this episode of his lecture by his\r\nview of the absurdity and illegality of British hunting. "I can talk\r\nabout it to you," he said, "and you will know whether I am speaking\r\nthe truth. But when I get home among my own people, and repeat my\r\nlecture there, as I shall do,--with some little additions as to the\r\ngood things I have found here from which your ears may be spared,--I\r\nshall omit this story as I know it will be impossible to make my\r\ncountrymen believe that a hundred harum-scarum tomboys may ride at\r\ntheir pleasure over every man\'s land, destroying crops and trampling\r\ndown fences, going, if their vermin leads them there, with reckless\r\nviolence into the sweet domestic garden of your country residences;\r\nand that no one can either stop them or punish them! An American will\r\nbelieve much about the wonderful ways of his British cousin, but no\r\nAmerican will be got to believe that till he sees it."\r\n\r\n"I find," said he, "that this irrationality, as I have ventured\r\nto call it, runs through all your professions. We will take the\r\nChurch as being the highest at any rate in its objects." Then he\r\nrecapitulated all those arguments against our mode of dispensing\r\nchurch patronage with which the reader is already familiar if he has\r\nattended to the Senator\'s earlier words as given in this chronicle.\r\n"In other lines of business there is, even here in England, some\r\nattempt made to get the man best suited for the work he has to\r\ndo. If any one wants a domestic servant he sets about the work of\r\ngetting a proper person in a very determined manner indeed. But for\r\nthe care,--or, as you call it, the cure,--of his soul, he has to put\r\nup with the man who has bought the right to minister to his wants;\r\nor with him whose father wants a means of living for his younger\r\nson,--the elder being destined to swallow all the family property;\r\nor with him who has become sick of drinking his wine in an Oxford\r\ncollege;--or with him, again, who has pleaded his cause successfully\r\nwith a bishop\'s daughter." It is not often that the British public\r\nis angered by abuse of the Church, and this part of the lecture was\r\nallowed to pass without strong marks of disapprobation.\r\n\r\n"I have been at some trouble," he continued, "to learn the very\r\ncomplex rules by which your army is now regulated, and those by which\r\nit was regulated a very short time since. Unhappily for me I have\r\nfound it in a state of transition, and nothing is so difficult to a\r\nstranger\'s comprehension as a transition state of affairs. But this\r\nI can see plainly;--that every improvement which is made is received\r\nby those whom it most concerns with a horror which amounts almost to\r\nmadness. So lovely to the ancient British, well-born, feudal instinct\r\nis a state of unreason, that the very absence of any principle\r\nendears to it institutions which no one can attempt to support by\r\nargument. Had such a thing not existed as the right to purchase\r\nmilitary promotion, would any satirist have been listened to who had\r\nsuggested it as a possible outcome of British irrationality? Think\r\nwhat it carries with it! The man who has proved himself fit to serve\r\nhis country by serving it in twenty foughten fields, who has bled for\r\nhis country and perhaps preserved his country, shall rot in obscurity\r\nbecause he has no money to buy promotion, whereas the young dandy who\r\nhas done no more than glitter along the pavements with his sword and\r\nspurs shall have the command of men;--because he has so many thousand\r\ndollars in his pocket."\r\n\r\n"_Buncombe_," shouted the inimical voice.\r\n\r\n"But is it _Buncombe_?" asked the intrepid Senator. "Will any one who\r\nknows what he is talking about say that I am describing a state of\r\nthings which did not exist yesterday? I will acknowledge that this\r\nhas been rectified,--tho\' I see symptoms of relapse. A fault that\r\nhas been mended is a fault no longer. But what I speak of now is the\r\ndisruption of all concord in your army caused by the reform which\r\nhas forced itself upon you. All loyalty has gone; all that love of\r\nhis profession which should be the breath of a soldier\'s nostrils.\r\nA fine body of fighting heroes is broken-hearted, not because injury\r\nhas been done to them or to any of them, but because the system had\r\nbecome peculiarly British by reason of its special absurdity, and\r\ntherefore peculiarly dear."\r\n\r\n"Buncombe," again said the voice, and the word was now repeated by a\r\ndozen voices.\r\n\r\n"Let any one show me that it is Buncombe. If I say what is untrue,\r\ndo with me what you please. If I am ignorant, set me right and laugh\r\nat me. But if what I say is true, then your interruption is surely a\r\nsign of imbecility. I say that the change was forced upon you by the\r\nfeeling of the people, but that its very expediency has demoralized\r\nthe army, because the army was irrational. And how is it with the\r\nnavy? What am I to believe when I hear so many conflicting statements\r\namong yourselves?" During this last appeal, however, the noise at\r\nthe back of the hall had become so violent, that the Senator was\r\nhardly able to make his voice heard by those immediately around him.\r\nHe himself did not quail for a moment, going on with his gestures,\r\nand setting down his foot as though he were still confident in his\r\npurpose of overcoming all opposition. He had not much above half done\r\nyet. There were the lawyers before him, and the Civil Service, and\r\nthe railways, and the commerce of the country, and the labouring\r\nclasses. But Lord Drummond and others near him were becoming\r\nterrified, thinking that something worse might occur unless an end\r\nwas put to the proceedings. Then a superintendent of police came\r\nin and whispered to his Lordship. A crowd was collecting itself in\r\nPiccadilly and St. James\'s Street, and perhaps the Senator had better\r\nbe withdrawn. The officer did not think that he could safely answer\r\nfor the consequences if this were carried on for a quarter of an hour\r\nlonger. Then Lord Drummond having meditated for a moment, touched\r\nthe Senator\'s arm and suggested a withdrawal into a side room for a\r\nminute. "Mr. Gotobed," he said, "a little feeling has been excited\r\nand we had better put an end to this for the present."\r\n\r\n"Put an end to it?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid we must. The police are becoming alarmed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course; you know best. In our country a man is allowed to\r\nexpress himself unless he utters either blasphemy or calumny. But I\r\nam in your hands and of course you must do as you please." Then he\r\nsat down in a corner, and wiped his brow. Lord Drummond returned to\r\nthe hall, and there endeavoured to explain that the lecture was over\r\nfor that night. The row was so great that it did not matter much what\r\nhe said, but the people soon understood that the American Senator was\r\nnot to appear before them again.\r\n\r\nIt was not much after nine o\'clock when the Senator reached his\r\nhotel, Lord Drummond having accompanied him thither in a cab. "Good\r\nnight, Mr. Gotobed," said his Lordship. "I cannot tell you how much I\r\nrespect both your purpose and your courage;--but I don\'t know how far\r\nit is wise for a man to tell any other man, much less a nation, of\r\nall his faults."\r\n\r\n"You English tell us of ours pretty often," said the Senator.\r\n\r\nWhen he found himself alone he thought of it all, giving himself no\r\nspecial credit for what he had done, acknowledging to himself that he\r\nhad often chosen his words badly and expressed himself imperfectly,\r\nbut declaring to himself through it all that the want of reason among\r\nBritishers was so great, that no one ought to treat them as wholly\r\nresponsible beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAYS OF MARY MASTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Mary Masters was something more than a nine days\'\r\nwonder to the people of Dillsborough. They had all known Larry\r\nTwentyman\'s intentions and aspirations, and had generally condemned\r\nthe young lady\'s obduracy, thinking, and not being slow to say,\r\nthat she would live to repent her perversity. Runciman who had\r\na thoroughly warm-hearted friendship for both the attorney and\r\nLarry had sometimes been very severe on Mary. "She wants a touch of\r\nhardship," he would say, "to bring her to. If Larry would just give\r\nher a cold shoulder for six months, she\'d be ready to jump into his\r\narms." And Dr. Nupper had been heard to remark that she might go\r\nfarther and fare worse. "If it were my girl I\'d let her know all\r\nabout it," Ribbs the butcher had said in the bosom of his own family.\r\nWhen it was found that Mr. Surtees the curate was not to be the\r\nfortunate man, the matter was more inexplicable than ever. Had it\r\nthen been declared that the owner of Hoppet Hall had proposed to her,\r\nall these tongues would have been silenced, and the refusal even of\r\nLarry Twentyman would have been justified. But what was to be said\r\nand what was to be thought when it was known that she was to be the\r\nmistress of Bragton? For a day or two the prosperity of the attorney\r\nwas hardly to be endured by his neighbours. When it was first known\r\nthat the stewardship of the property was to go back into his hands,\r\nhis rise in the world was for a time slightly prejudicial to his\r\npopularity; but this greater stroke of luck, this latter promotion\r\nwhich would place him so much higher in Dillsborough than even\r\nhis father or his grandfather had ever been, was a great trial of\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nMrs. Masters felt it all very keenly. All possibility for reproach\r\nagainst either her husband or her step-daughter was of course at\r\nan end. Even she did not pretend to say that Mary ought to refuse\r\nthe squire. Nor, as far as Mary was concerned, could she have\r\nfurther recourse to the evils of Ushanting, and the peril of social\r\nintercourse with ladies and gentlemen. It was manifest that Mary was\r\nto be a lady with a big house, and many servants, and, no doubt, a\r\ncarriage and horses. But still Mrs. Masters was not quite silenced.\r\nShe had daughters of her own, and would solace herself by declaring\r\nto them, to her husband, and to her specially intimate friends, that\r\nof course they would see no more of Mary. It wasn\'t for them to\r\nexpect to be asked to Bragton, and as for herself she would much\r\nrather not. She knew her own place and what she was born to, and\r\nwasn\'t going to let her own children spoil themselves and ruin their\r\nchances by dining at seven o\'clock and being waited upon by servants\r\nat every turn. Thank God her girls could make their own beds, and she\r\nhoped they might continue to do so at any rate till they had houses\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\nAnd there seemed to Dillsborough to be some justification for all\r\nthis in the fact that Mary was now living at Bragton, and that she\r\ndid not apparently intend to return to her father\'s house. At this\r\ntime Reginald Morton himself was still at Hoppet Hall, and had\r\ndeclared that he would remain there till after his marriage. Lady\r\nUshant was living at the big house, which was henceforth to be her\r\nhome. Mary was her visitor, and was to be married from Bragton as\r\nthough Bragton were her residence rather than the squire\'s. The\r\nplan had originated with Reginald, and when it had been hinted\r\nto him that Mary would in this way seem to slight her father\'s\r\nhome, he had proposed that all the Masters should come and stay at\r\nBragton previous to the ceremony. Mrs. Masters yielded as to Mary\'s\r\nresidence, saying with mock humility that of course she had no room\r\nfit to give a marriage feast to the Squire of Bragton; but she was\r\nsteadfast in saying to her husband, who made the proposition to her,\r\nthat she would stay at home. Of course she would be present at the\r\nwedding; but she would not trouble the like of Lady Ushant by any\r\nprolonged visiting.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was to take place about the beginning of May, and all\r\nthese things were being considered early in April. At this time one\r\nof the girls was always at Bragton, and Mary had done her best, but\r\nhitherto in vain, to induce her step-mother to come to her. When she\r\nheard that there was a doubt as to the accomplishment of the plan for\r\nthe coming of the whole family, she drove herself into Dillsborough\r\nin the old phaeton and then pleaded her cause for herself. "Mamma,"\r\nshe said, "won\'t you come with the girls and papa on the 29th?"\r\n\r\n"I think not, my dear. The girls can go,--if they like it. But it\r\nwill be more fitting for papa and me to come to the church on the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Why more fitting, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear; it will."\r\n\r\n"Dear mamma;--why,--why?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, my dear, I am very glad that you are going to get such a\r\nlift."\r\n\r\n"My lift is marrying the man I love."\r\n\r\n"That of course is all right. I have nothing on earth to say against\r\nit. And I will say that through it all you have behaved as a young\r\nwoman should. I don\'t think you meant to throw yourself at him."\r\n\r\n"Mamma!"\r\n\r\n"But as it has turned up, you have to go one way and me another."\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"But it must be so. The Squire of Bragton is the Squire, and his wife\r\nmust act accordingly. Of course you\'ll be visiting at Rufford and\r\nHampton Wick, and all the places. I know very well who I am, and what\r\nI came from. I\'m not a bit ashamed of myself, but I\'m not going to\r\nstick myself up with my betters."\r\n\r\n"Then mamma, I shall come and be married from here."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late for that now, my dear."\r\n\r\n"No;--it is not." And then a couple of tears began to roll down from\r\nher eyes. "I won\'t be married without your coming in to see me the\r\nnight before, and being with me in the morning when I dress. Haven\'t\r\nI been a good child to you, mamma?" Then the step-mother began to cry\r\nalso. "Haven\'t I, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear," whimpered the poor woman.\r\n\r\n"And won\'t you be my mamma to the last;--won\'t you?" And she threw\r\nher arms round her step-mother\'s neck and kissed her. "I won\'t go one\r\nway, and you another. He doesn\'t wish it. It is quite different from\r\nthat. I don\'t care a straw for Hampton Wick and Rufford; but I will\r\nnever be separated from you and the girls and papa. Say you will\r\ncome, mamma. I will not let you go till you say you will come." Of\r\ncourse she had her own way, and Mrs. Masters had to feel with a sore\r\nheart that she also must go out Ushanting. She knew, that in spite of\r\nher domestic powers, she would be stricken dumb in the drawing-room\r\nat Bragton and was unhappy.\r\n\r\nMary had another scheme in which she was less fortunate. She took it\r\ninto her head that Larry Twentyman might possibly be induced to come\r\nto her wedding. She had heard how he had ridden and gained honour for\r\nhimself on the day that the hounds killed their fox at Norrington,\r\nand thought that perhaps her own message to him had induced him so\r\nfar to return to his old habits. And now she longed to ask him, for\r\nher sake, to be happy once again. If any girl ever loved the man\r\nshe was going to marry with all her heart, this girl loved Reginald\r\nMorton. He had been to her, when her love was hopeless, so completely\r\nthe master of her heart that she could not realise the possibility\r\nof affection for another. But yet she was pervaded by a tenderness\r\nof feeling in regard to Larry which was love also,--though love\r\naltogether of another kind. She thought of him daily. His future\r\nwell-being was one of the cares of her life. That her husband might\r\nbe able to call him a friend was among her prayers. Had anybody\r\nspoken ill of him in her presence she would have resented it hotly.\r\nHad she been told that another girl had consented to be his wife,\r\nshe would have thought that girl to be happy in her destiny. When\r\nshe heard that he was leading a wretched, moping, aimless life for\r\nher sake, her heart was sad within her. It was necessary to the\r\ncompletion of her happiness that Larry should recover his tone of\r\nmind and be her friend. "Reg," she said, leaning on his arm out in\r\nthe park, "I want you to do me a favour."\r\n\r\n"Watch and chain?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be an idiot. You know I\'ve got a watch and chain."\r\n\r\n"Some girls like two. To have the wooden bridge pulled down and a\r\nstone one built."\r\n\r\n"If any one touched a morsel of that sacred timber he should be\r\nbanished from Bragton for ever. I want you to ask Mr. Twentyman to\r\ncome to our wedding."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s to do it? Who\'s to bell the cat?"\r\n\r\n"You."\r\n\r\n"I would sooner fight a Saracen, or ride such a horse as killed that\r\npoor major. Joking apart, I don\'t see how it is to be done. Why do\r\nyou wish it?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am so fond of him."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--indeed!"\r\n\r\n"If you\'re a goose, I\'ll hit you. I am fond of him. Next to you and\r\nmy own people, and Lady Ushant, I like him best in all the world."\r\n\r\n"What a pity you couldn\'t have put him up a little higher."\r\n\r\n"I used to think so too;--only I couldn\'t. If anybody loved you as he\r\ndid me,--offered you everything he had in the world,--thought that\r\nyou were the best in the world,--would have given his life for you,\r\nwould not you be grateful?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I need wish to ask such a person to my wedding."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you would, if in that way you could build a bridge to bring him\r\nback to happiness. And, Reg, though you used to despise him--"\r\n\r\n"I never despised him."\r\n\r\n"A little I think--before you knew him. But he is not despicable."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, my dear."\r\n\r\n"He is honest and good, and has a real heart of his own."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he has parted with that."\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean, and if you won\'t be serious I shall think\r\nthere is no seriousness in you. I want you to tell me how it can be\r\ndone."\r\n\r\nThen he was serious, and tried to explain to her that he could not\r\nvery well do what she wanted. "He is your friend you know rather than\r\nmine;--but if you like to write to him you can do so."\r\n\r\nThis seemed to her to be very difficult, and, as she thought more of\r\nit, almost impossible. A written letter remains, and may be taken as\r\nevidence of so much more than it means. But a word sometimes may be\r\nspoken which, if it be well spoken,--if assurance of its truth be\r\ngiven by the tone and by the eye of the speaker,--shall do so much\r\nmore than any letter, and shall yet only remain with the hearer as\r\nthe remembrance of the scent of a flower remains! Nevertheless she\r\ndid at last write the letter, and brought it to her husband. "Is it\r\nnecessary that I should see it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Not absolutely necessary."\r\n\r\n"Then send it without."\r\n\r\n"But I should like you to see what I have said. You know about\r\nthings, and if it is too much or too little, you can tell me." Then\r\nhe read her letter, which ran as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MR. TWENTYMAN,\r\n\r\n   Perhaps you have heard that we are to be married on\r\n   Thursday, May 6th. I do so wish that you would come. It\r\n   would make me so much happier on that day. We shall be\r\n   very quiet; and if you would come to the house at eleven\r\n   you could go across the park with them all to the church.\r\n   I am to be taken in a carriage because of my finery. Then\r\n   there will be a little breakfast. Papa and mamma and Dolly\r\n   and Kate would be so glad;--and so would Mr. Morton.\r\n   But none of them will be half so glad as your old, old,\r\n   affectionate friend\r\n\r\n   MARY MASTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"If that don\'t fetch him," said Reginald, "he is a poorer creature\r\nthan I take him to be."\r\n\r\n"But I may send it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly you may send it." And so the letter was sent across to\r\nChowton Farm.\r\n\r\nBut the letter did not "fetch" him; nor am I prepared to agree with\r\nMr. Morton that he was a poor creature for not being "fetched." There\r\nare things which the heart of a man should bear without whimpering,\r\nbut which it cannot bear in public with that appearance of stoical\r\nindifference which the manliness of a man is supposed to require.\r\nWere he to go, should he be jovial before the wedding party or should\r\nhe be sober and saturnine? Should he appear to have forgotten his\r\nlove, or should he go about lovelorn among the wedding guests? It was\r\nimpossible,--at any rate impossible as yet,--that he should fall into\r\nthat state of almost brotherly regard which it was so natural that\r\nshe should desire. But as he had determined to forgive her, he went\r\nacross that afternoon to the house and was the bearer of his own\r\nanswer. He asked Mrs. Hopkins who came to the door whether she were\r\nalone, and was then shown into an empty room where he waited for\r\nher. She came to him as quickly as she could, leaving Lady Ushant in\r\nthe middle of the page she was reading, and feeling as she tripped\r\ndownstairs that the colour was rushing to her face. "You will come,\r\nLarry," she said.\r\n\r\n"No, Miss Masters."\r\n\r\n"Let me be Mary till I am Mrs. Morton," she said, trying to smile. "I\r\nwas always Mary." And then she burst into tears. "Why,--why won\'t you\r\ncome?"\r\n\r\n"I should only stalk about like a ghost. I couldn\'t be merry as a man\r\nshould be at a wedding. I don\'t see how a man is to do such a thing."\r\nShe looked up into his face imploring him,--not to come, for that she\r\nfelt now to be impossible,--but imploring him to express in some way\r\nforgiveness of the sin she had committed against him. "But I shall\r\nthink of you and shall wish you well."\r\n\r\n"And after that we shall be friends?"\r\n\r\n"By and bye,--if he pleases."\r\n\r\n"He will please;--he does please. Of course he saw what I wrote to\r\nyou. And now, Larry, if I have ever treated you badly, say that you\r\npardon me."\r\n\r\n"If I had known it--" he said.\r\n\r\n"How could I tell you,--till he had spoken? And yet I knew it myself!\r\nIt has been so,--oh,--ever so long! What could I do? You will say\r\nthat you will forgive me."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I will say that."\r\n\r\n"And you will not go away from Chowton?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! They tell me I ought to stay here, and I suppose I shall\r\nstay. I thought I\'d just come over and say a word. I\'m going away\r\nto-morrow for a month. There is a fellow has got some fishing in\r\nIreland. Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Larry."\r\n\r\n"And I thought perhaps you\'d take this now." Then he brought out\r\nfrom his pocket a little ruby ring which he had carried often in his\r\npocket to the attorney\'s house, thinking that perhaps then might\r\ncome the happy hour in which he could get her to accept it. But the\r\nhour had never come as yet, and the ring had remained in the little\r\ndrawer beneath his looking-glass. It need hardly be said that she now\r\naccepted the gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senator for Mickewa,--whose name we have taken for a book which\r\nmight perhaps have been better called "The Chronicle of a Winter at\r\nDillsborough"--did not stay long in London after the unfortunate\r\nclose of his lecture. He was a man not very pervious to criticism,\r\nnor afraid of it, but he did not like the treatment he had received\r\nat St. James\'s Hall, nor the remarks which his lecture produced in\r\nthe newspapers. He was angry because people were unreasonable with\r\nhim, which was surely unreasonable in him who accused Englishmen\r\ngenerally of want of reason. One ought to take it as a matter of\r\ncourse that a bull should use his horns, and a wolf his teeth. The\r\nSenator read everything that was said of him, and then wrote numerous\r\nletters to the different journals which had condemned him. Had any\r\none accused him of an untruth? Or had his inaccuracies been glaring?\r\nHad he not always expressed his readiness to acknowledge his own\r\nmistake if convicted of ignorance? But when he was told that he had\r\npersistently trodden upon all the corns of his English cousins, he\r\ndeclared that corns were evil things which should be abolished, and\r\nthat with corns such as these there was no mode of abolition so\r\nefficacious as treading on them.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that you should have encountered anything so unpleasant,"\r\nLord Drummond said to him when he went to bid adieu to his friend at\r\nthe Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n"And I am sorry too, my Lord;--for your sake rather than my own. A\r\nman is in a bad case who cannot endure to hear of his faults."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you take our national sins a little too much for granted."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so, my Lord. If you knew me to be wrong you would\r\nnot be so sore with me. Nevertheless I am under deep obligation for\r\nkind-hearted hospitality. If an American can make up his mind to\r\ncrack up everything he sees here, there is no part of the world in\r\nwhich he can get along better." He had already written a long letter\r\nhome to his friend Mr. Josiah Scroome, and had impartially sent to\r\nthat gentleman not only his own lecture, but also a large collection\r\nof the criticisms made on it. A few weeks afterwards he took his\r\ndeparture, and when we last heard of him was thundering in the Senate\r\nagainst certain practices on the part of his own country which he\r\nthought to be unjust to other nations. Don Quixote was not more just\r\nthan the Senator, or more philanthropic,--nor perhaps more apt to\r\nwage war against the windmills.\r\n\r\nHaving in this our last chapter given the place of honour to the\r\nSenator, we must now say a parting word as to those countrymen of our\r\nown who have figured in our pages. Lord Rufford married Miss Penge\r\nof course, and used the lady\'s fortune in buying the property of Sir\r\nJohn Purefoy. We may probably be safe in saying that the acquisition\r\nadded very little to his happiness. What difference can it make to a\r\nman whether he has forty or fifty thousand pounds a year,--or at any\r\nrate to such a man? Perhaps Miss Penge herself was an acquisition. He\r\ndid not hunt so often or shoot so much, and was seen in church once\r\nat least on every Sunday. In a very short time his friends perceived\r\nthat a very great change had come over him. He was growing fat, and\r\nsoon disliked the trouble of getting up early to go to a distant\r\nmeet;--and, before a year or two had passed away, it had become an\r\nunderstood thing that in country houses he was not one of the men who\r\nwent down at night into the smoking-room in a short dressing-coat\r\nand a picturesque cap. Miss Penge had done all this. He had had his\r\nperiod of pleasure, and no doubt the change was desirable;--but he\r\nsometimes thought with regret of the promise Arabella Trefoil had\r\nmade him, that she would never interfere with his gratification.\r\n\r\nAt Dillsborough everything during the summer after the Squire\'s\r\nmarriage fell back into its usual routine. The greatest change made\r\nthere was in the residence of the attorney, who with his family went\r\nover to live at Hoppet Hall, giving up his old house to a young man\r\nfrom Norrington, who had become his partner, but keeping the old\r\noffice for his business. Mrs. Masters did, I think, like the honour\r\nand glory of the big house, but she would never admit that she did.\r\nAnd when she was constrained once or twice in the year to give a\r\ndinner to her step-daughter\'s husband and Lady Ushant, that, I think,\r\nwas really a period of discomfort to her. When at Bragton she could\r\nat any rate be quiet, and Mary\'s caressing care almost made the place\r\npleasant to her.\r\n\r\nMr. Runciman prospers at the Bush, though he has entirely lost his\r\nbest customer, Lord Rufford. But the U. R. U. is still strong, in\r\nspite of the philosophers, and in the hunting season the boxes of the\r\nBush Inn are full of horses. The club goes on without much change,\r\nMr. Masters being very regular in his attendance, undeterred by the\r\ngrandeur of his new household. And Larry is always there,--with\r\nincreased spirit, for he has dined two or three times lately at\r\nHampton Wick, having met young Hampton at the Squire\'s house at\r\nBragton. On this point Fred Botsey was for a time very jealous;--but\r\nhe found that Larry\'s popularity was not to be shaken, and now is\r\nvery keen in pushing an intimacy with the owner of Chowton Farm.\r\nPerhaps the most stirring event in the neighbourhood has been the\r\nretirement of Captain Glomax from the post of Master. When the season\r\nwas over he made an application to Lord Rufford respecting certain\r\nstable and kennel expenses, which that nobleman snubbed very bluntly.\r\nThereupon the Captain intimated to the Committee that unless some\r\nadvances were made he should go. The Committee refused, and thereupon\r\nthe captain went;--not altogether to the dissatisfaction of the\r\nfarmers, with whom an itinerant Master is seldom altogether popular.\r\nThen for a time there was great gloom in the U. R. U. What hunting\r\nman or woman does not know the gloom which comes over a hunting\r\ncounty when one Master goes before another is ready to step in his\r\nshoes? There had been a hope, a still growing hope, that Lord Rufford\r\nwould come forward at any such pinch; but since Miss Penge had come\r\nto the front that hope had altogether vanished. There was a word said\r\nat Rufford on the subject, but Miss Penge,--or Lady Rufford as she\r\nwas then,--at once put her foot on the project and extinguished it.\r\nThen, when despair was imminent, old Mr. Hampton gave way, and young\r\nHampton came forward, acknowledged on all sides as the man for the\r\nplace. A Master always does appear at last; though for a time it\r\nappears that the kingdom must come to an end because no one will\r\nconsent to sit on the throne.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most loudly triumphant man in Dillsborough was Mr.\r\nMainwaring, the parson, when he heard of the discomfiture of Senator\r\nGotobed. He could hardly restrain his joy, and confided first to\r\nDr. Nupper and then to Mr. Runciman his opinion, that of all the\r\nblackguards that had ever put their foot in Dillsborough, that vile\r\nYankee was the worst. Mr. Gotobed was no more a Yankee than was the\r\nparson himself;--but of any distinction among the citizens of the\r\nUnited States, Mr. Mainwaring knew very little.\r\n\r\nA word or two more must be said of our dear friend Larry\r\nTwentyman;--for in finishing this little story we must own that he\r\nhas in truth been our hero. He went away on his fishing expedition,\r\nand when he came back the girl of his heart had become Mrs. Morton.\r\nHunting had long been over then, but the great hunting difficulty\r\nwas in course of solution, and Larry took his part in the matter.\r\nWhen there was a suggestion as to a committee of three,--than which\r\nnothing for hunting purposes can be much worse,--there was a question\r\nwhether he should not be one of them. This nearly killed both the\r\nBotseys. The evil thing was prevented by the timely pressure put\r\non old Mr. Hampton; but the excitement did our friend Larry much\r\ngood. "Bicycle" and the other mare were at once summered with the\r\ngreatest care, and it is generally understood that young Hampton\r\nmeans to depend upon Larry very much in regard to the Rufford side\r\nof the country. Larry has bought Goarly\'s two fields, Goarly having\r\naltogether vanished from those parts, and is supposed to have\r\nDillsborough Wood altogether in his charge. He is frequently to be\r\nseen at Hoppet Hall, calling there every Saturday to take down the\r\nattorney to the Dillsborough club,--as was his habit of old; but it\r\nwould perhaps be premature to say that there are very valid grounds\r\nfor the hopes which Mrs. Masters already entertains in reference to\r\nKate. Kate is still too young and childish to justify any prediction\r\nin that quarter.\r\n\r\nWhat further need be said as to Reginald and his happy bride? Very\r\nlittle;--except that in the course of her bridal tour she did\r\ngradually find words to give him a true and accurate account of all\r\nher own feelings from the time at which he first asked her to walk\r\nwith him across the bridge over the Dill and look at the old place.\r\nThey had both passed their childish years there, but could have but\r\nlittle thought that they were destined then to love and grow old\r\ntogether. "I was longing, longing, longing to come," she said.\r\n\r\n"And why didn\'t you come?"\r\n\r\n"How little you know about girls! Of course I had to go with the one\r\nI--I--I--; well with the one I did not love down to the very soles of\r\nhis feet." And then there was the journey with the parrot. "I rather\r\nliked the bird. I don\'t know that you said very much, but I think you\r\nwould have said less if there had been no bird."\r\n\r\n"In fact I have been a fool all along."\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t a fool when you took me out through the orchard and\r\ncaught me when I jumped over the wall. Do you remember when you asked\r\nme, all of a sudden, whether I should like to be your wife? You\r\nweren\'t a fool then."\r\n\r\n"But you knew what was coming."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it. I knew it wasn\'t coming. I had quite made up my\r\nmind about that. I was as sure of it;--oh, as sure of it as I am that\r\nI\'ve got you now. And then it came;--like a great thunderclap."\r\n\r\n"A thunderclap, Mary!"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes. I wasn\'t quite sure at first. You might have been\r\nlaughing at me;--mightn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Just the kind of joke for me!"\r\n\r\n"How was I to understand it all in a moment? And you made me repeat\r\nall those words. I believed it then, or I shouldn\'t have said them.\r\nI knew that must be serious." And so she deified him, and sat at his\r\nfeet looking up into his eyes, and fooled him for a while into the\r\nmost perfect happiness that a man ever knows in this world. But she\r\nwas not altogether happy herself till she had got Larry to come to\r\nher at the house at Bragton and swear to her that he would be her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AMERICAN SENATOR***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 5118.txt or 5118.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/5/1/1/5118\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
