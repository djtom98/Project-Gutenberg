They were young, all\r\nin a happy mood; they kept step to the strokes of their canes on the\r\npavement, and swung along with vigor and elasticity, making the air\r\nthrob with their rollicking songs.\r\n\r\nParmenter was with them. His was the tenor voice that rang out with\r\nsuch strength and clearness above the others. He was the leader of his\r\nclass; in favor with the faculty, popular with his fellows, a welcome\r\nguest at any gathering.\r\n\r\nThe party passed on up the hill, through the college gate and along the\r\nterrace, still singing. They halted in front of Professor Samuel Lee\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresidence, faced toward it and began a new song:\r\n\r\n    Here\xe2\x80\x99s to Sammy Lee, drink it down, drink it down;\r\n    Here\xe2\x80\x99s to Sammy Lee, drink it down, drink it down;\r\n    Here\xe2\x80\x99s to Sammy Lee, and a right good fellow he;\r\n              Drink it down, drink it down,\r\n              Drink it down, down, down,\r\n              Balm of Gilead, Gilead;\r\n              Balm of Gilead, Gilead;\r\n              Balm of Gil-e-ad;\r\n              Way down on the Bingo farm.\r\n\r\nThe last words were hardly out of the mouths of the singers before the\r\ndoor of the house was opened, and from the square of light thus made,\r\nthe old professor himself stepped out upon the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a glorious\r\nnight for a song. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard students sing along this terrace for\r\ntwenty years and more, and I never liked their songs better than I do\r\nto-night. The music of them grows upon me always. Thank you again,\r\ngentlemen, and good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Sammy!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one irrepressible from the group,\r\nwhile all the rest responded with a hearty \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one intended to be disrespectful to Professor Lee. The use of his\r\nnickname was meant as a mark of affection, and he understood it so. But\r\nin the classroom his dignity was never trespassed upon. There were one\r\nor two good stories handed down from class to class, narrating the\r\njust fate that befell audacious students of the past who had ventured\r\nto be rude to \xe2\x80\x9cSammy.\xe2\x80\x9d These possibly apocryphal incidents made him\r\nmore popular, and in private he was the trusted friend of every student\r\nat Concord College.\r\n\r\nBesides that, he had a boy of his own--an only child, with whom he kept\r\nin close sympathy, and in whom the best and brightest of all his hopes\r\nwere centered. This boy, Charley, was a member of the Sophomore Class.\r\nHe was a bright, lovable, popular fellow, impetuous, perhaps somewhat\r\nlacking in stability, but likely to become a worthy if not a brilliant\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHe came out now upon the porch, just as his father turned to go in, and\r\nstood for a moment peering into the group on the walk as if trying to\r\nmake out the identity of the persons who composed it. He was no sooner\r\nseen by his classmates than another song broke from their lips:\r\n\r\n    Here\xe2\x80\x99s to Sammy\xe2\x80\x99s son, bring him down, bring him down:\r\n    Here\xe2\x80\x99s to Sammy\xe2\x80\x99s son, bring him down, bring him down:\r\n    Here\xe2\x80\x99s to Sammy\xe2\x80\x99s son, for he\xe2\x80\x99s always full of fun;\r\n    Bring him down, bring him down, bring him down, down, down, down.\r\n\r\nYoung Lee recognized the tenor voice in a moment. He and Parmenter were\r\nbosom friends. Their companions had long ago dubbed them Damon and\r\nPythias.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Fred!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lee, \xe2\x80\x9care you there? Hello, fellows! Is there room\r\nfor me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways room for one more,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cMove up, please! Move up\r\nnow and let the gentleman aboard! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you help him on, Freddie?\r\nHelp him on; he\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was more good-natured bantering. Then the party faced toward the\r\ncampus and started on, singing a good-night song to Professor Lee:\r\n\r\n    Good-night, Sammy! Good-night, Sammy! Good-night, Sammy!\r\n          We\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave you now.\r\n      Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along;\r\n            Merrily we roll along\r\n            O\xe2\x80\x99er the deep blue sea.\r\n\r\nThe steps sounded in unison, the heavy canes beat time, and back from\r\nthe campus, mellowed by the growing distance, came still the music of\r\nthe song:\r\n\r\n    Sweet dreams, Sammy! Sweet dreams, Sammy!\r\n        Sweet dreams, Sammy!\r\n      We\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave you now.\r\n\r\nThrough a half-open window the words came floating softly into the ears\r\nof Professor Lee, and he smiled as he thought of the real affection and\r\nseeming irreverence of the boys. Though his hair was white with years,\r\nhis heart was very youthful.\r\n\r\nHe liked young men, and sympathized with them. He entered heartily\r\ninto both their work and play. He enjoyed their fun, approved of their\r\ngames, and was the champion of athletics at Concord. But the doubtful\r\nsport of hazing he detested with his whole soul, and did not hesitate\r\nto say so.\r\n\r\nEvery one was aware of his feeling on this subject, but there were few\r\nwho knew why it was so deep. In a distant city, confined in an asylum\r\nfor the insane, Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s only brother had lived for years, an\r\nimbecile. His condition was the direct result of injuries received at\r\nthe hands of college hazers in his youth.\r\n\r\nWith this sorrow shadowing his life, it is not strange that hazing was\r\nan object of horror and hatred in Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe party of students, now headed by Parmenter and Lee, passed on\r\nacross the campus, still singing. From the shadows of North College the\r\ntall figure of a young man emerged and came toward them. In the bright\r\nmoonlight he was recognized at once as Van Loan, a man who had recently\r\nentered the Freshman class, coming from another college.\r\n\r\nHe had brought with him a reputation for mental ability and physical\r\nstrength that gave him at once a prominent position among his fellows.\r\nBut he was inordinately vain. He did not hesitate to boast of his\r\nwealth, of his aristocratic lineage, and of his superior attainments.\r\n\r\nThere is no community so thoroughly democratic as a community of\r\nstudents; and while Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s real ability met with the respect it\r\ndeserved, his vanity and arrogance made him obnoxious.\r\n\r\nTo-night he was dressed in the height of fashion. His costly clothes\r\nwere a perfect fit. But the articles of ornament and apparel which\r\nparticularly attracted the attention of the Sophomores who approached\r\nhim were his high silk hat and his heavy cane.\r\n\r\nIt was an unwritten law among the students at Concord College that\r\nFreshmen should not wear silk hats or carry canes before reaching their\r\nthird term. Any violation of this law was sure to bring on a class\r\nrush, in which the winning side secured and preserved the offensive\r\narticles of costume as trophies and emblems of their victory.\r\n\r\nYet here was a Freshman, in the midst of the second term, approaching a\r\ngroup of Sophomores with a cane in his hand and a silk hat on his head!\r\nApparently he saw danger ahead of him, for he stopped a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked some one in the group, as they came up to Van Loan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s dummy come to life,\xe2\x80\x9d replied another. Wilson was\r\nthe college tailor.\r\n\r\nVan Loan heard these uncomplimentary remarks, and his face flushed with\r\nanger. He started boldly on, turning to the right as if to pass by the\r\ngroup. But half a dozen Sophomores intercepted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you fellows mean by this impertinence?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mean,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Parmenter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Freshmen are not yet allowed\r\nto carry sticks or wear \xe2\x80\x98plugs.\xe2\x80\x99 As you came here recently, from a\r\none-horse college, perhaps you were not aware of this rule. If not, we\r\nshall be pleased to escort you to your room, where you can lay these\r\nhighly objectionable articles of apparel away, and let them grow with\r\nyour growth until it is time for you to wear them. But if you have\r\nknowingly and deliberately violated our rule, we--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business is it of yours what I carry or wear?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Van\r\nLoan, hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cStand aside and let me pass, or some one will get hurt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving declined our offer to escort you to your room,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nParmenter, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be obliged to ask you to deliver up to us\r\nat once the articles I have named.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not have them!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Van Loan, savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare any one\r\nof you to come and get them. I dare all of you to take them away! You\r\nare cowards and bullies, every one of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as the Sophomores approached him he backed out into the\r\nroad, retreating steadily until he came to the edge of a muddy pool of\r\nwater left by the melting snows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are robbers!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have you to stop a\r\ngentleman in the public road and demand his property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right that might makes,\xe2\x80\x9d came the quick reply from some one in the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nThe Sophomores were gradually encircling their victim. Van Loan glanced\r\nabout him nervously, and clutched his cane as if to make ready for\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them up peaceably, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t even disturb the part in your\r\nhair,\xe2\x80\x9d said some one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd be quick about it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cfor tempus is fast\r\nfugiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother body of students, scenting sport and trouble from afar, was\r\nrapidly approaching from the direction of South College. The circle\r\nabout Van Loan was completed and contracting. He saw that his only hope\r\nlay in holding his enemies at bay until help should arrive from his own\r\nclassmen. Yet he could not face all ways at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, here\xe2\x80\x99s the last word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robinson, who recognized the men\r\nnow bearing down on them as members of the Freshman class; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you\r\nsurrender the obnoxious articles peaceably, or won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan Loan, too, saw that assistance was at hand, and his courage\r\nincreased accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cThese things are mine, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep them, and\r\nthe first man that lays his hands on them or me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll break his--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat it was that Van Loan would have broken, no one ever knew; for\r\nParmenter, advancing quickly to his side, tripped him so suddenly and\r\ndexterously that he measured his full length in the shallow, muddy\r\npool into which he had been too dainty to step.\r\n\r\nIn the same instant Lee snatched the cane from his grasp, and Robinson\r\ncaught the silk hat as it fell.\r\n\r\nBut the victory was short-lived. Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s assailants turned\r\nwith their trophies only to find themselves face to face with and\r\noutnumbered by a party of Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s classmates, who plunged at once to\r\nthe rescue.\r\n\r\nThen the rush was on. Up from the midst of the struggling mass came\r\nthe class call of the Sophomores. It was followed at once by the class\r\ncry of the Freshmen. Soon the campus was alive with students hurrying\r\nsingly and in groups toward the scene of the conflict.\r\n\r\nFreshmen and Sophomores darted at once into the thick of the fight,\r\nwhile the Juniors and Seniors, moving about on the outskirts of the\r\nbattleground, cheered and encouraged alternately the contending\r\nfactions.\r\n\r\nVan Loan had struggled to his feet as the center of battle moved away\r\nfrom him, and looked down ruefully and in speechless anger at his\r\nsoiled and dripping garments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look very pretty, do they?\xe2\x80\x9d said a smiling Junior who stood by.\r\n\r\nThe victim of the drenching did not deign a reply. He jerked off his\r\ncoat, and began wringing the water from it. Suddenly he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWho was\r\nit, anyway? What coward threw me down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young fellow by the name of Parmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer; \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nfirst-class all-around athlete. I shall be happy to introduce you to\r\nhim at some more opportune moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan Loan did not relish the bantering tone of his informant; and\r\nmuttering something more about cowards and bullies, he turned savagely\r\non his heel, and started across the campus toward his room.\r\n\r\nBut a second thought appeared to come to him; for in the next moment\r\nhe swung himself quickly about and ran, as fast as his heavy garments\r\nwould permit him to, toward the crowd that was still struggling over\r\nhis hat and cane.\r\n\r\nHe forced his way desperately into the center of the group and through\r\nit, looking for Parmenter, his wet clothing like ice upon his body, but\r\na fire of hate raging in his heart.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s hat was in shreds; but the cane,\r\nheavy and tough, resisted all the violence brought to bear upon it,\r\nand remained unbroken. Wherever it was, there was the center of the\r\nfight. The struggling group about it moved here and there, now swiftly,\r\nnow slowly, swaying and parting, meeting and clinging, the dark mass\r\nlooking from a distance, in the moonlight, like some huge monster\r\ntwisting and writhing in pain.\r\n\r\nHats were lost and trampled upon. Coats were torn from the backs of\r\ntheir owners, clothes were rent and ruined--everywhere the campus was\r\nstrewn with the d\xc3\xa9bris of personal belongings.\r\n\r\nShifting back and forth by degrees, the surging mob finally reached a\r\npoint in the driveway near the corner of South College.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the mass being rent by some swift convulsion, Parmenter\r\ndarted from the midst and ran rapidly along the drive toward the main\r\nentrance to the building. He held Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s cane in his hand. In an\r\ninstant Van Loan was at his heels, with Lee a good third.\r\n\r\nFrom the crowd that pressed forward toward them came hoarse shouts of\r\nencouragement and wild yells of anticipated victory. The non-combatants\r\nwho stood by joined in the cheers, and hurried on after the racers.\r\n\r\nThose who watched closely saw that Parmenter, notwithstanding the\r\nswiftness of his gait, limped as if he had been hurt. They saw, too,\r\nthat Van Loan was gaining on him; and more than one person, marking\r\nthe look of desperate desire in Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s face, feared that it meant\r\nserious mischief.\r\n\r\nWhen Parmenter reached the stone pavement in front of the buildings Van\r\nLoan was near enough to grasp him, but he did not do so. He kept on\r\nuntil pursuer and pursued were side by side; then turning sharply and\r\nsuddenly, he thrust out his foot and struck Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s feet from under\r\nhim. The young man was hurled headlong to the pavement.\r\n\r\nHe fell on his side and shoulder. The blow of his fall was heard above\r\nthe storm of shouts and cheers that followed him. In an instant Van\r\nLoan had seized the cane, and flourished it for a second in heroic\r\nattitude above the prostrate body of his victim. Then finding Lee\r\nalmost within touch, he turned and ran with it into an open doorway of\r\nSouth College.\r\n\r\nBut Lee did not follow him; he stopped where Parmenter lay in the\r\nmoonlight, white-faced, limp, and unconscious, with flowing blood\r\nstaining the pavement under his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s hurt!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lee, frightened at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, and\r\nbending over him in deep anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s hurt! Maybe the brute has\r\nkilled him! Here, give us a lift; let\xe2\x80\x99s carry him in! Rob, run for\r\nDoctor Park--run!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd, suddenly quieted, pressed forward toward the point where\r\nParmenter lay. Half a dozen of his classmen had already lifted him in\r\ntheir arms, and a moment later they were carrying him, hurt, helpless,\r\nstill unconscious, across the moonlit campus to his room.\r\n\r\nBut the fight was won. Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s stroke, cruel and revengeful though\r\nit was, had placed victory in the hands of the Freshmen. Henceforth\r\nevery man in the class was entitled, by virtue of the time-honored\r\nstudent law, to wear a high hat and carry a cane whenever and wherever\r\nhe might choose to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE GAMMA QUESTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nParmenter recovered consciousness soon after he was carried to his\r\nroom, after being thrown so viciously by Van Loan; but when the college\r\nphysician came he declared that there was a fracture of the right\r\nclavicle.\r\n\r\nThere was also a deep scalp wound where Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s head had struck on\r\na sharp edge of the stone pavement, and this required stitching and\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nWhen the bathing and bandaging and plastering had been done, the\r\ninjured man was thoroughly exhausted, and weak from loss of blood. His\r\nbosom friend, Charley Lee, remained to care for him through the night.\r\n\r\nNext morning Parmenter awoke, refreshed and comfortable. By and by the\r\ndoctor came. Parmenter gave him hardly time to take off his overcoat\r\nbefore he inquired,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long will it be, doctor, before I shall have the free use of my\r\narm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, three or four weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cThese simple fractures of\r\nthe clavicle are of no great consequence. They heal up very quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s face fell. Three or four weeks! His injury might indeed\r\nhave been of no great consequence from the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, but\r\nto him it was a serious matter. It was likely to block his way to the\r\nprize stage.\r\n\r\nAt Concord College one evening of Commencement week was devoted to\r\nthe delivery of orations by Juniors and Sophomores in competition\r\nfor prizes. Six competitors were selected from each class at a trial\r\ncontest held about three months before Commencement. To be appointed\r\nto the prize stage was a marked honor, and one which Parmenter greatly\r\ncoveted. He had worked for it for months.\r\n\r\nThe trial speaking was to take place in the college chapel on the\r\nfollowing Friday; and here he was, and would be for weeks, with a\r\nbroken collar-bone, and his right arm in a sling!\r\n\r\nWhen Lee came back from breakfast, Parmenter exclaimed with a groan,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all up, Charley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all up?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lee, advancing in alarm to the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the prize stage! The doctor says I can\xe2\x80\x99t use my arm for a month,\r\nand here\xe2\x80\x99s the trial speaking coming on next Friday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lee, sinking into a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nbad business, that\xe2\x80\x99s so.\xe2\x80\x9d After a minute he added, \xe2\x80\x9cBut your voice will\r\nbe all right, Fred; you can have that as clear as a bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy voice! What good is that to me? Can I make gestures with my voice?\r\nHow can a man do anything with his arm in a sling and his shoulders\r\nbound up as if he were a mummy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter was excited. He felt that hitherto his success on the\r\nplatform had been largely due to the training he had had in what is\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cpresence\xe2\x80\x9d and his skill in gestures. That effect would now be\r\ntotally destroyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might learn to use your left arm,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Lee, as a forlorn\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! You know better than that, Charley. I\xe2\x80\x99m out, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly one redeeming feature about the whole business; and that is, that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll carry off first prize now for all the trouble I shall give you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a minute Lee was at a loss for an answer. He also was a candidate\r\nfor the prize stage. They had agreed that each was to strive to obtain\r\nthe honor to the best of his ability; but the rivalry was so friendly\r\nthat neither would have accepted an appointment at the expense of the\r\nother. At the same time, it would have been a great pleasure to either\r\nto have the other carry off the prize.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Lee said, casting his eyes down on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s bandaged\r\nshoulder and plastered head:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a cowardly thing for Van Loan to do, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Dangerous,\r\ntoo. Why, just think of it! It might have cracked your skull!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Parmenter. \xe2\x80\x9cThen there\xe2\x80\x99d have been no\r\nquestion about my being an idiot. As it is--well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve two years in\r\nwhich to get even with him. I think I can manage to make it up to him\r\nin that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a minute he added, \xe2\x80\x9cDid the Freshies carry sticks this morning,\r\nCharley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lee. \xe2\x80\x9cThey all went down town last night\r\nafter the row, and what canes they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise money enough to buy,\r\nthey begged or borrowed. They\xe2\x80\x99re tremendously proud and joyous this\r\nmorning--especially Van Loan. He thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest toad in the\r\npuddle now, sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter turned savagely toward the wall, and winced with the pain the\r\nmovement caused him; but he said nothing. After a little Lee reverted\r\nto the prize-speaking contest. He had been thinking about it all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be discouraged about that prize-speaking, Fred,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\nahead with it. Put it through. Never mind the gestures. They\xe2\x80\x99re only a\r\nuseless ornament, anyway. Why, you know--what\xe2\x80\x99s his name?--that great\r\norator, you remember; he never used gestures; disdained \xe2\x80\x99em; laid\r\nhimself out on voice and expression, you know, and swayed the hearts of\r\nmultitudes by his eloquent and thrilling--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, tell that to the marines! Here, I want to get up. Give me a lift,\r\nwill you, Charley? and help me on with my clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter had no great faith in the possibility of successful oratory\r\nwithout gestures, but Lee\xe2\x80\x99s idea struck him as worth considering, after\r\nall; and the more he thought about it, the more he was inclined toward\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe resumed the private rehearsals of his oration. He and Lee always\r\nrehearsed together, profiting by each other\xe2\x80\x99s friendly criticism; but\r\nnow Lee redoubled his efforts to make his friend\xe2\x80\x99s work perfect and\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIt was awkward to Parmenter at first to attempt to deliver his most\r\ntelling sentences with his right arm bound to his side, so instinctive\r\nhad gesturing become to him; but diligent study, persistent practice,\r\nand the judicious advice of his friendly critic helped him to overcome\r\nto a great extent that one difficulty. When on the following Friday\r\nhe took his place before the judges, it was with no small degree of\r\nconfidence in his success.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning the list containing the names of the fortunate six\r\nwas posted on the bulletin board near the chapel entrance. Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was upon it.\r\n\r\nLee caught sight of it first, and looking no further in the list,\r\nstarted at a full run across the campus to deliver the news to his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFred, it\xe2\x80\x99s there!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, bursting into Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s room like a\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s where?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Parmenter, gruffly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name--on the bulletin--prize speaking--no right arm--great\r\nvictory--whoop! Give us your hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLee made a dash for his friend\xe2\x80\x99s right hand, and in another second\r\nwould have given it a vigorous shake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hold! halt! fire! murder! Hang it, man, that\xe2\x80\x99s my cracked\r\nshoulder!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Parmenter, backing away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFred, forgive me! Did I hurt you? No? In the joyful exuberance of my\r\nemotion the swelling tide of feeling overran its bounds and came--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother the swelling tide! I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to you for the news, though.\r\nHere, take the other hand; that\xe2\x80\x99s it! I thought I could convince \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nthat a man can speak sometimes with his right arm strapped fast to his\r\nribs. You\xe2\x80\x99re sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no mistake about it, Charley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name is there! I saw it with my own eyes; these eyes that\r\notherwise had wept most bitter tears of vain regret, and poured their--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! Stop right there! Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to recover now. I\xe2\x80\x99m ready--say,\r\nCharley, look here! What about yourself? You took an appointment, too,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Your name\xe2\x80\x99s on the list, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLee stood for a moment without answering, the look of puzzled surprise\r\non his handsome face breaking into one of amusement, and ending in a\r\nbroad smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s one on me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally, as if partly ashamed of his\r\nremissness toward himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgot to look! Why, you saw my name! You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have helped seeing\r\nyours if it had been there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but--but you see I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for mine--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are the--Charley Lee, you\xe2\x80\x99re the best fellow in the\r\nworld--positively the very best!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter grasped Lee\xe2\x80\x99s hand again, and tears came into his eyes. It\r\nwas seldom he displayed so much emotion; but his friend\xe2\x80\x99s unselfishness\r\ntouched him deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s go over and see about the name of\r\nCharles Lee. It\xe2\x80\x99s high time for some one to take an interest in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up his hat, took his friend\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and they started to leave\r\nthe room; but at the threshold they met Robinson, also one of the\r\nappointees, who told them that Lee\xe2\x80\x99s name was on the list. Then there\r\nwere general rejoicings and congratulations.\r\n\r\nLee executed a breakdown very skillfully, landing finally on\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s table, from which elevation he proceeded to deliver a mock\r\noration.\r\n\r\nThe noise and confusion drew three or four other Sophomores into the\r\nroom; and when Lee had been dragged down and quieted, the conversation\r\nturned from the prize stage to Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and from\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder to Freshman Van Loan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks he won the fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the young men. \xe2\x80\x9cHe takes\r\nall the credit to himself, every bit of it. Brags about it without\r\nceasing. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch him with a ten-foot pole before the rush;\r\nthe Atlantic cable wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach to him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome fellow told him the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d added another member of the\r\ngroup, \xe2\x80\x9cthat unless he stopped his everlasting boasting, the Gamma\r\nQuesters might do him the honor to call on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Robinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid he\xe2\x80\x99d be pleased to see \xe2\x80\x99em. Said he\xe2\x80\x99d make it interesting for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. Said they\xe2\x80\x99d better have a surgeon in readiness to wait on \xe2\x80\x99em when\r\nhe got through with \xe2\x80\x99em. Said he should particularly enjoy meeting his\r\nfriend Parmenter under such auspices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s dead set against you, Parmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d cried another. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforgiven nor forgotten that mud-bath yet. He says the collar-bone\r\nbusiness was only part payment, and that the remaining installments\r\nwill be fully as delightful as the first one was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a minute no one spoke. Robinson was looking around the room,\r\nscanning intently each man\xe2\x80\x99s face. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any one here who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in hazing under proper\r\ncircumstances will he have the goodness to retire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one stirred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Parmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Robinson, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to drive you\r\nfrom your room; we will go elsewhere if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter did not at once reply. He rose, went to the door and locked\r\nit, closed the ventilator over the door, and returned and sat down.\r\nThen he said, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on with the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat took place behind that closed and locked door none but the seven\r\nwho were there, and the seven who were afterward taken into the\r\ncompany, ever knew.\r\n\r\nThe time was when the raids of the Gamma Questers, as hazing parties\r\nwere called at Concord College, were of frequent occurrence. But under\r\nthe severely repressive policy of the faculty, aided by a growing\r\nfeeling among upper classmen against the barbarous and unmanly custom,\r\nthe practice had nearly died out. There were scarcely a dozen men in\r\nthe college who remembered the last instance of it.\r\n\r\nYet there is no doubt that a chapter of the Gamma Questers was\r\norganized that day in Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s room; neither is there any doubt that\r\nit selected Freshman Van Loan as an unwilling candidate for admission\r\nand initiation.\r\n\r\nUnder the excitement and impulse of the moment Lee was the readiest to\r\nadvocate this form of retribution, and the most fertile in devising\r\nplans to carry it out. But a few days later he came to Parmenter with a\r\ncloud on his face and a burden on his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about that Van Loan business,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half sorry\r\nI agreed to go into it. You know how strongly father is set against\r\neverything of this sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you propose to let your father know you\xe2\x80\x99re in it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Parmenter,\r\nhalf in sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no; but he might find it out afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no necessity for his doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99d about half as soon he knew it, as to feel guilty\r\nevery time he looked at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, do as you choose, of course. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d better go out.\r\nBut if you do, Henderson will back out, and Brace, and the whole thing\r\nwill fizzle out before it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly begun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to spoil the plans of the boys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lee,\r\nhesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see what objection there is,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Parmenter, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ngiving such a fellow as Van Loan a little piece of humble-pie to eat.\r\nHis insufferable conduct has passed all bounds, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other\r\neffective way of letting him know it. We don\xe2\x80\x99t propose to hurt him\r\nphysically, you understand, and the fellow can\xe2\x80\x99t be hurt mentally. But\r\nwe can humiliate him, and he deserves it. You can get out of it if you\r\nwant to; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the fun, and I think after it\xe2\x80\x99s over you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwish you\xe2\x80\x99d gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLee was silent for a minute, turning the matter over in his unstable\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, finally, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll go after all. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he did go. Against his better judgment and truer instinct\r\nhe yielded to the logic of his friend and the force of his own\r\ninclination, and joined the party.\r\n\r\nA few nights later Van Loan was waked at midnight by a movement at his\r\nbedside. He opened his eyes to see indistinct figures standing about\r\nhim. He knew in an instant what it all meant; but before he could raise\r\nhis head from the pillow his hands were gripped and held, and his mouth\r\nclosed with a bandage so that he could not call.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of desperate but unavailing struggling on his part;\r\nthen, realizing the uselessness of his attempt, he quietly submitted to\r\nthe will of his captors.\r\n\r\nThey took him from his bed, dressed him, blindfolded him, bound his\r\nwrists together, and led him down stairs and out-of-doors. It was\r\nall done so quickly and noiselessly that the slumbers of men in the\r\nadjoining rooms were not disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe victim was hurried across the rear campus and into the protecting\r\ndarkness of the college grove. Here torches were lighted, and in single\r\nfile the party marched through the woods, across the corner of an open\r\nfield, and then into the thicker forest beyond.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half a mile they came to a shallow cave in the face of\r\na ledge of rocks. A brawling brook ran by it, and overarching trees\r\nhelped shut it in. Here they halted, and made preparations for what was\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments the victim\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and mouth were unbandaged. It was\r\na grotesque sight that he looked upon. The masks and costumes of the\r\nhazers were both ludicrous and hideous. Their huge mock weapons were\r\nswung menacingly.\r\n\r\nThey arranged themselves in a semicircle about the candidate. At their\r\nbacks were the mysterious shadows of the cave.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Inquisitor stepped forward, flourishing a mighty\r\nbroadsword--of wood. His voice was deep and hollow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore we proceed to the graver and more intense portion of the\r\ninitiation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe candidate is requested to reply to certain\r\nquestions, which, being satisfactorily answered, will entitle him to\r\npose for the first degree. The first question is: Do you admire our\r\npersonal appearance? And the answer is: \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 The candidate will\r\nplease say \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Van Loan, without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your fond and earnest desire to be initiated into the grand and\r\nillustrious order of Gamma Questers, without which honor you feel that\r\nlife is not worth living? The answer is \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 Say \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Van Loan, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you desire any part of the initiation ceremonies to be omitted,\r\nhowever painful, disagreeable, or surprising they may prove to be? The\r\nanswer is, \xe2\x80\x98No, I do not.\xe2\x80\x99 Say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan Loan said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you acknowledge yourself to be wholly unfit and unworthy to enter\r\ninto fraternal relations with brethren so exalted as ourselves, and do\r\nyou humbly implore us to overlook your thousand faults and follies, and\r\nto receive you into fellowship? The answer is, \xe2\x80\x98I do.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I do,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Loan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally, will you always strive to uphold the dignity and further the\r\naims of our most noble order, to endeavor, so much as in your feeble\r\nintellect lies, to induce the president and members of the faculty of\r\nConcord College to become members hereof, and forgetting your unworthy,\r\ndishonorable, and utterly idiotic past, press on to the coveted goal\r\nthat awaits all true Gamma Questers? The answer is: \xe2\x80\x98I will.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I will,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d was the final response.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost Grand and Worthy Scribe, are the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s answers duly\r\nrecorded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are,\xe2\x80\x9d came the reply in hollow tones from a black-robed figure at\r\nthe extremity of the cave. He sat under a torchlight, his black mask\r\nhideously splashed with red, an immense volume spread open before him,\r\nand in his hand a huge long-handled pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen advance and give the candidate sign A, of rite number one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe person in the black robe arose, laid down his pen, and advanced to\r\nwithin five feet of the victim.\r\n\r\nVan Loan stood quietly looking on, his face pale with anger and\r\nexcitement, and under his eyes dark rings indicative of suppressed\r\npassion. Yet, burning as he was with rage, he was still calm enough to\r\nnote with deep interest the apparent inflexibility of the right arm and\r\nshoulder of the person who approached him.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Scribe lifted his robe slightly, preparatory to some mock\r\nceremony of initiation; but whatever his intention was, he never\r\ncarried it out. In that instant, Van Loan, who had deftly slipped his\r\nhand from the bandage that bound his wrists, reached out and tore the\r\nmask completely from the face of the black-robed hazer.\r\n\r\nIt was done in a second; and there, under the glare of the torchlight,\r\nstood Parmenter, fully, distinctly revealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much,\xe2\x80\x9d was Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s quiet comment; \xe2\x80\x9cnow go on with the\r\nceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that it was useless for him to contend against so many, he\r\nhad decided from the first to obey implicitly the will of the hazers\r\nwhile in their power, mentally reserving to himself liberty to violate\r\nat pleasure any promise or agreement he might make under such hard\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE FACULTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor an instant after Van Loan had uncovered Parmenter no one stirred.\r\nThe act had been so sudden and unexpected that it startled them all.\r\nThen a half-dozen men pounced upon Van Loan, bound his wrists, and\r\nbandaged his eyes again.\r\n\r\nHe was thoroughly helpless now, but the mischief had been done.\r\nParmenter, at least, was in Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s power. The Freshman had seen his\r\nface, and could prove that he was engaged in an act for which he could\r\nbe expelled from the college.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators retired to deliberate. The question what was to be\r\ndone was a serious one. Bessick, one of the rash ones, whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hang him up by the thumbs until he promises that he will never\r\nreveal anything of what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would never do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robinson. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything but\r\nthreaten. I think he can be scared into keeping still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr bought off,\xe2\x80\x9d said another of the hazers. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, bribery is\r\nthe only thing for a man with a character as mean as his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were valid objections to all those methods, and to every other\r\nplan that could be conceived; but that the conspirators could not go on\r\nwith the hazing was plain. The life and fun had dropped suddenly and\r\ndisastrously out of that, and the danger to at least one of them was\r\ntoo great to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nParmenter again approached Van Loan, his face still uncovered. The\r\nothers followed to listen. Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s face was pale, but wore not the\r\nsmallest look of fright, and he spoke quietly but very firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have found out who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand to a certain extent you\r\nhave me in your power; but there are some things that depend on the\r\nuse you make of the knowledge you have obtained here to-night. If you\r\ncan assure us that you will keep it sacredly to yourself, I think you\r\ncan trust us, and each of us, to place no obstacle in your way through\r\ncollege, nor harm you in any way whatever. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to hint to\r\nyou what may happen if you betray us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter paused, and Van Loan replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know what you mean. I propose to keep the knowledge I have\r\nobtained here to-night sacredly to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you solemnly promise me, and each of us, that you will never reveal\r\nmy identity, nor disclose to anybody at any time anything of what has\r\nhappened here to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make you that solemn promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan Loan\xe2\x80\x99s voice certainly had in it the ring of sincerity. His\r\ncaptors could ask no more of him than he had promised. The agreement\r\nwas definite, and both parties thoroughly understood the situation.\r\n\r\nThen they took Van Loan back to the college. He was still bound,\r\nbandaged, and blindfolded. They led him down the forest path, across\r\nthe fields, and through the college grove, and loosening his hands,\r\nthey left him in the middle of the campus.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had freed himself, and could look around, not one of\r\nthe hazers was in sight; and before he reached his bed the men who had\r\ndragged him from it less than an hour before were locked safely in\r\ntheir rooms.\r\n\r\nThe next day Parmenter and Van Loan met each other face to face on the\r\nwalk between the colleges. There was a nod of recognition on the part\r\nof each, but no word was spoken. The same thing occurred the next day\r\nand the next.\r\n\r\nIt leaked out after a time, as such things will, that some sort of\r\nhazing had been done, and that Van Loan was the victim of it; but who\r\nthe hazers were no one except those who had participated in the affair\r\nappeared to know.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the rumor could not be traced to Van Loan; there was\r\nnothing to indicate that he was not keeping his promise.\r\n\r\nAs the days went by, and the situation remained unchanged, Parmenter\r\nbegan to feel relieved. The dread of discovery and consequent\r\npunishment was rapidly disappearing from his mind; but he was troubled\r\nabout Lee.\r\n\r\nCharley had sobered much since the night of the hazing. It is true he\r\nworked harder; but he went about his tasks with an anxious face, and\r\nhis laugh had lost much of the old-time, merry ring.\r\n\r\nHe told Parmenter one day that it was a constant trial to him to face\r\nhis father, who had heard with the utmost chagrin and sorrow that the\r\nhazing had occurred, and who spoke bitterly of it, but who evidently\r\ndid not suspect that his son had been one of the offenders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel guilty every time he looks at me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, \xe2\x80\x9cyet I know\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that I was in it. Why, he\xe2\x80\x99d as soon think I\xe2\x80\x99d hang\r\na man as haze him. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s hurting me, you see. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get over\r\nit. Fred, I\xe2\x80\x99d give up every college prize and honor I ever hope to get,\r\nand do it gladly, if I could blot out my part of that miserable night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter threw back his head impatiently. He felt, whether justly or\r\nnot, that he was responsible for Lee\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the hazing, and\r\nthe young man\xe2\x80\x99s passionate words of regret cut him deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there was any law obliging\r\nyou to take part in it. You joined us voluntarily, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. But after I\xe2\x80\x99d helped start the thing, and after what\r\nyou said about my backing out, you see I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t very well--Fred,\r\nforgive me! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how that was going to sound. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\nblame you, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not to blame, but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go right on!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Parmenter, coolly, his face a little\r\npale and his lips drawn; \xe2\x80\x9cgo right on! I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\ndanger, anyway, and I might as well shoulder the whole burden and\r\nhave done with it. I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly willing that all blame of any kind\r\nconnected with the affair shall be laid on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLee protested earnestly that he had no feeling against Parmenter in the\r\nmatter, and could not have any. A truce was patched up between them,\r\nbut their relations afterward were not quite the same.\r\n\r\nEach felt a certain restraint while in the other\xe2\x80\x99s presence,--a\r\nrestraint that might have worn away in time, but which now had only the\r\neffect of pushing them farther and farther apart.\r\n\r\nParmenter applied himself with renewed energy to the work of the term,\r\nand especially to the task of perfecting himself in his Sophomore\r\noration.\r\n\r\nHe was passionately fond of oratory. Often, sitting or walking alone,\r\nhe imagined himself on the prize stage in the midst of his triumph.\r\n\r\nBefore him in these visions stretched the long aisles of the crowded\r\nchurch, the pews bright with the evening costumes of the ladies, the\r\nair heavy with the fragrance of many flowers. All eyes were upon him.\r\nEvery ear was attentive to catch the sounding sentences that fell from\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\nThe rustle and stir that passed through the audience at some telling\r\npoint in his oration swept up pleasantly to his senses; the involuntary\r\nburst of applause at some brilliant climax rolled like a wave of\r\ndelight into his soul; and when, finally, he bowed and retired, there\r\nwere the marked and ribboned bouquets falling in sweet showers on the\r\nstage to attest his popularity; there was the long roll of applause\r\nrising and dying and rising again, only to be drowned at last in the\r\nmusic of the orchestra.\r\n\r\nOh, it was a splendid scene, a knightly test, a thrilling triumph! To\r\nanticipate it, to see it all in imagination as he did, left Parmenter\r\nin an exalted state for hours.\r\n\r\nBut his days were far from being happy. The anxious face of Charley Lee\r\nhaunted him wherever he went. The old love for his friend was still\r\nstrong enough in his heart to awaken sincere pity.\r\n\r\nHe tried a dozen times to bridge over the awkward restraint that\r\nseparated them; and although Charley was always anxious to assist him,\r\nsomehow the effort never succeeded. Though neither young man knew it,\r\nsuccess lay only in a radical change of the conditions that surrounded\r\nthem. Since they had been partners in transgression, they must needs be\r\npartners in expiation before they could hope to count upon a complete\r\nrenewal of their old relations.\r\n\r\nLee\xe2\x80\x99s apparent mental uneasiness became the source of deep annoyance to\r\nParmenter at last. Still feeling himself to be the cause of it, still\r\nunable to banish it, it irritated him to such an extent that he avoided\r\nhis old friend\xe2\x80\x99s society lest he should, by open reproof or sharp\r\nrebuke, cut the last tie of friendship.\r\n\r\nSo day after day the two drifted apart, and by and by a new factor\r\nentered into the problem of their estrangement.\r\n\r\nIt was whispered about that Professor Lee had opposed Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nselection for the prize stage. No one could tell how the information\r\ngot abroad, nor could any one at first state the ground of the\r\nprofessor\xe2\x80\x99s opposition. Later, however, it was said to be because\r\nParmenter had his arm in a sling and could make no gestures.\r\n\r\nBut some one who pretended to know said that Professor Lee did not so\r\nmuch object to the fact of Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s disability as to the cause of it.\r\n\r\nThe professor was reported to have declared before the committee that\r\nParmenter was the leader in the moonlight rush; that it was a vulgar\r\nexhibition of brute force and savagery, and would lower the moral tone\r\nof the college for a year; that hazing and rushing were the twin relics\r\nof college barbarism; and that since the first had been so effectually\r\nabolished, it was high time for the committee to show their disapproval\r\nof the other. He knew of no better opportunity to do so than the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nParmenter could not learn where these reports had originated. It was\r\nsuggested that one of the tutors had revealed the secrets of the\r\ncommittee-room to an upper classman, and that the matter had come out\r\nin that way. The story had every appearance of verity, and caused\r\nParmenter no little anxiety and unpleasant thought.\r\n\r\nYet he said nothing to Charley Lee about it, nor did Charley mention\r\nthe subject to him. Indeed, they saw very little of each other these\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nBessick came in one evening for a chat with Parmenter. Bessick was one\r\nof the disappointed candidates for the prize stage. The conversation\r\nturned on Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s position and opposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he said just what has been\r\nreported.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should he select me as a target?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Parmenter. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery man\r\nof the six was in that rush, Charley Lee included.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I heard the matter discussed yesterday--now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying this\r\nto prejudice the professor, you know, nor Charley, nor anybody; and\r\nbesides it may not be true. I hope it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But I heard it talked that\r\nthe thing was fixed to get you out of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know Lee is the only man in the class who is able to compete\r\nwith you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? The prize lies between you and him--there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndoubt about that, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Suppose there isn\xe2\x80\x99t; what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, with you out of the way Charley\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to get it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe? And Sammy Lee would crawl across the campus on his hands and knees\r\nto have his boy take that honor, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he? You know that, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\nAnd Charley--well, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t see through a door when it\xe2\x80\x99s open, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter protested earnestly that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think Sammy Lee would\r\nenter into such a plot, and he was sure Charley wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; and Bessick,\r\ndeclaring that he had no personal feeling in the matter, and that he\r\nwas simply repeating what he had heard, took his leave.\r\n\r\nBut the seed he had dropped fell into soil ready to receive it. The\r\nmore Parmenter thought about it and pondered over it, the more he began\r\nto believe that Bessick\xe2\x80\x99s theory had some foundation.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance after another, developing during the few days that\r\nfollowed Bessick\xe2\x80\x99s visit, tended to increase his distrust of Professor\r\nLee and his suspicion of Charley. Whispering tongues were at work,\r\nadding one bit of gossip after another to his stock of alleged\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nFinally it was rumored in his hearing that Professor Lee was at work\r\nunearthing Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s part in the hazing of Van Loan, and that he\r\nwould soon be called before the faculty on that account.\r\n\r\nWithin ten minutes after this rumor reached Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s ears Mr.\r\nDelavan, one of the tutors, knocked at his door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Parmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said courteously, \xe2\x80\x9cthe president desires to see you\r\nat his study.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Parmenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come right over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTutor Delavan bowed and disappeared; and Parmenter, feeling a sudden\r\nweakness in his knees, resumed his chair for a few minutes before\r\nanswering the summons.\r\n\r\nAt last, he thought, the blow was about to fall. Sammy Lee had\r\nprocured his evidence! Either Van Loan had turned traitor, or Charley\r\nhad--confessed, or some one of the remaining twelve had broken his\r\npledge. In whatever way it had come about, he felt sure that it was\r\nthe result of a systematic attempt on Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s part to deprive\r\nhim of his standing and disgrace him; and his bitterness increased\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s breast was still heaving with anger and apprehension as he\r\nentered the president\xe2\x80\x99s study, and faced the members of the faculty who\r\nwere gathered there.\r\n\r\nPresident Mather, large, portly, dignified, sat at the head of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you at once why we have sent for you, Mr. Parmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are informed that you participated in a hazing affair on the\r\nnight of the twelfth of April. We do not, of course, intend to condemn\r\nyou unheard. What have you to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter waited a moment before replying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is my accuser?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA member of the faculty has preferred the charge,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask which member of the faculty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfessor Lee arose from his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made the charge, Mr. Parmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cupon information derived\r\nfrom a student at this college.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what student?\xe2\x80\x9d again inquired Parmenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at liberty to give you his name,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nThe accused man turned again to the president.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI demand the right to meet my accuser face to face,\xe2\x80\x9d he said stoutly,\r\ndetermined to find out, if possible, who had betrayed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we cannot grant you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the president, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil we\r\nknow whether or not you deny the charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Parmenter hesitated. He had no thought of denying the charge;\r\nbut he thought he was justified in endeavoring to learn how much the\r\nfaculty knew about the matter, and from what source the information had\r\nbeen derived. After a moment he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHazing is a very indefinite term. Of what specifications does the\r\ncharge against me consist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of the members of the faculty moved uneasily in their chairs,\r\nimpatient at what they considered pure evasion. But Professor Lee rose\r\nagain and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer the question. The charge is that you, with certain other\r\npersons whose names are at present unknown to us, entered the room of\r\nFreshman Benjamin E. Van Loan on the night of the twelfth of April\r\nlast, masked and disguised; that you took Van Loan forcibly from his\r\nbed, bound, blindfolded and gagged him, and compelled him to accompany\r\nyou to a lonely place in the woods, half a mile from the college,\r\nwhere, with cruel persistence and fiendish ingenuity, you maltreated\r\nhis person and insulted his manhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfessor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s voice had grown stronger as he talked, his manner had\r\nbecome deeply earnest, and his face showed marks of great excitement.\r\nHe paused for a moment, as if to grasp some final thought. Then he went\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish to say in your presence, sir, and in the presence of the\r\npresident and members of the faculty, that in my judgment, no breach of\r\ndiscipline that has occurred here in years will so hurt us, and hinder\r\nus, and sap our moral strength, as this revival of one of the most\r\ncruel, brutal, and unmanly customs I have ever known. I do not hesitate\r\nto say, sir, that if you are guilty of the crime charged against you,\r\nthere is no punishment that we, as a faculty, have the power to impose\r\non you that will be too severe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one had ever before seen Professor Lee aroused to such an extent.\r\nAs he resumed his seat his face was glowing, his eyes were flashing,\r\nhis under lip was trembling with excitement and indignation.\r\n\r\nAs for Parmenter, every word that came from the professor\xe2\x80\x99s lips fell\r\nupon him like a blow. Never in his life before had any one dared to use\r\nsuch language to him. It kindled in his breast a perfect fire of rage\r\nand resentment.\r\n\r\nHot words came boiling to his lips. He had it wildly in mind to fling\r\ninto the face of this gray-haired accuser the fact that his own son was\r\nno less guilty than he who stood there under accusation, and fully as\r\ndeserving as he of those bitter, cruel, and seemingly vindictive words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI regret,\xe2\x80\x9d he began slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have denounced me with such\r\nforce and bitterness, since your condemnation falls equally as\r\nheavily--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter stopped suddenly. A spark of manhood shot up from his breast\r\nat the supreme moment, and closed his lips. Whatever the provocation\r\nmight be he would not stoop to such meanness as that.\r\n\r\nFor one moment he stood, with white face and clenched hands, stemming,\r\nwith powerful effort, the tide of speech that had threatened to break\r\ndisastrously from his lips. Then he turned slowly to the president.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not deny the charge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything to say in extenuation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not keep you longer before us. We thank you for your prompt\r\nattendance. Good-morning, Mr. Parmenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith much dignity President Mather bowed the young man out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE QUARREL OF FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nParmenter, fresh from his extorted confession of hazing, went back\r\nacross the campus with his mind in a tumult. Half a dozen students\r\nspoke to him on the way, but he did not answer them. He could see\r\nnothing but Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s white, strong face; he could hear nothing\r\nbut his terrible words of condemnation.\r\n\r\nWhat right had this man to denounce him as brutal and unmanly? Would he\r\nhave dared to do so if he had known how deeply his own son was involved\r\nin the mischief? It was plain that Charley had not told his father of\r\nthe hazing. Van Loan must then have broken faith.\r\n\r\nBut for the time all of Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s anger was centered, not on Van\r\nLoan, who had betrayed him, but on Professor Lee, who had denounced him.\r\n\r\nEvery moment some new recollection of the scene in President Mather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy added fuel to the flame of his resentment. His indignation was\r\nso great that it had not yet even occurred to him what punishment he\r\nshould receive for his offense, or whether he should receive any.\r\n\r\nHe went up the section stairs blinded with passion, ready to strike\r\nout savagely at anything and everything that pertained in any way to\r\nProfessor Lee.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered his room he found Charley Lee seated at his table.\r\nCertainly no meeting could have been more opportune for trouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Charley said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just heard\r\nthat absurd story about father\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to your appointment to the\r\nprize stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter went in and sat down. It was apparent that Charley did not\r\nknow what had just happened, and Parmenter was not quite ready to tell\r\nhim. He replied with forced coolness: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nlittle late in gathering news, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Lee. \xe2\x80\x9cI might have known of it days\r\nago if I\xe2\x80\x99d been bright enough to take the hints I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, and catch the\r\nmeaning of the remarks I\xe2\x80\x99ve overheard. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of such a\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Well, what do you think of it, now that you have heard\r\nabout it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter was exasperatingly cool in manner and tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, \xe2\x80\x9cit has taken me so\r\nby surprise. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it has any foundation in fact or\r\nnot. At any rate, any suggestion that father could have had any other\r\nobject in view than to sustain his well-known opposition to physical\r\nviolence of course you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe. Surely he has nothing against you\r\npersonally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? Perhaps not; but can you explain to me why it was, then, that he\r\nchose me as the subject of his criticism and opposition? It occurs to\r\nme, for instance, that you were about as active in the rush as anyone,\r\nbut I have not heard that any objections were raised to your going on\r\nthe prize stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLee\xe2\x80\x99s face turned red and then pale. Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s speech cut deeply, but\r\nhe kept his temper. After a moment he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think father intends to be unfair to anyone, nor partial to\r\nanyone, especially to me. And I repeat that he has nothing against you\r\npersonally. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him speak of you in the highest terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Parmenter, deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9chave heard him speak of me\r\nin the lowest terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFred, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I say. Within half an hour he has charged me with being\r\nbrutal and criminal to the last degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be some mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Lee, \xe2\x80\x9csome\r\nmisunderstanding--certainly he--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at all,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Parmenter, rising from his chair and walking\r\nthe floor savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did it knowingly, deliberately, cruelly, in the\r\npresence of the entire faculty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA light dawned suddenly upon Lee\xe2\x80\x99s mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it about the hazing?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course about the hazing. He had nothing else to bully me for. It\r\nwas his last chance to put me down and clear the way for others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fire that had been smoldering in Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s breast was beginning\r\nto break out uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nLee\xe2\x80\x99s face turned pale again. He was making an effort to hold himself\r\nin check.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be unjust, Fred,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that opposition to\r\nhazing is father\xe2\x80\x99s hobby, if he has one, and you should make allowance\r\nfor what he says in his excitement. But if you mean to insinuate that\r\nfather is trying to push me up at your expense, I want you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to insinuate nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Parmenter, hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cI say\r\nplainly that there seems to be a powerful effort in some quarters to\r\nmake me the scapegoat for the sins of the whole class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFred, you are beside yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be strange if I were. But what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the truth.\r\nWho else was criticised and harassed for taking part in the rush?\r\nTell me of another man! Who else is summoned before the faculty for\r\nhazing Van Loan, and browbeaten, abused, and insulted? Are you, for\r\ninstance? Tell me! Had you less to do with that affair than I? Yet you\r\ncan walk around in an atmosphere of innocence and honor, unharmed and\r\nunsuspected, while I, poor fool, must play the part of sacrificial\r\nlamb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s face was white with passion. He strode up and down the\r\nfloor like a madman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFred, be careful!\xe2\x80\x9d Lee\xe2\x80\x99s voice had a ring of danger in it now. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Van\r\nLoan has betrayed you, do not charge it up to me and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was Van Loan, was it? I had my doubts whether I was indebted to\r\nVan Loan or you for that disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was cruel; besides, it was false, and Parmenter knew it; but his\r\nrage was running away with his conscience and his tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that back, Fred!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lee. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it\xe2\x80\x99s not true, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take nothing back!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Parmenter, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me?\r\nNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are a coward and an ingrate, and I shall not stay to quarrel\r\nwith you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall not attempt to detain you. Good-morning, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment Lee was gone, and the friendship that had grown close\r\nand sweet between these young men through two years of college life had\r\nbecome a shattered and pitiful wreck.\r\n\r\nCharley went down the section stairs and out on the campus, dazed and\r\nshocked. It was the cruellest blow his life had ever known. He would\r\nnever have dreamed that Parmenter could say such things to him, or he\r\nsuch things to Parmenter.\r\n\r\nHe passed on across the campus with such a burden of sorrow and anger\r\non his mind that he took no note where his steps were tending. He\r\nlooked up finally, and found himself in front of President Mather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor. By some connection of ideas a new thought flashed into his mind.\r\nHe stopped to consider it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not? It is right; it is just; there\r\nis no reason why one should suffer and not both. I will do it, and do\r\nit now, while I have the strength, and then he cannot taunt me with\r\ngoing free while he suffers alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharley walked rapidly up the steps and across the hall, and knocked\r\nat the president\xe2\x80\x99s door. He was bidden to enter. The members of the\r\nfaculty were still in the room, discussing Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s case. They\r\nlooked up at Lee in curiosity and surprise. He advanced toward the\r\npresident and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Mather, I desire to say that I took part in the hazing of\r\nFreshman Van Loan in April.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe professors and tutors stared at him in open-eyed astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did, Mr. Lee?\xe2\x80\x9d said the president interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whatever punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Charley, \xe2\x80\x9canyone else receives for\r\nthat offense, I should receive the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president leaned forward in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thank you, Mr. Lee,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor coming to us with this voluntary statement. Is there\r\nanything else you wish to say about the matter--any explanation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing--except,\xe2\x80\x9d turning for a moment toward his father, who sat\r\ndumb with amazement and grief, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that I am very sorry, indeed,\r\nespecially on father\xe2\x80\x99s account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen his lips trembled, his eyes filled with tears; he turned to leave\r\nthe room, and would have stumbled and fallen had not Tutor Delavan\r\ntaken him kindly by the arm and led him away.\r\n\r\nIt soon became known among the students that Parmenter and Lee had been\r\nbefore the faculty in connection with the Van Loan case. The matter\r\nwas discussed freely at the dinner tables, on the campus, and in the\r\nsections; and opinions were many and varied as to the form and severity\r\nof the punishment that would be meted out to the offenders.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as Parmenter sat alone in his room, Tutor Delavan came in\r\nwith a letter for him. He delivered it with a few courteous words, and\r\nretired as quietly as he had come. Parmenter opened the letter and read\r\nit. It ran as follows:\r\n\r\n                                       \xe2\x80\x9cCONCORD COLLEGE, May 5th.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMR. ALFRED B. PARMENTER:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_Dear Sir_,--The president and members of the faculty have\r\n    taken into consideration your acknowledged connection with the\r\n    hazing of Benjamin E. Van Loan on the night of April 12th. We\r\n    greatly deprecate so serious a breach of college discipline.\r\n    We desire to be as lenient with you as possible; but it is\r\n    our duty and wish to banish this class of offenses from the\r\n    college by any and every means in our power.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe judgment of the faculty is that your name be stricken from\r\n    the list of competitors for the Sophomore prize of the present\r\n    year; and that the competition for honors and prizes in your\r\n    Junior year be likewise closed to you. It is accordingly so\r\n    ordered, and of this order you will please take notice.\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cYours with regret,\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x9cSYDENHAM E. MATHER, _President_.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_Attest_: R. E. HAGERMAN, _Secretary_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter laid the letter on his table, and stared from his window\r\nacross the fields, the city, and the distant river to the far-off\r\nwestern hills. They were simply a dark, uneven band against a sky from\r\nwhich the deepening twilight had brushed the last vestige of rose.\r\n\r\nThe punishment was severe enough in all conscience. He could lay away\r\nthe manuscript of his oration now, or burn it up as he chose; he would\r\nnever need it. He would indeed need nothing of the kind for two years.\r\n\r\nTwo years of punishment and disgrace for an hour of silly revenge and\r\ndoubtful fun! To be cut off from the prize stage with the highest honor\r\nalmost within his grasp; it was hard, it was terrible!\r\n\r\nHe had expected his mother and sister on at Commencement, to share in\r\nhis success. He would have to write to them now that they need not\r\ncome. Worse than that, he would have to tell them the reason why.\r\n\r\nThere were others, too, people in the city, who knew of his hopes and\r\nambitions in oratory. He did not see how he could meet them now, or\r\nspeak to them on the subject.\r\n\r\nAnother man would take his place on the stage. For some one else there\r\nwould be the golden opportunity, the exhilaration of oratory, the\r\nadmiration of the crowd, the ribboned bouquets, the rolling applause,\r\nthe splendid triumph.\r\n\r\nStill he sat looking out upon the western sky. One star was glowing in\r\nthe clear expanse. Below the horizon there was nothing but darkness,\r\npricked here and there by the lights of far-off electric lamps.\r\n\r\nAt home there was a western porch where he had often sat with his\r\nmother and sister to watch just such an evening scene as this. His lips\r\nbegan to quiver, and his eyes to fill with tears. He turned back into\r\nthe room, laid his head down on his bed, and gave way, for the first\r\ntime in years, to a prolonged fit of weeping.\r\n\r\nBut Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s flood of tears had not the effect to clear his mental\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke on the following morning his heart was as hard and bitter\r\ntoward Professor Lee as before; this feeling, strangely enough, still\r\novershadowing his resentment against Van Loan.\r\n\r\nAs for Charley, Parmenter felt that it was all over between them now.\r\nThe quarrel of the day before had settled that; and while, in his own\r\nmind, he knew that he had provoked it, yet Charley had said some\r\nthings in his anger which he could not forget.\r\n\r\nAfter the blow had fallen, Parmenter had not cared to leave his room\r\nuntil night, nor to converse with anybody; and he had not yet heard of\r\nLee\xe2\x80\x99s confession.\r\n\r\nComing back up the hill from a late breakfast that morning, and turning\r\nthe corner of South College to go into the chapel, he saw a crowd of\r\nstudents at the bulletin-board reading and discussing some notice\r\nposted thereon.\r\n\r\nHe did not need to be told what it was. Instead of going to chapel to\r\nbe gazed at and commented on, he decided to pass directly to his room.\r\nWhen he was nearly across the campus he met Robinson hurrying over to\r\nchapel exercises.\r\n\r\nThe bell was already tolling the final strokes, but Robinson stopped to\r\nspeak to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if Parmenter already knew all about it, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and\r\nCharley are cut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Parmenter in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he cut for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, for the Van Loan business, you know--same as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who gave him away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard? He went in before the faculty yesterday, after they\r\ngot through with you, and accused himself--made a clean breast of it,\r\nvoluntarily. What do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter did not reply. He was too deeply moved to speak. Robinson\r\nwent hurriedly on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Bessick and Ogdenburg are put on in your places. The rest of us\r\nare trembling in our shoes, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why we need to; you and\r\nCharley won\xe2\x80\x99t give us away, and Van Loan can\xe2\x80\x99t. Say, Fred! is there any\r\ndoubt but what Van Loan broke his promise? Everybody thinks so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Parmenter,\r\nimpatiently. Robinson rattled on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear he denies it; but there was no other way for it to get out,\r\nand he\xe2\x80\x99s such an all-round liar you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe him. Say, Fred, when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re sure of it just let us know; and if that Freshman don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer\r\nfor his perfidy, then--Oh, excuse me! There\xe2\x80\x99s the last bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobinson, who was an expert runner, shot across the campus, and entered\r\nthe chapel on the heels of the last group of attendants.\r\n\r\nParmenter passed on wearily to his room. And so Charley had\r\nconfessed--and had been cut! Parmenter wondered what motive had\r\nprompted the confession. Was it weakness or bravery?\r\n\r\nWell, there was some satisfaction in knowing that he himself was not\r\nthe only one to suffer. He did not know that he had much sympathy to\r\nwaste on Charley, after all. He was sure he had none for Charley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nHe picked up a book and tried to study; but he read the pages over and\r\nover again without remembering a word that was printed on them. Deep\r\nin his breast a voice kept saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Charley! poor Charley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt aggravated him. He threw the book aside, put on his hat, and started\r\nfor the city. At the college gate he came suddenly upon Lee, who was\r\nwalking up alone. His hands were deep in his pockets, his gait was\r\nslow, his gaze was on the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked up, Parmenter noticed that his face was pale and\r\nhaggard, and his eyes were bloodshot.\r\n\r\nCharley\xe2\x80\x99s appearance indicated that he had passed a sleepless night.\r\nHe stopped, when he saw Parmenter, and seemed about to speak; but in\r\na moment he changed his mind, for when Parmenter stopped in his turn,\r\nready to reply to any friendly word, Lee passed on without a nod or\r\nsmile, or any kindly look.\r\n\r\nAfter that, whenever the two young men met, in the class-room, on the\r\ncampus, or the street, they had for each other nothing beyond the\r\nmerest look of indifference, the merest nod of recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA COWARDLY REVENGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say whether Parmenter or Charley Lee suffered more from\r\ntheir estrangement, and impossible to declare which felt more keenly\r\nthe disgrace of his punishment.\r\n\r\nCertainly Lee\xe2\x80\x99s appearance indicated the greater grief, but people said\r\nthat was because he was at home. There he had every day to meet the\r\nsympathetic kindness of his mother, which was worse than any reproach\r\ncould be; and there he had every day to see in his father\xe2\x80\x99s face the\r\npained look which spoke more eloquently than words.\r\n\r\nCharley had not the firmness nor the mental and moral strength of\r\nParmenter. He was kinder, more impulsive, more unselfish; but he\r\ndepended more on circumstances to keep him at his best.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of disgrace that had now fallen on him he grew\r\ndespondent, even despairing. With the old companionship suddenly lost\r\nhe became unspeakably lonely. He found it impossible to rise from\r\nbeneath the burdens that had fallen on him.\r\n\r\nAll the gentle home influence, all the friendly sympathy and\r\nassistance of those who had been his companions in the better days,\r\nand who still loved him none the less for the shadows that rested on\r\nhim--all these things were wholly unavailing. He weakened, wavered, and\r\nbroke.\r\n\r\nHe neglected his studies, avoided the class-room on every pretext,\r\nlost his frank and cheery manner, fell back mentally and morally with\r\nstartling rapidity. By and by it began to be whispered about that he\r\nwas becoming addicted to intoxicating drinks.\r\n\r\nOne man had seen him drinking at a city bar. Another had met him late\r\nat night, going home with thick tongue and unsteady step. No pains\r\nwere spared to turn him back; but father, mother, and friends labored,\r\nimplored, and suffered in vain.\r\n\r\nThere was but one person in the world who, at this crisis, could have\r\narrested young Lee\xe2\x80\x99s course and brought him back to safety. That person\r\nwas Parmenter--Parmenter as he had been in the old days, strong in\r\nfriendship, forceful in will, undaunted by disaster.\r\n\r\nHe, by merely stretching out his hand, could have turned Charley Lee\r\nback toward manhood.\r\n\r\nBut no one thought of that. The gulf between the two young men had\r\ngrown too wide. Besides, Parmenter was demoralized as well as Lee; he\r\nhad not fallen in the same way, but certainly he had fallen.\r\n\r\nHe, too, was neglectful of his studies and remiss in his college\r\nduties. He avoided the companionship of his fellows and sank, day by\r\nday, into a state of listless self-sufficiency from which all the\r\nefforts of his friends failed to rouse him. Whispering tongues were\r\nagain at work, bringing to his ears tales of remarks, and declarations\r\nmade by Professor Lee and his wife, charging Parmenter with being the\r\ncause of their son\xe2\x80\x99s downfall.\r\n\r\nThe young man bitterly resented these imputations, and assumed at once\r\nthat Professor Lee had uttered them.\r\n\r\nWhat right had they to charge him with their son\xe2\x80\x99s waywardness,\r\nwhen he had not even spoken to the fellow for more than a month?\r\nHe could explain the story only on one hypothesis--Charley, in his\r\nweakness, must have complained of him. But poor Charley! he was hardly\r\nresponsible now for what he did.\r\n\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s anger and resentment toward his former friend had almost\r\nvanished, but the bitterness in his heart toward Professor Lee showed\r\nno abatement.\r\n\r\nHe had not yet given the word for Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s punishment, although his\r\nold comrades had frequently expressed a wish to \xe2\x80\x9cget even\xe2\x80\x9d with that\r\ntale-bearer and breaker of promises. Not that there was much doubt of\r\nVan Loan\xe2\x80\x99s perfidy, and not but that Parmenter thoroughly despised him.\r\n\r\nBut Parmenter was too heartily sick of the whole business to reopen\r\nold scores, and too listless and despondent to start new troubles.\r\nNevertheless, Van Loan was meeting with his reward. It was well\r\nunderstood among the students that his speedy release from the hands of\r\nthe hazers was due to his promise not to betray Parmenter--a promise\r\nwhich, it was believed, he had deliberately violated.\r\n\r\nHis class would have no more of his leadership. His companions fell\r\naway from him. He could no longer find attentive listeners to his\r\nboastful tales.\r\n\r\nHe still kept at the head with his studies; but being much alone,\r\nhe grew downcast and sullen. The humiliations to which he had been\r\nsubjected on the night of the hazing were too deep for him ever to\r\nforgive or forget.\r\n\r\nHis hatred for Parmenter showed little abatement; and when, by chance,\r\nit became known to him that Lee was the one who had asked him the\r\ninsulting questions with their forced answers on that miserable night,\r\nhis feeling toward Charley was scarcely less bitter.\r\n\r\nVan Loan exulted in the punishment of the two young men; he gloried\r\nin their downfall. But his resentment was not satisfied by their\r\nhumiliation and disgrace. He waited for some new opportunity to gratify\r\nhis mean thirst for revenge.\r\n\r\nSo far as Charley was concerned, that opportunity came to Van Loan one\r\nday in a most unexpected manner.\r\n\r\nHe went into a beer saloon in the city, a place to which some of the\r\nmore weak and reckless of the students occasionally resorted. Half a\r\ndozen men were in the room; and among them, leaning against the bar, an\r\nobject of entertainment to them, was some poor fellow in an advanced\r\nstate of inebriety. It needed but the second glance to tell Van Loan\r\nthat the drunken man was Charley Lee.\r\n\r\nLee discovered Van Loan at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Vanly!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, m\xe2\x80\x99 dear boy, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you\r\nsince--since--say, Billy,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to the saloon-keeper, who stood\r\nbehind the bar, \xe2\x80\x9cgive this man a drink; anything \xe2\x80\x99e wants; he\xe2\x80\x99s frien\xe2\x80\x99\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had already staggered forward and embraced Van Loan effusively.\r\nSome strange turn of his drunken fancy had presented the man to his\r\ndisordered mind as his bosom friend.\r\n\r\nFor the moment Van Loan was at a loss what to do or say. Then there\r\nshot suddenly into his mind a scheme for revenge as daring as it was\r\ndastardly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9clead this drunken fellow through the\r\nstreets of the city and up College Hill to his home, in broad daylight,\r\na spectacle for all men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan Loan turned the thought over in his mind as if it were incomparably\r\nsweet. He waited but a moment to perfect his plan. Then he turned\r\nquietly to Lee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Charley,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s go home and sober up; they\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nlooking for you, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe saloon-keeper came out from behind the bar and called Van Loan\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he a friend of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Van Loan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better let him go up-stairs and sleep this thing off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; \xe2\x80\x9che wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get over it till morning, and his\r\nfather and mother would be worried about him. No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for a close carriage for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t. He can walk well enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gracious! Look here! you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to show that young man up on\r\nthe street like that, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVan Loan turned on the man savagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s none of your business what I want to do!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\npart of the programme was ended when you got him drunk. Now you mind\r\nyour affairs, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll mind mine. Come, Charley, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to Lee, took his arm, and led him toward the door. The maudlin\r\nyoung fellow waved his free hand broadly to the group at the bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cBy, Billy! Come an\xe2\x80\x99 see us. Father\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99lighted to see you any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe saloon-keeper shrugged his shoulders suggestively, and made motions\r\nas if to wash his hands, as once did Pilate of old.\r\n\r\nVan Loan struck the screen door open, and the two young men passed out\r\ninto the street. It was no easy task to guide Lee\xe2\x80\x99s wavering footsteps.\r\nHis weight rested heavily on Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s arm; and at frequent intervals\r\nhe insisted on stopping and facing his companion, in order to give\r\ngreater emphasis to some expression of his drunken fancy.\r\n\r\nThey met many people. Some of them, who knew both young men, looked\r\naskance at them as they approached, and then passed on with knowing\r\nlooks and scornful smiles.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Centre and Concord Streets they came upon Miss Darcy,\r\na charming girl to whom Lee had taken a strong fancy. She stopped\r\nsuddenly, staring at the pair in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he ill, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse than that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Van Loan, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better pass on,\r\nMiss Darcy; his society is not agreeable to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew what the man meant, and turned away in sorrow and humiliation.\r\n\r\nPoor Lee, on seeing her, had attempted to lift his hat, but had pushed\r\nit from his head instead, and it had rolled into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99cuse me, Miss Darcy,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered; \xe2\x80\x9csomew\xe2\x80\x99at tired to-day. My\r\nfrien\xe2\x80\x99, Mr. Vanly, he--I--\xe2\x80\x9d But Miss Darcy was already out of hearing.\r\n\r\nVan Loan braced his charge against a tree, and went to recover the hat.\r\nStreet-boys came up, and began to poke fun at the unfortunate fellow,\r\nfollowing him with jeers as he moved on.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up Concord Street the pair met President Mather, driving down\r\nwith some ladies of his family. Lee discovered them, waved his hand\r\ngrandly toward the carriage, and called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ello, Prexy! Beau\xe2\x80\x99ful day, ladies! Comp\xe2\x80\x99ments of season to you all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president reined in his team, observed Charley an instant, and\r\ndrove on.\r\n\r\nThey met a dozen people from College Hill, acquaintances of both men,\r\nladies and gentlemen, who stopped for a moment to make sure that it was\r\na case of inebriety and not of illness, and then passed on in pained\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nA party of students came down, curious and sympathetic, making offers\r\nof help. Van Loan declared that he wanted no assistance, and declined\r\ntheir offers with scant courtesy. He was having his revenge; it was\r\ndeep and sweet indeed; but he began to feel that he should be glad when\r\nhe got his burdensome charge inside the door of his home.\r\n\r\nAt the college gate Parmenter met them. At the first glance he did not\r\nrecognize Lee. When he looked at him again he was shocked at the change\r\nin his appearance. Van Loan would have passed on with his victim, but\r\nParmenter stopped them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you find him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Billy\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you bring him from there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the streets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn foot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s blood was boiling with indignation. In his righteous wrath\r\nhe forgot that Charley was not his friend as of old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do that devil\xe2\x80\x99s deed?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo show the public what a beast the fellow is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Van Loan,\r\nfiercely; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m taking him to his father for the same reason. Get\r\nout of my way and let us pass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter was at a white heat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet go of him!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lay a finger on him! I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him\r\nhome. You\xe2\x80\x99ve about killed him already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charley was leaning against a gatepost, staring stupidly from\r\none to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the drunken fool, and welcome!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Van Loan, turning away in\r\na passion. The words were hardly out of his mouth before Parmenter\r\nshouted, \xe2\x80\x9cPut up your hands, you brute. Defend yourself if you can. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to thrash you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--you!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Van Loan, striking a pugilistic attitude.\r\n\r\nBut he was no match for Parmenter, whose fist shot out next moment,\r\nstruck Van Loan squarely on the jaw, and sent him sprawling in the dust\r\nof the road.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Tutor Delavan came up. He knew intuitively what it all\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Parmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s get Charley into the house as\r\nquickly as possible. You support him on that side, I will on this. If\r\never a man was justified in knocking another down, you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey straightened the drunken man up, and started with him along the\r\ncollege walk toward his father\xe2\x80\x99s residence, not stopping to answer the\r\nquestions nor satisfy the curiosity of those whom they met.\r\n\r\nPoor Lee had fallen suddenly into a sort of stupor. His face grew\r\npallid and his eyes glassy. His chin dropped. He no longer tried to\r\nspeak, and his feet dragged so heavily that he had almost to be carried.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the quarrel, pity and dread came into\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s breast. Never in all his life had he looked upon a\r\nspectacle so pitiable and so revolting.\r\n\r\nThe two men dragged their helpless burden up the steps of Professor\r\nLee\xe2\x80\x99s residence, but before they could ring the bell the professor\r\nhimself was at the door. The next moment they were all in the hall, the\r\nstreet-door was closed, the limp and insensible form of the young man\r\nwas laid carefully on the settee, and Delavan had hurried off to find\r\nthe college physician.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lee pushed the hair back tenderly from his boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and\r\nforehead, then he turned sharply to Parmenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you lead him into this also?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, huskily.\r\n\r\nThe tone, the implication, roused the tiger again in Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not,\xe2\x80\x9d was the swift reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI never drank with him in my life,\r\nnor ever suggested such a thing. I do not wonder, though, that you lay\r\nthis crowning disgrace of your son\xe2\x80\x99s at my door, since you have been\r\npleased, without cause, to charge to my account every fault and folly\r\nof which he has been guilty for the last six months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfessor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s face was white with emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Parmenter!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is no time nor place for\r\nquarrels or explanations. Let me say to you simply that I do not need\r\nyour presence here. You may go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter backed slowly down the hall, awed and subdued by the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquiet anger. He did not speak again. He cast one glance at the poor,\r\nunconscious figure on the hall settee; then he turned and left the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHe went to his room and picked up a book, but could not read. He went\r\ndown to his supper, but could not eat. He tossed about in his bed all\r\nnight, but he could not sleep.\r\n\r\nHe had unburdened his mind to Professor Lee, indeed--a thing he had\r\nbeen longing to do for weeks. But it brought him no relief. On the\r\ncontrary, deeply angered as he was at the professor, a flush of shame\r\ncrept into his face whenever he thought of the time and place he had\r\nchosen for his protest.\r\n\r\nHis mind became gloomier and his thoughts more desperate every day.\r\nHe scarcely opened a book to study from it. His brain was dull and\r\nunsteady, and he could think of little else than his own miserable\r\ncondition and his unhappy relations with the Lees.\r\n\r\nHe felt that Professor Lee had wronged him beyond forbearance, beyond\r\nendurance, beyond any hope of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nAs for Charley, his case was different. He was weak, boyish, impulsive,\r\ninfluenced by his father; but it might well be that time would heal the\r\ndifferences between him and Charley.\r\n\r\nThis was Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s daily, his hourly thought and hope; it was sweeter\r\nin his mind than had ever been his visions of oratorical success. For\r\nhe had not been able, in all the stormy days that had passed, to drive\r\nfrom his heart the last spark of affection for the dearest friend his\r\nyoung manhood had known.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when that friend\xe2\x80\x99s disgrace and humiliation were deepest, the\r\nspark began to take on new life, to kindle, to glow, to send light and\r\nheat through his whole mental and moral system.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was due in part to his memory of that prostrate figure on\r\nthe sofa in the hall. It was a picture that he could not forget,--the\r\nrelaxed muscles, the pallid face, the disordered hair, the glassy,\r\nhalf-closed eyes, the wreck and ruin of young manhood stretched\r\nprostrate in his father\xe2\x80\x99s hall.\r\n\r\nIt was pitiable, it was dreadful--the sight of death would have been\r\nless terrible.\r\n\r\nDay and night this image was before Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Go where he would\r\nhe could not escape it. It followed him relentlessly. It hung about him\r\nas persistently and ceaselessly as his own shadow. It blotted out all\r\nthought of anger or revenge toward Charley Lee; it brought with it only\r\npatience, pity, a desire to help, and a great longing to be reconciled.\r\n\r\nBefore he quite knew it himself, Parmenter was sighing for the old\r\ncompanionship, looking forward impatiently to the days when, with the\r\nkindly help of each other, they would both be themselves again; waiting\r\nwith feverish anxiety for an opportunity to get back on the old fair\r\nfooting with Charley Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nALMOST A TRAGEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharley Lee had not been seen in public since the day when his\r\nintoxication had been so terribly exposed by Van Loan. Some of the\r\nstudents said that he was ashamed to show himself; others that his\r\nfather was keeping him prisoner. But after a little while the truth\r\ncame out, and all the college knew that he was ill, and could not go\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe reaction from his fit of inebriety had been a severe shock to a\r\nsystem not especially strong, and the disgrace which had fallen on him\r\npreyed sharply on his mind. He suffered a kind of nervous prostration,\r\nfollowed by a low fever, and his strength gave way rapidly.\r\n\r\nParmenter was stricken with grief and remorse. His old friend\xe2\x80\x99s illness\r\nswept away the last vestige of his resentment. In all that had passed\r\nbetween them, Parmenter came to recognize no unfriendly acts but his\r\nown, no unkind words save those which he himself had spoken.\r\n\r\nHe kept himself informed of Charley\xe2\x80\x99s condition through his friends;\r\nand at last, finding that the sick man was not likely to be able to\r\nleave his room until after Commencement, he sat down one day and wrote\r\nhim this letter:\r\n\r\n                                                \xe2\x80\x9cFRIDAY AFTERNOON.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDEAR CHARLEY,--I feel that I have been a brute, and I want to\r\n    apologize. I also have some beggarly excuses for my conduct\r\n    which I would like to tell to you personally, if I may call and\r\n    see you. May I come, and when?--Fraternally, PARMENTER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dispatched this message by the janitor\xe2\x80\x99s boy, and paced the floor\r\nof his room in a fever of anxiety until the answer came. When the boy\r\nreturned with the letter, he snatched it from his grasp, and tore\r\nopen the envelope as a starving man would break a crust of bread. The\r\nmessage ran:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDEAR FRED,--Never mind the excuses or the apology. If you say\r\n    it\xe2\x80\x99s all right I\xe2\x80\x99m satisfied. Only come and see me and let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    get back on the old footing. Come to-morrow morning, say about\r\n    ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I feel a little more chipper mornings.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou have my everlasting gratitude for making the first\r\n    advance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I could have brought myself to it\r\n    or not. On second thought come at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock--don\xe2\x80\x99t wait till\r\n    ten. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fail me, old boy.--LEE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter sat down on the bed, and cried like a child. Then he jumped\r\nup and wiped the tears away, and laughed, and read the letter again,\r\nand many times again. No pleasure that his life had ever before known\r\nhad thrilled him as did these simple, tremulously written words.\r\n\r\nHe went to the window, and looked out upon the sweet June landscape.\r\nWhat a glorious day it was! He seized his hat and left the room singing:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is so rare as a day in June?\r\n       Then, if ever, come perfect days;\r\n     Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,\r\n       And over it softly her warm ear lays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went down the stairs two steps at a time. Some students in the lower\r\nhall, hearing his cheery voice and seeing his radiant face, so wondered\r\nat the transformation that they turned and followed him.\r\n\r\nOut on the campus was a crowd of Sophomores getting up a game of\r\nfoot-ball. Parmenter went over, and begged to be allowed to play with\r\nthem, and they gladly gave him his old place in the team.\r\n\r\nAnd how he did play! What tremendous runs he made!--though he had moped\r\nso long that he was not in his usual condition. How he shouted and\r\nlaughed at each brilliant point in the game, and shook hands all round\r\nwhen his team came out victorious!\r\n\r\nEvery one wondered and rejoiced at his changed manner, and said that\r\nfor some unexplainable reason \xe2\x80\x9cRichard was himself again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening Parmenter sat with a group of students on the terrace,\r\nand sang college songs for an hour in the good old fashion; and when\r\nhe went to bed he slept with such refreshing sweetness as he had not\r\nknown before for many weeks.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he arose early. It was Saturday, and there were no\r\nrecitations nor examinations. The work of the term was finished, and\r\nthe next week was to be given up to the pleasures of Commencement.\r\nParmenter started out for a walk before breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe morning was exceptionally beautiful, even for June. He crossed the\r\ncampus and struck into the woods, drinking in the dewy perfumes as he\r\nwent, feasting his eyes on sylvan sights, listening, with rapt ears,\r\nto the music of the singing birds. He thought he had never in his life\r\nbefore seen a morning so thoroughly charming as this.\r\n\r\nAt one time he found himself in the path leading to the ledge where\r\nthey had taken Van Loan that miserable night in April. He turned aside\r\nat once, and struck off in another direction. He did not care to\r\nrevisit the scene of that night\xe2\x80\x99s folly. The shadow of this incident\r\nwas the only one that fell upon his spirits during all that long and\r\nbeautiful morning walk.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the college grounds he started across the campus on\r\nhis way to breakfast, refreshed, vigorous, hopeful, with the sunshine\r\nof a brighter day than he had known for months already flooding his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIn front of the chapel a group of young men stood in earnest\r\nconversation; at the corner of South College a half-dozen more were\r\ntalking to each other in subdued voices. The expressions on their\r\nfaces indicated that something had gone wrong.\r\n\r\nParmenter did not stop to inquire what it was. Somehow he did not dare\r\nto. He pushed on, with a sudden sinking of heart, until he came in\r\nfront of Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and glanced up at the house uneasily. People seemed to be\r\nmoving about hurriedly in the upper rooms. The hall door opened as he\r\nstood there; and Mr. Delavan, the tutor, came out and down the steps.\r\nParmenter approached him and asked hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Charley about the same as yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tutor looked at him wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cof his changed condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Parmenter, huskily, backing up against a tree for\r\nsupport. \xe2\x80\x9cHow changed--worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, much worse. An intense fever, accompanied by delirium, set in\r\nlast evening and rapidly exhausted him. He lies now in a state of coma,\r\nwith symptoms of heart failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill--will he die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s lips were white, his knees were trembling, his voice was\r\nscarcely audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have little hope of saving his life. The end may come at any\r\nmoment. Here, take my arm. The news has unnerved you. I am going your\r\nway; I will walk with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter went to his room, but he could not stay there. In ten\r\nminutes he was out on the campus asking for the latest news from\r\nCharley. He sat on the terrace wall in a place where he could watch\r\nthe Lee house. As often as the door opened he caught his breath in the\r\ndread that some one would bring out news of Charley\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nBut Charley still lived. The spark of life in his body paled and glowed\r\nalternately, and as the day wore on, hope revived.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Parmenter caught sight of Doctor Park, hurrying\r\nalong in front of South College. He ran and overtook him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Charley?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. He is alive; we\r\nare making every effort to keep him alive. That is all I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe night came on, but Parmenter did not sleep. Many times in the\r\ndarkness he crept down the section stairs, across the campus, and over\r\nto the house where Charley lay. There were lights in the windows. He\r\ncould see people moving about in the rooms, and twice some one came out\r\nof whom he could make inquiries.\r\n\r\nJust before dawn he stood in the shadow of the great elm by the side of\r\nProfessor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s gate, waiting to see or hear some one or something from\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nThe hall door opened, and the professor himself came out. With his\r\nhands behind him, and his face turned toward the stars, he came down\r\nto the gate, and out on the walk, passing under the gas-lamp within\r\nfive feet of Parmenter, and continuing along the terrace to the college\r\ngate. There he turned, came back the same way, and re\xc3\xabntered his house.\r\n\r\nThat face, as Parmenter saw it under the lamplight, coming and going,\r\nstruck him to the heart. Never before in his life had he seen such woe\r\nand hope expressed in a single countenance. Never before had he seen\r\nthe intense desire of a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart strained through his face like this.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that this was the man whom he had charged with unjust\r\nmotives, with double dealing, with conduct entirely at variance with\r\nthe whole tenor of his good and gracious life? And what foundation was\r\nthere for the charge?\r\n\r\nAs he stood there, Parmenter went over in swift review the reasons for\r\nhis hatred of Professor Lee. He stripped them of their fallacies, of\r\ntheir sophistries, of their baseless judgments, till they stood naked\r\nand shrinking before him; and then for the first time he realized how\r\nutterly unworthy he had been to criticise the motives or denounce the\r\nconduct of such a man.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his room under the dawn-flushed sky, more wise and more\r\nhumble than he had ever been before.\r\n\r\nAll through the quiet Sunday Charley lay, gaining a little hour by\r\nhour, and when night came again they said that now he had a fair chance\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nEarly on Monday morning the word went round that there would be a\r\ncollege meeting in the North College Hall, and it was whispered that\r\nVan Loan\xe2\x80\x99s case would be taken up and disposed of. The feeling against\r\nhim on account of his heartless exposure of Lee had become intensified\r\nwith Charley\xe2\x80\x99s critical illness; and now that the strain of suspense\r\nwas somewhat relieved, it sought to find vent.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was large beyond precedent. Davis, the honor man of the\r\nSenior class, was made chairman; and White, a Freshman, arose and\r\noffered the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Whereas_: Benjamin E. Van Loan, a member of the Freshman class, was,\r\non the afternoon of the seventeenth day of the present month, guilty of\r\nan offense unbecoming a student of Concord College, unmanly and inhuman\r\nin the extreme, and\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Whereas_: For his said offense and certain abusive language connected\r\ntherewith Sophomore Alfred B. Parmenter promptly knocked him down,\r\ntherefore be it\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Resolved_: That the hearty thanks of the students at Concord College\r\nare due to the said Parmenter for his just and timely blow, and be it\r\nfurther\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Resolved_: That while the students do not desire to usurp the powers\r\nof the faculty, they wish to express it as their undivided opinion\r\nthat the interests of all persons will be better served if the said\r\nBenjamin E. Van Loan shall sever his connection with Concord College at\r\nthe end of the present college year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were carried with a rush. Not a dissenting voice was\r\nheard. A committee of three was appointed to present them to Van Loan.\r\n\r\nWhen, an hour later, this committee went to Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s room, he was not\r\nthere. The room was in disorder, as if he had made ready for a hasty\r\nflight. The committee on presentation of resolutions has never yet been\r\nable to report its duty fulfilled, for the reason that Van Loan has\r\nnever since been seen at Concord College.\r\n\r\nDuring the day it was said that, with the greatest care and the most\r\ncomplete rest and quiet, Charley might recover. Thereupon Charley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclassmates formed themselves into squads, and took turns in patrolling\r\nthe grounds about the Lee house.\r\n\r\nThey allowed no one to walk on the stone pavements in that vicinity.\r\nThey kept away all noise and intrusion. They themselves went about\r\ntheir duties on tiptoe and spoke in whispers. Nothing was left undone\r\nby any one on the hill to help forward the chances of Charley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecovery. The Seniors gave up their class ball on his account, and the\r\nJuniors their \xe2\x80\x9ccremation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo bells were rung, no terrace songs were sung; the quiet of a\r\npeaceful Sunday reigned for days between South College and the gate.\r\n\r\nOn Commencement Day the announcement was made from the stage that the\r\ndanger line in Charley\xe2\x80\x99s case had been passed, and only the unexpected\r\nwould now prevent his recovery.\r\n\r\nA great cheer went up from the vast audience; for Lee, in spite of his\r\nlast few months of ill behavior, was still the best-loved fellow on the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nThis was on Wednesday. On Thursday Parmenter started for his home,\r\nthree hundred miles away. He had seen neither Charley nor Professor\r\nLee; it was not possible to do so. But he was content now to bide his\r\ntime for explanation, for confession, for reconciliation.\r\n\r\nMr. Delavan had told him on the day of his departure of some things\r\nthat gave him a clearer insight into Van Loan\xe2\x80\x99s perfidy, and into\r\nProfessor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s simple honesty of character; and in the days of sober\r\nthought that followed he felt more and more how unworthy had been his\r\nself-made charges and suspicions, how unjustifiable and unmanly had\r\nbeen his treatment of Professor Lee.\r\n\r\nIn August a rumor reached Parmenter that the Lees were going to Europe\r\nfor a long vacation. Both Charley\xe2\x80\x99s health and his father\xe2\x80\x99s demanded\r\nthe change, and Mrs. Lee was to go with them. Parmenter was aroused by\r\nthe news into sudden activity.\r\n\r\nHe had looked forward to the opening of the term in September as the\r\ntime when he should go to the man whom he had wronged, arraign himself,\r\nplead guilty, and ask to be forgiven. He could not postpone that\r\nduty for a year, perhaps for two years longer; he felt that he could\r\nnot bear the burden of his shame for all that time, nor rest in the\r\nuncertainty of only a possible reconciliation.\r\n\r\nHe _must_ see Professor Lee and Charley before they sailed.\r\n\r\nHe threw a few things into a satchel, and took the next train for the\r\nEast. He traveled a night and a day, and the next afternoon he found\r\nhimself hurrying up Concord Street to College Hill.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was no time to lose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll gone away to New York this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant at Professor\r\nLee\xe2\x80\x99s house, when Parmenter rang the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve started for Europe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter was almost speechless with dismay; but he had enough presence\r\nof mind to ascertain that they were not to sail until the next morning,\r\nand that they were to go on the steamship _City of Paris_.\r\n\r\nAway he went to the railroad station, just in time to swing himself\r\nupon the train for New York. At Albany he went into a sleeping-car, but\r\ndid not have his berth made up. He knew he could not sleep. His whole\r\nbeing had turned toward the accomplishment of one object--to find the\r\ntwo men he had so deeply wronged, and beg their forgiveness.\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the train rolled into the Grand Central\r\nStation in New York City. Parmenter rushed out hotly and hailed a cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive me to the Inman pier!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the cabman. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste a\r\nsecond. There\xe2\x80\x99s money in it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vehicle rattled swiftly over rough places and smooth. Parmenter\r\nfretted nervously within.\r\n\r\nAt last the cab pulled up at the entrance to a pier. Parmenter leaped\r\nout, handed the cabman a sum of money that surprised and delighted him,\r\nand plunged at once into the shadows of the long buildings. He hurried\r\ndown, between rows of bales and boxes, toward the landing-place.\r\n\r\nSome people were coming leisurely up; a family group stood not far\r\naway, the persons in it weeping quietly; the edge of the pier was lined\r\nwith men and women, and at the farther corner of it were many who were\r\nwaving handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nAn officer with a gold band around his cap stood looking out upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the _City of Paris_?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Parmenter of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer, pointing to a majestic steamer in\r\nmidstream, gay with flying colors, and heading down the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she gone?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Parmenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if she had,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer, smiling.\r\n\r\nIn sudden weakness and despair Parmenter staggered to an empty truck,\r\nsat down on it, and buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE WELCOME HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nParmenter went back from New York to his home, and spent a night\r\nwriting a letter to Professor Lee, which was to reach him at Paris.\r\nWhen it was finished the young man read it over, and threw it from him\r\nin disgust. It sounded tame, formal, insincere. He felt that such a\r\nletter would fail of its mission.\r\n\r\nHe tore it up and wrote another, but with no better success. He tried\r\nto write to Charley, but his heart and courage gave out in doing that.\r\nHe knew that such desperate illnesses as Charley\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes washed the\r\nsoul clear and the mind free of everything that had stained and clogged\r\nit. Charley might no longer feel any need for his friendship.\r\n\r\nParmenter perceived at last that such an offense as his could be\r\nexplained, and apologized for only in person. Written lines were wholly\r\ninadequate. It needed the voice, the eyes, the spirit breathing through\r\nthe words, to make them effective. He knew now that his confession and\r\nhis plea must await Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nNow and then he heard indirectly from the travelers. They had been in\r\nBerlin, in Vienna, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Copenhagen. The next winter\r\nthey wrote from Florence, and afterward they journeyed through the Holy\r\nLand. Charley was gaining every day in health and strength; still they\r\nwere not ready to return.\r\n\r\nParmenter waited with all patience and in all hope. He devoted himself\r\nto his studies; he worked at his college tasks with the strength and\r\nearnestness of an enthusiast. He regained his former position in the\r\nclass. His old, cordial manner came back to him. He was once more a\r\nfavorite and leader among his fellow-students.\r\n\r\nThe experiences, the follies, the remorse, the suffering, of that\r\nsecond college year had turned the channel of his life and thought, and\r\nhe stood on the threshold of a broad, earnest, and sincere manhood.\r\n\r\nTwo years went by, and Commencement was at hand again. Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclass was to graduate, and Parmenter himself was to have the\r\nvaledictory. All deemed it certain that he would carry off the lion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshare of the honors of Commencement Day.\r\n\r\nThere was no better speaker in the class than he, and the first prize\r\nin oratory was sure to fall to him. There was no quicker and more\r\nlogical thinker in debate. The big Dobell prize was conceded to him in\r\nadvance. So far as the essays were concerned, no one hoped to surpass\r\nhim. In class standing it had long been known that he was first.\r\n\r\nCommencement Day was sure to be a great day, and a succession of\r\ntriumphs, for Parmenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing that will give any of the rest of us a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Robinson to him, banteringly; \xe2\x80\x9cand that is for you to get into a\r\ncane rush and break your collar-bone again; and if you could manage\r\nalso to fracture two or three ribs while you\xe2\x80\x99re about it, you would\r\nconfer a lasting debt of gratitude on your disconsolate classmates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another thing, too, that was going to happen. \xe2\x80\x9cSammy Lee\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas coming home. He and his wife and Charley had already set sail for\r\nAmerica. They would reach New York on Tuesday of Commencement week, and\r\nbe at home on Wednesday morning for the Commencement exercises.\r\n\r\nA private letter from Professor Lee had communicated the news, joyful\r\nto all his friends at the college, that Charley would return fully\r\nrestored to health and strength, wholly free from his old weaknesses,\r\nready to take up his work where he had left it off, and earnest in his\r\ndesire to reach up to the measure of sterling manhood.\r\n\r\nA small party went down to New York from the college on Monday night to\r\nmeet the Lees when they should land, and escort them home. Parmenter\r\nwas among the number. When his friend Robinson heard that he was\r\ngoing, he said to him with great earnestness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Fred, you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy! You can\xe2\x80\x99t get back here till Tuesday at\r\nmidnight, at the very best; and how can you expect to go on the stage\r\nWednesday morning all broken up with the journey, and be any credit\r\nto yourself or your friends? For your own sake, and the sake of your\r\nclass, you ought not to do it. With all due deference to Sammy Lee, I\r\nrepeat that you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobinson paced the floor in a high state of indignation, forgetting,\r\nin his unselfish zeal for his friend\xe2\x80\x99s success, that he was himself a\r\ncompetitor for the same honors.\r\n\r\nParmenter smiled a little, and said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fret, Rob. I want\r\nto see the professor and Charley when they land; but I shall be back\r\nhere all right on Wednesday morning, and all ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Parmenter went to New York. Some of Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic\r\nadmirers among the alumni there had chartered an excursion steamer to\r\ngo down the bay, meet the incoming ocean vessel, take the professor and\r\nhis family off at quarantine, and give them such a welcome home as they\r\nwould not soon forget.\r\n\r\nInvitations were sent to all the old Concord boys and their families to\r\naccompany the party, and quick messages were to notify them to hasten\r\nto the pier of the excursion boat as soon as the incoming vessel should\r\nbe sighted.\r\n\r\nBut Tuesday morning went by and no call came. Noon passed, and the\r\nsteamer had not yet been heard from. The party of undergraduates and\r\nalumni that had gathered at the office on the pier dwindled slowly as\r\nthe afternoon slipped by, until at last only Parmenter and Delavan were\r\nleft. Delavan had stepped from the place of tutor up to a professor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair; he filled it most worthily.\r\n\r\nHe pulled out his watch, glanced at it, and turned to Parmenter in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, man!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of? You have barely\r\ntime to get to the Grand Central Station before the last train goes\r\nout. Come, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the station with you, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t go up to-night.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not needed at the college, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for Professor Lee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had started to his feet and was moving toward the door. Parmenter\r\nsat still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going up to-night, either,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly.\r\n\r\nDelavan turned back in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow morning is Commencement!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re on the Commencement stage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know. I shall not be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young professor came back into the room and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParmenter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does this mean? Surely you are not going\r\nto let the honors of Commencement Day slip by you in order to\r\nmeet Professor Lee and Charley as they land? I know something of\r\nwhat has happened between you, and what you hope for in the way of\r\nreconciliation, and let me assure you that this action is certainly\r\nuncalled for. Pardon me, my dear boy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s foolish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Parmenter awoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, professor!\xe2\x80\x9d he said warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbeen waiting for this meeting for two years. I have thought of it\r\nnight and day. The hope that it may not be wholly fruitless has kept\r\nme from disgrace and despair. Do you suppose that a petty prize or the\r\ngratification of a selfish ambition would be enough to send me running\r\nlike a coward from it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Parmenter, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that you--I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wronged Professor Lee!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Parmenter, hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wronged\r\nhim terribly. I contributed my share, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a small one, to\r\nhis son\xe2\x80\x99s disgrace; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never said to him one word of contrition,\r\nof repentance, or regret. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late to make him any adequate\r\nreparation now; but I can be here to meet him and Charley when they\r\nland, to acknowledge my fault to him, to tell him of my grief and\r\nhumility, and ask him to try me again, and prove me that I am wiser and\r\njuster than I was. Now tell me, professor, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the least that I\r\ncan do and have any semblance of a man about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParmenter had risen in his excitement, and stood with flashing eyes,\r\nflushed face, and heaving breast. Delavan went up to him and took both\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are right.\r\nCome, let\xe2\x80\x99s telegraph up to them that we\xe2\x80\x99ll not be there. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nback up town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCommencement Day dawned bright and beautiful. It always did. No one had\r\never known a rainy Commencement Day at Old Concord; and the day was\r\njust as beautiful on New York Bay as it was in the college city.\r\n\r\nThe ocean vessel had been sighted late in the morning; and the\r\nexcursion steamer, with more than a hundred enthusiastic men and women\r\non board, was pulling rapidly down to meet her.\r\n\r\nThe little boat was gay with bunting. Flags and banners floated from\r\nevery pole and post. A great streamer at the bow bore the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConcord,\xe2\x80\x9d and another at the stern displayed the college cry.\r\n\r\nThere was a brass band on the boat, and a brass cannon; and lest these\r\nshould not meet the anticipated demand for noise, every person on board\r\nwas supplied with a college fish-horn. But the party failed to reach\r\nquarantine in time. They had hardly got below Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Island when\r\nthe black hull of the great vessel loomed up on the smoky horizon,\r\nbeating up the bay toward them. Ten minutes later the two steamers, big\r\nand little, were directly opposite, though at some distance from each\r\nother. Then the reception began.\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly a college boys\xe2\x80\x99 reception. Human throats vied with\r\nbrass instruments, with booming cannon, and the blare of horns in\r\nproclaiming welcome to the travelers.\r\n\r\nWhen the people on the big steamer realized that the demonstration was\r\nfor some of their number, they crowded to the side of the vessel, and\r\nwaved handkerchiefs and hats.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes one of the upper guard rails was cleared, for a\r\nlittle space, of all the human figures save one. That one no one who\r\nknew him could fail to distinguish as \xe2\x80\x9cSammy Lee.\xe2\x80\x9d He stood, with bared\r\nhead, waving his hat in one hand and his handkerchief in the other, and\r\napparently shouting some response at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\nThen he called his wife and son to his side; and from that point up\r\nthe bay and all the way to the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s pier the three stood together\r\nresponding as best they could to the cries and cheers, the music and\r\nthe noise, the waving hats and handkerchiefs that continuously greeted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt last the big steamer reached her pier and swung slowly in; and\r\nthe smaller boat made fast to the wharf that the excursionists might\r\ndisembark and greet the travelers as they landed.\r\n\r\nThrough all this demonstration Parmenter stood quietly in the\r\nbackground, joining occasionally in the cheering, brushing the tears\r\nfrom his eyes now and then, as he noted the sincerity and enthusiasm of\r\nthe greeting.\r\n\r\nHe went out on the pier with the others, but remained in the rear. Now\r\nthat his great opportunity had arrived, he hardly knew how to avail\r\nhimself of it. His heart beat thunderously against his breast.\r\n\r\nFar up the pier he saw Professor Lee and his wife and son come down the\r\nbridge. Then they were swallowed up in the circling crowd that pressed\r\nforward to greet them.\r\n\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s heart failed him then; his courage gave way, and he turned\r\naside and stood by a wharf-post, with his face toward the water, that\r\npeople passing by might not see his tears.\r\n\r\nAfter a little some one touched him on the shoulder, and he turned to\r\nsee who it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFred!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor one second the two men looked into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; then their\r\nhands met in a heart-thrilling clasp, then their arms were laid\r\nlovingly across each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey were again in complete accord. No words were necessary to\r\nassure them of that. If they had been necessary Parmenter could not\r\nhave spoken them. The lump in his throat had effectually choked his\r\nutterance. After a minute he managed to stammer out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley--your father--I wronged him! I want to explain--confess--and\r\nget forgiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLee swung quickly around, and pierced to the center of the party that\r\nwas coming slowly down the pier. He whispered something into his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s ear, drew him quietly from the throng, crossed over with him\r\nto where Parmenter stood, and then left them alone together.\r\n\r\nThe crowd moved on, laughing and chatting, casting backward glances at\r\nthe two who remained behind, wondering a little but knowing scarcely\r\nanything of the drama that was being reenacted with lightning-like\r\nrapidity in those two hearts.\r\n\r\nThose who looked at the two men a minute later from the deck saw that\r\nsomething unusual was going on. They saw Parmenter standing, hat in\r\nhand, looking straight into the professor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and talking with\r\nterrible earnestness.\r\n\r\nThey saw, too, that though he did not move a muscle, his face was white\r\nand his hands were tightly clenched.\r\n\r\nThe first time that Professor Lee interrupted him he reached out and\r\ntouched the young man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder gently. The next time he grasped both\r\nof Parmenter\xe2\x80\x99s hands in his and held them fast; and the third time,\r\nafter a flow of impassioned words that came hot from the penitent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart to his mouth, the old man drew the bared young head down toward\r\nhim and pressed it tenderly with his lips. That was all.\r\n\r\nAfter that they came back, arm in arm, to the boat. Tears were in\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but his face was radiant with the sunshine of\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nWhen every one was on board again the excursion steamer left the pier\r\nfor a run down the bay and a trip up the North and East Rivers. A\r\nluncheon was served; and after that the party gathered in the cabin,\r\nand Professor Lee responded to a brief address of welcome.\r\n\r\nHe had never spoken better in his life--never more earnestly, never\r\nmore joyously. His magnificent reception had warmed his heart, and\r\nfilled it to overflowing with gratitude and enthusiasm. He told briefly\r\nof his travels, and of the pleasure he found in his return home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith my wife and son, I was looking over our\r\nbaggage preparatory to meeting the customs officers. Happening to look\r\nout on the bay I saw your boat with its flags and bunting, its college\r\nmottoes, and its college colors, and its decks dark with people. I\r\ncould not believe my eyes. I dared not speak of it to my wife and son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stole away and went on deck to assure myself. Then I heard a great\r\ncry of \xe2\x80\x98Sammy Lee!\xe2\x80\x99 and I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Sammy, it\xe2\x80\x99s you they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nafter--sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I ran down, and called to Mrs. Lee and Charley. \xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98come on deck quick! Let the baggage go! let the custom-house officials\r\ngo! let everything go! The _boys_ are here to welcome us home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, there were men on that vessel who are worth millions.\r\nThere were high dignitaries of church and state on board. Yet I, poor\r\nas a church-mouse, not known beyond the circle of my own pupils,--I,\r\nfor my own sake, for the sake of the dear ones who are with me, for\r\nthe sake of the grand old college that I have the honor to represent,\r\nhave commanded such a reception to-day as those men with their combined\r\nwealth, power, and influence couldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy, force, or borrow for a\r\nsingle moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel it to the bottom of my heart. I shall never forget it. I shall\r\nlive this scene over in my mind every day so long as I remain on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a storm of applause. When it had subsided the professor\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went away from you two years ago, tired, hurt, and miserable; but I\r\ncome back to you filled with new life. If there were any wounds still\r\nopen when I entered New York Bay this morning your sovereign remedy of\r\nwelcome has completely healed them; if there was one hard or bitter\r\nfeeling still lingering in my breast when I stepped upon that pier an\r\nhour ago, the splendid courage, the manly confession, the magnificent\r\nself-sacrifice, of one among you has swept it from its hiding-place\r\nforever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the storm of cheers and applause burst forth. No one understood\r\nperfectly what it was all about, but every one felt that the allusion\r\nwas to Parmenter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am come to you again,\xe2\x80\x9d the speaker continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwith nothing\r\nbut love and gratitude in my heart for all of you--with nothing but\r\naffection for the dear old college and all who are in it or of it, with\r\nthe peace and quiet of serene old age stealing softly over me; with the\r\nonly grief I have ever known, during all my life among you, lost and\r\nburied in the beautiful memories of the past. I thank you--thank you a\r\nthousand times; and God bless you always!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice broke at last, and he sank into his seat and brushed away his\r\ntears. But all his boys knew that they were tears of joy and not of\r\nsorrow, and the flow of spirits and good-fellowship burst forth anew.\r\n\r\nCommencement Day at Concord went gloriously by. In the absence of\r\nParmenter, Robinson was the most conspicuous member of the graduating\r\nclass, and had the largest share of honors.\r\n\r\nAt midnight Professor Lee and his party reached the city, and found a\r\nrousing welcome awaiting them at the train. In some unaccountable way\r\nParmenter\xe2\x80\x99s story had traveled home ahead of him, and he had to share\r\nwith the professor and his family the honors of the night.\r\n\r\nLater a great crowd of students, with Parmenter and Charley Lee arm in\r\narm in the midst of them, marched up the hill and through the college\r\ngate, singing as no one had ever heard them sing before.\r\n\r\nThe party halted in front of Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s residence and sang:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s to Sammy Lee, drink it down;\xe2\x80\x9d and as that tired but happy\r\ntraveler laid his head on his pillow in his cherished home, there came\r\nsoftly, musically, gratefully to his ears, from some distant quarter of\r\nthe campus, the old familiar good-night song:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSweet dreams, Sammy, sweet dreams, Sammy, sweet dreams, Sammy,\r\n         We\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave you now.\r\n         Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along,\r\n         Merrily we roll along,\r\n         O\xe2\x80\x99er the deep blue sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Transcriber\xe2\x80\x99s Notes:\r\n\r\n --Text in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\n --Punctuation and spelling inaccuracies were silently corrected.\r\n\r\n --Archaic and variable spelling has been preserved.\r\n\r\n --Variations in hyphenation and compound words have been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Whispering Tongues, by Homer Greene\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHISPERING TONGUES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 46528-0.txt or 46528-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/6/5/2/46528/\r\n\r\nProduced by Donald Cummings and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
