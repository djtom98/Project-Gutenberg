The traffic was\r\nobstructed by casks, cables, and baskets of linen. The sailors answered\r\nnobody. People jostled one another. Between the two paddle-boxes was\r\npiled up a heap of parcels; and the uproar was drowned in the loud\r\nhissing of the steam, which, making its way through the plates of\r\nsheet-iron, enveloped everything in a white cloud, while the bell at the\r\nprow kept ringing continuously.\r\n\r\nAt last, the vessel set out; and the two banks of the river, stocked\r\nwith warehouses, timber-yards, and manufactories, opened out like two\r\nhuge ribbons being unrolled.\r\n\r\nA young man of eighteen, with long hair, holding an album under his arm,\r\nremained near the helm without moving. Through the haze he surveyed\r\nsteeples, buildings of which he did not know the names; then, with a\r\nparting glance, he took in the \xcele St. Louis, the Cit\xe9, N\xf4tre Dame; and\r\npresently, as Paris disappeared from his view, he heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nFrederick Moreau, having just taken his Bachelor\'s degree, was returning\r\nhome to Nogent-sur-Seine, where he would have to lead a languishing\r\nexistence for two months, before going back to begin his legal studies.\r\nHis mother had sent him, with enough to cover his expenses, to Havre to\r\nsee an uncle, from whom she had expectations of his receiving an\r\ninheritance. He had returned from that place only yesterday; and he\r\nindemnified himself for not having the opportunity of spending a little\r\ntime in the capital by taking the longest possible route to reach his\r\nown part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe hubbub had subsided. The passengers had all taken their places. Some\r\nof them stood warming themselves around the machinery, and the chimney\r\nspat forth with a slow, rhythmic rattle its plume of black smoke. Little\r\ndrops of dew trickled over the copper plates; the deck quivered with the\r\nvibration from within; and the two paddle-wheels, rapidly turning round,\r\nlashed the water. The edges of the river were covered with sand. The\r\nvessel swept past rafts of wood which began to oscillate under the\r\nrippling of the waves, or a boat without sails in which a man sat\r\nfishing. Then the wandering haze cleared off; the sun appeared; the hill\r\nwhich ran along the course of the Seine to the right subsided by\r\ndegrees, and another rose nearer on the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nIt was crowned with trees, which surrounded low-built houses, covered\r\nwith roofs in the Italian style. They had sloping gardens divided by\r\nfresh walls, iron railings, grass-plots, hot-houses, and vases of\r\ngeraniums, laid out regularly on the terraces where one could lean\r\nforward on one\'s elbow. More than one spectator longed, on beholding\r\nthose attractive residences which looked so peaceful, to be the owner of\r\none of them, and to dwell there till the end of his days with a good\r\nbilliard-table, a sailing-boat, and a woman or some other object to\r\ndream about. The agreeable novelty of a journey by water made such\r\noutbursts natural. Already the wags on board were beginning their jokes.\r\nMany began to sing. Gaiety prevailed, and glasses of brandy were poured\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFrederick was thinking about the apartment which he would occupy over\r\nthere, on the plan of a drama, on subjects for pictures, on future\r\npassions. He found that the happiness merited by the excellence of his\r\nsoul was slow in arriving. He declaimed some melancholy verses. He\r\nwalked with rapid step along the deck. He went on till he reached the\r\nend at which the bell was; and, in the centre of a group of passengers\r\nand sailors, he saw a gentleman talking soft nothings to a\r\ncountry-woman, while fingering the gold cross which she wore over her\r\nbreast. He was a jovial blade of forty with frizzled hair. His robust\r\nform was encased in a jacket of black velvet, two emeralds sparkled in\r\nhis cambric shirt, and his wide, white trousers fell over odd-looking\r\nred boots of Russian leather set off with blue designs.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Frederick did not discompose him. He turned round and\r\nglanced several times at the young man with winks of enquiry. He next\r\noffered cigars to all who were standing around him. But getting tired,\r\nno doubt, of their society, he moved away from them and took a seat\r\nfurther up. Frederick followed him.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, at first, turned on the various kinds of tobacco, then\r\nquite naturally it glided into a discussion about women. The gentleman\r\nin the red boots gave the young man advice; he put forward theories,\r\nrelated anecdotes, referred to himself by way of illustration, and he\r\ngave utterance to all these things in a paternal tone, with the\r\ningenuousness of entertaining depravity.\r\n\r\nHe was republican in his opinions. He had travelled; he was familiar\r\nwith the inner life of theatres, restaurants, and newspapers, and knew\r\nall the theatrical celebrities, whom he called by their Christian names.\r\nFrederick told him confidentially about his projects; and the elder man\r\ntook an encouraging view of them.\r\n\r\nBut he stopped talking to take a look at the funnel, then he went\r\nmumbling rapidly through a long calculation in order to ascertain "how\r\nmuch each stroke of the piston at so many times per minute would come\r\nto," etc., and having found the number, he spoke about the scenery,\r\nwhich he admired immensely. Then he gave expression to his delight at\r\nhaving got away from business.\r\n\r\nFrederick regarded him with a certain amount of respect, and politely\r\nmanifested a strong desire to know his name. The stranger, without a\r\nmoment\'s hesitation, replied:\r\n\r\n"Jacques Arnoux, proprietor of _L\'Art Industriel_, Boulevard\r\nMontmartre."\r\n\r\nA man-servant in a gold-laced cap came up and said:\r\n\r\n"Would Monsieur have the kindness to go below? Mademoiselle is crying."\r\n\r\n_L\'Art Industriel_ was a hybrid establishment, wherein the functions of\r\nan art-journal and a picture-shop were combined. Frederick had seen this\r\ntitle several times in the bookseller\'s window in his native place on\r\nbig prospectuses, on which the name of Jacques Arnoux displayed itself\r\nmagisterially.\r\n\r\nThe sun\'s rays fell perpendicularly, shedding a glittering light on the\r\niron hoops around the masts, the plates of the barricades, and the\r\nsurface of the water, which, at the prow, was cut into two furrows that\r\nspread out as far as the borders of the meadows. At each winding of the\r\nriver, a screen of pale poplars presented itself with the utmost\r\nuniformity. The surrounding country at this point had an empty look. In\r\nthe sky there were little white clouds which remained motionless, and\r\nthe sense of weariness, which vaguely diffused itself over everything,\r\nseemed to retard the progress of the steamboat and to add to the\r\ninsignificant appearance of the passengers. Putting aside a few persons\r\nof good position who were travelling first class, they were artisans or\r\nshopmen with their wives and children. As it was customary at that time\r\nto wear old clothes when travelling, they nearly all had their heads\r\ncovered with shabby Greek caps or discoloured hats, thin black coats\r\nthat had become quite threadbare from constant rubbing against\r\nwriting-desks, or frock-coats with the casings of their buttons loose\r\nfrom continual service in the shop. Here and there some roll-collar\r\nwaistcoat afforded a glimpse of a calico shirt stained with coffee.\r\nPinchbeck pins were stuck into cravats that were all torn. List shoes\r\nwere kept up by stitched straps. Two or three roughs who held in their\r\nhands bamboo canes with leathern loops, kept looking askance at their\r\nfellow-passengers; and fathers of families opened their eyes wide while\r\nmaking enquiries. People chatted either standing up or squatting over\r\ntheir luggage; some went to sleep in various corners of the vessel;\r\nseveral occupied themselves with eating. The deck was soiled with walnut\r\nshells, butt-ends of cigars, peelings of pears, and the droppings of\r\npork-butchers\' meat, which had been carried wrapped up in paper. Three\r\ncabinet-makers in blouses took their stand in front of the bottle case;\r\na harp-player in rags was resting with his elbows on his instrument. At\r\nintervals could be heard the sound of falling coals in the furnace, a\r\nshout, or a laugh; and the captain kept walking on the bridge from one\r\npaddle-box to the other without stopping for a moment.\r\n\r\nFrederick, to get back to his place, pushed forward the grating leading\r\ninto the part of the vessel reserved for first-class passengers, and in\r\nso doing disturbed two sportsmen with their dogs.\r\n\r\nWhat he then saw was like an apparition. She was seated in the middle of\r\na bench all alone, or, at any rate, he could see no one, dazzled as he\r\nwas by her eyes. At the moment when he was passing, she raised her head;\r\nhis shoulders bent involuntarily; and, when he had seated himself, some\r\ndistance away, on the same side, he glanced towards her.\r\n\r\nShe wore a wide straw hat with red ribbons which fluttered in the wind\r\nbehind her. Her black tresses, twining around the edges of her large\r\nbrows, descended very low, and seemed amorously to press the oval of her\r\nface. Her robe of light muslin spotted with green spread out in numerous\r\nfolds. She was in the act of embroidering something; and her straight\r\nnose, her chin, her entire person was cut out on the background of the\r\nluminous air and the blue sky.\r\n\r\nAs she remained in the same attitude, he took several turns to the right\r\nand to the left to hide from her his change of position; then he placed\r\nhimself close to her parasol which lay against the bench, and pretended\r\nto be looking at a sloop on the river.\r\n\r\nNever before had he seen more lustrous dark skin, a more seductive\r\nfigure, or more delicately shaped fingers than those through which the\r\nsunlight gleamed. He stared with amazement at her work-basket, as if it\r\nwere something extraordinary. What was her name, her place of residence,\r\nher life, her past? He longed to become familiar with the furniture of\r\nher apartment, all the dresses that she had worn, the people whom she\r\nvisited; and the desire of physical possession yielded to a deeper\r\nyearning, a painful curiosity that knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nA negress, wearing a silk handkerchief tied round her head, made her\r\nappearance, holding by the hand a little girl already tall for her age.\r\nThe child, whose eyes were swimming with tears, had just awakened. The\r\nlady took the little one on her knees. "Mademoiselle was not good,\r\nthough she would soon be seven; her mother would not love her any more.\r\nShe was too often pardoned for being naughty." And Frederick heard those\r\nthings with delight, as if he had made a discovery, an acquisition.\r\n\r\nHe assumed that she must be of Andalusian descent, perhaps a Creole: had\r\nshe brought this negress across with her from the West Indian Islands?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his attention was directed to a long shawl with violet stripes\r\nthrown behind her back over the copper support of the bench. She must\r\nhave, many a time, wrapped it around her waist, as the vessel sped\r\nthrough the midst of the waves; drawn it over her feet, gone to sleep in\r\nit!\r\n\r\nFrederick suddenly noticed that with the sweep of its fringes it was\r\nslipping off, and it was on the point of falling into the water when,\r\nwith a bound, he secured it. She said to him:\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Monsieur."\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready, my dear?" cried my lord Arnoux, presenting himself at\r\nthe hood of the companion-ladder.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Marthe ran over to him, and, clinging to his neck, she\r\nbegan pulling at his moustache. The strains of a harp were heard--she\r\nwanted to see the music played; and presently the performer on the\r\ninstrument, led forward by the negress, entered the place reserved for\r\nsaloon passengers. Arnoux recognized in him a man who had formerly been\r\na model, and "thou\'d" him, to the astonishment of the bystanders. At\r\nlength the harpist, flinging back his long hair over his shoulders,\r\nstretched out his hands and began playing.\r\n\r\nIt was an Oriental ballad all about poniards, flowers, and stars. The\r\nman in rags sang it in a sharp voice; the twanging of the harp strings\r\nbroke the harmony of the tune with false notes. He played more\r\nvigorously: the chords vibrated, and their metallic sounds seemed to\r\nsend forth sobs, and, as it were, the plaint of a proud and vanquished\r\nlove. On both sides of the river, woods extended as far as the edge of\r\nthe water. A current of fresh air swept past them, and Madame Arnoux\r\ngazed vaguely into the distance. When the music stopped, she moved her\r\neyes several times as if she were starting out of a dream.\r\n\r\nThe harpist approached them with an air of humility. While Arnoux was\r\nsearching his pockets for money, Frederick stretched out towards the cap\r\nhis closed hand, and then, opening it in a shamefaced manner, he\r\ndeposited in it a louis d\'or. It was not vanity that had prompted him to\r\nbestow this alms in her presence, but the idea of a blessing in which he\r\nthought she might share--an almost religious impulse of the heart.\r\n\r\nArnoux, pointing out the way, cordially invited him to go below.\r\nFrederick declared that he had just lunched; on the contrary, he was\r\nnearly dying of hunger; and he had not a single centime in his purse.\r\n\r\nAfter that, it occurred to him that he had a perfect right, as well as\r\nanyone else, to remain in the cabin.\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen were seated before round tables, lunching, while an\r\nattendant went about serving out coffee. Monsieur and Madame Arnoux were\r\nin the far corner to the right. He took a seat on the long bench covered\r\nwith velvet, having picked up a newspaper which he found there.\r\n\r\nThey would have to take the diligence at Montereau for Ch\xe2lons. Their\r\ntour in Switzerland would last a month. Madame Arnoux blamed her husband\r\nfor his weakness in dealing with his child. He whispered in her ear\r\nsomething agreeable, no doubt, for she smiled. Then, he got up to draw\r\ndown the window curtain at her back. Under the low, white ceiling, a\r\ncrude light filled the cabin. Frederick, sitting opposite to the place\r\nwhere she sat, could distinguish the shade of her eyelashes. She just\r\nmoistened her lips with her glass and broke a little piece of crust\r\nbetween her fingers. The lapis-lazuli locket fastened by a little gold\r\nchain to her wrist made a ringing sound, every now and then, as it\r\ntouched her plate. Those present, however, did not appear to notice it.\r\n\r\nAt intervals one could see, through the small portholes, the side of a\r\nboat taking away passengers or putting them on board. Those who sat\r\nround the tables stooped towards the openings, and called out the names\r\nof the various places they passed along the river.\r\n\r\nArnoux complained of the cooking. He grumbled particularly at the amount\r\nof the bill, and got it reduced. Then, he carried off the young man\r\ntowards the forecastle to drink a glass of grog with him. But Frederick\r\nspeedily came back again to gaze at Madame Arnoux, who had returned to\r\nthe awning, beneath which she seated herself. She was reading a thin,\r\ngrey-covered volume. From time to time, the corners of her mouth curled\r\nand a gleam of pleasure lighted up her forehead. He felt jealous of the\r\ninventor of those things which appeared to interest her so much. The\r\nmore he contemplated her, the more he felt that there were yawning\r\nabysses between them. He was reflecting that he should very soon lose\r\nsight of her irrevocably, without having extracted a few words from her,\r\nwithout leaving her even a souvenir!\r\n\r\nOn the right, a plain stretched out. On the left, a strip of\r\npasture-land rose gently to meet a hillock where one could see\r\nvineyards, groups of walnut-trees, a mill embedded in the grassy slopes,\r\nand, beyond that, little zigzag paths over the white mass of rocks that\r\nreached up towards the clouds. What bliss it would have been to ascend\r\nside by side with her, his arm around her waist, while her gown would\r\nsweep the yellow leaves, listening to her voice and gazing up into her\r\nglowing eyes! The steamboat might stop, and all they would have to do\r\nwas to step out of it; and yet this thing, simple as it might be, was\r\nnot less difficult than it would have been to move the sun.\r\n\r\nA little further on, a ch\xe2teau appeared with pointed roof and square\r\nturrets. A flower garden spread out in the foreground; and avenues ran,\r\nlike dark archways, under the tall linden trees. He pictured her to\r\nhimself passing along by this group of trees. At that moment a young\r\nlady and a young man showed themselves on the steps in front of the\r\nhouse, between the trunks of the orange trees. Then the entire scene\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe little girl kept skipping playfully around the place where he had\r\nstationed himself on the deck. Frederick wished to kiss her. She hid\r\nherself behind her nurse. Her mother scolded her for not being nice to\r\nthe gentleman who had rescued her own shawl. Was this an indirect\r\noverture?\r\n\r\n"Is she going to speak to me?" he asked himself.\r\n\r\nTime was flying. How was he to get an invitation to the Arnoux\'s house?\r\nAnd he could think of nothing better than to draw her attention to the\r\nautumnal hues, adding:\r\n\r\n"We are close to winter--the season of balls and dinner-parties."\r\n\r\nBut Arnoux was entirely occupied with his luggage. They had arrived at\r\nthe point of the river\'s bank facing Surville. The two bridges drew\r\nnearer. They passed a ropewalk, then a range of low-built houses, inside\r\nwhich there were pots of tar and splinters of wood; and brats went\r\nalong the sand turning head over heels. Frederick recognised a man with\r\na sleeved waistcoat, and called out to him:\r\n\r\n"Make haste!"\r\n\r\nThey were at the landing-place. He looked around anxiously for Arnoux\r\namongst the crowd of passengers, and the other came and shook hands with\r\nhim, saying:\r\n\r\n"A pleasant time, dear Monsieur!"\r\n\r\nWhen he was on the quay, Frederick turned around. She was standing\r\nbeside the helm. He cast a look towards her into which he tried to put\r\nhis whole soul. She remained motionless, as if he had done nothing.\r\nThen, without paying the slightest attentions to the obeisances of his\r\nman-servant:\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you bring the trap down here?"\r\n\r\nThe man made excuses.\r\n\r\n"What a clumsy fellow you are! Give me some money."\r\n\r\nAnd after that he went off to get something to eat at an inn.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, he felt an inclination to turn into the\r\ncoachyard, as if by chance. Perhaps he would see her again.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of it?" said he to himself.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle carried him off. The two horses did not belong to his\r\nmother. She had borrowed one of M. Chambrion, the tax-collector, in\r\norder to have it yoked alongside of her own. Isidore, having set forth\r\nthe day before, had taken a rest at Bray until evening, and had slept at\r\nMontereau, so that the animals, with restored vigour, were trotting\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\nFields on which the crops had been cut stretched out in apparently\r\nendless succession; and by degrees Villeneuve, St. Georges, Ablon,\r\nCh\xe2tillon, Corbeil, and the other places--his entire journey--came back\r\nto his recollection with such vividness that he could now recall to mind\r\nfresh details, more intimate particulars.... Under the lowest flounce of\r\nher gown, her foot showed itself encased in a dainty silk boot of maroon\r\nshade. The awning made of ticking formed a wide canopy over her head,\r\nand the little red tassels of the edging kept perpetually trembling in\r\nthe breeze.\r\n\r\nShe resembled the women of whom he had read in romances. He would have\r\nadded nothing to the charms of her person, and would have taken nothing\r\nfrom them. The universe had suddenly become enlarged. She was the\r\nluminous point towards which all things converged; and, rocked by the\r\nmovement of the vehicle, with half-dosed eyelids, and his face turned\r\ntowards the clouds, he abandoned himself to a dreamy, infinite joy.\r\n\r\nAt Bray, he did not wait till the horses had got their oats; he walked\r\non along the road ahead by himself. Arnoux had, when he spoke to her,\r\naddressed her as "Marie." He now loudly repeated the name "Marie!" His\r\nvoice pierced the air and was lost in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe western sky was one great mass of flaming purple. Huge stacks of\r\nwheat, rising up in the midst of the stubble fields, projected giant\r\nshadows. A dog began to bark in a farm-house in the distance. He\r\nshivered, seized with disquietude for which he could assign no cause.\r\n\r\nWhen Isidore had come up with him, he jumped up into the front seat to\r\ndrive. His fit of weakness was past. He had thoroughly made up his mind\r\nto effect an introduction into the house of the Arnoux, and to become\r\nintimate with them. Their house should be amusing; besides, he liked\r\nArnoux; then, who could tell? Thereupon a wave of blood rushed up to his\r\nface; his temples throbbed; he cracked his whip, shook the reins, and\r\nset the horses going at such a pace that the old coachman repeatedly\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Easy! easy now, or they\'ll get broken-winded!"\r\n\r\nGradually Frederick calmed down, and he listened to what the man was\r\nsaying. Monsieur\'s return was impatiently awaited. Mademoiselle Louise\r\nhad cried in her anxiety to go in the trap to meet him.\r\n\r\n"Who, pray, is Mademoiselle Louise?"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Roque\'s little girl, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I had forgotten," rejoined Frederick, carelessly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the two horses could keep up the pace no longer. They were\r\nboth getting lame; and nine o\'clock struck at St. Laurent\'s when he\r\narrived at the parade in front of his mother\'s house.\r\n\r\nThis house of large dimensions, with a garden looking out on the open\r\ncountry, added to the social importance of Madame Moreau, who was the\r\nmost respected lady in the district.\r\n\r\nShe came of an old family of nobles, of which the male line was now\r\nextinct. Her husband, a plebeian whom her parents forced her to marry,\r\nmet his death by a sword-thrust, during her pregnancy, leaving her an\r\nestate much encumbered. She received visitors three times a week, and\r\nfrom time to time, gave a fashionable dinner. But the number of wax\r\ncandles was calculated beforehand, and she looked forward with some\r\nimpatience to the payment of her rents. These pecuniary embarrassments,\r\nconcealed as if there were some guilt attached to them, imparted a\r\ncertain gravity to her character. Nevertheless, she displayed no\r\nprudery, no sourness, in the practice of her peculiar virtue. Her most\r\ntrifling charities seemed munificent alms. She was consulted about the\r\nselection of servants, the education of young girls, and the art of\r\nmaking preserves, and Monseigneur used to stay at her house on the\r\noccasion of his episcopal visitations.\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau cherished a lofty ambition for her son. Through a sort of\r\nprudence grounded on the expectation of favours, she did not care to\r\nhear blame cast on the Government. He would need patronage at the start;\r\nthen, with its aid, he might become a councillor of State, an\r\nambassador, a minister. His triumphs at the college of Sens warranted\r\nthis proud anticipation; he had carried off there the prize of honour.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the drawing-room, all present arose with a great racket;\r\nhe was embraced; and the chairs, large and small, were drawn up in a big\r\nsemi-circle around the fireplace. M. Gamblin immediately asked him what\r\nwas his opinion about Madame Lafarge. This case, the rage of the period,\r\ndid not fail to lead to a violent discussion. Madame Moreau stopped it,\r\nto the regret, however, of M. Gamblin. He deemed it serviceable to the\r\nyoung man in his character of a future lawyer, and, nettled at what had\r\noccurred, he left the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nNothing should have caused surprise on the part of a friend of P\xe8re\r\nRoque! The reference to P\xe8re Roque led them to talk of M. Dambreuse, who\r\nhad just become the owner of the demesne of La Fortelle. But the\r\ntax-collector had drawn Frederick aside to know what he thought of M.\r\nGuizot\'s latest work. They were all anxious to get some information\r\nabout his private affairs, and Madame Beno\xeet went cleverly to work with\r\nthat end in view by inquiring about his uncle. How was that worthy\r\nrelative? They no longer heard from him. Had he not a distant cousin in\r\nAmerica?\r\n\r\nThe cook announced that Monsieur\'s soup was served. The guests\r\ndiscreetly retired. Then, as soon as they were alone in the dining-room,\r\nhis mother said to him in a low tone:\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\nThe old man had received him in a very cordial manner, but without\r\ndisclosing his intentions.\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau sighed.\r\n\r\n"Where is she now?" was his thought.\r\n\r\nThe diligence was rolling along the road, and, wrapped up in the shawl,\r\nno doubt, she was leaning against the cloth of the coup\xe9, her beautiful\r\nhead nodding asleep.\r\n\r\nHe and his mother were just going up to their apartments when a waiter\r\nfrom the Swan of the Cross brought him a note.\r\n\r\n"What is that, pray?"\r\n\r\n"It is Deslauriers, who wants me," said he.\r\n\r\n"Ha! your chum!" said Madame Moreau, with a contemptuous sneer.\r\n"Certainly it is a nice hour to select!"\r\n\r\nFrederick hesitated. But friendship was stronger. He got his hat.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, don\'t be long!" said his mother to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDamon and Pythias.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Deslauriers\' father, an ex-captain in the line, who had left the\r\nservice in 1818, had come back to Nogent, where he had married, and with\r\nthe amount of the dowry bought up the business of a process-server,[1]\r\nwhich brought him barely enough to maintain him. Embittered by a long\r\ncourse of unjust treatment, suffering still from the effects of old\r\nwounds, and always regretting the Emperor, he vented on those around him\r\nthe fits of rage that seemed to choke him. Few children received so many\r\nwhackings as his son. In spite of blows, however, the brat did not\r\nyield. His mother, when she tried to interpose, was also ill-treated.\r\nFinally, the captain planted the boy in his office, and all the day long\r\nkept him bent over his desk copying documents, with the result that his\r\nright shoulder was noticeably higher than his left.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The French word _huissier_ means a sheriff\'s officer, or a\r\nperson whose business it is to serve writs, processes, and legal\r\ndocuments generally. The word "process-server" must not be understood in\r\nits colloquial English sense, for in France this business is sometimes a\r\nlucrative one.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nIn 1833, on the invitation of the president, the captain sold his\r\noffice. His wife died of cancer. He then went to live at Dijon. After\r\nthat he started in business at Troyes, where he was connected with the\r\nslave trade; and, having obtained a small scholarship for Charles,\r\nplaced him at the college of Sens, where Frederick came across him. But\r\none of the pair was twelve years old, while the other was fifteen;\r\nbesides, a thousand differences of character and origin tended to keep\r\nthem apart.\r\n\r\nFrederick had in his chest of drawers all sorts of useful things--choice\r\narticles, such as a dressing-case. He liked to lie late in bed in the\r\nmorning, to look at the swallows, and to read plays; and, regretting the\r\ncomforts of home, he thought college life rough. To the process-server\'s\r\nson it seemed a pleasant life. He worked so hard that, at the end of the\r\nsecond year, he had got into the third form. However, owing to his\r\npoverty or to his quarrelsome disposition, he was regarded with intense\r\ndislike. But when on one occasion, in the courtyard where pupils of the\r\nmiddle grade took exercise, an attendant openly called him a beggar\'s\r\nchild, he sprang at the fellow\'s throat, and would have killed him if\r\nthree of the ushers had not intervened. Frederick, carried away by\r\nadmiration, pressed him in his arms. From that day forward they became\r\nfast friends. The affection of a _grandee_ no doubt flattered the vanity\r\nof the youth of meaner rank, and the other accepted as a piece of good\r\nfortune this devotion freely offered to him. During the holidays\r\nCharles\'s father allowed him to remain in the college. A translation of\r\nPlato which he opened by chance excited his enthusiasm. Then he became\r\nsmitten with a love of metaphysical studies; and he made rapid progress,\r\nfor he approached the subject with all the energy of youth and the\r\nself-confidence of an emancipated intellect. Jouffroy, Cousin,\r\nLaromigui\xe8re, Malebranche, and the Scotch metaphysicians--everything\r\nthat could be found in the library dealing with this branch of knowledge\r\npassed through his hands. He found it necessary to steal the key in\r\norder to get the books.\r\n\r\nFrederick\'s intellectual distractions were of a less serious\r\ndescription. He made sketches of the genealogy of Christ carved on a\r\npost in the Rue des Trois Rois, then of the gateway of a cathedral.\r\nAfter a course of medi\xe6val dramas, he took up memoirs--Froissart,\r\nComines, Pierre de l\'Estoile, and Brant\xf4me.\r\n\r\nThe impressions made on his mind by this kind of reading took such a\r\nhold of it that he felt a need within him of reproducing those pictures\r\nof bygone days. His ambition was to be, one day, the Walter Scott of\r\nFrance. Deslauriers dreamed of formulating a vast system of philosophy,\r\nwhich might have the most far-reaching applications.\r\n\r\nThey chatted over all these matters at recreation hours, in the\r\nplayground, in front of the moral inscription painted under the clock.\r\nThey kept whispering to each other about them in the chapel, even with\r\nSt. Louis staring down at them. They dreamed about them in the\r\ndormitory, which looked out on a burial-ground. On walking-days they\r\ntook up a position behind the others, and talked without stopping.\r\n\r\nThey spoke of what they would do later, when they had left college.\r\nFirst of all, they would set out on a long voyage with the money which\r\nFrederick would take out of his own fortune on reaching his majority.\r\nThen they would come back to Paris; they would work together, and would\r\nnever part; and, as a relaxation from their labours, they would have\r\nlove-affairs with princesses in boudoirs lined with satin, or dazzling\r\norgies with famous courtesans. Their rapturous expectations were\r\nfollowed by doubts. After a crisis of verbose gaiety, they would often\r\nlapse into profound silence.\r\n\r\nOn summer evenings, when they had been walking for a long time over\r\nstony paths which bordered on vineyards, or on the high-road in the open\r\ncountry, and when they saw the wheat waving in the sunlight, while the\r\nair was filled with the fragrance of angelica, a sort of suffocating\r\nsensation took possession of them, and they stretched themselves on\r\ntheir backs, dizzy, intoxicated. Meanwhile the other lads, in their\r\nshirt-sleeves, were playing at base or flying kites. Then, as the usher\r\ncalled in the two companions from the playground, they would return,\r\ntaking the path which led along by the gardens watered by brooklets;\r\nthen they would pass through the boulevards overshadowed by the old city\r\nwalls. The deserted streets rang under their tread. The grating flew\r\nback; they ascended the stairs; and they felt as sad as if they had had\r\na great debauch.\r\n\r\nThe proctor maintained that they mutually cried up each other.\r\nNevertheless, if Frederick worked his way up to the higher forms, it was\r\nthrough the exhortations of his friend; and, during the vacation in\r\n1837, he brought Deslauriers to his mother\'s house.\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau disliked the young man. He had a terrible appetite. He was\r\nfond of making republican speeches. To crown all, she got it into her\r\nhead that he had been the means of leading her son into improper\r\nplaces. Their relations towards each other were watched. This only made\r\ntheir friendship grow stronger, and they bade one another adieu with\r\nheartfelt pangs when, in the following year, Deslauriers left the\r\ncollege in order to study law in Paris.\r\n\r\nFrederick anxiously looked forward to the time when they would meet\r\nagain. For two years they had not laid eyes on each other; and, when\r\ntheir embraces were over, they walked over the bridges to talk more at\r\ntheir ease.\r\n\r\nThe captain, who had now set up a billiard-room at Villenauxe, reddened\r\nwith anger when his son called for an account of the expense of\r\ntutelage, and even cut down the cost of victuals to the lowest figure.\r\nBut, as he intended to become a candidate at a later period for a\r\nprofessor\'s chair at the school, and as he had no money, Deslauriers\r\naccepted the post of principal clerk in an attorney\'s office at Troyes.\r\nBy dint of sheer privation he spared four thousand francs; and, by not\r\ndrawing upon the sum which came to him through his mother, he would\r\nalways have enough to enable him to work freely for three years while he\r\nwas waiting for a better position. It was necessary, therefore, to\r\nabandon their former project of living together in the capital, at least\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nFrederick hung down his head. This was the first of his dreams which had\r\ncrumbled into dust.\r\n\r\n"Be consoled," said the captain\'s son. "Life is long. We are young.\r\nWe\'ll meet again. Think no more about it!"\r\n\r\nHe shook the other\'s hand warmly, and, to distract his attention,\r\nquestioned him about his journey.\r\n\r\nFrederick had nothing to tell. But, at the recollection of Madame\r\nArnoux, his vexation disappeared. He did not refer to her, restrained by\r\na feeling of bashfulness. He made up for it by expatiating on Arnoux,\r\nrecalling his talk, his agreeable manner, his stories; and Deslauriers\r\nurged him strongly to cultivate this new acquaintance.\r\n\r\nFrederick had of late written nothing. His literary opinions were\r\nchanged. Passion was now above everything else in his estimation. He was\r\nequally enthusiastic about Werther, Ren\xe9, Franck, Lara, L\xe9lia, and other\r\nideal creations of less merit. Sometimes it seemed to him that music\r\nalone was capable of giving expression to his internal agitation. Then,\r\nhe dreamed of symphonies; or else the surface of things seized hold of\r\nhim, and he longed to paint. He had, however, composed verses.\r\nDeslauriers considered them beautiful, but did not ask him to write\r\nanother poem.\r\n\r\nAs for himself, he had given up metaphysics. Social economy and the\r\nFrench Revolution absorbed all his attention. Just now he was a tall\r\nfellow of twenty-two, thin, with a wide mouth, and a resolute look. On\r\nthis particular evening, he wore a poor-looking paletot of lasting; and\r\nhis shoes were white with dust, for he had come all the way from\r\nVillenauxe on foot for the express purpose of seeing Frederick.\r\n\r\nIsidore arrived while they were talking. Madame begged of Monsieur to\r\nreturn home, and, for fear of his catching cold, she had sent him his\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit!" said Deslauriers. And they continued walking from one end\r\nto the other of the two bridges which rest on the narrow islet formed by\r\nthe canal and the river.\r\n\r\nWhen they were walking on the side towards Nogent, they had, exactly in\r\nfront of them, a block of houses which projected a little. At the right\r\nmight be seen the church, behind the mills in the wood, whose sluices\r\nhad been closed up; and, at the left, the hedges covered with shrubs,\r\nalong the skirts of the wood, formed a boundary for the gardens, which\r\ncould scarcely be distinguished. But on the side towards Paris the high\r\nroad formed a sheer descending line, and the meadows lost themselves in\r\nthe distance under the vapours of the night. Silence reigned along this\r\nroad, whose white track clearly showed itself through the surrounding\r\ngloom. Odours of damp leaves ascended towards them. The waterfall, where\r\nthe stream had been diverted from its course a hundred paces further\r\naway, kept rumbling with that deep harmonious sound which waves make in\r\nthe night time.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers stopped, and said:\r\n\r\n"\'Tis funny to have these worthy folks sleeping so quietly! Patience! A\r\nnew \'89 is in preparation. People are tired of constitutions, charters,\r\nsubtleties, lies! Ah, if I had a newspaper, or a platform, how I would\r\nshake off all these things! But, in order to undertake anything\r\nwhatever, money is required. What a curse it is to be a tavern-keeper\'s\r\nson, and to waste one\'s youth in quest of bread!"\r\n\r\nHe hung down his head, bit his lips, and shivered under his threadbare\r\novercoat.\r\n\r\nFrederick flung half his cloak over his friend\'s shoulder. They both\r\nwrapped themselves up in it; and, with their arms around each other\'s\r\nwaists, they walked down the road side by side.\r\n\r\n"How do you think I can live over there without you?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\nThe bitter tone of his friend had brought back his own sadness.\r\n\r\n"I would have done something with a woman who loved me. What are you\r\nlaughing at? Love is the feeding-ground, and, as it were, the atmosphere\r\nof genius. Extraordinary emotions produce sublime works. As for seeking\r\nafter her whom I want, I give that up! Besides, if I should ever find\r\nher, she will repel me. I belong to the race of the disinherited, and I\r\nshall be extinguished with a treasure that will be of paste or of\r\ndiamond--I know not which."\r\n\r\nSomebody\'s shadow fell across the road, and at the same time they heard\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, gentlemen!"\r\n\r\nThe person who had uttered them was a little man attired in an ample\r\nbrown frock-coat, and with a cap on his head which under its peak\r\nafforded a glimpse of a sharp nose.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Roque?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"The very man!" returned the voice.\r\n\r\nThis resident in the locality explained his presence by stating that he\r\nhad come back to inspect the wolf-traps in his garden near the\r\nwater-side.\r\n\r\n"And so you are back again in the old spot? Very good! I ascertained the\r\nfact through my little girl. Your health is good, I hope? You are not\r\ngoing away again?"\r\n\r\nThen he left them, repelled, probably, by Frederick\'s chilling\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau, indeed, was not on visiting terms with him. P\xe8re Roque\r\nlived in peculiar relations with his servant-girl, and was held in very\r\nslight esteem, although he was the vice-president at elections, and M.\r\nDambreuse\'s manager.\r\n\r\n"The banker who resides in the Rue d\'Anjou," observed Deslauriers. "Do\r\nyou know what you ought to do, my fine fellow?"\r\n\r\nIsidore once more interrupted. His orders were positive not to go back\r\nwithout Frederick. Madame would be getting uneasy at his absence.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, he will go back," said Deslauriers. "He\'s not going to stay\r\nout all night."\r\n\r\nAnd, as soon as the man-servant had disappeared:\r\n\r\n"You ought to ask that old chap to introduce you to the Dambreuses.\r\nThere\'s nothing so useful as to be a visitor at a rich man\'s house.\r\nSince you have a black coat and white gloves, make use of them. You must\r\nmix in that set. You can introduce me into it later. Just think!--a man\r\nworth millions! Do all you can to make him like you, and his wife, too.\r\nBecome her lover!"\r\n\r\nFrederick uttered an exclamation by way of protest.\r\n\r\n"Why, I can quote classical examples for you on that point, I rather\r\nthink! Remember Rastignac in the _Com\xe9die Humaine_. You will succeed, I\r\nhave no doubt."\r\n\r\nFrederick had so much confidence in Deslauriers that he felt his\r\nfirmness giving way, and forgetting Madame Arnoux, or including her in\r\nthe prediction made with regard to the other, he could not keep from\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nThe clerk added:\r\n\r\n"A last piece of advice: pass your examinations. It is always a good\r\nthing to have a handle to your name: and, without more ado, give up your\r\nCatholic and Satanic poets, whose philosophy is as old as the twelfth\r\ncentury! Your despair is silly. The very greatest men have had more\r\ndifficult beginnings, as in the case of Mirabeau. Besides, our\r\nseparation will not be so long. I will make that pickpocket of a father\r\nof mine disgorge. It is time for me to be going back. Farewell! Have you\r\ngot a hundred sous to pay for my dinner?"\r\n\r\nFrederick gave him ten francs, what was left of those he had got that\r\nmorning from Isidore.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some forty yards away from the bridges, a light shone from\r\nthe garret-window of a low-built house.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers noticed it. Then he said emphatically, as he took off his\r\nhat:\r\n\r\n"Your pardon, Venus, Queen of Heaven, but Penury is the mother of\r\nwisdom. We have been slandered enough for that--so have mercy."\r\n\r\nThis allusion to an adventure in which they had both taken part, put\r\nthem into a jovial mood. They laughed loudly as they passed through the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThen, having settled his bill at the inn, Deslauriers walked back with\r\nFrederick as far as the crossway near the H\xf4tel-Dieu, and after a long\r\nembrace, the two friends parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSentiment and Passion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months later, Frederick, having debarked one morning in the Rue\r\nCoq-H\xe9ron, immediately thought of paying his great visit.\r\n\r\nChance came to his aid. P\xe8re Roque had brought him a roll of papers and\r\nrequested him to deliver them up himself to M. Dambreuse; and the worthy\r\nman accompanied the package with an open letter of introduction in\r\nbehalf of his young fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau appeared surprised at this proceeding. Frederick concealed\r\nthe delight that it gave him.\r\n\r\nM. Dambreuse\'s real name was the Count d\'Ambreuse; but since 1825,\r\ngradually abandoning his title of nobility and his party, he had turned\r\nhis attention to business; and with his ears open in every office, his\r\nhand in every enterprise, on the watch for every opportunity, as subtle\r\nas a Greek and as laborious as a native of Auvergne, he had amassed a\r\nfortune which might be called considerable. Furthermore, he was an\r\nofficer of the Legion of Honour, a member of the General Council of the\r\nAube, a deputy, and one of these days would be a peer of France.\r\nHowever, affable as he was in other respects, he wearied the Minister\r\nby his continual applications for relief, for crosses, and licences for\r\ntobacconists\' shops; and in his complaints against authority he was\r\ninclined to join the Left Centre.\r\n\r\nHis wife, the pretty Madame Dambreuse, of whom mention was made in the\r\nfashion journals, presided at charitable assemblies. By wheedling the\r\nduchesses, she appeased the rancours of the aristocratic faubourg, and\r\nled the residents to believe that M. Dambreuse might yet repent and\r\nrender them some services.\r\n\r\nThe young man was agitated when he called on them.\r\n\r\n"I should have done better to take my dress-coat with me. No doubt they\r\nwill give me an invitation to next week\'s ball. What will they say to\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nHis self-confidence returned when he reflected that M. Dambreuse was\r\nonly a person of the middle class, and he sprang out of the cab briskly\r\non the pavement of the Rue d\'Anjou.\r\n\r\nWhen he had pushed forward one of the two gateways he crossed the\r\ncourtyard, mounted the steps in front of the house, and entered a\r\nvestibule paved with coloured marble. A straight double staircase, with\r\nred carpet, fastened with copper rods, rested against the high walls of\r\nshining stucco. At the end of the stairs there was a banana-tree, whose\r\nwide leaves fell down over the velvet of the baluster. Two bronze\r\ncandelabra, with porcelain globes, hung from little chains; the\r\natmosphere was heavy with the fumes exhaled by the vent-holes of the\r\nhot-air stoves; and all that could be heard was the ticking of a big\r\nclock fixed at the other end of the vestibule, under a suit of armour.\r\n\r\nA bell rang; a valet made his appearance, and introduced Frederick into\r\na little apartment, where one could observe two strong boxes, with\r\npigeon-holes filled with pieces of pasteboard. In the centre of it, M.\r\nDambreuse was writing at a roll-top desk.\r\n\r\nHe ran his eye over P\xe8re Roque\'s letter, tore open the canvas in which\r\nthe papers had been wrapped, and examined them.\r\n\r\nAt some distance, he presented the appearance of being still young,\r\nowing to his slight figure. But his thin white hair, his feeble limbs,\r\nand, above all, the extraordinary pallor of his face, betrayed a\r\nshattered constitution. There was an expression of pitiless energy in\r\nhis sea-green eyes, colder than eyes of glass. His cheek-bones\r\nprojected, and his finger-joints were knotted.\r\n\r\nAt length, he arose and addressed to the young man a few questions with\r\nregard to persons of their acquaintance at Nogent and also with regard\r\nto his studies, and then dismissed him with a bow. Frederick went out\r\nthrough another lobby, and found himself at the lower end of the\r\ncourtyard near the coach-house.\r\n\r\nA blue brougham, to which a black horse was yoked, stood in front of the\r\nsteps before the house. The carriage door flew open, a lady sprang in,\r\nand the vehicle, with a rumbling noise, went rolling along the gravel.\r\nFrederick had come up to the courtyard gate from the other side at the\r\nsame moment. As there was not room enough to allow him to pass, he was\r\ncompelled to wait. The young lady, with her head thrust forward past the\r\ncarriage blind, talked to the door-keeper in a very low tone. All he\r\ncould see was her back, covered with a violet mantle. However, he took a\r\nglance into the interior of the carriage, lined with blue rep, with silk\r\nlace and fringes. The lady\'s ample robes filled up the space within. He\r\nstole away from this little padded box with its perfume of iris, and, so\r\nto speak, its vague odour of feminine elegance. The coachman slackened\r\nthe reins, the horse brushed abruptly past the starting-point, and all\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nFrederick returned on foot, following the track of the boulevard.\r\n\r\nHe regretted not having been able to get a proper view of Madame\r\nDambreuse. A little higher than the Rue Montmartre, a regular jumble of\r\nvehicles made him turn round his head, and on the opposite side, facing\r\nhim, he read on a marble plate:\r\n\r\n"JACQUES ARNOUX."\r\n\r\nHow was it that he had not thought about her sooner? It was Deslauriers\'\r\nfault; and he approached the shop, which, however, he did not enter. He\r\nwas waiting for _her_ to appear.\r\n\r\nThe high, transparent plate-glass windows presented to one\'s gaze\r\nstatuettes, drawings, engravings, catalogues and numbers of _L\'Art\r\nIndustriel_, arranged in a skilful fashion; and the amounts of the\r\nsubscription were repeated on the door, which was decorated in the\r\ncentre with the publisher\'s initials. Against the walls could be seen\r\nlarge pictures whose varnish had a shiny look, two chests laden with\r\nporcelain, bronze, alluring curiosities; a little staircase separated\r\nthem, shut off at the top by a Wilton porti\xe8re; and a lustre of old\r\nSaxe, a green carpet on the floor, with a table of marqueterie, gave to\r\nthis interior the appearance rather of a drawing-room than of a shop.\r\n\r\nFrederick pretended to be examining the drawings. After hesitating for a\r\nlong time, he went in. A clerk lifted the porti\xe8re, and in reply to a\r\nquestion, said that Monsieur would not be in the shop before five\r\no\'clock. But if the message could be conveyed----\r\n\r\n"No! I\'ll come back again," Frederick answered blandly.\r\n\r\nThe following days were spent in searching for lodgings; and he fixed\r\nupon an apartment in a second story of a furnished mansion in the Rue\r\nHyacinthe.\r\n\r\nWith a fresh blotting-case under his arm, he set forth to attend the\r\nopening lecture of the course. Three hundred young men, bare-headed,\r\nfilled an amphitheatre, where an old man in a red gown was delivering a\r\ndiscourse in a monotonous voice. Quill pens went scratching over the\r\npaper. In this hall he found once more the dusty odour of the school, a\r\nreading-desk of similar shape, the same wearisome monotony! For a\r\nfortnight he regularly continued his attendance at law lectures. But he\r\nleft off the study of the Civil Code before getting as far as Article 3,\r\nand he gave up the Institutes at the _Summa Divisio Personarum_.\r\n\r\nThe pleasures that he had promised himself did not come to him; and when\r\nhe had exhausted a circulating library, gone over the collections in the\r\nLouvre, and been at the theatre a great many nights in succession, he\r\nsank into the lowest depths of idleness.\r\n\r\nHis depression was increased by a thousand fresh annoyances. He found it\r\nnecessary to count his linen and to bear with the door keeper, a bore\r\nwith the figure of a male hospital nurse who came in the morning to make\r\nup his bed, smelling of alcohol and grunting. He did not like his\r\napartment, which was ornamented with an alabaster time-piece. The\r\npartitions were thin; he could hear the students making punch, laughing\r\nand singing.\r\n\r\nTired of this solitude, he sought out one of his old schoolfellows named\r\nBaptiste Martinon; and he discovered this friend of his boyhood in a\r\nmiddle-class boarding-house in the Rue Saint-Jacques, cramming up legal\r\nprocedure before a coal fire. A woman in a print dress sat opposite him\r\ndarning his socks.\r\n\r\nMartinon was what people call a very fine man--big, chubby, with a\r\nregular physiognomy, and blue eyes far up in his face. His father, an\r\nextensive land-owner, had destined him for the magistracy; and wishing\r\nalready to present a grave exterior, he wore his beard cut like a collar\r\nround his neck.\r\n\r\nAs there was no rational foundation for Frederick\'s complaints, and as\r\nhe could not give evidence of any misfortune, Martinon was unable in any\r\nway to understand his lamentations about existence. As for him, he went\r\nevery morning to the school, after that took a walk in the Luxembourg,\r\nin the evening swallowed his half-cup of coffee; and with fifteen\r\nhundred francs a year, and the love of this workwoman, he felt perfectly\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n"What happiness!" was Frederick\'s internal comment.\r\n\r\nAt the school he had formed another acquaintance, a youth of\r\naristocratic family, who on account of his dainty manners, suggested a\r\nresemblance to a young lady.\r\n\r\nM. de Cisy devoted himself to drawing, and loved the Gothic style. They\r\nfrequently went together to admire the Sainte-Chapelle and N\xf4tre Dame.\r\nBut the young patrician\'s rank and pretensions covered an intellect of\r\nthe feeblest order. Everything took him by surprise. He laughed\r\nimmoderately at the most trifling joke, and displayed such utter\r\nsimplicity that Frederick at first took him for a wag, and finally\r\nregarded him as a booby.\r\n\r\nThe young man found it impossible, therefore, to be effusive with\r\nanyone; and he was constantly looking forward to an invitation from the\r\nDambreuses.\r\n\r\nOn New Year\'s Day, he sent them visiting-cards, but received none in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nHe made his way back to the office of _L\'Art Industriel_.\r\n\r\nA third time he returned to it, and at last saw Arnoux carrying on an\r\nargument with five or six persons around him. He scarcely responded to\r\nthe young man\'s bow; and Frederick was wounded by this reception. None\r\nthe less he cogitated over the best means of finding his way to her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nHis first idea was to come frequently to the shop on the pretext of\r\ngetting pictures at low prices. Then he conceived the notion of slipping\r\ninto the letter-box of the journal a few "very strong" articles, which\r\nmight lead to friendly relations. Perhaps it would be better to go\r\nstraight to the mark at once, and declare his love? Acting on this\r\nimpulse, he wrote a letter covering a dozen pages, full of lyric\r\nmovements and apostrophes; but he tore it up, and did nothing, attempted\r\nnothing--bereft of motive power by his want of success.\r\n\r\nAbove Arnoux\'s shop, there were, on the first floor, three windows which\r\nwere lighted up every evening. Shadows might be seen moving about behind\r\nthem, especially one; this was hers; and he went very far out of his way\r\nin order to gaze at these windows and to contemplate this shadow.\r\n\r\nA negress who crossed his path one day in the Tuileries, holding a\r\nlittle girl by the hand, recalled to his mind Madame Arnoux\'s negress.\r\nShe was sure to come there, like the others; every time he passed\r\nthrough the Tuileries, his heart began to beat with the anticipation of\r\nmeeting her. On sunny days he continued his walk as far as the end of\r\nthe Champs-\xc9lys\xe9es.\r\n\r\nWomen seated with careless ease in open carriages, and with their veils\r\nfloating in the wind, filed past close to him, their horses advancing at\r\na steady walking pace, and with an unconscious see-saw movement that\r\nmade the varnished leather of the harness crackle. The vehicles became\r\nmore numerous, and, slackening their motion after they had passed the\r\ncircular space where the roads met, they took up the entire track. The\r\nhorses\' manes and the carriage lamps were close to each other. The steel\r\nstirrups, the silver curbs and the brass rings, flung, here and there,\r\nluminous points in the midst of the short breeches, the white gloves,\r\nand the furs, falling over the blazonry of the carriage doors. He felt\r\nas if he were lost in some far-off world. His eyes wandered along the\r\nrows of female heads, and certain vague resemblances brought back Madame\r\nArnoux to his recollection. He pictured her to himself, in the midst of\r\nthe others, in one of those little broughams like Madame Dambreuse\'s\r\nbrougham.\r\n\r\nBut the sun was setting, and the cold wind raised whirling clouds of\r\ndust. The coachmen let their chins sink into their neckcloths; the\r\nwheels began to revolve more quickly; the road-metal grated; and all the\r\nequipages descended the long sloping avenue at a quick trot, touching,\r\nsweeping past one another, getting out of one another\'s way; then, at\r\nthe Place de la Concorde, they went off in different directions. Behind\r\nthe Tuileries, there was a patch of slate-coloured sky. The trees of the\r\ngarden formed two enormous masses violet-hued at their summits. The\r\ngas-lamps were lighted; and the Seine, green all over, was torn into\r\nstrips of silver moir\xe9, near the piers of the bridges.\r\n\r\nHe went to get a dinner for forty-three sous in a restaurant in the Rue\r\nde la Harpe. He glanced disdainfully at the old mahogany counter, the\r\nsoiled napkins, the dingy silver-plate, and the hats hanging up on the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThose around him were students like himself. They talked about their\r\nprofessors, and about their mistresses. Much he cared about professors!\r\nHad he a mistress? To avoid being a witness of their enjoyment, he came\r\nas late as possible. The tables were all strewn with remnants of food.\r\nThe two waiters, worn out with attendance on customers, lay asleep, each\r\nin a corner of his own; and an odour of cooking, of an argand lamp, and\r\nof tobacco, filled the deserted dining-room. Then he slowly toiled up\r\nthe streets again. The gas lamps vibrated, casting on the mud long\r\nyellowish shafts of flickering light. Shadowy forms surmounted by\r\numbrellas glided along the footpaths. The pavement was slippery; the fog\r\ngrew thicker, and it seemed to him that the moist gloom, wrapping him\r\naround, descended into the depths of his heart.\r\n\r\nHe was smitten with a vague remorse. He renewed his attendance at\r\nlectures. But as he was entirely ignorant of the matters which formed\r\nthe subject of explanation, things of the simplest description puzzled\r\nhim. He set about writing a novel entitled _Sylvio, the Fisherman\'s\r\nSon_. The scene of the story was Venice. The hero was himself, and\r\nMadame Arnoux was the heroine. She was called Antonia; and, to get\r\npossession of her, he assassinated a number of noblemen, and burned a\r\nportion of the city; after which achievements he sang a serenade under\r\nher balcony, where fluttered in the breeze the red damask curtains of\r\nthe Boulevard Montmartre.\r\n\r\nThe reminiscences, far too numerous, on which he dwelt produced a\r\ndisheartening effect on him; he went no further with the work, and his\r\nmental vacuity redoubled.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he begged of Deslauriers to come and share his apartment.\r\nThey might make arrangements to live together with the aid of his\r\nallowance of two thousand francs; anything would be better than this\r\nintolerable existence. Deslauriers could not yet leave Troyes. He urged\r\nhis friend to find some means of distracting his thoughts, and, with\r\nthat end in view, suggested that he should call on S\xe9n\xe9cal.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal was a mathematical tutor, a hard-headed man with republican\r\nconvictions, a future Saint-Just, according to the clerk. Frederick\r\nascended the five flights, up which he lived, three times in succession,\r\nwithout getting a visit from him in return. He did not go back to the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHe now went in for amusing himself. He attended the balls at the Opera\r\nHouse. These exhibitions of riotous gaiety froze him the moment he had\r\npassed the door. Besides, he was restrained by the fear of being\r\nsubjected to insult on the subject of money, his notion being that a\r\nsupper with a domino, entailing considerable expense, was rather a big\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him, however, that he must needs love her. Sometimes he\r\nused to wake up with his heart full of hope, dressed himself carefully\r\nas if he were going to keep an appointment, and started on interminable\r\nexcursions all over Paris. Whenever a woman was walking in front of him,\r\nor coming in his direction, he would say: "Here she is!" Every time it\r\nwas only a fresh disappointment. The idea of Madame Arnoux strengthened\r\nthese desires. Perhaps he might find her on his way; and he conjured up\r\ndangerous complications, extraordinary perils from which he would save\r\nher, in order to get near her.\r\n\r\nSo the days slipped by with the same tiresome experiences, and\r\nenslavement to contracted habits. He turned over the pages of pamphlets\r\nunder the arcades of the Od\xe9on, went to read the _Revue des Deux Mondes_\r\nat the caf\xe9, entered the hall of the Coll\xe9ge de France, and for an hour\r\nstopped to listen to a lecture on Chinese or political economy. Every\r\nweek he wrote long letters to Deslauriers, dined from time to time with\r\nMartinon, and occasionally saw M. de Cisy. He hired a piano and composed\r\nGerman waltzes.\r\n\r\nOne evening at the theatre of the Palais-Royal, he perceived, in one of\r\nthe stage-boxes, Arnoux with a woman by his side. Was it she? The screen\r\nof green taffeta, pulled over the side of the box, hid her face. At\r\nlength, the curtain rose, and the screen was drawn aside. She was a tall\r\nwoman of about thirty, rather faded, and, when she laughed, her thick\r\nlips uncovered a row of shining teeth. She chatted familiarly with\r\nArnoux, giving him, from time to time, taps, with her fan, on the\r\nfingers. Then a fair-haired young girl with eyelids a little red, as if\r\nshe had just been weeping, seated herself between them. Arnoux after\r\nthat remained stooped over her shoulder, pouring forth a stream of talk\r\nto which she listened without replying. Frederick taxed his ingenuity to\r\nfind out the social position of these women, modestly attired in gowns\r\nof sober hue with flat, turned-up collars.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the play, he made a dash for the passages. The crowd of\r\npeople going out filled them up. Arnoux, just in front of him, was\r\ndescending the staircase step by step, with a woman on each arm.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a gas-burner shed its light on him. He wore a crape hat-band.\r\nShe was dead, perhaps? This idea tormented Frederick\'s mind so much,\r\nthat he hurried, next day, to the office of _L\'Art Industriel_, and\r\npaying, without a moment\'s delay, for one of the engravings exposed in\r\nthe window for sale, he asked the shop-assistant how was Monsieur\r\nArnoux.\r\n\r\nThe shop-assistant replied:\r\n\r\n"Why, quite well!"\r\n\r\nFrederick, growing pale, added:\r\n\r\n"And Madame?"\r\n\r\n"Madame, also."\r\n\r\nFrederick forgot to carry off his engraving.\r\n\r\nThe winter drew to an end. He was less melancholy in the spring time,\r\nand began to prepare for his examination. Having passed it\r\nindifferently, he started immediately afterwards for Nogent.\r\n\r\nHe refrained from going to Troyes to see his friend, in order to escape\r\nhis mother\'s comments. Then, on his return to Paris at the end of the\r\nvacation, he left his lodgings, and took two rooms on the Quai Napol\xe9on\r\nwhich he furnished. He had given up all hope of getting an invitation\r\nfrom the Dambreuses. His great passion for Madame Arnoux was beginning\r\nto die out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe Inexpressible She!\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, in the month of December, while going to attend a law\r\nlecture, he thought he could observe more than ordinary animation in the\r\nRue Saint-Jacques. The students were rushing precipitately out of the\r\ncaf\xe9s, where, through the open windows, they were calling one another\r\nfrom one house to the other. The shop keepers in the middle of the\r\nfootpath were looking about them anxiously; the window-shutters were\r\nfastened; and when he reached the Rue Soufflot, he perceived a large\r\nassemblage around the Panth\xe9on.\r\n\r\nYoung men in groups numbering from five to a dozen walked along, arm in\r\narm, and accosted the larger groups, which had stationed themselves here\r\nand there. At the lower end of the square, near the railings, men in\r\nblouses were holding forth, while policemen, with their three-cornered\r\nhats drawn over their ears, and their hands behind their backs, were\r\nstrolling up and down beside the walls making the flags ring under the\r\ntread of their heavy boots. All wore a mysterious, wondering look; they\r\nwere evidently expecting something to happen. Each held back a question\r\nwhich was on the edge of his lips.\r\n\r\nFrederick found himself close to a fair-haired young man with a\r\nprepossessing face and a moustache and a tuft of beard on his chin, like\r\na dandy of Louis XIII.\'s time. He asked the stranger what was the cause\r\nof the disorder.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea," replied the other, "nor have they, for that\r\nmatter! \'Tis their fashion just now! What a good joke!"\r\n\r\nAnd he burst out laughing. The petitions for Reform, which had been\r\nsigned at the quarters of the National Guard, together with the\r\nproperty-census of Humann and other events besides, had, for the past\r\nsix months, led to inexplicable gatherings of riotous crowds in Paris,\r\nand so frequently had they broken out anew, that the newspapers had\r\nceased to refer to them.\r\n\r\n"This lacks graceful outline and colour," continued Frederick\'s\r\nneighbour. "I am convinced, messire, that we have degenerated. In the\r\ngood epoch of Louis XI., and even in that of Benjamin Constant, there\r\nwas more mutinousness amongst the students. I find them as pacific as\r\nsheep, as stupid as greenhorns, and only fit to be grocers. Gadzooks!\r\nAnd these are what we call the youth of the schools!"\r\n\r\nHe held his arms wide apart after the fashion of Frederick Lemaitre in\r\n_Robert Macaire_.\r\n\r\n"Youth of the schools, I give you my blessing!"\r\n\r\nAfter this, addressing a rag picker, who was moving a heap of\r\noyster-shells up against the wall of a wine-merchant\'s house:\r\n\r\n"Do you belong to them--the youth of the schools?"\r\n\r\nThe old man lifted up a hideous countenance in which one could trace, in\r\nthe midst of a grey beard, a red nose and two dull eyes, bloodshot from\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n"No, you appear to me rather one of those men with patibulary faces whom\r\nwe see, in various groups, liberally scattering gold. Oh, scatter it, my\r\npatriarch, scatter it! Corrupt me with the treasures of Albion! Are you\r\nEnglish? I do not reject the presents of Artaxerxes! Let us have a\r\nlittle chat about the union of customs!"\r\n\r\nFrederick felt a hand laid on his shoulder. It was Martinon, looking\r\nexceedingly pale.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said he with a big sigh, "another riot!"\r\n\r\nHe was afraid of being compromised, and uttered complaints. Men in\r\nblouses especially made him feel uneasy, suggesting a connection with\r\nsecret societies.\r\n\r\n"You mean to say there are secret societies," said the young man with\r\nthe moustaches. "That is a worn-out dodge of the Government to frighten\r\nthe middle-class folk!"\r\n\r\nMartinon urged him to speak in a lower tone, for fear of the police.\r\n\r\n"You believe still in the police, do you? As a matter of fact, how do\r\nyou know, Monsieur, that I am not myself a police spy?"\r\n\r\nAnd he looked at him in such a way, that Martinon, much discomposed,\r\nwas, at first, unable to see the joke. The people pushed them on, and\r\nthey were all three compelled to stand on the little staircase which\r\nled, by one of the passages, to the new amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nThe crowd soon broke up of its own accord. Many heads could be\r\ndistinguished. They bowed towards the distinguished Professor Samuel\r\nRondelot, who, wrapped in his big frock-coat, with his silver spectacles\r\nheld up high in the air, and breathing hard from his asthma, was\r\nadvancing at an easy pace, on his way to deliver his lecture. This man\r\nwas one of the judicial glories of the nineteenth century, the rival of\r\nthe Zachari\xe6s and the Ruhdorffs. His new dignity of peer of France had\r\nin no way modified his external demeanour. He was known to be poor, and\r\nwas treated with profound respect.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the lower end of the square, some persons cried out:\r\n\r\n"Down with Guizot!"\r\n\r\n"Down with Pritchard!"\r\n\r\n"Down with the sold ones!"\r\n\r\n"Down with Louis Philippe!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd swayed to and fro, and, pressing against the gate of the\r\ncourtyard, which was shut, prevented the professor from going further.\r\nHe stopped in front of the staircase. He was speedily observed on the\r\nlowest of three steps. He spoke; the loud murmurs of the throng drowned\r\nhis voice. Although at another time they might love him, they hated him\r\nnow, for he was the representative of authority. Every time he tried to\r\nmake himself understood, the outcries recommenced. He gesticulated with\r\ngreat energy to induce the students to follow him. He was answered by\r\nvociferations from all sides. He shrugged his shoulders disdainfully,\r\nand plunged into the passage. Martinon profited by his situation to\r\ndisappear at the same moment.\r\n\r\n"What a coward!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"He was prudent," returned the other.\r\n\r\nThere was an outburst of applause from the crowd, from whose point of\r\nview this retreat, on the part of the professor, appeared in the light\r\nof a victory. From every window, faces, lighted with curiosity, looked\r\nout. Some of those in the crowd struck up the "Marseillaise;" others\r\nproposed to go to B\xe9ranger\'s house.\r\n\r\n"To Laffitte\'s house!"\r\n\r\n"To Chateaubriand\'s house!"\r\n\r\n"To Voltaire\'s house!" yelled the young man with the fair moustaches.\r\n\r\nThe policemen tried to pass around, saying in the mildest tones they\r\ncould assume:\r\n\r\n"Move on, messieurs! Move on! Take yourselves off!"\r\n\r\nSomebody exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Down with the slaughterers!"\r\n\r\nThis was a form of insult usual since the troubles of the month of\r\nSeptember. Everyone echoed it. The guardians of public order were hooted\r\nand hissed. They began to grow pale. One of them could endure it no\r\nlonger, and, seeing a low-sized young man approaching too close,\r\nlaughing in his teeth, pushed him back so roughly, that he tumbled over\r\non his back some five paces away, in front of a wine-merchant\'s shop.\r\nAll made way; but almost immediately afterwards the policeman rolled on\r\nthe ground himself, felled by a blow from a species of Hercules, whose\r\nhair hung down like a bundle of tow under an oilskin cap. Having stopped\r\nfor a few minutes at the corner of the Rue Saint-Jacques, he had very\r\nquickly laid down a large case, which he had been carrying, in order to\r\nmake a spring at the policeman, and, holding down that functionary,\r\npunched his face unmercifully. The other policemen rushed to the rescue\r\nof their comrade. The terrible shop-assistant was so powerfully built\r\nthat it took four of them at least to get the better of him. Two of them\r\nshook him, while keeping a grip on his collar; two others dragged his\r\narms; a fifth gave him digs of the knee in the ribs; and all of them\r\ncalled him "brigand," "assassin," "rioter." With his breast bare, and\r\nhis clothes in rags, he protested that he was innocent; he could not, in\r\ncold blood, look at a child receiving a beating.\r\n\r\n"My name is Dussardier. I\'m employed at Messieurs Valincart Brothers\'\r\nlace and fancy warehouse, in the Rue de Cl\xe9ry. Where\'s my case? I want\r\nmy case!"\r\n\r\nHe kept repeating:\r\n\r\n"Dussardier, Rue de Cl\xe9ry. My case!"\r\n\r\nHowever, he became quiet, and, with a stoical air, allowed himself to be\r\nled towards the guard-house in the Rue Descartes. A flood of people came\r\nrushing after him. Frederick and the young man with the moustaches\r\nwalked immediately behind, full of admiration for the shopman, and\r\nindignant at the violence of power.\r\n\r\nAs they advanced, the crowd became less thick.\r\n\r\nThe policemen from time to time turned round, with threatening looks;\r\nand the rowdies, no longer having anything to do, and the spectators not\r\nhaving anything to look at, all drifted away by degrees. The passers-by,\r\nwho met the procession, as they came along, stared at Dussardier, and in\r\nloud tones, gave vent to abusive remarks about him. One old woman, at\r\nher own door, bawled out that he had stolen a loaf of bread from her.\r\nThis unjust accusation increased the wrath of the two friends. At\r\nlength, they reached the guard-house. Only about twenty persons were\r\nnow left in the attenuated crowd, and the sight of the soldiers was\r\nenough to disperse them.\r\n\r\nFrederick and his companion boldly asked to have the man who had just\r\nbeen imprisoned delivered up. The sentinel threatened, if they\r\npersisted, to ram them into jail too. They said they required to see the\r\ncommander of the guard-house, and stated their names, and the fact that\r\nthey were law-students, declaring that the prisoner was one also.\r\n\r\nThey were ushered into a room perfectly bare, in which, amid an\r\natmosphere of smoke, four benches might be seen lining the\r\nroughly-plastered walls. At the lower end there was an open wicket. Then\r\nappeared the sturdy face of Dussardier, who, with his hair all tousled,\r\nhis honest little eyes, and his broad snout, suggested to one\'s mind in\r\na confused sort of way the physiognomy of a good dog.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you recognise us?" said Hussonnet.\r\n\r\nThis was the name of the young man with the moustaches.\r\n\r\n"Why----" stammered Dussardier.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t play the fool any further," returned the other. "We know that you\r\nare, just like ourselves, a law-student."\r\n\r\nIn spite of their winks, Dussardier failed to understand. He appeared to\r\nbe collecting his thoughts; then, suddenly:\r\n\r\n"Has my case been found?"\r\n\r\nFrederick raised his eyes, feeling much discouraged.\r\n\r\nHussonnet, however, said promptly:\r\n\r\n"Ha! your case, in which you keep your notes of lectures? Yes, yes, make\r\nyour mind easy about it!"\r\n\r\nThey made further pantomimic signs with redoubled energy, till\r\nDussardier at last realised that they had come to help him; and he held\r\nhis tongue, fearing that he might compromise them. Besides, he\r\nexperienced a kind of shamefacedness at seeing himself raised to the\r\nsocial rank of student, and to an equality with those young men who had\r\nsuch white hands.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to send any message to anyone?" asked Frederick.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks, to nobody."\r\n\r\n"But your family?"\r\n\r\nHe lowered his head without replying; the poor fellow was a bastard. The\r\ntwo friends stood quite astonished at his silence.\r\n\r\n"Have you anything to smoke?" was Frederick\'s next question.\r\n\r\nHe felt about, then drew forth from the depths of one of his pockets the\r\nremains of a pipe--a beautiful pipe, made of white talc with a shank of\r\nblackwood, a silver cover, and an amber mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years he had been engaged in completing this\r\nmasterpiece. He had been careful to keep the bowl of it constantly\r\nthrust into a kind of sheath of chamois, to smoke it as slowly as\r\npossible, without ever letting it lie on any cold stone substance, and\r\nto hang it up every evening over the head of his bed. And now he shook\r\nout the fragments of it into his hand, the nails of which were covered\r\nwith blood, and with his chin sunk on his chest, his pupils fixed and\r\ndilated, he contemplated this wreck of the thing that had yielded him\r\nsuch delight with a glance of unutterable sadness.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we give him some cigars, eh?" said Hussonnet in a whisper,\r\nmaking a gesture as if he were reaching them out.\r\n\r\nFrederick had already laid down a cigar-holder, filled, on the edge of\r\nthe wicket.\r\n\r\n"Pray take this. Good-bye! Cheer up!"\r\n\r\nDussardier flung himself on the two hands that were held out towards\r\nhim. He pressed them frantically, his voice choked with sobs.\r\n\r\n"What? For me!--for me!"\r\n\r\nThe two friends tore themselves away from the effusive display of\r\ngratitude which he made, and went off to lunch together at the Caf\xe9\r\nTabourey, in front of the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nWhile cutting up the beefsteak, Hussonnet informed his companion that he\r\ndid work for the fashion journals, and manufactured catchwords for\r\n_L\'Art Industriel_.\r\n\r\n"At Jacques Arnoux\'s establishment?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Do you know him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!--no!--that is to say, I have seen him--I have met him."\r\n\r\nHe carelessly asked Hussonnet if he sometimes saw Arnoux\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"From time to time," the Bohemian replied.\r\n\r\nFrederick did not venture to follow up his enquiries. This man\r\nhenceforth would fill up a large space in his life. He paid the\r\nlunch-bill without any protest on the other\'s part.\r\n\r\nThere was a bond of mutual sympathy between them; they gave one another\r\ntheir respective addresses, and Hussonnet cordially invited Frederick to\r\naccompany him to the Rue de Fleurus.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the middle of the garden, when Arnoux\'s clerk, holding\r\nhis breath, twisted his features into a hideous grimace, and began to\r\ncrow like a cock. Thereupon all the cocks in the vicinity responded\r\nwith prolonged "cock-a-doodle-doos."\r\n\r\n"It is a signal," explained Hussonnet.\r\n\r\nThey stopped close to the Th\xe9\xe0tre Bobino, in front of a house to which\r\nthey had to find their way through an alley. In the skylight of a\r\ngarret, between the nasturtiums and the sweet peas, a young woman showed\r\nherself, bare-headed, in her stays, her two arms resting on the edge of\r\nthe roof-gutter.\r\n\r\n"Good-morrow, my angel! good-morrow, ducky!" said Hussonnet, sending her\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\nHe made the barrier fly open with a kick, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nFrederick waited for him all the week. He did not venture to call at\r\nHussonnet\'s residence, lest it might look as if he were in a hurry to\r\nget a lunch in return for the one he had paid for. But he sought the\r\nclerk all over the Latin Quarter. He came across him one evening, and\r\nbrought him to his apartment on the Quai Napol\xe9on.\r\n\r\nThey had a long chat, and unbosomed themselves to each other. Hussonnet\r\nyearned after the glory and the gains of the theatre. He collaborated in\r\nthe writing of vaudevilles which were not accepted, "had heaps of\r\nplans," could turn a couplet; he sang out for Frederick a few of the\r\nverses he had composed. Then, noticing on one of the shelves a volume of\r\nHugo and another of Lamartine, he broke out into sarcastic criticisms of\r\nthe romantic school. These poets had neither good sense nor correctness,\r\nand, above all, were not French! He plumed himself on his knowledge of\r\nthe language, and analysed the most beautiful phrases with that snarling\r\nseverity, that academic taste which persons of playful disposition\r\nexhibit when they are discussing serious art.\r\n\r\nFrederick was wounded in his predilections, and he felt a desire to cut\r\nthe discussion short. Why not take the risk at once of uttering the word\r\non which his happiness depended? He asked this literary youth whether it\r\nwould be possible to get an introduction into the Arnoux\'s house through\r\nhis agency.\r\n\r\nThe thing was declared to be quite easy, and they fixed upon the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nHussonnet failed to keep the appointment, and on three subsequent\r\noccasions he did not turn up. One Saturday, about four o\'clock, he made\r\nhis appearance. But, taking advantage of the cab into which they had\r\ngot, he drew up in front of the Th\xe9\xe0tre Fran\xe7ais to get a box-ticket,\r\ngot down at a tailor\'s shop, then at a dressmaker\'s, and wrote notes in\r\nthe door-keeper\'s lodge. At last they came to the Boulevard Montmartre.\r\nFrederick passed through the shop, and went up the staircase. Arnoux\r\nrecognised him through the glass-partition in front of his desk, and\r\nwhile continuing to write he stretched out his hand and laid it on\r\nFrederick\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\nFive or six persons, standing up, filled the narrow apartment, which was\r\nlighted by a single window looking out on the yard, a sofa of brown\r\ndamask wool occupying the interior of an alcove between two\r\ndoor-curtains of similar material. Upon the chimney-piece, covered with\r\nold papers, there was a bronze Venus. Two candelabra, garnished with\r\nrose-coloured wax-tapers, supported it, one at each side. At the right\r\nnear a cardboard chest of drawers, a man, seated in an armchair, was\r\nreading the newspaper, with his hat on. The walls were hidden from view\r\nbeneath the array of prints and pictures, precious engravings or\r\nsketches by contemporary masters, adorned with dedications testifying\r\nthe most sincere affection for Jacques Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"You\'re getting on well all this time?" said he, turning round to\r\nFrederick.\r\n\r\nAnd, without waiting for an answer, he asked Hussonnet in a low tone:\r\n\r\n"What is your friend\'s name?" Then, raising his voice:\r\n\r\n"Take a cigar out of the box on the cardboard stand."\r\n\r\nThe office of _L\'Art Industriel_, situated in a central position in\r\nParis, was a convenient place of resort, a neutral ground wherein\r\nrivalries elbowed each other familiarly. On this day might be seen there\r\nAnt\xe9nor Braive, who painted portraits of kings; Jules Burrieu, who by\r\nhis sketches was beginning to popularise the wars in Algeria; the\r\ncaricaturist Sombary, the sculptor Vourdat, and others. And not a single\r\none of them corresponded with the student\'s preconceived ideas. Their\r\nmanners were simple, their talk free and easy. The mystic Lovarias told\r\nan obscene story; and the inventor of Oriental landscape, the famous\r\nDittmer, wore a knitted shirt under his waistcoat, and went home in the\r\nomnibus.\r\n\r\nThe first topic that came on the carpet was the case of a girl named\r\nApollonie, formerly a model, whom Burrieu alleged that he had seen on\r\nthe boulevard in a carriage. Hussonnet explained this metamorphosis\r\nthrough the succession of persons who had loved her.\r\n\r\n"How well this sly dog knows the girls of Paris!" said Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"After you, if there are any of them left, sire," replied the Bohemian,\r\nwith a military salute, in imitation of the grenadier offering his flask\r\nto Napol\xe9on.\r\n\r\nThen they talked about some pictures in which Apollonie had sat for the\r\nfemale figures. They criticised their absent brethren, expressing\r\nastonishment at the sums paid for their works; and they were all\r\ncomplaining of not having been sufficiently remunerated themselves, when\r\nthe conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a man of middle\r\nstature, who had his coat fastened by a single button, and whose eyes\r\nglittered with a rather wild expression.\r\n\r\n"What a lot of shopkeepers you are!" said he. "God bless my soul! what\r\ndoes that signify? The old masters did not trouble their heads about the\r\nmillion--Correggio, Murillo----"\r\n\r\n"Add Pellerin," said Sombary.\r\n\r\nBut, without taking the slightest notice of the epigram, he went on\r\ntalking with such vehemence, that Arnoux was forced to repeat twice to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n"My wife wants you on Thursday. Don\'t forget!"\r\n\r\nThis remark recalled Madame Arnoux to Frederick\'s thoughts. No doubt,\r\none might be able to reach her through the little room near the sofa.\r\nArnoux had just opened the porti\xe8re leading into it to get a\r\npocket-handkerchief, and Fr\xe9d\xe9ric had seen a wash-stand at the far end\r\nof the apartment.\r\n\r\nBut at this point a kind of muttering sound came from the corner of the\r\nchimney-piece; it was caused by the personage who sat in the armchair\r\nreading the newspaper. He was a man of five feet nine inches in height,\r\nwith rather heavy eyelashes, a head of grey hair, and an imposing\r\nappearance; and his name was Regimbart.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now, citizen?" said Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Another fresh piece of rascality on the part of Government!"\r\n\r\nThe thing that he was referring to was the dismissal of a schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nPellerin again took up his parallel between Michael Angelo and\r\nShakespeare. Dittmer was taking himself off when Arnoux pulled him back\r\nin order to put two bank notes into his hand. Thereupon Hussonnet said,\r\nconsidering this an opportune time:\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you give me an advance, my dear master----?"\r\n\r\nBut Arnoux had resumed his seat, and was administering a severe\r\nreprimand to an old man of mean aspect, who wore a pair of blue\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n"Ha! a nice fellow you are, P\xe8re Isaac! Here are three works cried down,\r\ndestroyed! Everybody is laughing at me! People know what they are now!\r\nWhat do you want me to do with them? I\'ll have to send them off to\r\nCalifornia--or to the devil! Hold your tongue!"\r\n\r\nThe specialty of this old worthy consisted in attaching the signatures\r\nof the great masters at the bottom of these pictures. Arnoux refused to\r\npay him, and dismissed him in a brutal fashion. Then, with an entire\r\nchange of manner, he bowed to a gentleman of affectedly grave demeanour,\r\nwho wore whiskers and displayed a white tie round his neck and the cross\r\nof the Legion of Honour over his breast.\r\n\r\nWith his elbow resting on the window-fastening, he kept talking to him\r\nfor a long time in honeyed tones. At last he burst out:\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, I am not bothered with brokers, Count."\r\n\r\nThe nobleman gave way, and Arnoux paid him down twenty-five louis. As\r\nsoon as he had gone out:\r\n\r\n"What a plague these big lords are!"\r\n\r\n"A lot of wretches!" muttered Regimbart.\r\n\r\nAs it grew later, Arnoux was much more busily occupied. He classified\r\narticles, tore open letters, set out accounts in a row; at the sound of\r\nhammering in the warehouse he went out to look after the packing; then\r\nhe went back to his ordinary work; and, while he kept his steel pen\r\nrunning over the paper, he indulged in sharp witticisms. He had an\r\ninvitation to dine with his lawyer that evening, and was starting next\r\nday for Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe others chatted about the topics of the day--Cherubini\'s portrait,\r\nthe hemicycle of the Fine Arts, and the next Exhibition. Pellerin railed\r\nat the Institute. Scandalous stories and serious discussions got mixed\r\nup together. The apartment with its low ceiling was so much stuffed up\r\nthat one could scarcely move; and the light of the rose-coloured\r\nwax-tapers was obscured in the smoke of their cigars, like the sun\'s\r\nrays in a fog.\r\n\r\nThe door near the sofa flew open, and a tall, thin woman entered with\r\nabrupt movements, which made all the trinkets of her watch rattle under\r\nher black taffeta gown.\r\n\r\nIt was the woman of whom Frederick had caught a glimpse last summer at\r\nthe Palais-Royal. Some of those present, addressing her by name, shook\r\nhands with her. Hussonnet had at last managed to extract from his\r\nemployer the sum of fifty francs. The clock struck seven.\r\n\r\nAll rose to go.\r\n\r\nArnoux told Pellerin to remain, and accompanied Mademoiselle Vatnaz into\r\nthe dressing-room.\r\n\r\nFrederick could not hear what they said; they spoke in whispers.\r\nHowever, the woman\'s voice was raised:\r\n\r\n"I have been waiting ever since the job was done, six months ago."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, and then Mademoiselle Vatnaz reappeared.\r\nArnoux had again promised her something.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! later, we shall see!"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye! happy man," said she, as she was going out.\r\n\r\nArnoux quickly re-entered the dressing-room, rubbed some cosmetic over\r\nhis moustaches, raised his braces, stretched his straps; and, while he\r\nwas washing his hands:\r\n\r\n"I would require two over the door at two hundred and fifty apiece, in\r\nBoucher\'s style. Is that understood?"\r\n\r\n"Be it so," said the artist, his face reddening.\r\n\r\n"Good! and don\'t forget my wife!"\r\n\r\nFrederick accompanied Pellerin to the top of the Faubourg Poissonni\xe8re,\r\nand asked his permission to come to see him sometimes, a favour which\r\nwas graciously accorded.\r\n\r\nPellerin read every work on \xe6sthetics, in order to find out the true\r\ntheory of the Beautiful, convinced that, when he had discovered it, he\r\nwould produce masterpieces. He surrounded himself with every imaginable\r\nauxiliary--drawings, plaster-casts, models, engravings; and he kept\r\nsearching about, eating his heart out. He blamed the weather, his\r\nnerves, his studio, went out into the street to find inspiration there,\r\nquivered with delight at the thought that he had caught it, then\r\nabandoned the work in which he was engaged, and dreamed of another which\r\nshould be finer. Thus, tormented by the desire for glory, and wasting\r\nhis days in discussions, believing in a thousand fooleries--in systems,\r\nin criticisms, in the importance of a regulation or a reform in the\r\ndomain of Art--he had at fifty as yet turned out nothing save mere\r\nsketches. His robust pride prevented him from experiencing any\r\ndiscouragement, but he was always irritated, and in that state of\r\nexaltation, at the same time factitious and natural, which is\r\ncharacteristic of comedians.\r\n\r\nOn entering his studio one\'s attention was directed towards two large\r\npictures, in which the first tones of colour laid on here and there made\r\non the white canvas spots of brown, red, and blue. A network of lines in\r\nchalk stretched overhead, like stitches of thread repeated twenty times;\r\nit was impossible to understand what it meant. Pellerin explained the\r\nsubject of these two compositions by pointing out with his thumb the\r\nportions that were lacking. The first was intended to represent "The\r\nMadness of Nebuchadnezzar," and the second "The Burning of Rome by\r\nNero." Frederick admired them.\r\n\r\nHe admired academies of women with dishevelled hair, landscapes in which\r\ntrunks of trees, twisted by the storm, abounded, and above all freaks of\r\nthe pen, imitations from memory of Callot, Rembrandt, or Goya, of which\r\nhe did not know the models. Pellerin no longer set any value on these\r\nworks of his youth. He was now all in favour of the grand style; he\r\ndogmatised eloquently about Phidias and Winckelmann. The objects around\r\nhim strengthened the force of his language; one saw a death\'s head on a\r\nprie-dieu, yataghans, a monk\'s habit. Frederick put it on.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived early, he surprised the artist in his wretched\r\nfolding-bed, which was hidden from view by a strip of tapestry; for\r\nPellerin went to bed late, being an assiduous frequenter of the\r\ntheatres. An old woman in tatters attended on him. He dined at a\r\ncook-shop, and lived without a mistress. His acquirements, picked up in\r\nthe most irregular fashion, rendered his paradoxes amusing. His hatred\r\nof the vulgar and the "bourgeois" overflowed in sarcasms, marked by a\r\nsuperb lyricism, and he had such religious reverence for the masters\r\nthat it raised him almost to their level.\r\n\r\nBut why had he never spoken about Madame Arnoux? As for her son, at one\r\ntime he called Pellerin a decent fellow, at other times a charlatan.\r\nFrederick was waiting for some disclosures on his part.\r\n\r\nOne day, while turning over one of the portfolios in the studio, he\r\nthought he could trace in the portrait of a female Bohemian some\r\nresemblance to Mademoiselle Vatnaz; and, as he felt interested in this\r\nlady, he desired to know what was her exact social position.\r\n\r\nShe had been, as far as Pellerin could ascertain, originally a\r\nschoolmistress in the provinces. She now gave lessons in Paris, and\r\ntried to write for the small journals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Frederick, one would imagine from her manners with Arnoux\r\nthat she was his mistress.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! he has others!"\r\n\r\nThen, turning away his face, which reddened with shame as he realised\r\nthe baseness of the suggestion, the young man added, with a swaggering\r\nair:\r\n\r\n"Very likely his wife pays him back for it?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all; she is virtuous."\r\n\r\nFrederick again experienced a feeling of compunction, and the result was\r\nthat his attendance at the office of the art journal became more marked\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nThe big letters which formed the name of Arnoux on the marble plate\r\nabove the shop seemed to him quite peculiar and pregnant with\r\nsignificance, like some sacred writing. The wide footpath, by its\r\ndescent, facilitated his approach; the door almost turned of its own\r\naccord; and the handle, smooth to the touch, gave him the sensation of\r\nfriendly and, as it were, intelligent fingers clasping his.\r\nUnconsciously, he became quite as punctual as Regimbart.\r\n\r\nEvery day Regimbart seated himself in the chimney corner, in his\r\narmchair, got hold of the _National_, and kept possession of it,\r\nexpressing his thoughts by exclamations or by shrugs of the\r\nshoulders. From time to time he would wipe his forehead with his\r\npocket-handkerchief, rolled up in a ball, which he usually stuck in\r\nbetween two buttons of his green frock-coat. He had trousers with\r\nwrinkles, bluchers, and a long cravat; and his hat, with its turned-up\r\nbrim, made him easily recognised, at a distance, in a crowd.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock in the morning he descended the heights of Montmartre,\r\nin order to imbibe white wine in the Rue N\xf4tre Dame des Victoires. A\r\nlate breakfast, following several games of billiards, brought him on to\r\nthree o\'clock. He then directed his steps towards the Passage des\r\nPanoramas, where he had a glass of absinthe. After the sitting in\r\nArnoux\'s shop, he entered the Bordelais smoking-divan, where he\r\nswallowed some bitters; then, in place of returning home to his wife, he\r\npreferred to dine alone in a little caf\xe9 in the Rue Gaillon, where he\r\ndesired them to serve up to him "household dishes, natural things."\r\nFinally, he made his way to another billiard-room, and remained there\r\ntill midnight, in fact, till one o\'clock in the morning, up till the\r\nlast moment, when, the gas being put out and the window-shutters\r\nfastened, the master of the establishment, worn out, begged of him to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not the love of drinking that attracted Citizen Regimbart to\r\nthese places, but the inveterate habit of talking politics at such\r\nresorts. With advancing age, he had lost his vivacity, and now exhibited\r\nonly a silent moroseness. One would have said, judging from the gravity\r\nof his countenence, that he was turning over in his mind the affairs of\r\nthe whole world. Nothing, however, came from it; and nobody, even\r\namongst his own friends, knew him to have any occupation, although he\r\ngave himself out as being up to his eyes in business.\r\n\r\nArnoux appeared to have a very great esteem for him. One day he said to\r\nFrederick:\r\n\r\n"He knows a lot, I assure you. He is an able man."\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Regimbart spread over his desk papers relating to\r\nthe kaolin mines in Brittany. Arnoux referred to his own experience on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nFrederick showed himself more ceremonious towards Regimbart, going so\r\nfar as to invite him from time to time to take a glass of absinthe; and,\r\nalthough he considered him a stupid man, he often remained a full hour\r\nin his company solely because he was Jacques Arnoux\'s friend.\r\n\r\nAfter pushing forward some contemporary masters in the early portions of\r\ntheir career, the picture-dealer, a man of progressive ideas, had tried,\r\nwhile clinging to his artistic ways, to extend his pecuniary profits.\r\nHis object was to emancipate the fine arts, to get the sublime at a\r\ncheap rate. Over every industry associated with Parisian luxury he\r\nexercised an influence which proved fortunate with respect to little\r\nthings, but fatal with respect to great things. With his mania for\r\npandering to public opinion, he made clever artists swerve from their\r\ntrue path, corrupted the strong, exhausted the weak, and got distinction\r\nfor those of mediocre talent; he set them up with the assistance of his\r\nconnections and of his magazine. Tyros in painting were ambitious of\r\nseeing their works in his shop-window, and upholsterers brought\r\nspecimens of furniture to his house. Frederick regarded him, at the same\r\ntime, as a millionaire, as a _dilettante_, and as a man of action.\r\nHowever, he found many things that filled him with astonishment, for my\r\nlord Arnoux was rather sly in his commercial transactions.\r\n\r\nHe received from the very heart of Germany or of Italy a picture\r\npurchased in Paris for fifteen hundred francs, and, exhibiting an\r\ninvoice that brought the price up to four thousand, sold it over again\r\nthrough complaisance for three thousand five hundred. One of his usual\r\ntricks with painters was to exact as a drink-allowance an abatement in\r\nthe purchase-money of their pictures, under the pretence that he would\r\nbring out an engraving of it. He always, when selling such pictures,\r\nmade a profit by the abatement; but the engraving never appeared. To\r\nthose who complained that he had taken an advantage of them, he would\r\nreply by a slap on the stomach. Generous in other ways, he squandered\r\nmoney on cigars for his acquaintances, "thee\'d" and "thou\'d" persons who\r\nwere unknown, displayed enthusiasm about a work or a man; and, after\r\nthat, sticking to his opinion, and, regardless of consequences, spared\r\nno expense in journeys, correspondence, and advertising. He looked upon\r\nhimself as very upright, and, yielding to an irresistible impulse to\r\nunbosom himself, ingenuously told his friends about certain indelicate\r\nacts of which he had been guilty. Once, in order to annoy a member of\r\nhis own trade who inaugurated another art journal with a big banquet, he\r\nasked Frederick to write, under his own eyes, a little before the hour\r\nfixed for the entertainment, letters to the guests recalling the\r\ninvitations.\r\n\r\n"This impugns nobody\'s honour, do you understand?"\r\n\r\nAnd the young man did not dare to refuse the service.\r\n\r\nNext day, on entering with Hussonnet M. Arnoux\'s office, Frederick saw\r\nthrough the door (the one opening on the staircase) the hem of a lady\'s\r\ndress disappearing.\r\n\r\n"A thousand pardons!" said Hussonnet. "If I had known that there were\r\nwomen----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! as for that one, she is my own," replied Arnoux. "She just came in\r\nto pay me a visit as she was passing."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes; she is going back home again."\r\n\r\nThe charm of the things around him was suddenly withdrawn. That which\r\nhad seemed to him to be diffused vaguely through the place had now\r\nvanished--or, rather, it had never been there. He experienced an\r\ninfinite amazement, and, as it were, the painful sensation of having\r\nbeen betrayed.\r\n\r\nArnoux, while rummaging about in his drawer, began to smile. Was he\r\nlaughing at him? The clerk laid down a bundle of moist papers on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Ha! the placards," exclaimed the picture-dealer. "I am not ready to\r\ndine this evening."\r\n\r\nRegimbart took up his hat.\r\n\r\n"What, are you leaving me?"\r\n\r\n"Seven o\'clock," said Regimbart.\r\n\r\nFrederick followed him.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Rue Montmartre, he turned round. He glanced towards\r\nthe windows of the first floor, and he laughed internally with self-pity\r\nas he recalled to mind with what love he had so often contemplated them.\r\nWhere, then, did she reside? How was he to meet her now? Once more\r\naround the object of his desire a solitude opened more immense than\r\never!\r\n\r\n"Are you coming to take it?" asked Regimbart.\r\n\r\n"To take what?"\r\n\r\n"The absinthe."\r\n\r\nAnd, yielding to his importunities, Frederick allowed himself to be led\r\ntowards the Bordelais smoking-divan. Whilst his companion, leaning on\r\nhis elbow, was staring at the decanter, he was turning his eyes to the\r\nright and to the left. But he caught a glimpse of Pellerin\'s profile on\r\nthe footpath outside; the painter gave a quick tap at the window-pane,\r\nand he had scarcely sat down when Regimbart asked him why they no longer\r\nsaw him at the office of _L\'Art Industriel_.\r\n\r\n"May I perish before ever I go back there again. The fellow is a brute,\r\na mere tradesman, a wretch, a downright rogue!"\r\n\r\nThese insulting words harmonised with Frederick\'s present angry mood.\r\nNevertheless, he was wounded, for it seemed to him that they hit at\r\nMadame Arnoux more or less.\r\n\r\n"Why, what has he done to you?" said Regimbart.\r\n\r\nPellerin stamped with his foot on the ground, and his only response was\r\nan energetic puff.\r\n\r\nHe had been devoting himself to artistic work of a kind that he did not\r\ncare to connect his name with, such as portraits for two crayons, or\r\npasticcios from the great masters for amateurs of limited knowledge;\r\nand, as he felt humiliated by these inferior productions, he preferred\r\nto hold his tongue on the subject as a general rule. But "Arnoux\'s dirty\r\nconduct" exasperated him too much. He had to relieve his feelings.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an order, which had been given in Frederick\'s very\r\npresence, he had brought Arnoux two pictures. Thereupon the dealer took\r\nthe liberty of criticising them. He found fault with the composition,\r\nthe colouring, and the drawing--above all the drawing; he would not, in\r\nshort, take them at any price. But, driven to extremities by a bill\r\nfalling due, Pellerin had to give them to the Jew Isaac; and, a\r\nfortnight later, Arnoux himself sold them to a Spaniard for two thousand\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n"Not a sou less! What rascality! and, faith, he has done many other\r\nthings just as bad. One of these mornings we\'ll see him in the dock!"\r\n\r\n"How you exaggerate!" said Frederick, in a timid voice.\r\n\r\n"Come, now, that\'s good; I exaggerate!" exclaimed the artist, giving the\r\ntable a great blow with his fist.\r\n\r\nThis violence had the effect of completely restoring the young man\'s\r\nself-command. No doubt he might have acted more nicely; still, if Arnoux\r\nfound these two pictures----\r\n\r\n"Bad! say it out! Are you a judge of them? Is this your profession? Now,\r\nyou know, my youngster, I don\'t allow this sort of thing on the part of\r\nmere amateurs."\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, it\'s not my business," said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Then, what interest have you in defending him?" returned Pellerin,\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\nThe young man faltered:\r\n\r\n"But--since I am his friend----"\r\n\r\n"Go, and give him a hug for me. Good evening!"\r\n\r\nAnd the painter rushed away in a rage, and, of course, without paying\r\nfor his drink.\r\n\r\nFrederick, whilst defending Arnoux, had convinced himself. In the heat\r\nof his eloquence, he was filled with tenderness towards this man, so\r\nintelligent and kind, whom his friends calumniated, and who had now to\r\nwork all alone, abandoned by them. He could not resist a strange impulse\r\nto go at once and see him again. Ten minutes afterwards he pushed open\r\nthe door of the picture-warehouse.\r\n\r\nArnoux was preparing, with the assistance of his clerks, some huge\r\nplacards for an exhibition of pictures.\r\n\r\n"Halloa! what brings you back again?"\r\n\r\nThis question, simple though it was, embarrassed Frederick, and, at a\r\nloss for an answer, he asked whether they had happened to find a\r\nnotebook of his--a little notebook with a blue leather cover.\r\n\r\n"The one that you put your letters to women in?" said Arnoux.\r\n\r\nFrederick, blushing like a young girl, protested against such an\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\n"Your verses, then?" returned the picture-dealer.\r\n\r\nHe handled the pictorial specimens that were to be exhibited,\r\ndiscovering their form, colouring, and frames; and Frederick felt more\r\nand more irritated by his air of abstraction, and particularly by the\r\nappearance of his hands--large hands, rather soft, with flat nails. At\r\nlength, M. Arnoux arose, and saying, "That\'s disposed of!" he chucked\r\nthe young man familiarly under the chin. Frederick was offended at this\r\nliberty, and recoiled a pace or two; then he made a dash for the\r\nshop-door, and passed out through it, as he imagined, for the last time\r\nin his life. Madame Arnoux herself had been lowered by the vulgarity of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nDuring the same week he got a letter from Deslauriers, informing him\r\nthat the clerk would be in Paris on the following Thursday. Then he\r\nflung himself back violently on this affection as one of a more solid\r\nand lofty character. A man of this sort was worth all the women in the\r\nworld. He would no longer have any need of Regimbart, of Pellerin, of\r\nHussonnet, of anyone! In order to provide his friend with as comfortable\r\nlodgings as possible, he bought an iron bedstead and a second armchair,\r\nand stripped off some of his own bed-covering to garnish this one\r\nproperly. On Thursday morning he was dressing himself to go to meet\r\nDeslauriers when there was a ring at the door.\r\n\r\nArnoux entered.\r\n\r\n"Just one word. Yesterday I got a lovely trout from Geneva. We expect\r\nyou by-and-by--at seven o\'clock sharp. The address is the Rue de\r\nChoiseul 24 _bis_. Don\'t forget!"\r\n\r\nFrederick was obliged to sit down; his knees were tottering under him.\r\nHe repeated to himself, "At last! at last!" Then he wrote to his\r\ntailor, to his hatter, and to his bootmaker; and he despatched these\r\nthree notes by three different messengers.\r\n\r\nThe key turned in the lock, and the door-keeper appeared with a trunk on\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\nFrederick, on seeing Deslauriers, began to tremble like an adulteress\r\nunder the glance of her husband.\r\n\r\n"What has happened to you?" said Deslauriers. "Surely you got my\r\nletter?"\r\n\r\nFrederick had not enough energy left to lie. He opened his arms, and\r\nflung himself on his friend\'s breast.\r\n\r\nThen the clerk told his story. His father thought to avoid giving an\r\naccount of the expense of tutelage, fancying that the period limited for\r\nrendering such accounts was ten years; but, well up in legal procedure,\r\nDeslauriers had managed to get the share coming to him from his mother\r\ninto his clutches--seven thousand francs clear--which he had there with\r\nhim in an old pocket-book.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a reserve fund, in case of misfortune. I must think over the best\r\nway of investing it, and find quarters for myself to-morrow morning.\r\nTo-day I\'m perfectly free, and am entirely at your service, my old\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t put yourself about," said Frederick. "If you had anything of\r\nimportance to do this evening----"\r\n\r\n"Come, now! I would be a selfish wretch----"\r\n\r\nThis epithet, flung out at random, touched Frederick to the quick, like\r\na reproachful hint.\r\n\r\nThe door-keeper had placed on the table close to the fire some chops,\r\ncold meat, a large lobster, some sweets for dessert, and two bottles of\r\nBordeaux.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers was touched by these excellent preparations to welcome his\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, you are treating me like a king!"\r\n\r\nThey talked about their past and about the future; and, from time to\r\ntime, they grasped each other\'s hands across the table, gazing at each\r\nother tenderly for a moment.\r\n\r\nBut a messenger came with a new hat. Deslauriers, in a loud tone,\r\nremarked that this head-gear was very showy. Next came the tailor\r\nhimself to fit on the coat, to which he had given a touch with the\r\nsmoothing-iron.\r\n\r\n"One would imagine you were going to be married," said Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, a third individual appeared on the scene, and drew forth\r\nfrom a big black bag a pair of shining patent leather boots. While\r\nFrederick was trying them on, the bootmaker slyly drew attention to the\r\nshoes of the young man from the country.\r\n\r\n"Does Monsieur require anything?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks," replied the clerk, pulling behind his chair his old shoes\r\nfastened with strings.\r\n\r\nThis humiliating incident annoyed Frederick. At length he exclaimed, as\r\nif an idea had suddenly taken possession of him:\r\n\r\n"Ha! deuce take it! I was forgetting."\r\n\r\n"What is it, pray?"\r\n\r\n"I have to dine in the city this evening."\r\n\r\n"At the Dambreuses\'? Why did you never say anything to me about them in\r\nyour letters?"\r\n\r\n"It is not at the Dambreuses\', but at the Arnoux\'s."\r\n\r\n"You should have let me know beforehand," said Deslauriers. "I would\r\nhave come a day later."\r\n\r\n"Impossible," returned Frederick, abruptly. "I only got the invitation\r\nthis morning, a little while ago."\r\n\r\nAnd to redeem his error and distract his friend\'s mind from the\r\noccurrence, he proceeded to unfasten the tangled cords round the trunk,\r\nand to arrange all his belongings in the chest of drawers, expressed his\r\nwillingness to give him his own bed, and offered to sleep himself in the\r\ndressing-room bedstead. Then, as soon as it was four o\'clock, he began\r\nthe preparations for his toilet.\r\n\r\n"You have plenty of time," said the other.\r\n\r\nAt last he was dressed and off he went.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way with the rich," thought Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nAnd he went to dine in the Rue Saint-Jacques, at a little restaurant\r\nkept by a man he knew.\r\n\r\nFrederick stopped several times while going up the stairs, so violently\r\ndid his heart beat. One of his gloves, which was too tight, burst, and,\r\nwhile he was fastening back the torn part under his shirt-cuff, Arnoux,\r\nwho was mounting the stairs behind him, took his arm and led him in.\r\n\r\nThe anteroom, decorated in the Chinese fashion, had a painted lantern\r\nhanging from the ceiling, and bamboos in the corners. As he was passing\r\ninto the drawing-room, Frederick stumbled against a tiger\'s skin. The\r\nplace had not yet been lighted up, but two lamps were burning in the\r\nboudoir in the far corner.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Marthe came to announce that her mamma was dressing. Arnoux\r\nraised her as high as his mouth in order to kiss her; then, as he wished\r\nto go to the cellar himself to select certain bottles of wine, he left\r\nFrederick with the little girl.\r\n\r\nShe had grown much larger since the trip in the steamboat. Her dark hair\r\ndescended in long ringlets, which curled over her bare arms. Her dress,\r\nmore puffed out than the petticoat of a _danseuse_, allowed her rosy\r\ncalves to be seen, and her pretty childlike form had all the fresh odour\r\nof a bunch of flowers. She received the young gentleman\'s compliments\r\nwith a coquettish air, fixed on him her large, dreamy eyes, then\r\nslipping on the carpet amid the furniture, disappeared like a cat.\r\n\r\nAfter this he no longer felt ill at ease. The globes of the lamps,\r\ncovered with a paper lace-work, sent forth a white light, softening the\r\ncolour of the walls, hung with mauve satin. Through the fender-bars, as\r\nthrough the slits in a big fan, the coal could be seen in the fireplace,\r\nand close beside the clock there was a little chest with silver clasps.\r\nHere and there things lay about which gave the place a look of home--a\r\ndoll in the middle of the sofa, a fichu against the back of a chair, and\r\non the work-table a knitted woollen vest, from which two ivory needles\r\nwere hanging with their points downwards. It was altogether a peaceful\r\nspot, suggesting the idea of propriety and innocent family life.\r\n\r\nArnoux returned, and Madame Arnoux appeared at the other doorway. As she\r\nwas enveloped in shadow, the young man could at first distinguish only\r\nher head. She wore a black velvet gown, and in her hair she had fastened\r\na long Algerian cap, in a red silk net, which coiling round her comb,\r\nfell over her left shoulder.\r\n\r\nArnoux introduced Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I remember Monsieur perfectly well," she responded.\r\n\r\nThen the guests arrived, nearly all at the same time--Dittmer, Lovarias,\r\nBurrieu, the composer Rosenwald, the poet Th\xe9ophile Lorris, two art\r\ncritics, colleagues of Hussonnet, a paper manufacturer, and in the rear\r\nthe illustrious Pierre Paul Meinsius, the last representative of the\r\ngrand school of painting, who blithely carried along with his glory his\r\nforty-five years and his big paunch.\r\n\r\nWhen they were passing into the dining-room, Madame Arnoux took his arm.\r\nA chair had been left vacant for Pellerin. Arnoux, though he took\r\nadvantage of him, was fond of him. Besides, he was afraid of his\r\nterrible tongue, so much so, that, in order to soften him, he had given\r\na portrait of him in _L\'Art Industriel_, accompanied by exaggerated\r\neulogies; and Pellerin, more sensitive about distinction than about\r\nmoney, made his appearance about eight o\'clock quite out of breath.\r\nFrederick fancied that they had been a long time reconciled.\r\n\r\nHe liked the company, the dishes, everything. The dining-room, which\r\nresembled a medi\xe6val parlour, was hung with stamped leather. A Dutch\r\nwhatnot faced a rack for chibouks, and around the table the Bohemian\r\nglasses, variously coloured, had, in the midst of the flowers and\r\nfruits, the effect of an illumination in a garden.\r\n\r\nHe had to make his choice between ten sorts of mustard. He partook of\r\ndaspachio, of curry, of ginger, of Corsican blackbirds, and a species of\r\nRoman macaroni called lasagna; he drank extraordinary wines, lip-fraeli\r\nand tokay. Arnoux indeed prided himself on entertaining people in good\r\nstyle. With an eye to the procurement of eatables, he paid court to\r\nmail-coach drivers, and was in league with the cooks of great houses,\r\nwho communicated to him the secrets of rare sauces.\r\n\r\nBut Frederick was particularly amused by the conversation. His taste for\r\ntravelling was tickled by Dittmer, who talked about the East; he\r\ngratified his curiosity about theatrical matters by listening to\r\nRosenwald\'s chat about the opera; and the atrocious existence of Bohemia\r\nassumed for him a droll aspect when seen through the gaiety of\r\nHussonnet, who related, in a picturesque fashion, how he had spent an\r\nentire winter with no food except Dutch cheese. Then, a discussion\r\nbetween Lovarias and Burrieu about the Florentine School gave him new\r\nideas with regard to masterpieces, widened his horizon, and he found\r\ndifficulty in restraining his enthusiasm when Pellerin exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother me with your hideous reality! What does it mean--reality?\r\nSome see things black, others blue--the multitude sees them\r\nbrute-fashion. There is nothing less natural than Michael Angelo; there\r\nis nothing more powerful! The anxiety about external truth is a mark of\r\ncontemporary baseness; and art will become, if things go on that way, a\r\nsort of poor joke as much below religion as it is below poetry, and as\r\nmuch below politics as it is below business. You will never reach its\r\nend--yes, its end!--which is to cause within us an impersonal\r\nexaltation, with petty works, in spite of all your finished execution.\r\nLook, for instance, at Bassolier\'s pictures: they are pretty,\r\ncoquettish, spruce, and by no means dull. You might put them into your\r\npocket, bring them with you when you are travelling. Notaries buy them\r\nfor twenty thousand francs, while pictures of the ideal type are sold\r\nfor three sous. But, without ideality, there is no grandeur; without\r\ngrandeur there is no beauty. Olympus is a mountain. The most swagger\r\nmonument will always be the Pyramids. Exuberance is better than taste;\r\nthe desert is better than a street-pavement, and a savage is better than\r\na hairdresser!"\r\n\r\nFrederick, as these words fell upon his ear, glanced towards Madame\r\nArnoux. They sank into his soul like metals falling into a furnace,\r\nadded to his passion, and supplied the material of love.\r\n\r\nHis chair was three seats below hers on the same side. From time to\r\ntime, she bent forward a little, turning aside her head to address a few\r\nwords to her little daughter; and as she smiled on these occasions, a\r\ndimple took shape in her cheek, giving to her face an expression of more\r\ndainty good-nature.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the time came for the gentlemen to take their wine, she\r\ndisappeared. The conversation became more free and easy. M. Arnoux shone\r\nin it, and Frederick was astonished at the cynicism of men. However,\r\ntheir preoccupation with woman established between them and him, as it\r\nwere, an equality, which raised him in his own estimation.\r\n\r\nWhen they had returned to the drawing-room, he took up, to keep himself\r\nin countenance, one of the albums which lay about on the table. The\r\ngreat artists of the day had illustrated them with drawings, had written\r\nin them snatches of verse or prose, or their signatures simply. In the\r\nmidst of famous names he found many that he had never heard of before,\r\nand original thoughts appeared only underneath a flood of nonsense. All\r\nthese effusions contained a more or less direct expression of homage\r\ntowards Madame Arnoux. Frederick would have been afraid to write a line\r\nbeside them.\r\n\r\nShe went into her boudoir to look at the little chest with silver clasps\r\nwhich he had noticed on the mantel-shelf. It was a present from her\r\nhusband, a work of the Renaissance. Arnoux\'s friends complimented him,\r\nand his wife thanked him. His tender emotions were aroused, and before\r\nall the guests he gave her a kiss.\r\n\r\nAfter this they all chatted in groups here and there. The worthy\r\nMeinsius was with Madame Arnoux on an easy chair close beside the fire.\r\nShe was leaning forward towards his ear; their heads were just touching,\r\nand Frederick would have been glad to become deaf, infirm, and ugly if,\r\ninstead, he had an illustrious name and white hair--in short, if he only\r\nhappened to possess something which would install him in such intimate\r\nassociation with her. He began once more to eat out his heart, furious\r\nat the idea of being so young a man.\r\n\r\nBut she came into the corner of the drawing-room in which he was\r\nsitting, asked him whether he was acquainted with any of the guests,\r\nwhether he was fond of painting, how long he had been a student in\r\nParis. Every word that came out of her mouth seemed to Frederick\r\nsomething entirely new, an exclusive appendage of her personality. He\r\ngazed attentively at the fringes of her head-dress, the ends of which\r\ncaressed her bare shoulder, and he was unable to take away his eyes; he\r\nplunged his soul into the whiteness of that feminine flesh, and yet he\r\ndid not venture to raise his eyelids to glance at her higher, face to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nRosenwald interrupted them, begging of Madame Arnoux to sing something.\r\nHe played a prelude, she waited, her lips opened slightly, and a sound,\r\npure, long-continued, silvery, ascended into the air.\r\n\r\nFrederick did not understand a single one of the Italian words. The song\r\nbegan with a grave measure, something like church music, then in a more\r\nanimated strain, with a crescendo movement, it broke into repeated\r\nbursts of sound, then suddenly subsided, and the melody came back again\r\nin a tender fashion with a wide and easy swing.\r\n\r\nShe stood beside the keyboard with her arms hanging down and a far-off\r\nlook on her face. Sometimes, in order to read the music, she advanced\r\nher forehead for a moment and her eyelashes moved to and fro. Her\r\ncontralto voice in the low notes took a mournful intonation which had a\r\nchilling effect on the listener, and then her beautiful head, with those\r\ngreat brows of hers, bent over her shoulder; her bosom swelled; her eyes\r\nwere wide apart; her neck, from which roulades made their escape, fell\r\nback as if under a\xebrial kisses. She flung out three sharp notes, came\r\ndown again, cast forth one higher still, and, after a silence, finished\r\nwith an organ-point.\r\n\r\nRosenwald did not leave the piano. He continued playing, to amuse\r\nhimself. From time to time a guest stole away. At eleven o\'clock, as the\r\nlast of them were going off, Arnoux went out along with Pellerin, under\r\nthe pretext of seeing him home. He was one of those people who say that\r\nthey are ill when they do not "take a turn" after dinner. Madame Arnoux\r\nhad made her way towards the anteroom. Dittmer and Hussonnet bowed to\r\nher. She stretched out her hand to them. She did the same to Frederick;\r\nand he felt, as it were, something penetrating every particle of his\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nHe quitted his friends. He wished to be alone. His heart was\r\noverflowing. Why had she offered him her hand? Was it a thoughtless\r\nact, or an encouragement? "Come now! I am mad!" Besides, what did it\r\nmatter, when he could now visit her entirely at his ease, live in the\r\nvery atmosphere she breathed?\r\n\r\nThe streets were deserted. Now and then a heavy wagon would roll past,\r\nshaking the pavements. The houses came one after another with their grey\r\nfronts, their closed windows; and he thought with disdain of all those\r\nhuman beings who lived behind those walls without having seen her, and\r\nnot one of whom dreamed of her existence. He had no consciousness of his\r\nsurroundings, of space, of anything, and striking the ground with his\r\nheel, rapping with his walking-stick on the shutters of the shops, he\r\nkept walking on continually at random, in a state of excitement, carried\r\naway by his emotions. Suddenly he felt himself surrounded by a circle of\r\ndamp air, and found that he was on the edge of the quays.\r\n\r\nThe gas-lamps shone in two straight lines, which ran on endlessly, and\r\nlong red flames flickered in the depths of the water. The waves were\r\nslate-coloured, while the sky, which was of clearer hue, seemed to be\r\nsupported by vast masses of shadow that rose on each side of the river.\r\nThe darkness was intensified by buildings whose outlines the eye could\r\nnot distinguish. A luminous haze floated above the roofs further on. All\r\nthe noises of the night had melted into a single monotonous hum.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in the middle of the Pont Neuf, and, taking off his hat and\r\nexposing his chest, he drank in the air. And now he felt as if something\r\nthat was inexhaustible were rising up from the very depths of his being,\r\nan afflux of tenderness that enervated him, like the motion of the\r\nwaves under his eyes. A church-clock slowly struck one, like a voice\r\ncalling out to him.\r\n\r\nThen, he was seized with one of those shuddering sensations of the soul\r\nin which one seems to be transported into a higher world. He felt, as it\r\nwere, endowed with some extraordinary faculty, the aim of which he could\r\nnot determine. He seriously asked himself whether he would be a great\r\npainter or a great poet; and he decided in favour of painting, for the\r\nexigencies of this profession would bring him into contact with Madame\r\nArnoux. So, then, he had found his vocation! The object of his existence\r\nwas now perfectly clear, and there could be no mistake about the future.\r\n\r\nWhen he had shut his door, he heard some one snoring in the dark closet\r\nnear his apartment. It was his friend. He no longer bestowed a thought\r\non him.\r\n\r\nHis own face presented itself to his view in the glass. He thought\r\nhimself handsome, and for a minute he remained gazing at himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n"Love Knoweth No Laws."\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore twelve o\'clock next day he had bought a box of colours,\r\npaintbrushes, and an easel. Pellerin consented to give him lessons, and\r\nFrederick brought him to his lodgings to see whether anything was\r\nwanting among his painting utensils.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers had come back, and the second armchair was occupied by a\r\nyoung man. The clerk said, pointing towards him:\r\n\r\n"\'Tis he! There he is! S\xe9n\xe9cal!" Frederick disliked this young man. His\r\nforehead was heightened by the way in which he wore his hair, cut\r\nstraight like a brush. There was a certain hard, cold look in his grey\r\neyes; and his long black coat, his entire costume, savoured of the\r\npedagogue and the ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\nThey first discussed topics of the hour, amongst others the _Stabat_ of\r\nRossini. S\xe9n\xe9cal, in answer to a question, declared that he never went\r\nto the theatre.\r\n\r\nPellerin opened the box of colours.\r\n\r\n"Are these all for you?" said the clerk.\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly!"\r\n\r\n"Well, really! What a notion!" And he leaned across the table, at which\r\nthe mathematical tutor was turning over the leaves of a volume of Louis\r\nBlanc. He had brought it with him, and was reading passages from it in\r\nlow tones, while Pellerin and Frederick were examining together the\r\npalette, the knife, and the bladders; then the talk came round to the\r\ndinner at Arnoux\'s.\r\n\r\n"The picture-dealer, is it?" asked S\xe9n\xe9cal. "A nice gentleman, truly!"\r\n\r\n"Why, now?" said Pellerin. S\xe9n\xe9cal replied:\r\n\r\n"A man who makes money by political turpitude!"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on to talk about a well-known lithograph, in which the Royal\r\nFamily was all represented as being engaged in edifying occupations:\r\nLouis Philippe had a copy of the Code in his hand; the Queen had a\r\nCatholic prayer-book; the Princesses were embroidering; the Duc de\r\nNemours was girding on a sword; M. de Joinville was showing a map to his\r\nyoung brothers; and at the end of the apartment could be seen a bed with\r\ntwo divisions. This picture, which was entitled "A Good Family," was a\r\nsource of delight to commonplace middle-class people, but of grief to\r\npatriots.\r\n\r\nPellerin, in a tone of vexation, as if he had been the producer of this\r\nwork himself, observed by way of answer that every opinion had some\r\nvalue. S\xe9n\xe9cal protested: Art should aim exclusively at promoting\r\nmorality amongst the masses! The only subjects that ought to be\r\nreproduced were those which impelled people to virtuous actions; all\r\nothers were injurious.\r\n\r\n"But that depends on the execution," cried Pellerin. "I might produce\r\nmasterpieces."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse for you, then; you have no right----"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"No, monsieur, you have no right to excite my interest in matters of\r\nwhich I disapprove. What need have we of laborious trifles, from which\r\nit is impossible to derive any benefit--those Venuses, for instance,\r\nwith all your landscapes? I see there no instruction for the people!\r\nShow us rather their miseries! arouse enthusiasm in us for their\r\nsacrifices! Ah, my God! there is no lack of subjects--the farm, the\r\nworkshop----"\r\n\r\nPellerin stammered forth his indignation at this, and, imagining that he\r\nhad found an argument:\r\n\r\n"Moli\xe8re, do you accept him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly!" said S\xe9n\xe9cal. "I admire him as the precursor of the French\r\nRevolution."\r\n\r\n"Ha! the Revolution! What art! Never was there a more pitiable epoch!"\r\n\r\n"None greater, Monsieur!"\r\n\r\nPellerin folded his arms, and looking at him straight in the face:\r\n\r\n"You have the appearance of a famous member of the National Guard!"\r\n\r\nHis opponent, accustomed to discussions, responded:\r\n\r\n"I am not, and I detest it just as much as you. But with such principles\r\nwe corrupt the crowd. This sort of thing, however, is profitable to the\r\nGovernment. It would not be so powerful but for the complicity of a lot\r\nof rogues of that sort."\r\n\r\nThe painter took up the defence of the picture-dealer, for S\xe9n\xe9cal\'s\r\nopinions exasperated him. He even went so far as to maintain that Arnoux\r\nwas really a man with a heart of gold, devoted to his friends, deeply\r\nattached to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Oho! if you offered him a good sum, he would not refuse to let her\r\nserve as a model."\r\n\r\nFrederick turned pale.\r\n\r\n"So then, he has done you some great injury, Monsieur?"\r\n\r\n"Me? no! I saw him once at a caf\xe9 with a friend. That\'s all."\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal had spoken truly. But he had his teeth daily set on edge by the\r\nannouncements in _L\'Art Industriel_. Arnoux was for him the\r\nrepresentative of a world which he considered fatal to democracy. An\r\naustere Republican, he suspected that there was something corrupt in\r\nevery form of elegance, and the more so as he wanted nothing and was\r\ninflexible in his integrity.\r\n\r\nThey found some difficulty in resuming the conversation. The painter\r\nsoon recalled to mind his appointment, the tutor his pupils; and, when\r\nthey had gone, after a long silence, Deslauriers asked a number of\r\nquestions about Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"You will introduce me there later, will you not, old fellow?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Frederick. Then they thought about settling\r\nthemselves. Deslauriers had without much trouble obtained the post of\r\nsecond clerk in a solicitor\'s office; he had also entered his name for\r\nthe terms at the Law School, and bought the indispensable books; and the\r\nlife of which they had dreamed now began.\r\n\r\nIt was delightful, owing to their youth, which made everything assume a\r\nbeautiful aspect. As Deslauriers had said nothing as to any pecuniary\r\narrangement, Frederick did not refer to the subject. He helped to defray\r\nall the expenses, kept the cupboard well stocked, and looked after all\r\nthe household requirements; but if it happened to be desirable to give\r\nthe door-keeper a rating, the clerk took that on his own shoulders,\r\nstill playing the part, which he had assumed in their college days, of\r\nprotector and senior.\r\n\r\nSeparated all day long, they met again in the evening. Each took his\r\nplace at the fireside and set about his work. But ere long it would be\r\ninterrupted. Then would follow endless outpourings, unaccountable bursts\r\nof merriment, and occasional disputes about the lamp flaring too much or\r\na book being mislaid, momentary ebullitions of anger which subsided in\r\nhearty laughter.\r\n\r\nWhile in bed they left open the door of the little room where\r\nDeslauriers slept, and kept chattering to each other from a distance.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they walked in their shirt-sleeves on the terrace. The\r\nsun rose; light vapours passed over the river. From the flower-market\r\nclose beside them the noise of screaming reached their ears; and the\r\nsmoke from their pipes whirled round in the clear air, which was\r\nrefreshing to their eyes still puffed from sleep. While they inhaled it,\r\ntheir hearts swelled with great expectations.\r\n\r\nWhen it was not raining on Sunday they went out together, and, arm in\r\narm, they sauntered through the streets. The same reflection nearly\r\nalways occurred to them at the same time, or else they would go on\r\nchatting without noticing anything around them. Deslauriers longed for\r\nriches, as a means for gaining power over men. He was anxious to possess\r\nan influence over a vast number of people, to make a great noise, to\r\nhave three secretaries under his command, and to give a big political\r\ndinner once a month.\r\n\r\nFrederick would have furnished for himself a palace in the Moorish\r\nfashion, to spend his life reclining on cashmere divans, to the murmur\r\nof a jet of water, attended by negro pages. And these things, of which\r\nhe had only dreamed, became in the end so definite that they made him\r\nfeel as dejected as if he had lost them.\r\n\r\n"What is the use of talking about all these things," said he, "when\r\nwe\'ll never have them?"\r\n\r\n"Who knows?" returned Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his democratic views, he urged Frederick to get an\r\nintroduction into the Dambreuses\' house.\r\n\r\nThe other, by way of objection, pointed to the failure of his previous\r\nattempts.\r\n\r\n"Bah! go back there. They\'ll give you an invitation!"\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the month of March, they received amongst other\r\nbills of a rather awkward description that of the restaurant-keeper who\r\nsupplied them with dinners. Frederick, not having the entire amount,\r\nborrowed a hundred crowns from Deslauriers. A fortnight afterwards, he\r\nrenewed the same request, and the clerk administered a lecture to him on\r\nthe extravagant habits to which he gave himself up in the Arnoux\'s\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, he put no restraint upon himself in this respect. A\r\nview of Venice, a view of Naples, and another of Constantinople\r\noccupying the centre of three walls respectively, equestrian subjects by\r\nAlfred de Dreux here and there, a group by Pradier over the mantelpiece,\r\nnumbers of _L\'Art Industriel_ lying on the piano, and works in boards on\r\nthe floor in the corners, encumbered the apartment which he occupied to\r\nsuch an extent that it was hard to find a place to lay a book on, or to\r\nmove one\'s elbows about freely. Frederick maintained that he needed all\r\nthis for his painting.\r\n\r\nHe pursued his art-studies under Pellerin. But when he called on the\r\nartist, the latter was often out, being accustomed to attend at every\r\nfuneral and public occurrence of which an account was given in the\r\nnewspapers, and so it was that Frederick spent entire hours alone in the\r\nstudio. The quietude of this spacious room, which nothing disturbed save\r\nthe scampering of the mice, the light falling from the ceiling, or the\r\nhissing noise of the stove, made him sink into a kind of intellectual\r\nease. Then his eyes, wandering away from the task at which he was\r\nengaged, roamed over the shell-work on the wall, around the objects of\r\nvirt\xf9 on the whatnot, along the torsos on which the dust that had\r\ncollected made, as it were, shreds of velvet; and, like a traveller who\r\nhas lost his way in the middle of a wood, and whom every path brings\r\nback to the same spot, continually, he found underlying every idea in\r\nhis mind the recollection of Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\nHe selected days for calling on her. When he had reached the second\r\nfloor, he would pause on the threshold, hesitating as to whether he\r\nought to ring or not. Steps drew nigh, the door opened, and the\r\nannouncement "Madame is gone out," a sense of relief would come upon\r\nhim, as if a weight had been lifted from his heart. He met her, however.\r\nOn the first occasion there were three other ladies with her; the next\r\ntime it was in the afternoon, and Mademoiselle Marthe\'s writing-master\r\ncame on the scene. Besides, the men whom Madame Arnoux received were\r\nnot very punctilious about paying visits. For the sake of prudence he\r\ndeemed it better not to call again.\r\n\r\nBut he did not fail to present himself regularly at the office of _L\'Art\r\nIndustriel_ every Wednesday in order to get an invitation to the\r\nThursday dinners, and he remained there after all the others, even\r\nlonger than Regimbart, up to the last moment, pretending to be looking\r\nat an engraving or to be running his eye through a newspaper. At last\r\nArnoux would say to him, "Shall you be disengaged to-morrow evening?"\r\nand, before the sentence was finished, he would give an affirmative\r\nanswer. Arnoux appeared to have taken a fancy to him. He showed him how\r\nto become a good judge of wines, how to make hot punch, and how to\r\nprepare a woodcock rago\xfbt. Frederick followed his advice with docility,\r\nfeeling an attachment to everything connected with Madame Arnoux--her\r\nfurniture, her servants, her house, her street.\r\n\r\nDuring these dinners he scarcely uttered a word; he kept gazing at her.\r\nShe had a little mole close to her temple. Her head-bands were darker\r\nthan the rest of her hair, and were always a little moist at the edges;\r\nfrom time to time she stroked them with only two fingers. He knew the\r\nshape of each of her nails. He took delight in listening to the rustle\r\nof her silk skirt as she swept past doors; he stealthily inhaled the\r\nperfume that came from her handkerchief; her comb, her gloves, her rings\r\nwere for him things of special interest, important as works of art,\r\nalmost endowed with life like individuals; all took possession of his\r\nheart and strengthened his passion.\r\n\r\nHe had not been sufficiently self-contained to conceal it from\r\nDeslauriers. When he came home from Madame Arnoux\'s, he would wake up\r\nhis friend, as if inadvertently, in order to have an opportunity of\r\ntalking about her.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers, who slept in the little off-room, close to where they had\r\ntheir water-supply, would give a great yawn. Frederick seated himself on\r\nthe side of the bed. At first, he spoke about the dinner; then he\r\nreferred to a thousand petty details, in which he saw marks of contempt\r\nor of affection. On one occasion, for instance, she had refused his arm,\r\nin order to take Dittmer\'s; and Frederick gave vent to his humiliation:\r\n\r\n"Ah! how stupid!"\r\n\r\nOr else she had called him her "dear friend."\r\n\r\n"Then go after her gaily!"\r\n\r\n"But I dare not do that," said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, think no more about her! Good night!"\r\n\r\nDeslauriers thereupon turned on his side, and fell asleep. He felt\r\nutterly unable to comprehend this love, which seemed to him the last\r\nweakness of adolescence; and, as his own society was apparently not\r\nenough to content Frederick, he conceived the idea of bringing together,\r\nonce a week, those whom they both recognised as friends.\r\n\r\nThey came on Saturday about nine o\'clock. The three Algerine curtains\r\nwere carefully drawn. The lamp and four wax-lights were burning. In the\r\nmiddle of the table the tobacco-pot, filled with pipes, displayed itself\r\nbetween the beer-bottles, the tea-pot, a flagon of rum, and some fancy\r\nbiscuits.\r\n\r\nThey discussed the immortality of the soul, and drew comparisons between\r\nthe different professors.\r\n\r\nOne evening Hussonnet introduced a tall young man, attired in a\r\nfrock-coat, too short in the wrists, and with a look of embarrassment in\r\nhis face. It was the young fellow whom they had gone to release from\r\nthe guard-house the year before.\r\n\r\nAs he had not been able to restore the box of lace which he had lost in\r\nthe scuffle, his employer had accused him of theft, and threatened to\r\nprosecute him. He was now a clerk in a wagon-office. Hussonnet had come\r\nacross him that morning at the corner of the street, and brought him\r\nalong, for Dussardier, in a spirit of gratitude, had expressed a wish to\r\nsee "the other."\r\n\r\nHe stretched out towards Frederick the cigar-holder, still full, which\r\nhe had religiously preserved, in the hope of being able to give it back.\r\nThe young men invited him to pay them a second visit; and he was not\r\nslow in doing so.\r\n\r\nThey all had sympathies in common. At first, their hatred of the\r\nGovernment reached the height of an unquestionable dogma. Martinon alone\r\nattempted to defend Louis Philippe. They overwhelmed him with the\r\ncommonplaces scattered through the newspapers--the "Bastillization" of\r\nParis, the September laws, Pritchard, Lord Guizot--so that Martinon held\r\nhis tongue for fear of giving offence to somebody. During his seven\r\nyears at college he had never incurred the penalty of an imposition, and\r\nat the Law School he knew how to make himself agreeable to the\r\nprofessors. He usually wore a big frock-coat of the colour of putty,\r\nwith india-rubber goloshes; but one evening he presented himself arrayed\r\nlike a bridegroom, in a velvet roll-collar waistcoat, a white tie, and a\r\ngold chain.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the other young men was greatly increased when they\r\nlearned that he had just come away from M. Dambreuse\'s house. In fact,\r\nthe banker Dambreuse had just bought a portion of an extensive wood\r\nfrom Martinon senior; and, when the worthy man introduced his son, the\r\nother had invited them both to dinner.\r\n\r\n"Was there a good supply of truffles there?" asked Deslauriers. "And did\r\nyou take his wife by the waist between the two doors, _sicut decet_?"\r\n\r\nHereupon the conversation turned on women. Pellerin would not admit that\r\nthere were beautiful women (he preferred tigers); besides the human\r\nfemale was an inferior creature in the \xe6sthetic hierarchy.\r\n\r\n"What fascinates you is just the very thing that degrades her as an\r\nidea; I mean her breasts, her hair----"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," urged Frederick, "long black hair and large dark\r\neyes----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! we know all about that," cried Hussonnet. "Enough of Andalusian\r\nbeauties on the lawn. Those things are out of date; no thank you! For\r\nthe fact is, honour bright! a fast woman is more amusing than the Venus\r\nof Milo. Let us be Gallic, in Heaven\'s name, and after the Regency\r\nstyle, if we can!\r\n\r\n    \'Flow, generous wines; ladies, deign to smile!\'[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Coules, bons vins; femmes, deignez sourire._]\r\n\r\nWe must pass from the dark to the fair. Is that your opinion, Father\r\nDussardier?"\r\n\r\nDussardier did not reply. They all pressed him to ascertain what his\r\ntastes were.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, colouring, "for my part, I would like to love the same\r\none always!"\r\n\r\nThis was said in such a way that there was a moment of silence, some of\r\nthem being surprised at this candour, and others finding in his words,\r\nperhaps, the secret yearning of their souls.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal placed his glass of beer on the mantelpiece, and declared\r\ndogmatically that, as prostitution was tyrannical and marriage immoral,\r\nit was better to practice abstinence. Deslauriers regarded women as a\r\nsource of amusement--nothing more. M. de Cisy looked upon them with the\r\nutmost dread.\r\n\r\nBrought up under the eyes of a grandmother who was a devotee, he found\r\nthe society of those young fellows as alluring as a place of ill-repute\r\nand as instructive as the Sorbonne. They gave him lessons without stint;\r\nand so much zeal did he exhibit that he even wanted to smoke in spite of\r\nthe qualms that upset him every time he made the experiment. Frederick\r\npaid him the greatest attention. He admired the shade of this young\r\ngentleman\'s cravat, the fur on his overcoat, and especially his boots,\r\nas thin as gloves, and so very neat and fine that they had a look of\r\ninsolent superiority. His carriage used to wait for him below in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nOne evening, after his departure, when there was a fall of snow, S\xe9n\xe9cal\r\nbegan to complain about his having a coachman. He declaimed against\r\nkid-gloved exquisites and against the Jockey Club. He had more respect\r\nfor a workman than for these fine gentlemen.\r\n\r\n"For my part, anyhow, I work for my livelihood! I am a poor man!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite evident," said Frederick, at length, losing patience.\r\n\r\nThe tutor conceived a grudge against him for this remark.\r\n\r\nBut, as Regimbart said he knew S\xe9n\xe9cal pretty well, Frederick, wishing\r\nto be civil to a friend of the Arnoux, asked him to come to the\r\nSaturday meetings; and the two patriots were glad to be brought together\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\nHowever, they took opposite views of things.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal--who had a skull of the angular type--fixed his attention merely\r\non systems, whereas Regimbart, on the contrary, saw in facts nothing but\r\nfacts. The thing that chiefly troubled him was the Rhine frontier. He\r\nclaimed to be an authority on the subject of artillery, and got his\r\nclothes made by a tailor of the Polytechnic School.\r\n\r\nThe first day, when they asked him to take some cakes, he disdainfully\r\nshrugged his shoulders, saying that these might suit women; and on the\r\nnext few occasions his manner was not much more gracious. Whenever\r\nspeculative ideas had reached a certain elevation, he would mutter: "Oh!\r\nno Utopias, no dreams!" On the subject of Art (though he used to visit\r\nthe studios, where he occasionally out of complaisance gave a lesson in\r\nfencing) his opinions were not remarkable for their excellence. He\r\ncompared the style of M. Marast to that of Voltaire, and Mademoiselle\r\nVatnaz to Madame de Sta\xebl, on account of an Ode on Poland in which\r\n"there was some spirit." In short, Regimbart bored everyone, and\r\nespecially Deslauriers, for the Citizen was a friend of the Arnoux\r\nfamily. Now the clerk was most anxious to visit those people in the hope\r\nthat he might there make the acquaintance of some persons who would be\r\nan advantage to him.\r\n\r\n"When are you going to take me there with you?" he would say. Arnoux was\r\neither overburdened with business, or else starting on a journey. Then\r\nit was not worth while, as the dinners were coming to an end.\r\n\r\nIf he had been called on to risk his life for his friend, Frederick\r\nwould have done so. But, as he was desirous of making as good a figure\r\nas possible, and with this view was most careful about his language and\r\nmanners, and so attentive to his costume that he always presented\r\nhimself at the office of _L\'Art Industriel_ irreproachably gloved, he\r\nwas afraid that Deslauriers, with his shabby black coat, his\r\nattorney-like exterior, and his swaggering kind of talk, might make\r\nhimself disagreeable to Madame Arnoux, and thus compromise him and lower\r\nhim in her estimation. The other results would have been bad enough, but\r\nthe last one would have annoyed him a thousand times more.\r\n\r\nThe clerk saw that his friend did not wish to keep his promise, and\r\nFrederick\'s silence seemed to him an aggravation of the insult. He would\r\nhave liked to exercise absolute control over him, to see him developing\r\nin accordance with the ideal of their youth; and his inactivity excited\r\nthe clerk\'s indignation as a breach of duty and a want of loyalty\r\ntowards himself. Moreover, Frederick, with his thoughts full of Madame\r\nArnoux, frequently talked about her husband; and Deslauriers now began\r\nan intolerable course of boredom by repeating the name a hundred times a\r\nday, at the end of each remark, like the parrot-cry of an idiot.\r\n\r\nWhen there was a knock at the door, he would answer, "Come in, Arnoux!"\r\nAt the restaurant he asked for a Brie cheese "in imitation of Arnoux,"\r\nand at night, pretending to wake up from a bad dream, he would rouse his\r\ncomrade by howling out, "Arnoux! Arnoux!" At last Frederick, worn out,\r\nsaid to him one day, in a piteous voice:\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t bother me about Arnoux!"\r\n\r\n"Never!" replied the clerk:\r\n\r\n    "He always, everywhere, burning or icy cold,\r\n    The pictured form of Arnoux----"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Toujours lui! lui partout! ou brulante ou glac\xe9e, L\'image\r\nde l\'Arnoux._]\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, I tell you!" exclaimed Frederick, raising his fist.\r\n\r\nThen less angrily he added:\r\n\r\n"You know well this is a painful subject to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! forgive me, old fellow," returned Deslauriers with a very low bow.\r\n"From this time forth we will be considerate towards Mademoiselle\'s\r\nnerves. Again, I say, forgive me. A thousand pardons!"\r\n\r\nAnd so this little joke came to an end.\r\n\r\nBut, three weeks later, one evening, Deslauriers said to him:\r\n\r\n"Well, I have just seen Madame Arnoux."\r\n\r\n"Where, pray?"\r\n\r\n"At the Palais, with Balandard, the solicitor. A dark woman, is she not,\r\nof the middle height?"\r\n\r\nFrederick made a gesture of assent. He waited for Deslauriers to speak.\r\nAt the least expression of admiration he would have been most effusive,\r\nand would have fairly hugged the other. However, Deslauriers remained\r\nsilent. At last, unable to contain himself any longer, Frederick, with\r\nassumed indifference, asked him what he thought of her.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers considered that "she was not so bad, but still nothing\r\nextraordinary."\r\n\r\n"Ha! you think so," said Frederick.\r\n\r\nThey soon reached the month of August, the time when he was to present\r\nhimself for his second examination. According to the prevailing opinion,\r\nthe subjects could be made up in a fortnight. Frederick, having full\r\nconfidence in his own powers, swallowed up in a trice the first four\r\nbooks of the Code of Procedure, the first three of the Penal Code, many\r\nbits of the system of criminal investigation, and a part of the Civil\r\nCode, with the annotations of M. Poncelet. The night before, Deslauriers\r\nmade him run through the whole course, a process which did not finish\r\ntill morning, and, in order to take advantage of even the last quarter\r\nof an hour, continued questioning him while they walked along the\r\nfootpath together.\r\n\r\nAs several examinations were taking place at the same time, there were\r\nmany persons in the precincts, and amongst others Hussonnet and Cisy:\r\nyoung men never failed to come and watch these ordeals when the fortunes\r\nof their comrades were at stake.\r\n\r\nFrederick put on the traditional black gown; then, followed by the\r\nthrong, with three other students, he entered a spacious apartment, into\r\nwhich the light penetrated through uncurtained windows, and which was\r\ngarnished with benches ranged along the walls. In the centre, leather\r\nchairs were drawn round a table adorned with a green cover. This\r\nseparated the candidates from the examiners in their red gowns and\r\nermine shoulder-knots, the head examiners wearing gold-laced flat caps.\r\n\r\nFrederick found himself the last but one in the series--an unfortunate\r\nplace. In answer to the first question, as to the difference between a\r\nconvention and a contract, he defined the one as if it were the other;\r\nand the professor, who was a fair sort of man, said to him, "Don\'t be\r\nagitated, Monsieur! Compose yourself!" Then, having asked two easy\r\nquestions, which were answered in a doubtful fashion, he passed on at\r\nlast to the fourth. This wretched beginning made Frederick lose his\r\nhead. Deslauriers, who was facing him amongst the spectators, made a\r\nsign to him to indicate that it was not a hopeless case yet; and at the\r\nsecond batch of questions, dealing with the criminal law, he came out\r\ntolerably well. But, after the third, with reference to the "mystic\r\nwill," the examiner having remained impassive the whole time, his mental\r\ndistress redoubled; for Hussonnet brought his hands together as if to\r\napplaud, whilst Deslauriers liberally indulged in shrugs of the\r\nshoulders. Finally, the moment was reached when it was necessary to be\r\nexamined on Procedure. The professor, displeased at listening to\r\ntheories opposed to his own, asked him in a churlish tone:\r\n\r\n"And so this is your view, monsieur? How do you reconcile the principle\r\nof article 1351 of the Civil Code with this application by a third party\r\nto set aside a judgment by default?"\r\n\r\nFrederick had a great headache from not having slept the night before. A\r\nray of sunlight, penetrating through one of the slits in a Venetian\r\nblind, fell on his face. Standing behind the seat, he kept wriggling\r\nabout and tugging at his moustache.\r\n\r\n"I am still awaiting your answer," the man with the gold-edged cap\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAnd as Frederick\'s movements, no doubt, irritated him:\r\n\r\n"You won\'t find it in that moustache of yours!"\r\n\r\nThis sarcasm made the spectators laugh. The professor, feeling\r\nflattered, adopted a wheedling tone. He put two more questions with\r\nreference to adjournment and summary jurisdiction, then nodded his head\r\nby way of approval. The examination was over. Frederick retired into the\r\nvestibule.\r\n\r\nWhile an usher was taking off his gown, to draw it over some other\r\nperson immediately afterwards, his friends gathered around him, and\r\nsucceeded in fairly bothering him with their conflicting opinions as to\r\nthe result of his examination. Presently the announcement was made in a\r\nsonorous voice at the entrance of the hall: "The third was--put off!"\r\n\r\n"Sent packing!" said Hussonnet. "Let us go away!"\r\n\r\nIn front of the door-keeper\'s lodge they met Martinon, flushed, excited,\r\nwith a smile on his face and the halo of victory around his brow. He had\r\njust passed his final examination without any impediment. All he had now\r\nto do was the thesis. Before a fortnight he would be a licentiate. His\r\nfamily enjoyed the acquaintance of a Minister; "a beautiful career" was\r\nopening before him.\r\n\r\n"All the same, this puts you into a mess," said Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so humiliating as to see blockheads succeed in\r\nundertakings in which we fail. Frederick, filled with vexation, replied\r\nthat he did not care a straw about the matter. He had higher\r\npretensions; and as Hussonnet made a show of leaving, Frederick took him\r\naside, and said to him:\r\n\r\n"Not a word about this to them, mind!"\r\n\r\nIt was easy to keep it secret, since Arnoux was starting the next\r\nmorning for Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back in the evening the clerk found his friend singularly\r\naltered: he danced about and whistled; and the other was astonished at\r\nthis capricious change of mood. Frederick declared that he did not\r\nintend to go home to his mother, as he meant to spend his holidays\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nAt the news of Arnoux\'s departure, a feeling of delight had taken\r\npossession of him. He might present himself at the house whenever he\r\nliked without any fear of having his visits broken in upon. The\r\nconsciousness of absolute security would make him self-confident. At\r\nlast he would not stand aloof, he would not be separated from her!\r\nSomething more powerful than an iron chain attached him to Paris; a\r\nvoice from the depths of his heart called out to him to remain.\r\n\r\nThere were certain obstacles in his path. These he got over by writing\r\nto his mother: he first of all admitted that he had failed to pass,\r\nowing to alterations made in the course--a mere mischance--an unfair\r\nthing; besides, all the great advocates (he referred to them by name)\r\nhad been rejected at their examinations. But he calculated on presenting\r\nhimself again in the month of November. Now, having no time to lose, he\r\nwould not go home this year; and he asked, in addition to the quarterly\r\nallowance, for two hundred and fifty francs, to get coached in law by a\r\nprivate tutor, which would be of great assistance to him; and he threw\r\naround the entire epistle a garland of regrets, condolences, expressions\r\nof endearment, and protestations of filial love.\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau, who had been expecting him the following day, was doubly\r\ngrieved. She threw a veil over her son\'s misadventure, and in answer\r\ntold him to "come all the same." Frederick would not give way, and the\r\nresult was a falling out between them. However, at the end of the week,\r\nhe received the amount of the quarter\'s allowance together with the sum\r\nrequired for the payment of the private tutor, which helped to pay for\r\na pair of pearl-grey trousers, a white felt hat, and a gold-headed\r\nswitch. When he had procured all these things he thought:\r\n\r\n"Perhaps this is only a hairdresser\'s fancy on my part!"\r\n\r\nAnd a feeling of considerable hesitation took possession of him.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure as to whether he ought to call on Madame Arnoux,\r\nhe tossed three coins into the air in succession. On each occasion luck\r\nwas in his favour. So then Fate must have ordained it. He hailed a cab\r\nand drove to the Rue de Choiseul.\r\n\r\nHe quickly ascended the staircase and drew the bell-pull, but without\r\neffect. He felt as if he were about to faint.\r\n\r\nThen, with fierce energy, he shook the heavy silk tassel. There was a\r\nresounding peal which gradually died away till no further sound was\r\nheard. Frederick got rather frightened.\r\n\r\nHe pasted his ear to the door--not a breath! He looked in through the\r\nkey-hole, and only saw two reed-points on the wall-paper in the midst of\r\ndesigns of flowers. At last, he was on the point of going away when he\r\nchanged his mind. This time, he gave a timid little ring. The door flew\r\nopen, and Arnoux himself appeared on the threshold, with his hair all in\r\ndisorder, his face crimson, and his features distorted by an expression\r\nof sullen embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Hallo! What the deuce brings you here? Come in!"\r\n\r\nHe led Frederick, not into the boudoir or into the bedroom, but into the\r\ndining-room, where on the table could be seen a bottle of champagne and\r\ntwo glasses; and, in an abrupt tone:\r\n\r\n"There is something you want to ask me, my dear friend?"\r\n\r\n"No! nothing! nothing!" stammered the young man, trying to think of some\r\nexcuse for his visit. At length, he said to Arnoux that he had called to\r\nknow whether they had heard from him, as Hussonnet had announced that he\r\nhad gone to Germany.\r\n\r\n"Not at all!" returned Arnoux. "What a feather-headed fellow that is to\r\ntake everything in the wrong way!"\r\n\r\nIn order to conceal his agitation, Frederick kept walking from right to\r\nleft in the dining-room. Happening to come into contact with a chair, he\r\nknocked down a parasol which had been laid across it, and the ivory\r\nhandle got broken.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" he exclaimed. "How sorry I am for having broken Madame\r\nArnoux\'s parasol!"\r\n\r\nAt this remark, the picture-dealer raised his head and smiled in a very\r\npeculiar fashion. Frederick, taking advantage of the opportunity thus\r\noffered to talk about her, added shyly:\r\n\r\n"Could I not see her?"\r\n\r\nNo. She had gone to the country to see her mother, who was ill.\r\n\r\nHe did not venture to ask any questions as to the length of time that\r\nshe would be away. He merely enquired what was Madame Arnoux\'s native\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n"Chartres. Does this astonish you?"\r\n\r\n"Astonish me? Oh, no! Why should it! Not in the least!"\r\n\r\nAfter that, they could find absolutely nothing to talk about. Arnoux,\r\nhaving made a cigarette for himself, kept walking round the table,\r\npuffing. Frederick, standing near the stove, stared at the walls, the\r\nwhatnot, and the floor; and delightful pictures flitted through his\r\nmemory, or, rather, before his eyes. Then he left the apartment.\r\n\r\nA piece of a newspaper, rolled up into a ball, lay on the floor in the\r\nanteroom. Arnoux snatched it up, and, raising himself on the tips of his\r\ntoes, he stuck it into the bell, in order, as he said, that he might be\r\nable to go and finish his interrupted siesta. Then, as he grasped\r\nFrederick\'s hand:\r\n\r\n"Kindly tell the porter that I am not in."\r\n\r\nAnd he shut the door after him with a bang.\r\n\r\nFrederick descended the staircase step by step. The ill-success of this\r\nfirst attempt discouraged him as to the possible results of those that\r\nmight follow. Then began three months of absolute boredom. As he had\r\nnothing to do, his melancholy was aggravated by the want of occupation.\r\n\r\nHe spent whole hours gazing from the top of his balcony at the river as\r\nit flowed between the quays, with their bulwarks of grey stone,\r\nblackened here and there by the seams of the sewers, with a pontoon of\r\nwasherwomen moored close to the bank, where some brats were amusing\r\nthemselves by making a water-spaniel swim in the slime. His eyes,\r\nturning aside from the stone bridge of N\xf4tre Dame and the three\r\nsuspension bridges, continually directed their glance towards the\r\nQuai-aux-Ormes, resting on a group of old trees, resembling the\r\nlinden-trees of the Montereau wharf. The Saint-Jacques tower, the H\xf4tel\r\nde Ville, Saint-Gervais, Saint-Louis, and Saint-Paul, rose up in front\r\nof him amid a confused mass of roofs; and the genius of the July Column\r\nglittered at the eastern side like a large gold star, whilst at the\r\nother end the dome of the Tuileries showed its outlines against the sky\r\nin one great round mass of blue. Madame Arnoux\'s house must be on this\r\nside in the rear!\r\n\r\nHe went back to his bedchamber; then, throwing himself on the sofa, he\r\nabandoned himself to a confused succession of thoughts--plans of work,\r\nschemes for the guidance of his conduct, attempts to divine the future.\r\nAt last, in order to shake off broodings all about himself, he went out\r\ninto the open air.\r\n\r\nHe plunged at random into the Latin Quarter, usually so noisy, but\r\ndeserted at this particular time, for the students had gone back to join\r\ntheir families. The huge walls of the colleges, which the silence seemed\r\nto lengthen, wore a still more melancholy aspect. All sorts of peaceful\r\nsounds could be heard--the flapping of wings in cages, the noise made by\r\nthe turning of a lathe, or the strokes of a cobbler\'s hammer; and the\r\nold-clothes men, standing in the middle of the street, looked up at each\r\nhouse fruitlessly. In the interior of a solitary caf\xe9 the barmaid was\r\nyawning between her two full decanters. The newspapers were left\r\nundisturbed on the tables of reading-rooms. In the ironing\r\nestablishments linen quivered under the puffs of tepid wind. From time\r\nto time he stopped to look at the window of a second-hand book-shop; an\r\nomnibus which grazed the footpath as it came rumbling along made him\r\nturn round; and, when he found himself before the Luxembourg, he went no\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he was attracted towards the boulevards by the hope of\r\nfinding there something that might amuse him. After he had passed\r\nthrough dark alleys, from which his nostrils were greeted by fresh moist\r\nodours, he reached vast, desolate, open spaces, dazzling with light, in\r\nwhich monuments cast at the side of the pavement notches of black\r\nshadow. But once more the wagons and the shops appeared, and the crowd\r\nhad the effect of stunning him, especially on Sunday, when, from the\r\nBastille to the Madeleine, it kept swaying in one immense flood over the\r\nasphalt, in the midst of a cloud of dust, in an incessant clamour. He\r\nfelt disgusted at the meanness of the faces, the silliness of the talk,\r\nand the idiotic self-satisfaction that oozed through these sweating\r\nforeheads. However, the consciousness of being superior to these\r\nindividuals mitigated the weariness which he experienced in gazing at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEvery day he went to the office of _L\'Art Industriel_; and in order to\r\nascertain when Madame Arnoux would be back, he made elaborate enquiries\r\nabout her mother. Arnoux\'s answer never varied--"the change for the\r\nbetter was continuing"--his wife, with his little daughter, would be\r\nreturning the following week. The longer she delayed in coming back, the\r\nmore uneasiness Frederick exhibited, so that Arnoux, touched by so much\r\naffection, brought him five or six times a week to dine at a restaurant.\r\n\r\nIn the long talks which they had together on these occasions Frederick\r\ndiscovered that the picture-dealer was not a very intellectual type of\r\nman. Arnoux might, however, take notice of his chilling manner; and now\r\nFrederick deemed it advisable to pay back, in a small measure, his\r\npolite attentions.\r\n\r\nSo, being anxious to do things on a good scale, the young man sold all\r\nhis new clothes to a second-hand clothes-dealer for the sum of eighty\r\nfrancs, and having increased it with a hundred more francs which he had\r\nleft, he called at Arnoux\'s house to bring him out to dine. Regimbart\r\nhappened to be there, and all three of them set forth for Les Trois\r\nFr\xe8res Proven\xe7aux.\r\n\r\nThe Citizen began by taking off his surtout, and, knowing that the two\r\nothers would defer to his gastronomic tastes, drew up the _menu_. But in\r\nvain did he make his way to the kitchen to speak himself to the _chef_,\r\ngo down to the cellar, with every corner of which he was familiar, and\r\nsend for the master of the establishment, to whom he gave "a blowing\r\nup." He was not satisfied with the dishes, the wines, or the attendance.\r\nAt each new dish, at each fresh bottle, as soon as he had swallowed the\r\nfirst mouthful, the first draught, he threw down his fork or pushed his\r\nglass some distance away from him; then, leaning on his elbows on the\r\ntablecloth, and stretching out his arms, he declared in a loud tone that\r\nhe could no longer dine in Paris! Finally, not knowing what to put into\r\nhis mouth, Regimbart ordered kidney-beans dressed with oil, "quite\r\nplain," which, though only a partial success, slightly appeased him.\r\nThen he had a talk with the waiter all about the latter\'s predecessors\r\nat the "Proven\xe7aux":--"What had become of Antoine? And a fellow named\r\nEug\xe8ne? And Th\xe9odore, the little fellow who always used to attend down\r\nstairs? There was much finer fare in those days, and Burgundy vintages\r\nthe like of which they would never see again."\r\n\r\nThen there was a discussion as to the value of ground in the suburbs,\r\nArnoux having speculated in that way, and looked on it as a safe thing.\r\nIn the meantime, however, he would lie out of the interest on his money.\r\nAs he did not want to sell out at any price, Regimbart would find out\r\nsome one to whom he could let the ground; and so these two gentlemen\r\nproceeded at the close of the dessert to make calculations with a lead\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nThey went out to get coffee in the smoking-divan on the ground-floor in\r\nthe Passage du Saumon. Frederick had to remain on his legs while\r\ninterminable games of billiards were being played, drenched in\r\ninnumerable glasses of beer; and he lingered on there till midnight\r\nwithout knowing why, through want of energy, through sheer\r\nsenselessness, in the vague expectation that something might happen\r\nwhich would give a favourable turn to his love.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, would he next see her? Frederick was in a state of despair\r\nabout it. But, one evening, towards the close of November, Arnoux said\r\nto him:\r\n\r\n"My wife, you know, came back yesterday!"\r\n\r\nNext day, at five o\'clock, he made his way to her house. He began by\r\ncongratulating her on her mother\'s recovery from such a serious illness.\r\n\r\n"Why, no! Who told you that?"\r\n\r\n"Arnoux!"\r\n\r\nShe gave vent to a slight "Ah!" then added that she had grave fears at\r\nfirst, which, however, had now been dispelled. She was seated close\r\nbeside the fire in an upholstered easy-chair. He was on the sofa, with\r\nhis hat between his knees; and the conversation was difficult to carry\r\non, as it was broken off nearly every minute, so he got no chance\r\nof giving utterance to his sentiments. But, when he began to\r\ncomplain of having to study legal quibbles, she answered, "Oh! I\r\nunderstand--business!" and she let her face fall, buried suddenly in her\r\nown reflections.\r\n\r\nHe was eager to know what they were, and even did not bestow a thought\r\non anything else. The twilight shadows gathered around them.\r\n\r\nShe rose, having to go out about some shopping; then she reappeared in a\r\nbonnet trimmed with velvet, and a black mantle edged with minever. He\r\nplucked up courage and offered to accompany her.\r\n\r\nIt was now so dark that one could scarcely see anything. The air was\r\ncold, and had an unpleasant odour, owing to a heavy fog, which partially\r\nblotted out the fronts of the houses. Frederick inhaled it with delight;\r\nfor he could feel through the wadding of his coat the form of her arm;\r\nand her hand, cased in a chamois glove with two buttons, her little hand\r\nwhich he would have liked to cover with kisses, leaned on his sleeve.\r\nOwing to the slipperiness of the pavement, they lost their balance a\r\nlittle; it seemed to him as if they were both rocked by the wind in the\r\nmidst of a cloud.\r\n\r\nThe glitter of the lamps on the boulevard brought him back to the\r\nrealities of existence. The opportunity was a good one, there was no\r\ntime to lose. He gave himself as far as the Rue de Richeli\xe9u to declare\r\nhis love. But almost at that very moment, in front of a china-shop, she\r\nstopped abruptly and said to him:\r\n\r\n"We are at the place. Thanks. On Thursday--is it not?--as usual."\r\n\r\nThe dinners were now renewed; and the more visits he paid at Madame\r\nArnoux\'s, the more his love-sickness increased. The contemplation of\r\nthis woman had an enervating effect upon him, like the use of a perfume\r\nthat is too strong. It penetrated into the very depths of his nature,\r\nand became almost a kind of habitual sensation, a new mode of existence.\r\n\r\nThe prostitutes whom he brushed past under the gaslight, the female\r\nballad-singers breaking into bursts of melody, the ladies rising on\r\nhorseback at full gallop, the shopkeepers\' wives on foot, the grisettes\r\nat their windows, all women brought her before his mental vision, either\r\nfrom the effect of their resemblance to her or the violent contrast to\r\nher which they presented. As he walked along by the shops, he gazed at\r\nthe cashmeres, the laces, and the jewelled eardrops, imagining how they\r\nwould look draped around her figure, sewn in her corsage, or lighting up\r\nher dark hair. In the flower-girls\' baskets the bouquets blossomed for\r\nher to choose one as she passed. In the shoemakers\' show-windows the\r\nlittle satin slippers with swan\'s-down edges seemed to be waiting for\r\nher foot. Every street led towards her house; the hackney-coaches stood\r\nin their places to carry her home the more quickly; Paris was associated\r\nwith her person, and the great city, with all its noises, roared around\r\nher like an immense orchestra.\r\n\r\nWhen he went into the Jardin des Plantes the sight of a palm-tree\r\ncarried him off into distant countries. They were travelling together on\r\nthe backs of dromedaries, under the awnings of elephants, in the cabin\r\nof a yacht amongst the blue archipelagoes, or side by side on mules with\r\nlittle bells attached to them who went stumbling through the grass\r\nagainst broken columns. Sometimes he stopped in the Louvre before old\r\npictures; and, his love embracing her even in vanished centuries, he\r\nsubstituted her for the personages in the paintings. Wearing a hennin on\r\nher head, she was praying on bended knees before a stained-glass window.\r\nLady Paramount of Castile or Flanders, she remained seated in a starched\r\nruff and a body lined with whalebone with big puffs. Then he saw her\r\ndescending some wide porphyry staircase in the midst of senators under a\r\ndais of ostriches\' feathers in a robe of brocade. At another time he\r\ndreamed of her in yellow silk trousers on the cushions of a harem--and\r\nall that was beautiful, the scintillation of the stars, certain tunes in\r\nmusic, the turn of a phrase, the outlines of a face, led him to think\r\nabout her in an abrupt, unconscious fashion.\r\n\r\nAs for trying to make her his mistress, he was sure that any such\r\nattempt would be futile.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Dittmer, on his arrival, kissed her on the forehead;\r\nLovarias did the same, observing:\r\n\r\n"You give me leave--don\'t you?--as it is a friend\'s privilege?"\r\n\r\nFrederick stammered out:\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that we are all friends."\r\n\r\n"Not all old friends!" she returned.\r\n\r\nThis was repelling him beforehand indirectly.\r\n\r\nBesides, what was he to do? To tell her that he loved her? No doubt, she\r\nwould decline to listen to him or else she would feel indignant and turn\r\nhim out of the house. But he preferred to submit to even the most\r\npainful ordeal rather than run the horrible risk of seeing her no more.\r\nHe envied pianists for their talents and soldiers for their scars. He\r\nlonged for a dangerous attack of sickness, hoping in this way to make\r\nher take an interest in him.\r\n\r\nOne thing caused astonishment to himself, that he felt in no way jealous\r\nof Arnoux; and he could not picture her in his imagination undressed, so\r\nnatural did her modesty appear, and so far did her sex recede into a\r\nmysterious background.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he dreamed of the happiness of living with her, of\r\n"theeing" and "thouing" her, of passing his hand lingeringly over her\r\nhead-bands, or remaining in a kneeling posture on the floor, with both\r\narms clasped round her waist, so as to drink in her soul through his\r\neyes. To accomplish this it would be necessary to conquer Fate; and so,\r\nincapable of action, cursing God, and accusing himself of being a\r\ncoward, he kept moving restlessly within the confines of his passion\r\njust as a prisoner keeps moving about in his dungeon. The pangs which he\r\nwas perpetually enduring were choking him. For hours he would remain\r\nquite motionless, or else he would burst into tears; and one day when he\r\nhad not the strength to restrain his emotion, Deslauriers said to him:\r\n\r\n"Why, goodness gracious! what\'s the matter with you?"\r\n\r\nFrederick\'s nerves were unstrung. Deslauriers did not believe a word of\r\nit. At the sight of so much mental anguish, he felt all his old\r\naffection reawakening, and he tried to cheer up his friend. A man like\r\nhim to let himself be depressed, what folly! It was all very well while\r\none was young; but, as one grows older, it is only loss of time.\r\n\r\n"You are spoiling my Frederick for me! I want him whom I knew in bygone\r\ndays. The same boy as ever! I liked him! Come, smoke a pipe, old chap!\r\nShake yourself up a little! You drive me mad!"\r\n\r\n"It is true," said Frederick, "I am a fool!"\r\n\r\nThe clerk replied:\r\n\r\n"Ah! old troubadour, I know well what\'s troubling you! A little affair\r\nof the heart? Confess it! Bah! One lost, four found instead! We console\r\nourselves for virtuous women with the other sort. Would you like me to\r\nintroduce you to some women? You have only to come to the Alhambra."\r\n\r\n(This was a place for public balls recently opened at the top of the\r\nChamps-Elys\xe9es, which had gone down owing to a display of licentiousness\r\nsomewhat ruder than is usual in establishments of the kind.)\r\n\r\n"That\'s a place where there seems to be good fun. You can take your\r\nfriends, if you like. I can even pass in Regimbart for you."\r\n\r\nFrederick did not think fit to ask the Citizen to go. Deslauriers\r\ndeprived himself of the pleasure of S\xe9n\xe9cal\'s society. They took only\r\nHussonnet and Cisy along with Dussardier; and the same hackney-coach set\r\nthe group of five down at the entrance of the Alhambra.\r\n\r\nTwo Moorish galleries extended on the right and on the left, parallel to\r\none another. The wall of a house opposite occupied the entire backguard;\r\nand the fourth side (that in which the restaurant was) represented a\r\nGothic cloister with stained-glass windows. A sort of Chinese roof\r\nscreened the platform reserved for the musicians. The ground was covered\r\nall over with asphalt; the Venetian lanterns fastened to posts formed,\r\nat regular intervals, crowns of many-coloured flame above the heads of\r\nthe dancers. A pedestal here and there supported a stone basin, from\r\nwhich rose a thin streamlet of water. In the midst of the foliage could\r\nbe seen plaster statues, and Hebes and Cupid, painted in oil, and\r\npresenting a very sticky appearance; and the numerous walks, garnished\r\nwith sand of a deep yellow, carefully raked, made the garden look much\r\nlarger than it was in reality.\r\n\r\nStudents were walking their mistresses up and down; drapers\' clerks\r\nstrutted about with canes in their hands; lads fresh from college were\r\nsmoking their regalias; old men had their dyed beards smoothed out with\r\ncombs. There were English, Russians, men from South America, and three\r\nOrientals in tarbooshes. Lorettes, grisettes, and girls of the town had\r\ncome there in the hope of finding a protector, a lover, a gold coin, or\r\nsimply for the pleasure of dancing; and their dresses, with tunics of\r\nwater-green, cherry-red, or violet, swept along, fluttered between the\r\nebony-trees and the lilacs. Nearly all the men\'s clothes were of striped\r\nmaterial; some of them had white trousers, in spite of the coolness of\r\nthe evening. The gas was lighted.\r\n\r\nHussonnet was acquainted with a number of the women through his\r\nconnection with the fashion-journals and the smaller theatres. He sent\r\nthem kisses with the tips of his fingers, and from time to time he\r\nquitted his friends to go and chat with them.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers felt jealous of these playful familiarities. He accosted in\r\na cynical manner a tall, fair-haired girl, in a nankeen costume. After\r\nlooking at him with a certain air of sullenness, she said:\r\n\r\n"No! I wouldn\'t trust you, my good fellow!" and turned on her heel.\r\n\r\nHis next attack was on a stout brunette, who apparently was a little\r\nmad; for she gave a bounce at the very first word he spoke to her,\r\nthreatening, if he went any further, to call the police. Deslauriers\r\nmade an effort to laugh; then, coming across a little woman sitting by\r\nherself under a gas-lamp, he asked her to be his partner in a quadrille.\r\n\r\nThe musicians, perched on the platform in the attitude of apes, kept\r\nscraping and blowing away with desperate energy. The conductor, standing\r\nup, kept beating time automatically. The dancers were much crowded and\r\nenjoyed themselves thoroughly. The bonnet-strings, getting loose,\r\nrubbed against the cravats; the boots sank under the petticoats; and all\r\nthis bouncing went on to the accompaniment of the music. Deslauriers\r\nhugged the little woman, and, seized with the delirium of the cancan,\r\nwhirled about, like a big marionnette, in the midst of the dancers. Cisy\r\nand Deslauriers were still promenading up and down. The young aristocrat\r\nkept ogling the girls, and, in spite of the clerk\'s exhortations, did\r\nnot venture to talk to them, having an idea in his head that in the\r\nresorts of these women there was always "a man hidden in the cupboard\r\nwith a pistol who would come out of it and force you to sign a bill of\r\nexchange."\r\n\r\nThey came back and joined Frederick. Deslauriers had stopped dancing;\r\nand they were all asking themselves how they were to finish up the\r\nevening, when Hussonnet exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Look! Here\'s the Marquise d\'Ama\xebgui!"\r\n\r\nThe person referred to was a pale woman with a _retrouss\xe9_ nose, mittens\r\nup to her elbows, and big black earrings hanging down her cheeks, like\r\ntwo dog\'s ears. Hussonnet said to her:\r\n\r\n"We ought to organise a little f\xeate at your house--a sort of Oriental\r\nrout. Try to collect some of your friends here for these French\r\ncavaliers. Well, what is annoying you? Are you going to wait for your\r\nhidalgo?"\r\n\r\nThe Andalusian hung down her head: being well aware of the by no means\r\nlavish habits of her friend, she was afraid of having to pay for any\r\nrefreshments he ordered. When, at length, she let the word "money" slip\r\nfrom her, Cisy offered five napoleons--all he had in his purse; and so\r\nit was settled that the thing should come off.\r\n\r\nBut Frederick was absent. He fancied that he had recognised the voice of\r\nArnoux, and got a glimpse of a woman\'s hat; and accordingly he hastened\r\ntowards an arbour which was not far off.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Vatnaz was alone there with Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me! I am in the way?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least!" returned the picture-merchant.\r\n\r\nFrederick, from the closing words of their conversation, understood that\r\nArnoux had come to the Alhambra to talk over a pressing matter of\r\nbusiness with Mademoiselle Vatnaz; and it was evident that he was not\r\ncompletely reassured, for he said to her, with some uneasiness in his\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n"You are quite sure?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly certain! You are loved. Ah! what a man you are!"\r\n\r\nAnd she assumed a pouting look, putting out her big lips, so red that\r\nthey seemed tinged with blood. But she had wonderful eyes, of a tawny\r\nhue, with specks of gold in the pupils, full of vivacity, amorousness,\r\nand sensuality. They illuminated, like lamps, the rather yellow tint of\r\nher thin face. Arnoux seemed to enjoy her exhibition of pique. He\r\nstooped over her, saying:\r\n\r\n"You are nice--give me a kiss!"\r\n\r\nShe caught hold of his two ears, and pressed her lips against his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the dancing stopped; and in the conductor\'s place\r\nappeared a handsome young man, rather fat, with a waxen complexion. He\r\nhad long black hair, which he wore in the same fashion as Christ, and a\r\nblue velvet waistcoat embroidered with large gold palm-branches. He\r\nlooked as proud as a peacock, and as stupid as a turkey-cock; and,\r\nhaving bowed to the audience, he began a ditty. A villager was supposed\r\nto be giving an account of his journey to the capital. The singer used\r\nthe dialect of Lower Normandy, and played the part of a drunken man. The\r\nrefrain--\r\n\r\n    "Ah! I laughed at you there, I laughed at you there,\r\n         In that rascally city of Paris!"[4]\r\n\r\nwas greeted with enthusiastic stampings of feet. Delmas, "a vocalist who\r\nsang with expression," was too shrewd to let the excitement of his\r\nlisteners cool. A guitar was quickly handed to him and he moaned forth a\r\nballad entitled "The Albanian Girl\'s Brother."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ah! j\'ai l\'y ri, j\'ai l\'y ri. Dans ce gueusard de Paris!_]\r\n\r\nThe words recalled to Frederick those which had been sung by the man in\r\nrags between the paddle-boxes of the steamboat. His eyes involuntarily\r\nattached themselves to the hem of the dress spread out before him.\r\n\r\nAfter each couplet there was a long pause, and the blowing of the wind\r\nthrough the trees resembled the sound of the waves.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Vatnaz blushed the moment she saw Dussardier. She soon\r\nrose, and stretching out her hand towards him:\r\n\r\n"You do not remember me, Monsieur Auguste?"\r\n\r\n"How do you know her?" asked Frederick.\r\n\r\n"We have been in the same house," he replied.\r\n\r\nCisy pulled him by the sleeve; they went out; and, scarcely had they\r\ndisappeared, when Madame Vatnaz began to pronounce a eulogy on his\r\ncharacter. She even went so far as to add that he possessed "the genius\r\nof the heart."\r\n\r\nThen they chatted about Delmas, admitting that as a mimic he might be a\r\nsuccess on the stage; and a discussion followed in which Shakespeare,\r\nthe Censorship, Style, the People, the receipts of the Porte\r\nSaint-Martin, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, and Dumersan were all mixed\r\nup together.\r\n\r\nArnoux had known many celebrated actresses; the young men bent forward\r\ntheir heads to hear what he had to say about these ladies. But his words\r\nwere drowned in the noise of the music; and, as soon as the quadrille or\r\nthe polka was over, they all squatted round the tables, called the\r\nwaiter, and laughed. Bottles of beer and of effervescent lemonade went\r\noff with detonations amid the foliage; women clucked like hens; now and\r\nthen, two gentlemen tried to fight; and a thief was arrested. The\r\ndancers, in the rush of a gallop, encroached on the walks. Panting, with\r\nflushed, smiling faces, they filed off in a whirlwind which lifted up\r\nthe gowns with the coat-tails. The trombones brayed more loudly; the\r\nrhythmic movement became more rapid. Behind the medi\xe6val cloister could\r\nbe heard crackling sounds; squibs went off; artificial suns began\r\nturning round; the gleam of the Bengal fires, like emeralds in colour,\r\nlighted up for the space of a minute the entire garden; and, with the\r\nlast rocket, a great sigh escaped from the assembled throng.\r\n\r\nIt slowly died away. A cloud of gunpowder floated into the air.\r\nFrederick and Deslauriers were walking step by step through the midst of\r\nthe crowd, when they happened to see something that made them suddenly\r\nstop: Martinon was in the act of paying some money at the place where\r\numbrellas were left; and he was accompanying a woman of fifty,\r\nplain-looking, magnificently dressed, and of problematic social rank.\r\n\r\n"That sly dog," said Deslauriers, "is not so simple as we imagine. But\r\nwhere in the world is Cisy?"\r\n\r\nDussardier pointed out to them the smoking-divan, where they perceived\r\nthe knightly youth, with a bowl of punch before him, and a pink hat by\r\nhis side, to keep him company. Hussonnet, who had been away for the past\r\nfew minutes, reappeared at the same moment.\r\n\r\nA young girl was leaning on his arm, and addressing him in a loud voice\r\nas "My little cat."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no!" said he to her--"not in public! Call me rather \'Vicomte.\' That\r\ngives you a cavalier style--Louis XIII. and dainty boots--the sort of\r\nthing I like! Yes, my good friends, one of the old _r\xe9gime_!--nice,\r\nisn\'t she?"--and he chucked her by the chin--"Salute these gentlemen!\r\nthey are all the sons of peers of France. I keep company with them in\r\norder that they may get an appointment for me as an ambassador."\r\n\r\n"How insane you are!" sighed Mademoiselle Vatnaz. She asked Dussardier\r\nto see her as far as her own door.\r\n\r\nArnoux watched them going off; then, turning towards Frederick:\r\n\r\n"Did you like the Vatnaz? At any rate, you\'re not quite frank about\r\nthese affairs. I believe you keep your amours hidden."\r\n\r\nFrederick, turning pale, swore that he kept nothing hidden.\r\n\r\n"Can it be possible you don\'t know what it is to have a mistress?" said\r\nArnoux.\r\n\r\nFrederick felt a longing to mention a woman\'s name at random. But the\r\nstory might be repeated to her. So he replied that as a matter of fact\r\nhe had no mistress.\r\n\r\nThe picture-dealer reproached him for this.\r\n\r\n"This evening you had a good opportunity! Why didn\'t you do like the\r\nothers, each of whom went off with a woman?"\r\n\r\n"Well, and what about yourself?" said Frederick, provoked by his\r\npersistency.\r\n\r\n"Oh! myself--that\'s quite a different matter, my lad! I go home to my\r\nown one!"\r\n\r\nThen he called a cab, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe two friends walked towards their own destination. An east wind was\r\nblowing. They did not exchange a word. Deslauriers was regretting that\r\nhe had not succeeded in making a _shine_ before a certain\r\nnewspaper-manager, and Frederick was lost once more in his melancholy\r\nbroodings. At length, breaking silence, he said that this public-house\r\nball appeared to him a stupid affair.\r\n\r\n"Whose fault is it? If you had not left us, to join that Arnoux of\r\nyours----"\r\n\r\n"Bah! anything I could have done would have been utterly useless!"\r\n\r\nBut the clerk had theories of his own. All that was necessary in order\r\nto get a thing was to desire it strongly.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, you yourself, a little while ago----"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a straw about that sort of thing!" returned Deslauriers,\r\ncutting short Frederick\'s allusion. "Am I going to get entangled with\r\nwomen?"\r\n\r\nAnd he declaimed against their affectations, their silly ways--in short,\r\nhe disliked them.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be acting, then!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers became silent. Then, all at once:\r\n\r\n"Will you bet me a hundred francs that I won\'t _do_ the first woman that\r\npasses?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--it\'s a bet!"\r\n\r\nThe first who passed was a hideous-looking beggar-woman, and they were\r\ngiving up all hope of a chance presenting itself when, in the middle of\r\nthe Rue de Rivoli, they saw a tall girl with a little bandbox in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers accosted her under the arcades. She turned up abruptly by\r\nthe Tuileries, and soon diverged into the Place du Carrousel. She\r\nglanced to the right and to the left. She ran after a hackney-coach;\r\nDeslauriers overtook her. He walked by her side, talking to her with\r\nexpressive gestures. At length, she accepted his arm, and they went on\r\ntogether along the quays. Then, when they reached the rising ground in\r\nfront of the Ch\xe2telet, they kept tramping up and down for at least\r\ntwenty minutes, like two sailors keeping watch. But, all of a sudden,\r\nthey passed over the Pont-au-Change, through the Flower Market, and\r\nalong the Quai Napol\xe9on. Frederick came up behind them. Deslauriers gave\r\nhim to understand that he would be in their way, and had only to follow\r\nhis own example.\r\n\r\n"How much have you got still?"\r\n\r\n"Two hundred sous pieces."\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough--good night to you!"\r\n\r\nFrederick was seized with the astonishment one feels at seeing a piece\r\nof foolery coming to a successful issue.\r\n\r\n"He has the laugh at me," was his reflection. "Suppose I went back\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Deslauriers imagined that he was envious of this paltry love!\r\n"As if I had not one a hundred times more rare, more noble, more\r\nabsorbing." He felt a sort of angry feeling impelling him onward. He\r\narrived in front of Madame Arnoux\'s door.\r\n\r\nNone of the outer windows belonged to her apartment. Nevertheless, he\r\nremained with his eyes pasted on the front of the house--as if he\r\nfancied he could, by his contemplation, break open the walls. No doubt,\r\nshe was now sunk in repose, tranquil as a sleeping flower, with her\r\nbeautiful black hair resting on the lace of the pillow, her lips\r\nslightly parted, and one arm under her head. Then Arnoux\'s head rose\r\nbefore him, and he rushed away to escape from this vision.\r\n\r\nThe advice which Deslauriers had given to him came back to his memory.\r\nIt only filled him with horror. Then he walked about the streets in a\r\nvagabond fashion.\r\n\r\nWhen a pedestrian approached, he tried to distinguish the face. From\r\ntime to time a ray of light passed between his legs, tracing a great\r\nquarter of a circle on the pavement; and in the shadow a man appeared\r\nwith his dosser and his lantern. The wind, at certain points, made the\r\nsheet-iron flue of a chimney shake. Distant sounds reached his ears,\r\nmingling with the buzzing in his brain; and it seemed to him that he was\r\nlistening to the indistinct flourish of quadrille music. His movements\r\nas he walked on kept up this illusion. He found himself on the Pont de\r\nla Concorde.\r\n\r\nThen he recalled that evening in the previous winter, when, as he left\r\nher house for the first time, he was forced to stand still, so rapidly\r\ndid his heart beat with the hopes that held it in their clasp. And now\r\nthey had all withered!\r\n\r\nDark clouds were drifting across the face of the moon. He gazed at it,\r\nmusing on the vastness of space, the wretchedness of life, the\r\nnothingness of everything. The day dawned; his teeth began to chatter,\r\nand, half-asleep, wet with the morning mist, and bathed in tears, he\r\nasked himself, Why should I not make an end of it? All that was\r\nnecessary was a single movement. The weight of his forehead dragged him\r\nalong--he beheld his own dead body floating in the water. Frederick\r\nstooped down. The parapet was rather wide, and it was through pure\r\nweariness that he did not make the attempt to leap over it.\r\n\r\nThen a feeling of dismay swept over him. He reached the boulevards once\r\nmore, and sank down upon a seat. He was aroused by some police-officers,\r\nwho were convinced that he had been indulging a little too freely.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his walk. But, as he was exceedingly hungry, and as all the\r\nrestaurants were closed, he went to get a "snack" at a tavern by the\r\nfish-markets; after which, thinking it too soon to go in yet, he kept\r\nsauntering about the H\xf4tel de Ville till a quarter past eight.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers had long since got rid of his wench; and he was writing at\r\nthe table in the middle of his room. About four o\'clock, M. de Cisy came\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dussardier, he had enjoyed the society of a lady the night\r\nbefore; and he had even accompanied her home in the carriage with her\r\nhusband to the very threshold of their house, where she had given him an\r\nassignation. He parted with her without even knowing her name.\r\n\r\n"And what do you propose that I should do in that way?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\nThereupon the young gentleman began to cudgel his brains to think of a\r\nsuitable woman; he mentioned Mademoiselle Vatnaz, the Andalusian, and\r\nall the rest. At length, with much circumlocution, he stated the object\r\nof his visit. Relying on the discretion of his friend, he came to aid\r\nhim in taking an important step, after which he might definitely regard\r\nhimself as a man; and Frederick showed no reluctance. He told the story\r\nto Deslauriers without relating the facts with reference to himself\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\nThe clerk was of opinion that he was now going on very well. This\r\nrespect for his advice increased his good humour. He owed to that\r\nquality his success, on the very first night he met her, with\r\nMademoiselle Cl\xe9mence Daviou, embroideress in gold for military outfits,\r\nthe sweetest creature that ever lived, as slender as a reed, with large\r\nblue eyes, perpetually staring with wonder. The clerk had taken\r\nadvantage of her credulity to such an extent as to make her believe that\r\nhe had been decorated. At their private conversations he had his\r\nfrock-coat adorned with a red ribbon, but divested himself of it in\r\npublic in order, as he put it, not to humiliate his master. However, he\r\nkept her at a distance, allowed himself to be fawned upon, like a pasha,\r\nand, in a laughing sort of way, called her "daughter of the people."\r\nEvery time they met, she brought him little bunches of violets.\r\nFrederick would not have cared for a love affair of this sort.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, whenever they set forth arm-in-arm to visit Pinson\'s or\r\nBarillot\'s circulating library, he experienced a feeling of singular\r\ndepression. Frederick did not realise how much pain he had made\r\nDeslauriers endure for the past year, while brushing his nails before\r\ngoing out to dine in the Rue de Choiseul!\r\n\r\nOne evening, when from the commanding position in which his balcony\r\nstood, he had just been watching them as they went out together, he saw\r\nHussonnet, some distance off, on the Pont d\'Arcole. The Bohemian began\r\ncalling him by making signals towards him, and, when Frederick had\r\ndescended the five flights of stairs:\r\n\r\n"Here is the thing--it is next Saturday, the 24th, Madame Arnoux\'s\r\nfeast-day."\r\n\r\n"How is that, when her name is Marie?"\r\n\r\n"And Ang\xe8le also--no matter! They will entertain their guests at their\r\ncountry-house at Saint-Cloud. I was told to give you due notice about\r\nit. You\'ll find a vehicle at the magazine-office at three o\'clock. So\r\nthat makes matters all right! Excuse me for having disturbed you! But I\r\nhave such a number of calls to make!"\r\n\r\nFrederick had scarcely turned round when his door-keeper placed a letter\r\nin his hand:\r\n\r\n"Monsieur and Madame Dambreuse beg of Monsieur F. Moreau to do them the\r\nhonour to come and dine with them on Saturday the 24th inst.--R.S.V.P."\r\n\r\n"Too late!" he said to himself. Nevertheless, he showed the letter to\r\nDeslauriers, who exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Ha! at last! But you don\'t look as if you were satisfied. Why?"\r\n\r\nAfter some little hesitation, Frederick said that he had another\r\ninvitation for the same day.\r\n\r\n"Be kind enough to let me run across to the Rue de Choiseul. I\'m not\r\njoking! I\'ll answer this for you if it puts you about."\r\n\r\nAnd the clerk wrote an acceptance of the invitation in the third person.\r\n\r\nHaving seen nothing of the world save through the fever of his desires,\r\nhe pictured it to himself as an artificial creation discharging its\r\nfunctions by virtue of mathematical laws. A dinner in the city, an\r\naccidental meeting with a man in office, a smile from a pretty woman,\r\nmight, by a series of actions deducing themselves from one another, have\r\ngigantic results. Certain Parisian drawing-rooms were like those\r\nmachines which take a material in the rough and render it a hundred\r\ntimes more valuable. He believed in courtesans advising diplomatists, in\r\nwealthy marriages brought about by intrigues, in the cleverness of\r\nconvicts, in the capacity of strong men for getting the better of\r\nfortune. In short, he considered it so useful to visit the Dambreuses,\r\nand talked about it so plausibly, that Frederick was at a loss to know\r\nwhat was the best course to take.\r\n\r\nThe least he ought to do, as it was Madame Arnoux\'s feast-day, was to\r\nmake her a present. He naturally thought of a parasol, in order to make\r\nreparation for his awkwardness. Now he came across a shot-silk parasol\r\nwith a little carved ivory handle, which had come all the way from\r\nChina. But the price of it was a hundred and seventy-five francs, and he\r\nhad not a sou, having in fact to live on the credit of his next\r\nquarter\'s allowance. However, he wished to get it; he was determined to\r\nhave it; and, in spite of his repugnance to doing so, he had recourse to\r\nDeslauriers.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers answered Frederick\'s first question by saying that he had no\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n"I want some," said Frederick--"I want some very badly!"\r\n\r\nAs the other made the same excuse over again, he flew into a passion.\r\n\r\n"You might find it to your advantage some time----"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! nothing."\r\n\r\nThe clerk understood. He took the sum required out of his reserve-fund,\r\nand when he had counted out the money, coin by coin:\r\n\r\n"I am not asking you for a receipt, as I see you have a lot of expense!"\r\n\r\nFrederick threw himself on his friend\'s neck with a thousand\r\naffectionate protestations. Deslauriers received this display of emotion\r\nfrigidly. Then, next morning, noticing the parasol on the top of the\r\npiano:\r\n\r\n"Ah! it was for that!"\r\n\r\n"I will send it, perhaps," said Frederick, with an air of carelessness.\r\n\r\nGood fortune was on his side, for that evening he got a note with a\r\nblack border from Madame Dambreuse announcing to him that she had lost\r\nan uncle, and excusing herself for having to defer till a later period\r\nthe pleasure of making his acquaintance. At two o\'clock, he reached the\r\noffice of the art journal. Instead of waiting for him in order to drive\r\nhim in his carriage, Arnoux had left the city the night before, unable\r\nto resist his desire to get some fresh air.\r\n\r\nEvery year it was his custom, as soon as the leaves were budding forth,\r\nto start early in the morning and to remain away several days, making\r\nlong journeys across the fields, drinking milk at the farm-houses,\r\nromping with the village girls, asking questions about the harvest, and\r\ncarrying back home with him stalks of salad in his pocket-handkerchief.\r\nAt length, in order to realise a long-cherished dream of his, he had\r\nbought a country-house.\r\n\r\nWhile Frederick was talking to the picture-dealer\'s clerk, Mademoiselle\r\nVatnaz suddenly made her appearance, and was disappointed at not seeing\r\nArnoux. He would, perhaps, be remaining away two days longer. The clerk\r\nadvised her "to go there"--she could not go there; to write a\r\nletter--she was afraid that the letter might get lost. Frederick offered\r\nto be the bearer of it himself. She rapidly scribbled off a letter, and\r\nimplored of him to let nobody see him delivering it.\r\n\r\nForty minutes afterwards, he found himself at Saint-Cloud. The house,\r\nwhich was about a hundred paces farther away than the bridge, stood\r\nhalf-way up the hill. The garden-walls were hidden by two rows of\r\nlinden-trees, and a wide lawn descended to the bank of the river. The\r\nrailed entrance before the door was open, and Frederick went in.\r\n\r\nArnoux, stretched on the grass, was playing with a litter of kittens.\r\nThis amusement appeared to absorb him completely. Mademoiselle Vatnaz\'s\r\nletter drew him out of his sleepy idleness.\r\n\r\n"The deuce! the deuce!--this is a bore! She is right, though; I must\r\ngo."\r\n\r\nThen, having stuck the missive into his pocket, he showed the young man\r\nthrough the grounds with manifest delight. He pointed out\r\neverything--the stable, the cart-house, the kitchen. The drawing-room\r\nwas at the right, on the side facing Paris, and looked out on a floored\r\narbour, covered over with clematis. But presently a few harmonious notes\r\nburst forth above their heads: Madame Arnoux, fancying that there was\r\nnobody near, was singing to amuse herself. She executed quavers,\r\ntrills, arpeggios. There were long notes which seemed to remain\r\nsuspended in the air; others fell in a rushing shower like the spray of\r\na waterfall; and her voice passing out through the Venetian blind, cut\r\nits way through the deep silence and rose towards the blue sky. She\r\nceased all at once, when M. and Madame Oudry, two neighbours, presented\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThen she appeared herself at the top of the steps in front of the house;\r\nand, as she descended, he caught a glimpse of her foot. She wore little\r\nopen shoes of reddish-brown leather, with three straps crossing each\r\nother so as to draw just above her stockings a wirework of gold.\r\n\r\nThose who had been invited arrived. With the exception of Ma\xeetre\r\nLefaucheur, an advocate, they were the same guests who came to the\r\nThursday dinners. Each of them had brought some present--Dittmer a\r\nSyrian scarf, Rosenwald a scrap-book of ballads, Burieu a water-colour\r\npainting, Sombary one of his own caricatures, and Pellerin a\r\ncharcoal-drawing, representing a kind of dance of death, a hideous\r\nfantasy, the execution of which was rather poor. Hussonnet dispensed\r\nwith the formality of a present.\r\n\r\nFrederick was waiting to offer his, after the others.\r\n\r\nShe thanked him very much for it. Thereupon, he said:\r\n\r\n"Why, \'tis almost a debt. I have been so much annoyed----"\r\n\r\n"At what, pray?" she returned. "I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"Come! dinner is waiting!" said Arnoux, catching hold of his arm; then\r\nin a whisper: "You are not very knowing, certainly!"\r\n\r\nNothing could well be prettier than the dining-room, painted in\r\nwater-green. At one end, a nymph of stone was dipping her toe in a basin\r\nformed like a shell. Through the open windows the entire garden could be\r\nseen with the long lawn flanked by an old Scotch fir, three-quarters\r\nstripped bare; groups of flowers swelled it out in unequal plots; and at\r\nthe other side of the river extended in a wide semi-circle the Bois de\r\nBoulogne, Neuilly, S\xe8vres, and Meudon. Before the railed gate in front a\r\ncanoe with sail outspread was tacking about.\r\n\r\nThey chatted first about the view in front of them, then about scenery\r\nin general; and they were beginning to plunge into discussions when\r\nArnoux, at half-past nine o\'clock, ordered the horse to be put to the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n"Would you like me to go back with you?" said Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly!" and, making her a graceful bow: "You know well,\r\nmadame, that it is impossible to live without you!"\r\n\r\nEveryone congratulated her on having so good a husband.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it is because I am not the only one," she replied quietly, pointing\r\ntowards her little daughter.\r\n\r\nThen, the conversation having turned once more on painting, there was\r\nsome talk about a Ruysda\xe9l, for which Arnoux expected a big sum, and\r\nPellerin asked him if it were true that the celebrated Saul Mathias from\r\nLondon had come over during the past month to make him an offer of\r\ntwenty-three thousand francs for it.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a positive fact!" and turning towards Frederick: "That was the\r\nvery same gentleman I brought with me a few days ago to the Alhambra,\r\nmuch against my will, I assure you, for these English are by no means\r\namusing companions."\r\n\r\nFrederick, who suspected that Mademoiselle Vatnaz\'s letter contained\r\nsome reference to an intrigue, was amazed at the facility with which my\r\nlord Arnoux found a way of passing it off as a perfectly honourable\r\ntransaction; but his new lie, which was quite needless, made the young\r\nman open his eyes in speechless astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe picture-dealer added, with an air of simplicity:\r\n\r\n"What\'s the name, by-the-by, of that young fellow, your friend?"\r\n\r\n"Deslauriers," said Frederick quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd, in order to repair the injustice which he felt he had done to his\r\ncomrade, he praised him as one who possessed remarkable ability.\r\n\r\n"Ah! indeed? But he doesn\'t look such a fine fellow as the other--the\r\nclerk in the wagon-office."\r\n\r\nFrederick bestowed a mental imprecation on Dussardier. She would now be\r\ntaking it for granted that he associated with the common herd.\r\n\r\nThen they began to talk about the ornamentation of the capital--the new\r\ndistricts of the city--and the worthy Oudry happened to refer to M.\r\nDambreuse as one of the big speculators.\r\n\r\nFrederick, taking advantage of the opportunity to make a good figure,\r\nsaid he was acquainted with that gentleman. But Pellerin launched into a\r\nharangue against shopkeepers--he saw no difference between them, whether\r\nthey were sellers of candles or of money. Then Rosenwald and Burieu\r\ntalked about old china; Arnoux chatted with Madame Oudry about\r\ngardening; Sombary, a comical character of the old school, amused\r\nhimself by chaffing her husband, referring to him sometimes as "Odry,"\r\nas if he were the actor of that name, and remarking that he must be\r\ndescended from Oudry, the dog-painter, seeing that the bump of the\r\nanimals was visible on his forehead. He even wanted to feel M. Oudry\'s\r\nskull; but the latter excused himself on account of his wig; and the\r\ndessert ended with loud bursts of laughter.\r\n\r\nWhen they had taken their coffee, while they smoked, under the\r\nlinden-trees, and strolled about the garden for some time, they went out\r\nfor a walk along the river.\r\n\r\nThe party stopped in front of a fishmonger\'s shop, where a man was\r\nwashing eels. Mademoiselle Marthe wanted to look at them. He emptied the\r\nbox in which he had them out on the grass; and the little girl threw\r\nherself on her knees in order to catch them, laughed with delight, and\r\nthen began to scream with terror. They all got spoiled, and Arnoux paid\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nHe next took it into his head to go out for a sail in the cutter.\r\n\r\nOne side of the horizon was beginning to assume a pale aspect, while on\r\nthe other side a wide strip of orange colour showed itself in the sky,\r\ndeepening into purple at the summits of the hills, which were steeped in\r\nshadow. Madame Arnoux seated herself on a big stone with this glittering\r\nsplendour at her back. The other ladies sauntered about here and there.\r\nHussonnet, at the lower end of the river\'s bank, went making ducks and\r\ndrakes over the water.\r\n\r\nArnoux presently returned, followed by a weather-beaten long boat, into\r\nwhich, in spite of the most prudent remonstrances, he packed his\r\nguests. The boat got upset, and they had to go ashore again.\r\n\r\nBy this time wax-tapers were burning in the drawing-room, all hung with\r\nchintz, and with branched candlesticks of crystal fixed close to the\r\nwalls. M\xe8re Oudry was sleeping comfortably in an armchair, and the\r\nothers were listening to M. Lefaucheux expatiating on the glories of the\r\nBar. Madame Arnoux was sitting by herself near the window. Frederick\r\ncame over to her.\r\n\r\nThey chatted about the remarks which were being made in their vicinity.\r\nShe admired oratory; he preferred the renown gained by authors. But, she\r\nventured to suggest, it must give a man greater pleasure to move crowds\r\ndirectly by addressing them in person, face to face, than it does to\r\ninfuse into their souls by his pen all the sentiments that animate his\r\nown. Such triumphs as these did not tempt Frederick much, as he had no\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nThen he broached the subject of sentimental adventures. She spoke\r\npityingly of the havoc wrought by passion, but expressed indignation at\r\nhypocritical vileness, and this rectitude of spirit harmonised so well\r\nwith the regular beauty of her face that it seemed indeed as if her\r\nphysical attractions were the outcome of her moral nature.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, every now and then, letting her eyes rest on him for a\r\nminute. Then he felt her glances penetrating his soul like those great\r\nrays of sunlight which descend into the depths of the water. He loved\r\nher without mental reservation, without any hope of his love being\r\nreturned, unconditionally; and in those silent transports, which were\r\nlike outbursts of gratitude, he would fain have covered her forehead\r\nwith a rain of kisses. However, an inspiration from within carried him\r\nbeyond himself--he felt moved by a longing for self-sacrifice, an\r\nimperative impulse towards immediate self-devotion, and all the stronger\r\nfrom the fact that he could not gratify it.\r\n\r\nHe did not leave along with the rest. Neither did Hussonnet. They were\r\nto go back in the carriage; and the vehicle was waiting just in front of\r\nthe steps when Arnoux rushed down and hurried into the garden to gather\r\nsome flowers there. Then the bouquet having been tied round with a\r\nthread, as the stems fell down unevenly, he searched in his pocket,\r\nwhich was full of papers, took out a piece at random, wrapped them up,\r\ncompleted his handiwork with the aid of a strong pin, and then offered\r\nit to his wife with a certain amount of tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Look here, my darling! Excuse me for having forgotten you!"\r\n\r\nBut she uttered a little scream: the pin, having been awkwardly fixed,\r\nhad cut her, and she hastened up to her room. They waited nearly a\r\nquarter of an hour for her. At last, she reappeared, carried off Marthe,\r\nand threw herself into the carriage.\r\n\r\n"And your bouquet?" said Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"No! no--it is not worth while!" Frederick was running off to fetch it\r\nfor her; she called out to him:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want it!"\r\n\r\nBut he speedily brought it to her, saying that he had just put it into\r\nan envelope again, as he had found the flowers lying on the floor. She\r\nthrust them behind the leathern apron of the carriage close to the seat,\r\nand off they started.\r\n\r\nFrederick, seated by her side, noticed that she was trembling\r\nfrightfully. Then, when they had passed the bridge, as Arnoux was\r\nturning to the left:\r\n\r\n"Why, no! you are making a mistake!--that way, to the right!"\r\n\r\nShe seemed irritated; everything annoyed her. At length, Marthe having\r\nclosed her eyes, Madame Arnoux drew forth the bouquet, and flung it out\r\nthrough the carriage-door, then caught Frederick\'s arm, making a sign to\r\nhim with the other hand to say nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAfter this, she pressed her handkerchief against her lips, and sat quite\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nThe two others, on the dickey, kept talking about printing and about\r\nsubscribers. Arnoux, who was driving recklessly, lost his way in the\r\nmiddle of the Bois de Boulogne. Then they plunged into narrow paths. The\r\nhorse proceeded along at a walking pace; the branches of the trees\r\ngrazed the hood. Frederick could see nothing of Madame Arnoux save her\r\ntwo eyes in the shade. Marthe lay stretched across her lap while he\r\nsupported the child\'s head.\r\n\r\n"She is tiring you!" said her mother.\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n"No! Oh, no!"\r\n\r\nWhirlwinds of dust rose up slowly. They passed through Auteuil. All the\r\nhouses were closed up; a gas-lamp here and there lighted up the angle of\r\na wall; then once more they were surrounded by darkness. At one time he\r\nnoticed that she was shedding tears.\r\n\r\nWas this remorse or passion? What in the world was it? This grief, of\r\nwhose exact nature he was ignorant, interested him like a personal\r\nmatter. There was now a new bond between them, as if, in a sense, they\r\nwere accomplices; and he said to her in the most caressing voice he\r\ncould assume:\r\n\r\n"You are ill?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a little," she returned.\r\n\r\nThe carriage rolled on, and the honeysuckles and the syringas trailed\r\nover the garden fences, sending forth puffs of enervating odour into the\r\nnight air. Her gown fell around her feet in numerous folds. It seemed to\r\nhim as if he were in communication with her entire person through the\r\nmedium of this child\'s body which lay stretched between them. He stooped\r\nover the little girl, and spreading out her pretty brown tresses, kissed\r\nher softly on the forehead.\r\n\r\n"You are good!" said Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because you are fond of children."\r\n\r\n"Not all!"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but he let his left hand hang down her side wide open,\r\nfancying that she would follow his example perhaps, and that he would\r\nfind her palm touching his. Then he felt ashamed and withdrew it. They\r\nsoon reached the paved street. The carriage went on more quickly; the\r\nnumber of gas-lights vastly increased--it was Paris. Hussonnet, in front\r\nof the lumber-room, jumped down from his seat. Frederick waited till\r\nthey were in the courtyard before alighting; then he lay in ambush at\r\nthe corner of the Rue de Choiseul, and saw Arnoux slowly making his way\r\nback to the boulevards.\r\n\r\nNext morning he began working as hard as ever he could.\r\n\r\nHe saw himself in an Assize Court, on a winter\'s evening, at the close\r\nof the advocates\' speeches, when the jurymen are looking pale, and when\r\nthe panting audience make the partitions of the pr\xe6torium creak; and\r\nafter having being four hours speaking, he was recapitulating all his\r\nproofs, feeling with every phrase, with every word, with every gesture,\r\nthe chopper of the guillotine, which was suspended behind him, rising\r\nup; then in the tribune of the Chamber, an orator who bears on his lips\r\nthe safety of an entire people, drowning his opponents under his figures\r\nof rhetoric, crushing them under a repartee, with thunders and musical\r\nintonations in his voice, ironical, pathetic, fiery, sublime. She would\r\nbe there somewhere in the midst of the others, hiding beneath her veil\r\nher enthusiastic tears. After that they would meet again, and he would\r\nbe unaffected by discouragements, calumnies, and insults, if she would\r\nonly say, "Ah, that is beautiful!" while drawing her light hand across\r\nhis brow.\r\n\r\nThese images flashed, like beacon-lights, on the horizon of his life.\r\nHis intellect, thereby excited, became more active and more vigorous. He\r\nburied himself in study till the month of August, and was successful at\r\nhis final examination.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers, who had found it so troublesome to coach him once more for\r\nthe second examination at the close of December, and for the third in\r\nFebruary, was astonished at his ardour. Then the great expectations of\r\nformer days returned. In ten years it was probable that Frederick would\r\nbe deputy; in fifteen a minister. Why not? With his patrimony, which\r\nwould soon come into his hands, he might, at first, start a newspaper;\r\nthis would be the opening step in his career; after that they would see\r\nwhat the future would bring. As for himself, he was still ambitious of\r\nobtaining a chair in the Law School; and he sustained his thesis for\r\nthe degree of Doctor in such a remarkable fashion that it won for him\r\nthe compliments of the professors.\r\n\r\nThree days afterwards, Frederick took his own degree. Before leaving for\r\nhis holidays, he conceived the idea of getting up a picnic to bring to a\r\nclose their Saturday reunions.\r\n\r\nHe displayed the utmost gaiety on the occasion. Madame Arnoux was now\r\nwith her mother at Chartres. But he would soon come across her again,\r\nand would end by being her lover.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers, admitted the same day to the young advocates\' pleading\r\nrehearsals at Orsay, had made a speech which was greatly applauded.\r\nAlthough he was sober, he drank a little more wine than was good for\r\nhim, and said to Dussardier at dessert:\r\n\r\n"You are an honest fellow!--and, when I\'m a rich man, I\'ll make you my\r\nmanager."\r\n\r\nAll were in a state of delight. Cisy was not going to finish his\r\nlaw-course. Martinon intended to remain during the period before his\r\nadmission to the Bar in the provinces, where he would be nominated a\r\ndeputy-magistrate. Pellerin was devoting himself to the production of a\r\nlarge picture representing "The Genius of the Revolution." Hussonnet\r\nwas, in the following week, about to read for the Director of Public\r\nAmusements the scheme of a play, and had no doubt as to its success:\r\n\r\n"As for the framework of the drama, they may leave that to me! As for\r\nthe passions, I have knocked about enough to understand them thoroughly;\r\nand as for witticisms, they\'re entirely in my line!"\r\n\r\nHe gave a spring, fell on his two hands, and thus moved for some time\r\naround the table with his legs in the air. This performance, worthy of\r\na street-urchin, did not get rid of S\xe9n\xe9cal\'s frowns. He had just been\r\ndismissed from the boarding-school, in which he had been a teacher, for\r\nhaving given a whipping to an aristocrat\'s son. His straitened\r\ncircumstances had got worse in consequence: he laid the blame of this on\r\nthe inequalities of society, and cursed the wealthy. He poured out his\r\ngrievances into the sympathetic ears of Regimbart, who had become every\r\nday more and more disillusioned, saddened, and disgusted. The Citizen\r\nhad now turned his attention towards questions arising out of the\r\nBudget, and blamed the Court party for the loss of millions in Algeria.\r\n\r\nAs he could not sleep without having paid a visit to the Alexandre\r\nsmoking-divan, he disappeared at eleven o\'clock. The rest went away some\r\ntime afterwards; and Frederick, as he was parting with Hussonnet,\r\nlearned that Madame Arnoux was to have come back the night before.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly went to the coach-office to change his time for starting\r\nto the next day; and, at about six o\'clock in the evening, presented\r\nhimself at her house. Her return, the door keeper said, had been put off\r\nfor a week. Frederick dined alone, and then lounged about the\r\nboulevards.\r\n\r\nRosy clouds, scarf-like in form, stretched beyond the roofs; the\r\nshop-tents were beginning to be taken away; water-carts were letting a\r\nshower of spray fall over the dusty pavement; and an unexpected coolness\r\nwas mingled with emanations from caf\xe9s, as one got a glimpse through\r\ntheir open doors, between some silver plate and gilt ware, of flowers in\r\nsheaves, which were reflected in the large sheets of glass. The crowd\r\nmoved on at a leisurely pace. Groups of men were chatting in the middle\r\nof the footpath; and women passed along with an indolent expression in\r\ntheir eyes and that camelia tint in their complexions which intense heat\r\nimparts to feminine flesh. Something immeasurable in its vastness seemed\r\nto pour itself out and enclose the houses. Never had Paris looked so\r\nbeautiful. He saw nothing before him in the future but an interminable\r\nseries of years all full of love.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in front of the theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin to look at\r\nthe bill; and, for want of something to occupy him, paid for a seat and\r\nwent in.\r\n\r\nAn old-fashioned dramatic version of a fairy-tale was the piece on the\r\nstage. There was a very small audience; and through the skylights of the\r\ntop gallery the vault of heaven seemed cut up into little blue squares,\r\nwhilst the stage lamps above the orchestra formed a single line of\r\nyellow illuminations. The scene represented a slave-market at Pekin,\r\nwith hand-bells, tomtoms, sweeping robes, sharp-pointed caps, and\r\nclownish jokes. Then, as soon as the curtain fell, he wandered into the\r\nfoyer all alone and gazed out with admiration at a large green landau\r\nwhich stood on the boulevard outside, before the front steps of the\r\ntheatre, yoked to two white horses, while a coachman with short breeches\r\nheld the reins.\r\n\r\nHe had just got back to his seat when, in the balcony, a lady and a\r\ngentleman entered the first box in front of the stage. The husband had a\r\npale face with a narrow strip of grey beard round it, the rosette of a\r\nGovernment official, and that frigid look which is supposed to\r\ncharacterise diplomatists.\r\n\r\nHis wife, who was at least twenty years younger, and who was neither\r\ntall nor under-sized, neither ugly nor pretty, wore her fair hair in\r\ncorkscrew curls in the English fashion, and displayed a long-bodiced\r\ndress and a large black lace fan. To make people so fashionable as these\r\ncome to the theatre at such a season one would imagine either that there\r\nwas some accidental cause, or that they had got tired of spending the\r\nevening in one another\'s society. The lady kept nibbling at her fan,\r\nwhile the gentleman yawned. Frederick could not recall to mind where he\r\nhad seen that face.\r\n\r\nIn the next interval between the acts, while passing through one of the\r\nlobbies, he came face to face with both of them. As he bowed in an\r\nundecided manner, M. Dambreuse, at once recognising him, came up and\r\napologised for having treated him with unpardonable neglect. It was an\r\nallusion to the numerous visiting-cards he had sent in accordance with\r\nthe clerk\'s advice. However, he confused the periods, supposing that\r\nFrederick was in the second year of his law-course. Then he said he\r\nenvied the young man for the opportunity of going into the country. He\r\nsadly needed a little rest himself, but business kept him in Paris.\r\n\r\nMadame Dambreuse, leaning on his arm, nodded her head slightly, and the\r\nagreeable sprightliness of her face contrasted with its gloomy\r\nexpression a short time before.\r\n\r\n"One finds charming diversions in it, nevertheless," she said, after her\r\nhusband\'s last remark. "What a stupid play that was--was it not,\r\nMonsieur?" And all three of them remained there chatting about theatres\r\nand new pieces.\r\n\r\nFrederick, accustomed to the grimaces of provincial dames, had not seen\r\nin any woman such ease of manner combined with that simplicity which is\r\nthe essence of refinement, and in which ingenuous souls trace the\r\nexpression of instantaneous sympathy.\r\n\r\nThey would expect to see him as soon as he returned. M. Dambreuse told\r\nhim to give his kind remembrances to P\xe8re Roque.\r\n\r\nFrederick, when he reached his lodgings, did not fail to inform\r\nDeslauriers of their hospitable invitation.\r\n\r\n"Grand!" was the clerk\'s reply; "and don\'t let your mamma get round you!\r\nCome back without delay!"\r\n\r\nOn the day after his arrival, as soon as they had finished breakfast,\r\nMadame Moreau brought her son out into the garden.\r\n\r\nShe said she was happy to see him in a profession, for they were not as\r\nrich as people imagined. The land brought in little; the people who\r\nfarmed it paid badly. She had even been compelled to sell her carriage.\r\nFinally, she placed their situation in its true colours before him.\r\n\r\nDuring the first embarrassments which followed the death of her late\r\nhusband, M. Roque, a man of great cunning, had made her loans of money\r\nwhich had been renewed, and left long unpaid, in spite of her desire to\r\nclear them off. He had suddenly made a demand for immediate payment, and\r\nshe had gone beyond the strict terms of the agreement by giving up to\r\nhim, at a contemptible figure, the farm of Presles. Ten years later, her\r\ncapital disappeared through the failure of a banker at Melun. Through a\r\nhorror which she had of mortgages, and to keep up appearances, which\r\nmight be necessary in view of her son\'s future, she had, when P\xe8re Roque\r\npresented himself again, listened to him once more. But now she was free\r\nfrom debt. In short, there was left them an income of about ten thousand\r\nfrancs, of which two thousand three hundred belonged to him--his entire\r\npatrimony.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t possible!" exclaimed Frederick.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head, as if to declare that it was perfectly possible.\r\n\r\nBut his uncle would leave him something?\r\n\r\nThat was by no means certain!\r\n\r\nAnd they took a turn around the garden without exchanging a word. At\r\nlast she pressed him to her heart, and in a voice choked with rising\r\ntears:\r\n\r\n"Ah! my poor boy! I have had to give up my dreams!"\r\n\r\nHe seated himself on a bench in the shadow of the large acacia.\r\n\r\nHer advice was that he should become a clerk to M. Prouharam, solicitor,\r\nwho would assign over his office to him; if he increased its value, he\r\nmight sell it again and find a good practice.\r\n\r\nFrederick was no longer listening to her. He was gazing automatically\r\nacross the hedge into the other garden opposite.\r\n\r\nA little girl of about twelve with red hair happened to be there all\r\nalone. She had made earrings for herself with the berries of the\r\nservice-tree. Her bodice, made of grey linen-cloth, allowed her\r\nshoulders, slightly gilded by the sun, to be seen. Her short white\r\npetticoat was spotted with the stains made by sweets; and there was, so\r\nto speak, the grace of a young wild animal about her entire person, at\r\nthe same time, nervous and thin. Apparently, the presence of a stranger\r\nastonished her, for she had stopped abruptly with her watering-pot in\r\nher hand darting glances at him with her large bright eyes, which were\r\nof a limpid greenish-blue colour.\r\n\r\n"That is M. Roque\'s daughter," said Madame Moreau. "He has just married\r\nhis servant and legitimised the child that he had by her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBlighted Hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuined, stripped of everything, undermined!\r\n\r\nHe remained seated on the bench, as if stunned by a shock. He cursed\r\nFate; he would have liked to beat somebody; and, to intensify his\r\ndespair, he felt a kind of outrage, a sense of disgrace, weighing down\r\nupon him; for Frederick had been under the impression that the fortune\r\ncoming to him through his father would mount up one day to an income of\r\nfifteen thousand livres, and he had so informed the Arnoux\' in an\r\nindirect sort of way. So then he would be looked upon as a braggart, a\r\nrogue, an obscure blackguard, who had introduced himself to them in the\r\nexpectation of making some profit out of it! And as for her--Madame\r\nArnoux--how could he ever see her again now?\r\n\r\nMoreover, that was completely impossible when he had only a yearly\r\nincome of three thousand francs, He could not always lodge on the fourth\r\nfloor, have the door keeper as a servant, and make his appearance with\r\nwretched black gloves turning blue at the ends, a greasy hat, and the\r\nsame frock-coat for a whole year. No, no! never! And yet without her\r\nexistence was intolerable. Many people were well able to live without\r\nany fortune, Deslauriers amongst the rest; and he thought himself a\r\ncoward to attach so much importance to matters of trifling consequence.\r\nNeed would perhaps multiply his faculties a hundredfold. He excited\r\nhimself by thinking on the great men who had worked in garrets. A soul\r\nlike that of Madame Arnoux ought to be touched at such a spectacle, and\r\nshe would be moved by it to sympathetic tenderness. So, after all, this\r\ncatastrophe was a piece of good fortune; like those earthquakes which\r\nunveil treasures, it had revealed to him the hidden wealth of his\r\nnature. But there was only one place in the world where this could be\r\nturned to account--Paris; for to his mind, art, science, and love (those\r\nthree faces of God, as Pellerin would have said) were associated\r\nexclusively with the capital. That evening, he informed his mother of\r\nhis intention to go back there. Madame Moreau was surprised and\r\nindignant. She regarded it as a foolish and absurd course. It would be\r\nbetter to follow her advice, namely, to remain near her in an office.\r\nFrederick shrugged his shoulders, "Come now"--looking on this proposal\r\nas an insult to himself.\r\n\r\nThereupon, the good lady adopted another plan. In a tender voice broken\r\nby sobs she began to dwell on her solitude, her old age, and the\r\nsacrifices she had made for him. Now that she was more unhappy than\r\never, he was abandoning her. Then, alluding to the anticipated close of\r\nher life:\r\n\r\n"A little patience--good heavens! you will soon be free!"\r\n\r\nThese lamentations were renewed twenty times a day for three months; and\r\nat the same time the luxuries of a home made him effeminate. He found it\r\nenjoyable to have a softer bed and napkins that were not torn, so that,\r\nweary, enervated, overcome by the terrible force of comfort, Frederick\r\nallowed himself to be brought to Ma\xeetre Prouharam\'s office.\r\n\r\nHe displayed there neither knowledge nor aptitude. Up to this time, he\r\nhad been regarded as a young man of great means who ought to be the\r\nshining light of the Department. The public would now come to the\r\nconclusion that he had imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nAt first, he said to himself:\r\n\r\n"It is necessary to inform Madame Arnoux about it;" and for a whole week\r\nhe kept formulating in his own mind dithyrambic letters and short notes\r\nin an eloquent and sublime style. The fear of avowing his actual\r\nposition restrained him. Then he thought that it was far better to write\r\nto the husband. Arnoux knew life and could understand the true state of\r\nthe case. At length, after a fortnight\'s hesitation:\r\n\r\n"Bah! I ought not to see them any more: let them forget me! At any rate,\r\nI shall be cherished in her memory without having sunk in her\r\nestimation! She will believe that I am dead, and will regret\r\nme--perhaps."\r\n\r\nAs extravagant resolutions cost him little, he swore in his own mind\r\nthat he would never return to Paris, and that he would not even make any\r\nenquiries about Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he regretted the very smell of the gas and the noise of\r\nthe omnibuses. He mused on the things that she might have said to him,\r\non the tone of her voice, on the light of her eyes--and, regarding\r\nhimself as a dead man, he no longer did anything at all.\r\n\r\nHe arose very late, and looked through the window at the passing teams\r\nof wagoners. The first six months especially were hateful.\r\n\r\nOn certain days, however, he was possessed by a feeling of indignation\r\neven against her. Then he would go forth and wander through the meadows,\r\nhalf covered in winter time by the inundations of the Seine. They were\r\ncut up by rows of poplar-trees. Here and there arose a little bridge. He\r\ntramped about till evening, rolling the yellow leaves under his feet,\r\ninhaling the fog, and jumping over the ditches. As his arteries began to\r\nthrob more vigorously, he felt himself carried away by a desire to do\r\nsomething wild; he longed to become a trapper in America, to attend on a\r\npasha in the East, to take ship as a sailor; and he gave vent to his\r\nmelancholy in long letters to Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nThe latter was struggling to get on. The slothful conduct of his friend\r\nand his eternal jeremiads appeared to him simply stupid. Their\r\ncorrespondence soon became a mere form. Frederick had given up all his\r\nfurniture to Deslauriers, who stayed on in the same lodgings. From time\r\nto time his mother spoke to him. At length he one day told her about the\r\npresent he had made, and she was giving him a rating for it, when a\r\nletter was placed in his hands.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter now?" she said, "you are trembling?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing the matter with me," replied Frederick.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers informed him that he had taken S\xe9n\xe9cal under his protection,\r\nand that for the past fortnight they had been living together. So now\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal was exhibiting himself in the midst of things that had come\r\nfrom the Arnoux\'s shop. He might sell them, criticise, make jokes about\r\nthem. Frederick felt wounded in the depths of his soul. He went up to\r\nhis own apartment. He felt a yearning for death.\r\n\r\nHis mother called him to consult him about a plantation in the garden.\r\n\r\nThis garden was, after the fashion of an English park, cut in the middle\r\nby a stick fence; and the half of it belonged to P\xe8re Roque, who had\r\nanother for vegetables on the bank of the river. The two neighbours,\r\nhaving fallen out, abstained from making their appearance there at the\r\nsame hour. But since Frederick\'s return, the old gentleman used to walk\r\nabout there more frequently, and was not stinted in his courtesies\r\ntowards Madame Moreau\'s son. He pitied the young man for having to live\r\nin a country town. One day he told him that Madame Dambreuse had been\r\nanxious to hear from him. On another occasion he expatiated on the\r\ncustom of Champagne, where the stomach conferred nobility.\r\n\r\n"At that time you would have been a lord, since your mother\'s name was\r\nDe Fouvens. And \'tis all very well to talk--never mind! there\'s\r\nsomething in a name. After all," he added, with a sly glance at\r\nFrederick, "that depends on the Keeper of the Seals."\r\n\r\nThis pretension to aristocracy contrasted strangely with his personal\r\nappearance. As he was small, his big chestnut-coloured frock-coat\r\nexaggerated the length of his bust. When he took off his hat, a face\r\nalmost like that of a woman with an extremely sharp nose could be seen;\r\nhis hair, which was of a yellow colour, resembled a wig. He saluted\r\npeople with a very low bow, brushing against the wall.\r\n\r\nUp to his fiftieth year, he had been content with the services of\r\nCatherine, a native of Lorraine, of the same age as himself, who was\r\nstrongly marked with small-pox. But in the year 1834, he brought back\r\nwith him from Paris a handsome blonde with a sheep-like type of\r\ncountenance and a "queenly carriage." Ere long, she was observed\r\nstrutting about with large earrings; and everything was explained by the\r\nbirth of a daughter who was introduced to the world under the name of\r\nElisabeth Olympe Louise Roque.\r\n\r\nCatherine, in her first ebullition of jealousy, expected that she would\r\ncurse this child. On the contrary, she became fond of the little girl,\r\nand treated her with the utmost care, consideration, and tenderness, in\r\norder to supplant her mother and render her odious--an easy task,\r\ninasmuch as Madame \xc9l\xe9onore entirely neglected the little one,\r\npreferring to gossip at the tradesmen\'s shops. On the day after her\r\nmarriage, she went to pay a visit at the Sub-prefecture, no longer\r\n"thee\'d" and "thou\'d" the servants, and took it into her head that, as a\r\nmatter of good form, she ought to exhibit a certain severity towards the\r\nchild. She was present while the little one was at her lessons. The\r\nteacher, an old clerk who had been employed at the Mayor\'s office, did\r\nnot know how to go about the work of instructing the girl. The pupil\r\nrebelled, got her ears boxed, and rushed away to shed tears on the lap\r\nof Catherine, who always took her part. After this the two women\r\nwrangled, and M. Roque ordered them to hold their tongues. He had\r\nmarried only out of tender regard for his daughter, and did not wish to\r\nbe annoyed by them.\r\n\r\nShe often wore a white dress with ribbons, and pantalettes trimmed with\r\nlace; and on great festival-days she would leave the house attired like\r\na princess, in order to mortify a little the matrons of the town, who\r\nforbade their brats to associate with her on account of her illegitimate\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nShe passed her life nearly always by herself in the garden, went\r\nsee-sawing on the swing, chased butterflies, then suddenly stopped to\r\nwatch the floral beetles swooping down on the rose-trees. It was, no\r\ndoubt, these habits which imparted to her face an expression at the same\r\ntime of audacity and dreaminess. She had, moreover, a figure like\r\nMarthe, so that Frederick said to her, at their second interview:\r\n\r\n"Will you permit me to kiss you, mademoiselle?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl lifted up her head and replied:\r\n\r\n"I will!"\r\n\r\nBut the stick-hedge separated them from one another.\r\n\r\n"We must climb over," said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"No, lift me up!"\r\n\r\nHe stooped over the hedge, and raising her off the ground with his\r\nhands, kissed her on both cheeks; then he put her back on her own side\r\nby a similar process; and this performance was repeated on the next\r\noccasions when they found themselves together.\r\n\r\nWithout more reserve than a child of four, as soon as she heard her\r\nfriend coming, she sprang forward to meet him, or else, hiding behind a\r\ntree, she began yelping like a dog to frighten him.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Madame Moreau had gone out, he brought her up to his own\r\nroom. She opened all the scent-bottles, and pomaded her hair\r\nplentifully; then, without the slightest embarrassment, she lay down on\r\nthe bed, where she remained stretched out at full length, wide awake.\r\n\r\n"I fancy myself your wife," she said to him.\r\n\r\nNext day he found her all in tears. She confessed that she had been\r\n"weeping for her sins;" and, when he wished to know what they were, she\r\nhung down her head, and answered:\r\n\r\n"Ask me no more!"\r\n\r\nThe time for first communion was at hand. She had been brought to\r\nconfession in the morning. The sacrament scarcely made her wiser.\r\nOccasionally, she got into a real passion; and Frederick was sent for to\r\nappease her.\r\n\r\nHe often brought her with him in his walks. While he indulged in\r\nday-dreams as he walked along, she would gather wild poppies at the\r\nedges of the corn-fields; and, when she saw him more melancholy than\r\nusual, she tried to console him with her pretty childish prattle. His\r\nheart, bereft of love, fell back on this friendship inspired by a little\r\ngirl. He gave her sketches of old fogies, told her stories, and devoted\r\nhimself to reading books for her.\r\n\r\nHe began with the _Annales Romantiques_, a collection of prose and verse\r\ncelebrated at the period. Then, forgetting her age, so much was he\r\ncharmed by her intelligence, he read for her in succession, _Atala_,\r\n_Cinq-Mars_, and _Les Feuilles d\'Automne_. But one night (she had that\r\nvery evening heard _Macbeth_ in Letourneur\'s simple translation) she\r\nwoke up, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"The spot! the spot!" Her teeth chattered, she shivered, and, fixing\r\nterrified glances on her right hand, she kept rubbing it, saying:\r\n\r\n"Always a spot!"\r\n\r\nAt last a doctor was brought, who directed that she should be kept free\r\nfrom violent emotions.\r\n\r\nThe townsfolk saw in this only an unfavourable prognostic for her\r\nmorals. It was said that "young Moreau" wished to make an actress of her\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nSoon another event became the subject of discussion--namely, the arrival\r\nof uncle Barth\xe9lemy. Madame Moreau gave up her sleeping-apartment to\r\nhim, and was so gracious as to serve up meat to him on fast-days.\r\n\r\nThe old man was not very agreeable. He was perpetually making\r\ncomparisons between Havre and Nogent, the air of which he considered\r\nheavy, the bread bad, the streets ill-paved, the food indifferent, and\r\nthe inhabitants very lazy. "How wretched trade is with you in this\r\nplace!" He blamed his deceased brother for his extravagance, pointing\r\nout by way of contrast that he had himself accumulated an income of\r\ntwenty-seven thousand livres a year. At last, he left at the end of the\r\nweek, and on the footboard of the carriage gave utterance to these by no\r\nmeans reassuring words:\r\n\r\n"I am always very glad to know that you are in a good position."\r\n\r\n"You will get nothing," said Madame Moreau as they re-entered the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nHe had come only at her urgent request, and for eight days she had been\r\nseeking, on her part, for an opening--only too clearly perhaps. She\r\nrepented now of having done so, and remained seated in her armchair with\r\nher head bent down and her lips tightly pressed together. Frederick sat\r\nopposite, staring at her; and they were both silent, as they had been\r\nfive years before on his return home by the Montereau steamboat. This\r\ncoincidence, which presented itself even to her mind, recalled Madame\r\nArnoux to his recollection.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the crack of a whip outside the window reached their\r\nears, while a voice was heard calling out to him.\r\n\r\nIt was P\xe8re Roque, who was alone in his tilted cart. He was going to\r\nspend the whole day at La Fortelle with M. Dambreuse, and cordially\r\noffered to drive Frederick there.\r\n\r\n"You have no need of an invitation as long as you are with me. Don\'t be\r\nafraid!"\r\n\r\nFrederick felt inclined to accept this offer. But how would he explain\r\nhis fixed sojourn at Nogent? He had not a proper summer suit. Finally,\r\nwhat would his mother say? He accordingly decided not to go.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, their neighbour exhibited less friendliness. Louise was\r\ngrowing tall; Madame \xc9l\xe9onore fell dangerously ill; and the intimacy\r\nbroke off, to the great delight of Madame Moreau, who feared lest her\r\nson\'s prospects of being settled in life might be affected by\r\nassociation with such people.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of purchasing for him the registrarship of the Court of\r\nJustice. Frederick raised no particular objection to this scheme. He now\r\naccompanied her to mass; in the evening he took a hand in a game of "all\r\nfours." He became accustomed to provincial habits of life, and allowed\r\nhimself to slide into them; and even his love had assumed a character of\r\nmournful sweetness, a kind of soporific charm. By dint of having poured\r\nout his grief in his letters, mixed it up with everything he read, given\r\nfull vent to it during his walks through the country, he had almost\r\nexhausted it, so that Madame Arnoux was for him, as it were, a dead\r\nwoman whose tomb he wondered that he did not know, so tranquil and\r\nresigned had his affection for her now become.\r\n\r\nOne day, the 12th of December, 1845, about nine o\'clock in the morning,\r\nthe cook brought up a letter to his room. The address, which was in big\r\ncharacters, was written in a hand he was not acquainted with; and\r\nFrederick, feeling sleepy, was in no great hurry to break the seal. At\r\nlength, when he did so, he read:\r\n\r\n    "Justice of the Peace at Havre,\r\n     3rd Arrondissement.\r\n\r\n"MONSIEUR,--Monsieur Moreau, your uncle, having died intestate----"\r\n\r\nHe had fallen in for the inheritance! As if a conflagration had burst\r\nout behind the wall, he jumped out of bed in his shirt, with his feet\r\nbare. He passed his hand over his face, doubting the evidence of his own\r\neyes, believing that he was still dreaming, and in order to make his\r\nmind more clearly conscious of the reality of the event, he flung the\r\nwindow wide open.\r\n\r\nThere had been a fall of snow; the roofs were white, and he even\r\nrecognised in the yard outside a washtub which had caused him to stumble\r\nafter dark the evening before.\r\n\r\nHe read the letter over three times in succession. Could there be\r\nanything more certain? His uncle\'s entire fortune! A yearly income of\r\ntwenty-seven thousand livres![5] And he was overwhelmed with frantic joy\r\nat the idea of seeing Madame Arnoux once more. With the vividness of a\r\nhallucination he saw himself beside her, at her house, bringing her some\r\npresent in silver paper, while at the door stood a tilbury--no, a\r\nbrougham rather!--a black brougham, with a servant in brown livery. He\r\ncould hear his horse pawing the ground and the noise of the curb-chain\r\nmingling with the rippling sound of their kisses. And every day this was\r\nrenewed indefinitely. He would receive them in his own house: the\r\ndining-room would be furnished in red leather; the boudoir in yellow\r\nsilk; sofas everywhere! and such a variety of whatnots, china vases, and\r\ncarpets! These images came in so tumultuous a fashion into his mind that\r\nhe felt his head turning round. Then he thought of his mother; and he\r\ndescended the stairs with the letter in his hand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: About \xa31,350.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau made an effort to control her emotion, but could not keep\r\nherself from swooning. Frederick caught her in his arms and kissed her\r\non the forehead.\r\n\r\n"Dear mother, you can now buy back your carriage--laugh then! shed no\r\nmore tears! be happy!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laugh then! shed no more tears! be happy!]\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the news had travelled as far as the faubourgs. Then\r\nM. Benoist, M. Gamblin, M. Chambion, and other friends hurried towards\r\nthe house. Frederick got away for a minute in order to write to\r\nDeslauriers. Then other visitors turned up. The afternoon passed in\r\ncongratulations. They had forgotten all about "Roque\'s wife," who,\r\nhowever, was declared to be "very low."\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone, the same evening, Madame Moreau said to her son\r\nthat she would advise him to set up as an advocate at Troyes. As he was\r\nbetter known in his own part of the country than in any other, he might\r\nmore easily find there a profitable connection.\r\n\r\n"Ah, it is too hard!" exclaimed Frederick. He had scarcely grasped his\r\ngood fortune in his hands when he longed to carry it to Madame Arnoux.\r\nHe announced his express determination to live in Paris.\r\n\r\n"And what are you going to do there?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing!"\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau, astonished at his manner, asked what he intended to\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\n"A minister," was Frederick\'s reply. And he declared that he was not at\r\nall joking, that he meant to plunge at once into diplomacy, and that his\r\nstudies and his instincts impelled him in that direction. He would first\r\nenter the Council of State under M. Dambreuse\'s patronage.\r\n\r\n"So then, you know him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--through M. Roque."\r\n\r\n"That is singular," said Madame Moreau. He had awakened in her heart her\r\nformer dreams of ambition. She internally abandoned herself to them, and\r\nsaid no more about other matters.\r\n\r\nIf he had yielded to his impatience, Frederick would have started that\r\nvery instant. Next morning every seat in the diligence had been engaged;\r\nand so he kept eating out his heart till seven o\'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nThey had sat down to dinner when three prolonged tolls of the\r\nchurch-bell fell on their ears; and the housemaid, coming in, informed\r\nthem that Madame \xc9l\xe9onore had just died.\r\n\r\nThis death, after all, was not a misfortune for anyone, not even for her\r\nchild. The young girl would only find it all the better for herself\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nAs the two houses were close to one another, a great coming and going\r\nand a clatter of tongues could be heard; and the idea of this corpse\r\nbeing so near them threw a certain funereal gloom over their parting.\r\nMadame Moreau wiped her eyes two or three times. Frederick felt his\r\nheart oppressed.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, Catherine stopped him between two doors.\r\nMademoiselle had peremptorily expressed a wish to see him. She was\r\nwaiting for him in the garden. He went out there, strode over the hedge,\r\nand knocking more or less against the trees, directed his steps towards\r\nM. Roque\'s house. Lights were glittering through a window in the second\r\nstory then a form appeared in the midst of the darkness, and a voice\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n"\'Tis I!"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to him taller than usual, owing to her black dress, no doubt.\r\nNot knowing what to say to her, he contented himself with catching her\r\nhands, and sighing forth:\r\n\r\n"Ah! my poor Louise!"\r\n\r\nShe did not reply. She gazed at him for a long time with a look of sad,\r\ndeep earnestness.\r\n\r\nFrederick was afraid of missing the coach; he fancied that he could hear\r\nthe rolling of wheels some distance away, and, in order to put an end to\r\nthe interview without any delay:\r\n\r\n"Catherine told me that you had something----"\r\n\r\n"Yes--\'tis true! I wanted to tell you----"\r\n\r\nHe was astonished to find that she addressed him in the plural; and, as\r\nshe again relapsed into silence:\r\n\r\n"Well, what?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I forget! Is it true that you\'re going away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m starting just now."\r\n\r\nShe repeated: "Ah! just now?--for good?--we\'ll never see one another\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\nShe was choking with sobs.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye! good-bye! embrace me then!"\r\n\r\nAnd she threw her arms about him passionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nA Change of Fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he had taken his place behind the other passengers in the front of\r\nthe diligence, and when the vehicle began to shake as the five horses\r\nstarted into a brisk trot all at the same time, he allowed himself to\r\nplunge into an intoxicating dream of the future. Like an architect\r\ndrawing up the plan of a palace, he mapped out his life beforehand. He\r\nfilled it with dainties and with splendours; it rose up to the sky; a\r\nprofuse display of allurements could be seen there; and so deeply was he\r\nburied in the contemplation of these things that he lost sight of all\r\nexternal objects.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill of Sourdun his attention was directed to the\r\nstage which they had reached in their journey. They had travelled only\r\nabout five kilometres[6] at the most. He was annoyed at this tardy rate\r\nof travelling. He pulled down the coach-window in order to get a view of\r\nthe road. He asked the conductor several times at what hour they would\r\nreach their destination. However, he eventually regained his composure,\r\nand remained seated in his corner of the vehicle with eyes wide open.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: A little over three miles.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nThe lantern, which hung from the postilion\'s seat, threw its light on\r\nthe buttocks of the shaft-horses. In front, only the manes of the other\r\nhorses could be seen undulating like white billows. Their breathing\r\ncaused a kind of fog to gather at each side of the team. The little iron\r\nchains of the harness rang; the windows shook in their sashes; and the\r\nheavy coach went rolling at an even pace over the pavement. Here and\r\nthere could be distinguished the wall of a barn, or else an inn standing\r\nby itself. Sometimes, as they entered a village, a baker\'s oven threw\r\nout gleams of light; and the gigantic silhouettes of the horses kept\r\nrushing past the walls of the opposite houses. At every change of\r\nhorses, when the harness was unfastened, there was a great silence for a\r\nminute. Overhead, under the awning, some passenger might be heard\r\ntapping with his feet, while a woman sitting at the threshold of the\r\ndoor screened her candle with her hand. Then the conductor would jump on\r\nthe footboard, and the vehicle would start on its way again.\r\n\r\nAt Mormans, the striking of the clocks announced that it was a quarter\r\npast one.\r\n\r\n"So then we are in another day," he thought, "we have been in it for\r\nsome time!"\r\n\r\nBut gradually his hopes and his recollections, Nogent, the Rue de\r\nChoiseul, Madame Arnoux, and his mother, all got mixed up together.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by the dull sound of wheels passing over planks: they\r\nwere crossing the Pont de Charenton--it was Paris. Then his two\r\ntravelling companions, the first taking off his cap, and the second his\r\nsilk handkerchief, put on their hats, and began to chat.\r\n\r\nThe first, a big, red-faced man in a velvet frock-coat, was a merchant;\r\nthe second was coming up to the capital to consult a physician; and,\r\nfearing that he had disturbed this gentleman during the night, Frederick\r\nspontaneously apologised to him, so much had the young man\'s heart been\r\nsoftened by the feelings of happiness that possessed it. The wharf of\r\nthe wet dock being flooded, no doubt, they went straight ahead; and once\r\nmore they could see green fields. In the distance, tall factory-chimneys\r\nwere sending forth their smoke. Then they turned into Ivry. Then drove\r\nup a street: all at once, he saw before him the dome of the Panth\xe9on.\r\n\r\nThe plain, quite broken up, seemed a waste of ruins. The enclosing wall\r\nof the fortifications made a horizontal swelling there; and, on the\r\nfootpath, on the ground at the side of the road, little branchless trees\r\nwere protected by laths bristling with nails. Establishments for\r\nchemical products and timber-merchants\' yards made their appearance\r\nalternately. High gates, like those seen in farm-houses, afforded\r\nglimpses, through their opening leaves, of wretched yards within, full\r\nof filth, with puddles of dirty water in the middle of them. Long\r\nwine-shops, of the colour of ox\'s blood, displayed in the first floor,\r\nbetween the windows, two billiard-cues crossing one another, with a\r\nwreath of painted flowers. Here and there might be noticed a half-built\r\nplaster hut, which had been allowed to remain unfinished. Then the\r\ndouble row of houses was no longer interrupted; and over their bare\r\nfronts enormous tin cigars showed themselves at some distance from each\r\nother, indicating tobacconists\' shops. Midwives\' signboards represented\r\nin each case a matron in a cap rocking a doll under a counterpane\r\ntrimmed with lace. The corners of the walls were covered with placards,\r\nwhich, three-quarters torn, were quivering in the wind like rags.\r\nWorkmen in blouses, brewers\' drays, laundresses\' and butchers\' carts\r\npassed along. A thin rain was falling. It was cold. There was a pale\r\nsky; but two eyes, which to him were as precious as the sun, were\r\nshining behind the haze.\r\n\r\nThey had to wait a long time at the barrier, for vendors of poultry,\r\nwagoners, and a flock of sheep caused an obstruction there. The sentry,\r\nwith his great-coat thrown back, walked to and fro in front of his box,\r\nto keep himself warm. The clerk who collected the city-dues clambered up\r\nto the roof of the diligence, and a cornet-\xe0-piston sent forth a\r\nflourish. They went down the boulevard at a quick trot, the\r\nwhipple-trees clapping and the traces hanging loose. The lash of the\r\nwhip went cracking through the moist air. The conductor uttered his\r\nsonorous shout:\r\n\r\n"Look alive! look alive! oho!" and the scavengers drew out of the way,\r\nthe pedestrians sprang back, the mud gushed against the coach-windows;\r\nthey crossed dung-carts, cabs, and omnibuses. At length, the iron gate\r\nof the Jardin des Plantes came into sight.\r\n\r\nThe Seine, which was of a yellowish colour, almost reached the platforms\r\nof the bridges. A cool breath of air issued from it. Frederick inhaled\r\nit with his utmost energy, drinking in this good air of Paris, which\r\nseems to contain the effluvia of love and the emanations of the\r\nintellect. He was touched with emotion at the first glimpse of a\r\nhackney-coach. He gazed with delight on the thresholds of the\r\nwine-merchants\' shops garnished with straw, on the shoe-blacks with\r\ntheir boxes, on the lads who sold groceries as they shook their\r\ncoffee-burners. Women hurried along at a jog-trot with umbrellas over\r\ntheir heads. He bent forward to try whether he could distinguish their\r\nfaces--chance might have led Madame Arnoux to come out.\r\n\r\nThe shops displayed their wares. The crowd grew denser; the noise in the\r\nstreets grew louder. After passing the Quai Saint-Bernard, the Quai de\r\nla Tournelle, and the Quai Montebello, they drove along the Quai\r\nNapol\xe9on. He was anxious to see the windows there; but they were too far\r\naway from him. Then they once more crossed the Seine over the Pont-Neuf,\r\nand descended in the direction of the Louvre; and, having traversed the\r\nRues Saint-Honor\xe9, Croix des Petits-Champs, and Du Bouloi, he reached\r\nthe Rue Coq-H\xe9ron, and entered the courtyard of the hotel.\r\n\r\nTo make his enjoyment last the longer, Frederick dressed himself as\r\nslowly as possible, and even walked as far as the Boulevard Montmartre.\r\nHe smiled at the thought of presently beholding once more the beloved\r\nname on the marble plate. He cast a glance upwards; there was no longer\r\na trace of the display in the windows, the pictures, or anything else.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to the Rue de Choiseul. M. and Madame Arnoux no longer\r\nresided there, and a woman next door was keeping an eye on the porter\'s\r\nlodge. Frederick waited to see the porter himself. After some time he\r\nmade his appearance--it was no longer the same man. He did not know\r\ntheir address.\r\n\r\nFrederick went into a caf\xe9, and, while at breakfast, consulted the\r\nCommercial Directory. There were three hundred Arnoux in it, but no\r\nJacques Arnoux. Where, then, were they living? Pellerin ought to know.\r\n\r\nHe made his way to the very top of the Faubourg Poissonni\xe8re, to the\r\nartist\'s studio. As the door had neither a bell nor a knocker, he rapped\r\nloudly on it with his knuckles, and then called out--shouted. But the\r\nonly response was the echo of his voice from the empty house.\r\n\r\nAfter this he thought of Hussonnet; but where could he discover a man of\r\nthat sort? On one occasion he had waited on Hussonnet when the latter\r\nwas paying a visit to his mistress\'s house in the Rue de Fleurus.\r\nFrederick had just reached the Rue de Fleurus when he became conscious\r\nof the fact that he did not even know the lady\'s name.\r\n\r\nHe had recourse to the Prefecture of Police. He wandered from staircase\r\nto staircase, from office to office. He found that the Intelligence\r\nDepartment was closed for the day, and was told to come back again next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThen he called at all the picture-dealers\' shops that he could discover,\r\nand enquired whether they could give him any information as to Arnoux\'s\r\nwhereabouts. The only answer he got was that M. Arnoux was no longer in\r\nthe trade.\r\n\r\nAt last, discouraged, weary, sickened, he returned to his hotel, and\r\nwent to bed. Just as he was stretching himself between the sheets, an\r\nidea flashed upon him which made him leap up with delight:\r\n\r\n"Regimbart! what an idiot I was not to think of him before!"\r\n\r\nNext morning, at seven o\'clock, he arrived in the Rue N\xf4tre Dame des\r\nVictoires, in front of a dram-shop, where Regimbart was in the habit of\r\ndrinking white wine. It was not yet open. He walked about the\r\nneighbourhood, and at the end of about half-an-hour, presented himself\r\nat the place once more. Regimbart had left it.\r\n\r\nFrederick rushed out into the street. He fancied that he could even\r\nnotice Regimbart\'s hat some distance away. A hearse and some mourning\r\ncoaches intercepted his progress. When they had got out of the way, the\r\nvision had disappeared.\r\n\r\nFortunately, he recalled to mind that the Citizen breakfasted every day\r\nat eleven o\'clock sharp, at a little restaurant in the Place Gaillon.\r\nAll he had to do was to wait patiently till then; and, after sauntering\r\nabout from the Bourse to the Madeleine, and from the Madeleine to the\r\nGymnase, so long that it seemed as if it would never come to an end,\r\nFrederick, just as the clocks were striking eleven, entered the\r\nrestaurant in the Rue Gaillon, certain of finding Regimbart there.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know!" said the restaurant-keeper, in an unceremonious tone.\r\n\r\nFrederick persisted: the man replied:\r\n\r\n"I have no longer any acquaintance with him, Monsieur"--and, as he\r\nspoke, he raised his eyebrows majestically and shook his head in a\r\nmysterious fashion.\r\n\r\nBut, in their last interview, the Citizen had referred to the Alexandre\r\nsmoking-divan. Frederick swallowed a cake, jumped into a cab, and asked\r\nthe driver whether there happened to be anywhere on the heights of\r\nSainte-Genevi\xe8ve a certain Caf\xe9 Alexandre. The cabman drove him to the\r\nRue des Francs Bourgeois Saint-Michel, where there was an establishment\r\nof that name, and in answer to his question:\r\n\r\n"M. Regimbart, if you please?" the keeper of the caf\xe9 said with an\r\nunusually gracious smile:\r\n\r\n"We have not seen him as yet, Monsieur," while he directed towards his\r\nwife, who sat behind the counter, a look of intelligence. And the next\r\nmoment, turning towards the clock:\r\n\r\n"But he\'ll be here, I hope, in ten minutes, or at most a quarter of an\r\nhour. Celestin, hurry with the newspapers! What would Monsieur like to\r\ntake?"\r\n\r\nThough he did not want to take anything, Frederick swallowed a glass of\r\nrum, then a glass of kirsch, then a glass of cura\xe7oa, then several\r\nglasses of grog, both cold and hot. He read through that day\'s _Si\xe8cle_,\r\nand then read it over again; he examined the caricatures in the\r\n_Charivari_ down to the very tissue of the paper. When he had finished,\r\nhe knew the advertisements by heart. From time to time, the tramp of\r\nboots on the footpath outside reached his ears--it was he! and some\r\none\'s form would trace its outlines on the window-panes; but it\r\ninvariably passed on.\r\n\r\nIn order to get rid of the sense of weariness he experienced, Frederick\r\nshifted his seat. He took up his position at the lower end of the room;\r\nthen at the right; after that at the left; and he remained in the middle\r\nof the bench with his arms stretched out. But a cat, daintily pressing\r\ndown the velvet at the back of the seat, startled him by giving a sudden\r\nspring, in order to lick up the spots of syrup on the tray; and the\r\nchild of the house, an insufferable brat of four, played noisily with a\r\nrattle on the bar steps. His mother, a pale-faced little woman, with\r\ndecayed teeth, was smiling in a stupid sort of way. What in the world\r\ncould Regimbart be doing? Frederick waited for him in an exceedingly\r\nmiserable frame of mind.\r\n\r\nThe rain clattered like hail on the covering of the cab. Through the\r\nopening in the muslin curtain he could see the poor horse in the street\r\nmore motionless than a horse made of wood. The stream of water, becoming\r\nenormous, trickled down between two spokes of the wheels, and the\r\ncoachman was nodding drowsily with the horsecloth wrapped round him for\r\nprotection, but fearing lest his fare might give him the slip, he opened\r\nthe door every now and then, with the rain dripping from him as if\r\nfalling from a mountain torrent; and, if things could get worn out by\r\nlooking at them, the clock ought to have by this time been utterly\r\ndissolved, so frequently did Frederick rivet his eyes on it. However, it\r\nkept going. "Mine host" Alexandre walked up and down repeating, "He\'ll\r\ncome! Cheer up! he\'ll come!" and, in order to divert his thoughts,\r\ntalked politics, holding forth at some length. He even carried civility\r\nso far as to propose a game of dominoes.\r\n\r\nAt length when it was half-past four, Frederick, who had been there\r\nsince about twelve, sprang to his feet, and declared that he would not\r\nwait any longer.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand it at all myself," replied the caf\xe9-keeper, in a\r\ntone of straightforwardness. "This is the first time that M. Ledoux has\r\nfailed to come!"\r\n\r\n"What! Monsieur Ledoux?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, Monsieur!"\r\n\r\n"I said Regimbart," exclaimed Frederick, exasperated.\r\n\r\n"Ah! a thousand pardons! You are making a mistake! Madame Alexandre, did\r\nnot Monsieur say M. Ledoux?"\r\n\r\nAnd, questioning the waiter: "You heard him yourself, just as I did?"\r\n\r\nNo doubt, to pay his master off for old scores, the waiter contented\r\nhimself with smiling.\r\n\r\nFrederick drove back to the boulevards, indignant at having his time\r\nwasted, raging against the Citizen, but craving for his presence as if\r\nfor that of a god, and firmly resolved to drag him forth, if necessary,\r\nfrom the depths of the most remote cellars. The vehicle in which he was\r\ndriving only irritated him the more, and he accordingly got rid of it.\r\nHis ideas were in a state of confusion. Then all the names of the caf\xe9s\r\nwhich he had heard pronounced by that idiot burst forth at the same time\r\nfrom his memory like the thousand pieces of an exhibition of\r\nfireworks--the Caf\xe9 Gascard, the Caf\xe9 Grimbert, the Caf\xe9 Halbout, the\r\nBordelais smoking-divan, the Havanais, the Havrais, the Boeuf \xe0 la\r\nMode, the Brasserie Allemande, and the M\xe8re Morel; and he made his way\r\nto all of them in succession. But in one he was told that Regimbart had\r\njust gone out; in another, that he might perhaps call at a later hour;\r\nin a third, that they had not seen him for six months; and, in another\r\nplace, that he had the day before ordered a leg of mutton for Saturday.\r\nFinally, at Vautier\'s dining-rooms, Frederick, on opening the door,\r\nknocked against the waiter.\r\n\r\n"Do you know M. Regimbart?"\r\n\r\n"What, monsieur! do I know him? \'Tis I who have the honour of attending\r\non him. He\'s upstairs--he is just finishing his dinner!"\r\n\r\nAnd, with a napkin under his arm, the master of the establishment\r\nhimself accosted him:\r\n\r\n"You\'re asking him for M. Regimbart, monsieur? He was here a moment\r\nago."\r\n\r\nFrederick gave vent to an oath, but the proprietor of the dining-rooms\r\nstated that he would find the gentleman as a matter of certainty at\r\nBouttevilain\'s.\r\n\r\n"I assure you, on my honour, he left a little earlier than usual, for he\r\nhad a business appointment with some gentlemen. But you\'ll find him, I\r\ntell you again, at Bouttevilain\'s, in the Rue Saint-Martin, No. 92, the\r\nsecond row of steps at the left, at the end of the courtyard--first\r\nfloor--door to the right!"\r\n\r\nAt last, he saw Regimbart, in a cloud of tobacco-smoke, by himself, at\r\nthe lower end of the refreshment-room, near the billiard-table, with a\r\nglass of beer in front of him, and his chin lowered in a thoughtful\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I have been a long time searching for you!"\r\n\r\nWithout rising, Regimbart extended towards him only two fingers, and, as\r\nif he had seen Frederick the day before, he gave utterance to a number\r\nof commonplace remarks about the opening of the session.\r\n\r\nFrederick interrupted him, saying in the most natural tone he could\r\nassume:\r\n\r\n"Is Arnoux going on well?"\r\n\r\nThe reply was a long time coming, as Regimbart was gargling the liquor\r\nin his throat:\r\n\r\n"Yes, not badly."\r\n\r\n"Where is he living now?"\r\n\r\n"Why, in the Rue Paradis Poissonni\xe8re," the Citizen returned with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"What number?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty-seven--confound it! what a funny fellow you are!"\r\n\r\nFrederick rose.\r\n\r\n"What! are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! I have to make a call--some business matter I had forgotten!\r\nGood-bye!"\r\n\r\nFrederick went from the smoking-divan to the Arnoux\'s residence, as if\r\ncarried along by a tepid wind, with a sensation of extreme ease such as\r\npeople experience in dreams.\r\n\r\nHe found himself soon on the second floor in front of a door, at the\r\nringing of whose bell a servant appeared. A second door was flung open.\r\nMadame Arnoux was seated near the fire. Arnoux jumped up, and rushed\r\nacross to embrace Frederick. She had on her lap a little boy not quite\r\nthree years old. Her daughter, now as tall as herself, was standing up\r\nat the opposite side of the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to present this gentleman to you," said Arnoux, taking his son\r\nup in his arms. And he amused himself for some minutes in making the\r\nchild jump up in the air very high, and then catching him with both\r\nhands as he came down.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll kill him!--ah! good heavens, have done!" exclaimed Madame\r\nArnoux.\r\n\r\nBut Arnoux, declaring that there was not the slightest danger, still\r\nkept tossing up the child, and even addressed him in words of endearment\r\nsuch as nurses use in the Marseillaise dialect, his natal tongue: "Ah!\r\nmy fine picheoun! my ducksy of a little nightingale!"\r\n\r\nThen, he asked Frederick why he had been so long without writing to\r\nthem, what he had been doing down in the country, and what brought him\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"As for me, I am at present, my dear friend, a dealer in fa\xefence. But\r\nlet us talk about yourself!"\r\n\r\nFrederick gave as reasons for his absence a protracted lawsuit and the\r\nstate of his mother\'s health.\r\n\r\nHe laid special stress on the latter subject in order to make himself\r\ninteresting. He ended by saying that this time he was going to settle in\r\nParis for good; and he said nothing about the inheritance, lest it might\r\nbe prejudicial to his past.\r\n\r\nThe curtains, like the upholstering of the furniture, were of maroon\r\ndamask wool. Two pillows were close beside one another on the bolster.\r\nOn the coal-fire a kettle was boiling; and the shade of the lamp, which\r\nstood near the edge of the chest of drawers, darkened the apartment.\r\nMadame Arnoux wore a large blue merino dressing-gown. With her face\r\nturned towards the fire and one hand on the shoulder of the little boy,\r\nshe unfastened with the other the child\'s bodice. The youngster in his\r\nshirt began to cry, while scratching his head, like the son of M.\r\nAlexandre.\r\n\r\nFrederick expected that he would have felt spasms of joy; but the\r\npassions grow pale when we find ourselves in an altered situation; and,\r\nas he no longer saw Madame Arnoux in the environment wherein he had\r\nknown her, she seemed to him to have lost some of her fascination; to\r\nhave degenerated in some way that he could not comprehend--in fact, not\r\nto be the same. He was astonished at the serenity of his own heart. He\r\nmade enquiries about some old friends, about Pellerin, amongst others.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see him often," said Arnoux. She added:\r\n\r\n"We no longer entertain as we used to do formerly!"\r\n\r\nWas the object of this to let him know that he would get no invitation\r\nfrom them? But Arnoux, continuing to exhibit the same cordiality,\r\nreproached him for not having come to dine with them uninvited; and he\r\nexplained why he had changed his business.\r\n\r\n"What are you to do in an age of decadence like ours? Great painting is\r\ngone out of fashion! Besides, we may import art into everything. You\r\nknow that, for my part, I am a lover of the beautiful. I must bring you\r\none of these days to see my earthenware works."\r\n\r\nAnd he wanted to show Frederick immediately some of his productions in\r\nthe store which he had between the ground-floor and the first floor.\r\n\r\nDishes, soup-tureens, and washhand-basins encumbered the floor. Against\r\nthe walls were laid out large squares of pavement for bathrooms and\r\ndressing-rooms, with mythological subjects in the Renaissance style;\r\nwhilst in the centre, a pair of whatnots, rising up to the ceiling,\r\nsupported ice-urns, flower-pots, candelabra, little flower-stands, and\r\nlarge statuettes of many colours, representing a negro or a shepherdess\r\nin the Pompadour fashion. Frederick, who was cold and hungry, was bored\r\nwith Arnoux\'s display of his wares. He hurried off to the Caf\xe9 Anglais,\r\nwhere he ordered a sumptuous supper, and while eating, said to himself:\r\n\r\n"I was well off enough below there with all my troubles! She scarcely\r\ntook any notice of me! How like a shopkeeper\'s wife!"\r\n\r\nAnd in an abrupt expansion of healthfulness, he formed egoistic\r\nresolutions. He felt his heart as hard as the table on which his elbows\r\nrested. So then he could by this time plunge fearlessly into the vortex\r\nof society. The thought of the Dambreuses recurred to his mind. He would\r\nmake use of them. Then he recalled Deslauriers to mind. "Ah! faith, so\r\nmuch the worse!" Nevertheless, he sent him a note by a messenger, making\r\nan appointment with him for the following day, in order that they might\r\nbreakfast together.\r\n\r\nFortune had not been so kind to the other.\r\n\r\nHe had presented himself at the examination for a fellowship with a\r\nthesis on the law of wills, in which he maintained that the powers of\r\ntestators ought to be restricted as much as possible; and, as his\r\nadversary provoked him in such a way as to make him say foolish things,\r\nhe gave utterance to many of these absurdities without in any way\r\ninducing the examiners to falter in deciding that he was wrong. Then\r\nchance so willed it that he should choose by lot, as a subject for a\r\nlecture, Prescription. Thereupon, Deslauriers gave vent to some\r\nlamentable theories: the questions in dispute in former times ought to\r\nbe brought forward as well as those which had recently arisen; why\r\nshould the proprietor be deprived of his estate because he could furnish\r\nhis title-deeds only after the lapse of thirty-one years? This was\r\ngiving the security of the honest man to the inheritor of the enriched\r\nthief. Every injustice was consecrated by extending this law, which was\r\na form of tyranny, the abuse of force! He had even exclaimed: "Abolish\r\nit; and the Franks will no longer oppress the Gauls, the English oppress\r\nthe Irish, the Yankee oppress the Redskins, the Turks oppress the Arabs,\r\nthe whites oppress the blacks, Poland----"\r\n\r\nThe President interrupted him: "Well! well! Monsieur, we have nothing to\r\ndo with your political opinions--you will have them represented in your\r\nbehalf by-and-by!"\r\n\r\nDeslauriers did not wish to have his opinions represented; but this\r\nunfortunate Title XX. of the Third Book of the Civil Code had become a\r\nsort of mountain over which he stumbled. He was elaborating a great work\r\non "Prescription considered as the Basis of the Civil Law and of the Law\r\nof Nature amongst Peoples"; and he got lost in Dunod, Rogerius, Balbus,\r\nMerlin, Vazeille, Savigny, Traplong, and other weighty authorities on\r\nthe subject. In order to have more leisure for the purpose of devoting\r\nhimself to this task, he had resigned his post of head-clerk. He lived\r\nby giving private tuitions and preparing theses; and at the meetings of\r\nnewly-fledged barristers to rehearse legal arguments he frightened by\r\nhis display of virulence those who held conservative views, all the\r\nyoung doctrinaires who acknowledged M. Guizot as their master--so that\r\nin a certain set he had gained a sort of celebrity, mingled, in a slight\r\ndegree, with lack of confidence in him as an individual.\r\n\r\nHe came to keep the appointment in a big paletot, lined with red\r\nflannel, like the one S\xe9n\xe9cal used to wear in former days.\r\n\r\nHuman respect on account of the passers-by prevented them from straining\r\none another long in an embrace of friendship; and they made their way to\r\nV\xe9four\'s arm-in-arm, laughing pleasantly, though with tear-drops\r\nlingering in the depths of their eyes. Then, as soon as they were free\r\nfrom observation, Deslauriers exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Ah! damn it! we\'ll have a jolly time of it now!"\r\n\r\nFrederick was not quite pleased to find Deslauriers all at once\r\nassociating himself in this way with his own newly-acquired\r\ninheritance. His friend exhibited too much pleasure on account of them\r\nboth, and not enough on his account alone.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Deslauriers gave details about the reverse he had met with,\r\nand gradually told Frederick all about his occupations and his daily\r\nexistence, speaking of himself in a stoical fashion, and of others in\r\ntones of intense bitterness. He found fault with everything; there was\r\nnot a man in office who was not an idiot or a rascal. He flew into a\r\npassion against the waiter for having a glass badly rinsed, and, when\r\nFrederick uttered a reproach with a view to mitigating his wrath: "As if\r\nI were going to annoy myself with such numbskulls, who, you must know,\r\ncan earn as much as six and even eight thousand francs a year, who are\r\nelectors, perhaps eligible as candidates. Ah! no, no!"\r\n\r\nThen, with a sprightly air, "But I\'ve forgotten that I\'m talking to a\r\ncapitalist, to a Mondor,[7] for you are a Mondor now!"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Mondor was a celebrated Italian charlatan, who,\r\nin the seventeenth century, settled in Paris and made a large\r\nfortune.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nAnd, coming back to the question of the inheritance, he gave expression\r\nto this view--that collateral successorship (a thing unjust in itself,\r\nthough in the present case he was glad it was possible) would be\r\nabolished one of these days at the approaching revolution.\r\n\r\n"Do you believe in that?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Be sure of it!" he replied. "This sort of thing cannot last. There is\r\ntoo much suffering. When I see into the wretchedness of men like\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal----"\r\n\r\n"Always S\xe9n\xe9cal!" thought Frederick.\r\n\r\n"But, at all events, tell me the news? Are you still in love with Madame\r\nArnoux? Is it all over--eh?"\r\n\r\nFrederick, not knowing what answer to give him, closed his eyes and hung\r\ndown his head.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Arnoux, Deslauriers told him that the journal was now the\r\nproperty of Hussonnet, who had transformed it. It was called "_L\'Art_, a\r\nliterary institution--a company with shares of one hundred francs each;\r\ncapital of the firm, forty thousand francs," each shareholder having the\r\nright to put into it his own contributions; for "the company has for its\r\nobject to publish the works of beginners, to spare talent, perchance\r\ngenius, the sad crises which drench," etc.\r\n\r\n"You see the dodge!" There was, however, something to be effected by the\r\nchange--the tone of the journal could be raised; then, without any\r\ndelay, while retaining the same writers, and promising a continuation of\r\nthe feuilleton, to supply the subscribers with a political organ: the\r\namount to be advanced would not be very great.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it? Come! would you like to have a hand in it?"\r\n\r\nFrederick did not reject the proposal; but he pointed out that it was\r\nnecessary for him to attend to the regulation of his affairs.\r\n\r\n"After that, if you require anything----"\r\n\r\n"Thanks, my boy!" said Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nThen, they smoked puros, leaning with their elbows on the shelf covered\r\nwith velvet beside the window. The sun was shining; the air was balmy.\r\nFlocks of birds, fluttering about, swooped down into the garden. The\r\nstatues of bronze and marble, washed by the rain, were glistening.\r\nNursery-maids wearing aprons, were seated on chairs, chatting together;\r\nand the laughter of children could be heard mingling with the continuous\r\nplash that came from the sheaf-jets of the fountain.\r\n\r\nFrederick was troubled by Deslauriers\' irritability; but under the\r\ninfluence of the wine which circulated through his veins, half-asleep,\r\nin a state of torpor, with the sun shining full on his face, he was no\r\nlonger conscious of anything save a profound sense of comfort, a kind of\r\nvoluptuous feeling that stupefied him, as a plant is saturated with heat\r\nand moisture. Deslauriers, with half-closed eyelids, was staring\r\nvacantly into the distance. His breast swelled, and he broke out in the\r\nfollowing strain:\r\n\r\n"Ah! those were better days when Camille Desmoulins, standing below\r\nthere on a table, drove the people on to the Bastille. Men really lived\r\nin those times; they could assert themselves, and prove their strength!\r\nSimple advocates commanded generals. Kings were beaten by beggars;\r\nwhilst now----"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, then added all of a sudden:\r\n\r\n"Pooh! the future is big with great things!"\r\n\r\nAnd, drumming a battle-march on the window-panes, he declaimed some\r\nverses of Barth\xe9lemy, which ran thus:\r\n\r\n    "\'That dread Assembly shall again appear,\r\n    Which, after forty years, fills you with fear,\r\n    Marching with giant stride and dauntless soul\'[8]\r\n\r\n--I don\'t know the rest of it! But \'tis late; suppose we go?"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8:   "Elle repara\xeetra, la terrible Assembl\xe9e,\r\n               Dont, apr\xe8s quarante ans, votre t\xeate est troubl\xe9e,\r\n               Colosse qui sans peur marche d\'un pas puissant."]\r\n\r\nAnd he went on setting forth his theories in the street.\r\n\r\nFrederick, without listening to him, was looking at certain materials\r\nand articles of furniture in the shop-windows which would be suitable\r\nfor his new residence in Paris; and it was, perhaps, the thought of\r\nMadame Arnoux that made him stop before a second-hand dealer\'s window,\r\nwhere three plates made of fine ware were exposed to view. They were\r\ndecorated with yellow arabesques with metallic reflections, and were\r\nworth a hundred crowns apiece. He got them put by.\r\n\r\n"For my part, if I were in your place," said Deslauriers, "I would\r\nrather buy silver plate," revealing by this love of substantial things\r\nthe man of mean extraction.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was alone, Frederick repaired to the establishment of the\r\ncelebrated Pomad\xe8re, where he ordered three pairs of trousers, two\r\ncoats, a pelisse trimmed with fur, and five waistcoats. Then he called\r\nat a bootmaker\'s, a shirtmaker\'s, and a hatter\'s, giving them directions\r\nin each shop to make the greatest possible haste. Three days later, on\r\nthe evening of his return from Havre, he found his complete wardrobe\r\nawaiting him in his Parisian abode; and impatient to make use of it, he\r\nresolved to pay an immediate visit to the Dambreuses. But it was too\r\nearly yet--scarcely eight o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I went to see the others?" said he to himself.\r\n\r\nHe came upon Arnoux, all alone, in the act of shaving in front of his\r\nglass. The latter proposed to drive him to a place where they could\r\namuse themselves, and when M. Dambreuse was referred to, "Ah, that\'s\r\njust lucky! You\'ll see some of his friends there. Come on, then! It will\r\nbe good fun!"\r\n\r\nFrederick asked to be excused. Madame Arnoux recognised his voice, and\r\nwished him good-day, through the partition, for her daughter was\r\nindisposed, and she was also rather unwell herself. The noise of a\r\nsoup-ladle against a glass could be heard from within, and all those\r\nquivering sounds made by things being lightly moved about, which are\r\nusual in a sick-room. Then Arnoux left his dressing-room to say good-bye\r\nto his wife. He brought forward a heap of reasons for going out:\r\n\r\n"You know well that it is a serious matter! I must go there; \'tis a case\r\nof necessity. They\'ll be waiting for me!"\r\n\r\n"Go, go, my dear! Amuse yourself!"\r\n\r\nArnoux hailed a hackney-coach:\r\n\r\n"Palais Royal, No. 7 Montpensier Gallery." And, as he let himself sink\r\nback in the cushions:\r\n\r\n"Ah! how tired I am, my dear fellow! It will be the death of me!\r\nHowever, I can tell it to you--to you!"\r\n\r\nHe bent towards Frederick\'s ear in a mysterious fashion:\r\n\r\n"I am trying to discover again the red of Chinese copper!"\r\n\r\nAnd he explained the nature of the glaze and the little fire.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at Chevet\'s shop, a large hamper was brought to him,\r\nwhich he stowed away in the hackney-coach. Then he bought for his "poor\r\nwife" pine-apples and various dainties, and directed that they should be\r\nsent early next morning.\r\n\r\nAfter this, they called at a costumer\'s establishment; it was to a ball\r\nthey were going.\r\n\r\nArnoux selected blue velvet breeches, a vest of the same material, and a\r\nred wig; Frederick a domino; and they went down the Rue de Laval towards\r\na house the second floor of which was illuminated by coloured lanterns.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairs they heard violins playing above.\r\n\r\n"Where the deuce are you bringing me to?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"To see a nice girl! don\'t be afraid!"\r\n\r\nThe door was opened for them by a groom; and they entered the anteroom,\r\nwhere paletots, mantles, and shawls were thrown together in a heap on\r\nsome chairs. A young woman in the costume of a dragoon of Louis XIV.\'s\r\nreign was passing at that moment. It was Mademoiselle Rosanette Bron,\r\nthe mistress of the place.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis done!" she replied.\r\n\r\n"Ah! thanks, my angel!"\r\n\r\nAnd he wanted to kiss her.\r\n\r\n"Take care, now, you foolish man! You\'ll spoil the paint on my face!"\r\n\r\nArnoux introduced Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Step in there, Monsieur; you are quite welcome!"\r\n\r\nShe drew aside a door-curtain, and cried out with a certain emphasis:\r\n\r\n"Here\'s my lord Arnoux, girl, and a princely friend of his!"\r\n\r\nFrederick was at first dazzled by the lights. He could see nothing save\r\nsome silk and velvet dresses, naked shoulders, a mass of colours swaying\r\nto and fro to the accompaniment of an orchestra hidden behind green\r\nfoliage, between walls hung with yellow silk, with pastel portraits here\r\nand there and crystal chandeliers in the style of Louis XVI.\'s period.\r\nHigh lamps, whose globes of roughened glass resembled snowballs, looked\r\ndown on baskets of flowers placed on brackets in the corners; and at the\r\nopposite side, at the rear of a second room, smaller in size, one could\r\ndistinguish, in a third, a bed with twisted posts, and at its head a\r\nVenetian mirror.\r\n\r\nThe dancing stopped, and there were bursts of applause, a hubbub of\r\ndelight, as Arnoux was seen advancing with his hamper on his head; the\r\neatables contained in it made a lump in the centre.\r\n\r\n"Make way for the lustre!"\r\n\r\nFrederick raised his eyes: it was the lustre of old Saxe that had\r\nadorned the shop attached to the office of _L\'Art Industriel_. The\r\nmemory of former days was brought back to his mind. But a foot-soldier\r\nof the line in undress, with that silly expression of countenance\r\nascribed by tradition to conscripts, planted himself right in front of\r\nhim, spreading out his two arms in order to emphasise his astonishment,\r\nand, in spite of the hideous black moustaches, unusually pointed, which\r\ndisfigured his face, Frederick recognised his old friend Hussonnet. In a\r\nhalf-Alsatian, half-negro kind of gibberish, the Bohemian loaded him\r\nwith congratulations, calling him his colonel. Frederick, put out of\r\ncountenance by the crowd of personages assembled around him, was at a\r\nloss for an answer. At a tap on the desk from a fiddlestick, the\r\npartners in the dance fell into their places.\r\n\r\nThey were about sixty in number, the women being for the most part\r\ndressed either as village-girls or marchionesses, and the men, who were\r\nnearly all of mature age, being got up as wagoners, \'longshoremen, or\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nFrederick having taken up his position close to the wall, stared at\r\nthose who were going through the quadrille in front of him.\r\n\r\nAn old beau, dressed like a Venetian Doge in a long gown or purple silk,\r\nwas dancing with Mademoiselle Rosanette, who wore a green coat, laced\r\nbreeches, and boots of soft leather with gold spurs. The pair in front\r\nof them consisted of an Albanian laden with yataghans and a Swiss girl\r\nwith blue eyes and skin white as milk, who looked as plump as a quail\r\nwith her chemise-sleeves and red corset exposed to view. In order to\r\nturn to account her hair, which fell down to her hips, a tall blonde, a\r\nwalking lady in the opera, had assumed the part of a female savage; and\r\nover her brown swaddling-cloth she displayed nothing save leathern\r\nbreeches, glass bracelets, and a tinsel diadem, from which rose a large\r\nsheaf of peacock\'s feathers. In front of her, a gentleman who had\r\nintended to represent Pritchard,[9] muffled up in a grotesquely big\r\nblack coat, was beating time with his elbows on his snuff-box. A little\r\nWatteau shepherd in blue-and-silver, like moonlight, dashed his crook\r\nagainst the thyrsus of a Bacchante crowned with grapes, who wore a\r\nleopard\'s skin over her left side, and buskins with gold ribbons. On the\r\nother side, a Polish lady, in a spencer of nacarat-coloured velvet, made\r\nher gauze petticoat flutter over her pearl-gray stockings, which rose\r\nabove her fashionable pink boots bordered with white fur. She was\r\nsmiling on a big-paunched man of forty, disguised as a choir-boy, who\r\nwas skipping very high, lifting up his surplice with one hand, and with\r\nthe other his red clerical cap. But the queen, the star, was\r\nMademoiselle Loulou, a celebrated dancer at public halls. As she had now\r\nbecome wealthy, she wore a large lace collar over her vest of smooth\r\nblack velvet; and her wide trousers of poppy-coloured silk, clinging\r\nclosely to her figure, and drawn tight round her waist by a cashmere\r\nscarf, had all over their seams little natural white camellias. Her pale\r\nface, a little puffed, and with the nose somewhat _retrouss\xe9_, looked\r\nall the more pert from the disordered appearance of her wig, over which\r\nshe had with a touch of her hand clapped a man\'s grey felt hat, so that\r\nit covered her right ear; and, with every bounce she made, her pumps,\r\nadorned with diamond buckles, nearly reached the nose of her neighbour,\r\na big medi\xe6val baron, who was quite entangled in his steel armour. There\r\nwas also an angel, with a gold sword in her hand, and two swan\'s wings\r\nover her back, who kept rushing up and down, every minute losing her\r\npartner who appeared as Louis XIV., displaying an utter ignorance of the\r\nfigures and confusing the quadrille.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: This probably refers to the English astronomer of that\r\nname.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nFrederick, as he gazed at these people, experienced a sense of\r\nforlornness, a feeling of uneasiness. He was still thinking of Madame\r\nArnoux and it seemed to him as if he were taking part in some plot that\r\nwas being hatched against her.\r\n\r\nWhen the quadrille was over, Mademoiselle Rosanette accosted him. She\r\nwas slightly out of breath, and her gorget, polished like a mirror,\r\nswelled up softly under her chin.\r\n\r\n"And you, Monsieur," said she, "don\'t you dance?"\r\n\r\nFrederick excused himself; he did not know how to dance.\r\n\r\n"Really! but with me? Are you quite sure?" And, poising herself on one\r\nhip, with her other knee a little drawn back, while she stroked with her\r\nleft hand the mother-of-pearl pommel of her sword, she kept staring at\r\nhim for a minute with a half-beseeching, half-teasing air. At last she\r\nsaid "Good night! then," made a pirouette, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nFrederick, dissatisfied with himself, and not well knowing what to do,\r\nbegan to wander through the ball-room.\r\n\r\nHe entered the boudoir padded with pale blue silk, with bouquets of\r\nflowers from the fields, whilst on the ceiling, in a circle of gilt\r\nwood, Cupids, emerging out of an azure sky, played over the clouds,\r\nresembling down in appearance. This display of luxuries, which would\r\nto-day be only trifles to persons like Rosanette, dazzled him, and he\r\nadmired everything--the artificial convolvuli which adorned the surface\r\nof the mirror, the curtains on the mantelpiece, the Turkish divan, and a\r\nsort of tent in a recess in the wall, with pink silk hangings and a\r\ncovering of white muslin overhead. Furniture made of dark wood with\r\ninlaid work of copper filled the sleeping apartment, where, on a\r\nplatform covered with swan\'s-down, stood the large canopied bedstead\r\ntrimmed with ostrich-feathers. Pins, with heads made of precious stones,\r\nstuck into pincushions, rings trailing over trays, lockets with hoops of\r\ngold, and little silver chests, could be distinguished in the shade\r\nunder the light shed by a Bohemian urn suspended from three chainlets.\r\nThrough a little door, which was slightly ajar, could be seen a\r\nhot-house occupying the entire breadth of a terrace, with an aviary at\r\nthe other end.\r\n\r\nHere were surroundings specially calculated to charm him. In a sudden\r\nrevolt of his youthful blood he swore that he would enjoy such things;\r\nhe grew bold; then, coming back to the place opening into the\r\ndrawing-room, where there was now a larger gathering--it kept moving\r\nabout in a kind of luminous pulverulence--he stood to watch the\r\nquadrilles, blinking his eyes to see better, and inhaling the soft\r\nperfumes of the women, which floated through the atmosphere like an\r\nimmense kiss.\r\n\r\nBut, close to him, on the other side of the door, was\r\nPellerin--Pellerin, in full dress, his left arm over his breast and with\r\nhis hat and a torn white glove in his right.\r\n\r\n"Halloa! \'Tis a long time since we saw you! Where the deuce have you\r\nbeen? Gone to travel in Italy? \'Tis a commonplace country enough--Italy,\r\neh? not so unique as people say it is? No matter! Will you bring me your\r\nsketches one of these days?"\r\n\r\nAnd, without giving him time to answer, the artist began talking about\r\nhimself. He had made considerable progress, having definitely satisfied\r\nhimself as to the stupidity of the line. We ought not to look so much\r\nfor beauty and unity in a work as for character and diversity of\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n"For everything exists in nature; therefore, everything is legitimate;\r\neverything is plastic. It is only a question of catching the note, mind\r\nyou! I have discovered the secret." And giving him a nudge, he repeated\r\nseveral times, "I have discovered the secret, you see! just look at that\r\nlittle woman with the head-dress of a sphinx who is dancing with a\r\nRussian postilion--that\'s neat, dry, fixed, all in flats and in stiff\r\ntones--indigo under the eyes, a patch of vermilion on the cheek, and\r\nbistre on the temples--pif! paf!" And with his thumb he drew, as it\r\nwere, pencil-strokes in the air. "Whilst the big one over there," he\r\nwent on, pointing towards a fishwife in a cherry gown with a gold cross\r\nhanging from her neck, and a lawn fichu fastened round her shoulders,\r\n"is nothing but curves. The nostrils are spread out just like the\r\nborders of her cap; the corners of the mouth are rising up; the chin\r\nsinks: all is fleshy, melting, abundant, tranquil, and sunshiny--a true\r\nRubens! Nevertheless, they are both perfect! Where, then, is the type?"\r\nHe grew warm with the subject. "What is this but a beautiful woman? What\r\nis it but the beautiful? Ah! the beautiful--tell me what that is----"\r\n\r\nFrederick interrupted him to enquire who was the merry-andrew with the\r\nface of a he-goat, who was in the very act of blessing all the dancers\r\nin the middle of a pastourelle.\r\n\r\n"Oh! he\'s not much!--a widower, the father of three boys. He leaves them\r\nwithout breeches, spends his whole day at the club, and lives with the\r\nservant!"\r\n\r\n"And who is that dressed like a bailiff talking in the recess of the\r\nwindow to a Marquise de Pompadour?"\r\n\r\n"The Marquise is Mademoiselle Vandael, formerly an actress at the\r\nGymnase, the mistress of the Doge, the Comte de Palazot. They have now\r\nbeen twenty years living together--nobody can tell why. Had she fine\r\neyes at one time, this woman? As for the citizen by her side, his name\r\nis Captain d\'Herbigny, an old man of the hurdy-gurdy sort that you can\r\nplay on, with nothing in the world except his Cross of the Legion of\r\nHonour and his pension. He passes for the uncle of the grisettes at\r\nfestival times, arranges duels, and dines in the city."\r\n\r\n"A rascal?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"No! an honest man!"\r\n\r\n"Ha!"\r\n\r\nThe artist was going on to mention the names of many others, when,\r\nperceiving a gentleman who, like Moli\xe8re\'s physician, wore a big black\r\nserge gown opening very wide as it descended in order to display all his\r\ntrinkets:\r\n\r\n"The person who presents himself there before you is Dr. Des Rogis, who,\r\nfull of rage at not having made a name for himself, has written a book\r\nof medical pornography, and willingly blacks people\'s boots in society,\r\nwhile he is at the same time discreet. These ladies adore him. He and\r\nhis wife (that lean ch\xe2telaine in the grey dress) trip about together at\r\nevery public place--aye, and at other places too. In spite of domestic\r\nembarrassments, they have a _day_--artistic teas, at which verses are\r\nrecited. Attention!"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the doctor came up to them at that moment; and soon they formed\r\nall three, at the entrance to the drawing-room, a group of talkers,\r\nwhich was presently augmented by Hussonnet, then by the lover of the\r\nfemale savage, a young poet who displayed, under a court cloak of\r\nFrancis I.\'s reign, the most pitiful of anatomies, and finally a\r\nsprightly youth disguised as a Turk of the barrier. But his vest with\r\nits yellow galloon had taken so many voyages on the backs of strolling\r\ndentists, his wide trousers full of creases, were of so faded a red, his\r\nturban, rolled about like an eel in the Tartar fashion, was so poor in\r\nappearance--in short, his entire costume was so wretched and made-up,\r\nthat the women did not attempt to hide their disgust. The doctor\r\nconsoled him by pronouncing eulogies on his mistress, the lady in the\r\ndress of a \'longshorewoman. This Turk was a banker\'s son.\r\n\r\nBetween two quadrilles, Rosanette advanced towards the mantelpiece,\r\nwhere an obese little old man, in a maroon coat with gold buttons, had\r\nseated himself in an armchair. In spite of his withered cheeks, which\r\nfell over his white cravat, his hair, still fair, and curling naturally\r\nlike that of a poodle, gave him a certain frivolity of aspect.\r\n\r\nShe was listening to him with her face bent close to his. Presently, she\r\naccommodated him with a little glass of syrup; and nothing could be more\r\ndainty than her hands under their laced sleeves, which passed over the\r\nfacings of her green coat. When the old man had swallowed it, he kissed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s M. Oudry, a neighbor of Arnoux!"\r\n\r\n"He has lost her!" said Pellerin, smiling.\r\n\r\nA Longjumeau postilion caught her by the waist. A waltz was beginning.\r\nThen all the women, seated round the drawing-room on benches, rose up\r\nquickly at the same time; and their petticoats, their scarfs, and their\r\nhead-dresses went whirling round.\r\n\r\nThey whirled so close to him that Frederick could notice the beads of\r\nperspiration on their foreheads; and this gyral movement, more and more\r\nlively, regular, provocative of dizzy sensations, communicated to his\r\nmind a sort of intoxication, which made other images surge up within it,\r\nwhile every woman passed with the same dazzling effect, and each of them\r\nwith a special kind of exciting influence, according to her style of\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe Polish lady, surrendering herself in a languorous fashion, inspired\r\nhim with a longing to clasp her to his heart while they were both\r\nspinning forward on a sledge along a plain covered with snow. Horizons\r\nof tranquil voluptuousness in a ch\xe2let at the side of a lake opened out\r\nunder the footsteps of the Swiss girl, who waltzed with her bust erect\r\nand her eyelashes drooping. Then, suddenly, the Bacchante, bending back\r\nher head with its dark locks, made him dream of devouring caresses in a\r\nwood of oleanders, in the midst of a storm, to the confused\r\naccompaniment of tabours. The fishwife, who was panting from the\r\nrapidity of the music, which was far too great for her, gave vent to\r\nbursts of laughter; and he would have liked, while drinking with her in\r\nsome tavern in the "Porcherons,"[10] to rumple her fichu with both\r\nhands, as in the good old times. But the \'longshorewoman, whose light\r\ntoes barely skimmed the floor, seemed to conceal under the suppleness of\r\nher limbs and the seriousness of her face all the refinements of modern\r\nlove, which possesses the exactitude of a science and the mobility of a\r\nbird. Rosanette was whirling with arms akimbo; her wig, in an awkward\r\nposition, bobbing over her collar, flung iris-powder around her; and, at\r\nevery turn, she was near catching hold of Frederick with the ends of her\r\ngold spurs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The "Porcherons" was the name given to an old quarter of\r\nParis famous for its taverns, situated between the Rue du Faubourg\r\nMontmartre and the Rue de Saint-Lazare.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nDuring the closing bar of the waltz, Mademoiselle Vatnaz made her\r\nappearance. She had an Algerian handkerchief on her head, a number of\r\npiastres on her forehead, antimony at the edges of her eyes, with a kind\r\nof paletot made of black cashmere falling over a petticoat of sparkling\r\ncolour, with stripes of silver; and in her hand she held a tambourine.\r\n\r\nBehind her back came a tall fellow in the classical costume of Dante,\r\nwho happened to be--she now made no concealment any longer about it--the\r\nex-singer of the Alhambra, and who, though his name was Auguste\r\nDelamare, had first called himself Ant\xe9nor Delamarre, then Delmas, then\r\nBelmar, and at last Delmar, thus modifying and perfecting his name, as\r\nhis celebrity increased, for he had forsaken the public-house concert\r\nfor the theatre, and had even just made his _d\xe9but_ in a noisy fashion\r\nat the Ambigu in _Gaspardo le P\xe9cheur_.\r\n\r\nHussonnet, on seeing him, knitted his brows. Since his play had been\r\nrejected, he hated actors. It was impossible to conceive the vanity of\r\nindividuals of this sort, and above all of this fellow. "What a prig!\r\nJust look at him!"\r\n\r\nAfter a light bow towards Rosanette, Delmar leaned back against the\r\nmantelpiece; and he remained motionless with one hand over his heart,\r\nhis left foot thrust forward, his eyes raised towards heaven, with his\r\nwreath of gilt laurels above his cowl, while he strove to put into the\r\nexpression of his face a considerable amount of poetry in order to\r\nfascinate the ladies. They made, at some distance, a great circle around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut the Vatnaz, having given Rosanette a prolonged embrace, came to beg\r\nof Hussonnet to revise, with a view to the improvement of the style, an\r\neducational work which she intended to publish, under the title of "The\r\nYoung Ladies\' Garland," a collection of literature and moral philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe man of letters promised to assist her in the preparation of the\r\nwork. Then she asked him whether he could not in one of the prints to\r\nwhich he had access give her friend a slight puff, and even assign to\r\nhim, later, some part. Hussonnet had forgotten to take a glass of punch\r\non account of her.\r\n\r\nIt was Arnoux who had brewed the beverage; and, followed by the Comte\'s\r\ngroom carrying an empty tray, he offered it to the ladies with a\r\nself-satisfied air.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to pass in front of M. Oudry, Rosanette stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Well--and this little business?"\r\n\r\nHe coloured slightly; finally, addressing the old man:\r\n\r\n"Our fair friend tells me that you would have the kindness----"\r\n\r\n"What of that, neighbour? I am quite at your service!"\r\n\r\nAnd M. Dambreuse\'s name was pronounced. As they were talking to one\r\nanother in low tones, Frederick could only hear indistinctly; and he\r\nmade his way to the other side of the mantelpiece, where Rosanette and\r\nDelmar were chatting together.\r\n\r\nThe mummer had a vulgar countenance, made, like the scenery of the\r\nstage, to be viewed from a distance--coarse hands, big feet, and a heavy\r\njaw; and he disparaged the most distinguished actors, spoke of poets\r\nwith patronising contempt, made use of the expressions "my organ," "my\r\nphysique," "my powers," enamelling his conversation with words that were\r\nscarcely intelligible even to himself, and for which he had quite an\r\naffection, such as "_morbidezza_," "analogue," and "homogeneity."\r\n\r\nRosanette listened to him with little nods of approbation. One could see\r\nher enthusiasm bursting out under the paint on her cheeks, and a touch\r\nof moisture passed like a veil over her bright eyes of an indefinable\r\ncolour. How could such a man as this fascinate her? Frederick internally\r\nexcited himself to greater contempt for him, in order to banish,\r\nperhaps, the species of envy which he felt with regard to him.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Vatnaz was now with Arnoux, and, while laughing from time\r\nto time very loudly, she cast glances towards Rosanette, of whom M.\r\nOudry did not lose sight.\r\n\r\nThen Arnoux and the Vatnaz disappeared. The old man began talking in a\r\nsubdued voice to Rosanette.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, \'tis settled then! Leave me alone!"\r\n\r\nAnd she asked Frederick to go and give a look into the kitchen to see\r\nwhether Arnoux happened to be there.\r\n\r\nA battalion of glasses half-full covered the floor; and the saucepans,\r\nthe pots, the turbot-kettle, and the frying-stove were all in a state of\r\ncommotion. Arnoux was giving directions to the servants, whom he\r\n"thee\'d" and "thou\'d," beating up the mustard, tasting the sauces, and\r\nlarking with the housemaid.\r\n\r\n"All right," he said; "tell them \'tis ready! I\'m going to have it served\r\nup."\r\n\r\nThe dancing had ceased. The women came and sat down; the men were\r\nwalking about. In the centre of the drawing-room, one of the curtains\r\nstretched over a window was swelling in the wind; and the Sphinx, in\r\nspite of the observations of everyone, exposed her sweating arms to the\r\ncurrent of air.\r\n\r\nWhere could Rosanette be? Frederick went on further to find her, even\r\ninto her boudoir and her bedroom. Some, in order to be alone, or to be\r\nin pairs, had retreated into the corners. Whisperings intermingled with\r\nthe shade. There were little laughs stifled under handkerchiefs, and at\r\nthe sides of women\'s corsages one could catch glimpses of fans quivering\r\nwith slow, gentle movements, like the beating of a wounded bird\'s wings.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the hot-house, he saw under the large leaves of a caladium\r\nnear the jet d\'eau, Delmar lying on his face on the sofa covered with\r\nlinen cloth. Rosanette, seated beside him, had passed her fingers\r\nthrough his hair; and they were gazing into each other\'s faces. At the\r\nsame moment, Arnoux came in at the opposite side--that which was near\r\nthe aviary. Delmar sprang to his feet; then he went out at a rapid pace,\r\nwithout turning round; and even paused close to the door to gather a\r\nhibiscus flower, with which he adorned his button-hole. Rosanette hung\r\ndown her head; Frederick, who caught a sight of her profile, saw that\r\nshe was in tears.\r\n\r\n"I say! What\'s the matter with you?" exclaimed Arnoux.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders without replying.\r\n\r\n"Is it on account of him?" he went on.\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms round his neck, and kissing him on the forehead,\r\nslowly:\r\n\r\n"You know well that I will always love you, my big fellow! Think no more\r\nabout it! Let us go to supper!"\r\n\r\nA copper chandelier with forty wax tapers lighted up the dining-room,\r\nthe walls of which were hidden from view under some fine old earthenware\r\nthat was hung up there; and this crude light, falling perpendicularly,\r\nrendered still whiter, amid the side-dishes and the fruits, a huge\r\nturbot which occupied the centre of the tablecloth, with plates all\r\nround filled with crayfish soup. With a rustle of garments, the women,\r\nhaving arranged their skirts, their sleeves, and their scarfs, took\r\ntheir seats beside one another; the men, standing up, posted themselves\r\nat the corners. Pellerin and M. Oudry were placed near Rosanette. Arnoux\r\nwas facing her. Palazot and his female companion had just gone out.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye to them!" said she. "Now let us begin the attack!"\r\n\r\nAnd the choir-boy, a facetious man with a big sign of the cross, said\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were scandalised, and especially the fishwife, the mother of\r\na young girl of whom she wished to make an honest woman. Neither did\r\nArnoux like "that sort of thing," as he considered that religion ought\r\nto be respected.\r\n\r\nA German clock with a cock attached to it happening to chime out the\r\nhour of two, gave rise to a number of jokes about the cuckoo. All kinds\r\nof talk followed--puns, anecdotes, bragging remarks, bets, lies taken\r\nfor truth, improbable assertions, a tumult of words, which soon became\r\ndispersed in the form of chats between particular individuals. The wines\r\nwent round; the dishes succeeded each other; the doctor carved. An\r\norange or a cork would every now and then be flung from a distance.\r\nPeople would quit their seats to go and talk to some one at another end\r\nof the table. Rosanette turned round towards Delmar, who sat motionless\r\nbehind her; Pellerin kept babbling; M. Oudry smiled. Mademoiselle Vatnaz\r\nate, almost alone, a group of crayfish, and the shells crackled under\r\nher long teeth. The angel, poised on the piano-stool--the only place on\r\nwhich her wings permitted her to sit down--was placidly masticating\r\nwithout ever stopping.\r\n\r\n"What an appetite!" the choir-boy kept repeating in amazement, "what an\r\nappetite!"\r\n\r\nAnd the Sphinx drank brandy, screamed out with her throat full, and\r\nwriggled like a demon. Suddenly her jaws swelled, and no longer being\r\nable to keep down the blood which rushed to her head and nearly choked\r\nher, she pressed her napkin against her lips, and threw herself under\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nFrederick had seen her falling: "\'Tis nothing!" And at his entreaties to\r\nbe allowed to go and look after her, she replied slowly:\r\n\r\n"Pooh! what\'s the good? That\'s just as pleasant as anything else. Life\r\nis not so amusing!"\r\n\r\nThen, he shivered, a feeling of icy sadness taking possession of him, as\r\nif he had caught a glimpse of whole worlds of wretchedness and\r\ndespair--a chafing-dish of charcoal beside a folding-bed, the corpses of\r\nthe Morgue in leathern aprons, with the tap of cold water that flows\r\nover their heads.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hussonnet, squatted at the feet of the female savage, was\r\nhowling in a hoarse voice in imitation of the actor Grassot:\r\n\r\n"Be not cruel, O Celuta! this little family f\xeate is charming! Intoxicate\r\nme with delight, my loves! Let us be gay! let us be gay!"\r\n\r\nAnd he began kissing the women on the shoulders. They quivered under the\r\ntickling of his moustaches. Then he conceived the idea of breaking a\r\nplate against his head by rapping it there with a little energy. Others\r\nfollowed his example. The broken earthenware flew about in bits like\r\nslates in a storm; and the \'longshorewoman exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother yourselves about it; these cost nothing. We get a present\r\nof them from the merchant who makes them!"\r\n\r\nEvery eye was riveted on Arnoux. He replied:\r\n\r\n"Ha! about the invoice--allow me!" desiring, no doubt, to pass for not\r\nbeing, or for no longer being, Rosanette\'s lover.\r\n\r\nBut two angry voices here made themselves heard:\r\n\r\n"Idiot!"\r\n\r\n"Rascal!"\r\n\r\n"I am at your command!"\r\n\r\n"So am I at yours!"\r\n\r\nIt was the medi\xe6val knight and the Russian postilion who were disputing,\r\nthe latter having maintained that armour dispensed with bravery, while\r\nthe other regarded this view as an insult. He desired to fight; all\r\ninterposed to prevent him, and in the midst of the uproar the captain\r\ntried to make himself heard.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, messieurs! One word! I have some experience, messieurs!"\r\n\r\nRosanette, by tapping with her knife on a glass, succeeded eventually in\r\nrestoring silence, and, addressing the knight, who had kept his helmet\r\non, and then the postilion, whose head was covered with a hairy cap:\r\n\r\n"Take off that saucepan of yours! and you, there, your wolf\'s head! Are\r\nyou going to obey me, damn you? Pray show respect to my epaulets! I am\r\nyour commanding officer!"\r\n\r\nThey complied, and everyone present applauded, exclaiming, "Long live\r\nthe Mar\xe9chale! long live the Mar\xe9chale!" Then she took a bottle of\r\nchampagne off the stove, and poured out its contents into the cups which\r\nthey successively stretched forth to her. As the table was very large,\r\nthe guests, especially the women, came over to her side, and stood erect\r\non tiptoe on the slats of the chairs, so as to form, for the space of a\r\nminute, a pyramidal group of head-dresses, naked shoulders, extended\r\narms, and stooping bodies; and over all these objects a spray of wine\r\nplayed for some time, for the merry-andrew and Arnoux, at opposite\r\ncorners of the dining-room, each letting fly the cork of a bottle,\r\nsplashed the faces of those around them.\r\n\r\nThe little birds of the aviary, the door of which had been left open,\r\nbroke into the apartment, quite scared, flying round the chandelier,\r\nknocking against the window-panes and against the furniture, and some of\r\nthem, alighting on the heads of the guests, presented the appearance\r\nthere of large flowers.\r\n\r\nThe musicians had gone. The piano had been drawn out of the anteroom.\r\nThe Vatnaz seated herself before it, and, accompanied by the choir-boy,\r\nwho thumped his tambourine, she made a wild dash into a quadrille,\r\nstriking the keys like a horse pawing the ground, and wriggling her\r\nwaist about, the better to mark the time. The Mar\xe9chale dragged out\r\nFrederick; Hussonnet took the windmill; the \'longshorewoman put out her\r\njoints like a circus-clown; the merry-andrew exhibited the manoeuvres\r\nof an orang-outang; the female savage, with outspread arms, imitated the\r\nswaying motion of a boat. At last, unable to go on any further, they all\r\nstopped; and a window was flung open.\r\n\r\nThe broad daylight penetrated the apartment with the cool breath of\r\nmorning. There was an exclamation of astonishment, and then came\r\nsilence. The yellow flames flickered, making the sockets of the\r\ncandlesticks crack from time to time. The floor was strewn with ribbons,\r\nflowers, and pearls. The pier-tables were sticky with the stains of\r\npunch and syrup. The hangings were soiled, the dresses rumpled and\r\ndusty. The plaits of the women\'s hair hung loose over their shoulders,\r\nand the paint, trickling down with the perspiration, revealed pallid\r\nfaces and red, blinking eyelids.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale, fresh as if she had come out of a bath, had rosy checks\r\nand sparkling eyes. She flung her wig some distance away, and her hair\r\nfell around her like a fleece, allowing none of her uniform to be seen\r\nexcept her breeches, the effect thus produced being at the same time\r\ncomical and pretty.\r\n\r\nThe Sphinx, whose teeth chattered as if she had the ague, wanted a\r\nshawl.\r\n\r\nRosanette rushed up to her own room to look for one, and, as the other\r\ncame after her, she quickly shut the door in her face.\r\n\r\nThe Turk remarked, in a loud tone, that M. Oudry had not been seen going\r\nout. Nobody noticed the maliciousness of this observation, so worn out\r\nwere they all.\r\n\r\nThen, while waiting for vehicles, they managed to get on their\r\nbroad-brimmed hats and cloaks. It struck seven. The angel was still in\r\nthe dining-room, seated at the table with a plate of sardines and fruit\r\nstewed in melted butter in front of her, and close beside her was the\r\nfishwife, smoking cigarettes, while giving her advice as to the right\r\nway to live.\r\n\r\nAt last, the cabs having arrived, the guests took their departure.\r\nHussonnet, who had an engagement as correspondent for the provinces, had\r\nto read through fifty-three newspapers before his breakfast. The female\r\nsavage had a rehearsal at the theatre; Pellerin had to see a model; and\r\nthe choir-boy had three appointments. But the angel, attacked by the\r\npreliminary symptoms of indigestion, was unable to rise. The medi\xe6val\r\nbaron carried her to the cab.\r\n\r\n"Take care of her wings!" cried the \'longshorewoman through the window.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs, Mademoiselle Vatnaz said to Rosanette:\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, darling! That was a very nice evening party of yours."\r\n\r\nThen, bending close to her ear: "Take care of him!"\r\n\r\n"Till better times come," returned the Mar\xe9chale, in drawling tones, as\r\nshe turned her back.\r\n\r\nArnoux and Frederick returned together, just as they had come. The\r\ndealer in fa\xefence looked so gloomy that his companion wished to know if\r\nhe were ill.\r\n\r\n"I? Not at all!"\r\n\r\nHe bit his moustache, knitted his brows; and Frederick asked him, was it\r\nhis business that annoyed him.\r\n\r\n"By no means!"\r\n\r\nThen all of a sudden:\r\n\r\n"You know him--P\xe8re Oudry--don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nAnd, with a spiteful expression on his countenance:\r\n\r\n"He\'s rich, the old scoundrel!"\r\n\r\nAfter this, Arnoux spoke about an important piece of ware-making, which\r\nhad to be finished that day at his works. He wanted to see it; the\r\ntrain was starting in an hour.\r\n\r\n"Meantime, I must go and embrace my wife."\r\n\r\n"Ha! his wife!" thought Frederick. Then he made his way home to go to\r\nbed, with his head aching terribly; and, to appease his thirst, he\r\nswallowed a whole carafe of water.\r\n\r\nAnother thirst had come to him--the thirst for women, for licentious\r\npleasure, and all that Parisian life permitted him to enjoy. He felt\r\nsomewhat stunned, like a man coming out of a ship, and in the visions\r\nthat haunted his first sleep, he saw the shoulders of the fishwife, the\r\nloins of the \'longshorewoman, the calves of the Polish lady, and the\r\nhead-dress of the female savage flying past him and coming back again\r\ncontinually. Then, two large black eyes, which had not been at the ball,\r\nappeared before him; and, light as butterflies, burning as torches, they\r\ncame and went, ascended to the cornice and descended to his very mouth.\r\n\r\nFrederick made desperate efforts to recognise those eyes, without\r\nsucceeding in doing so. But already the dream had taken hold of him. It\r\nseemed to him that he was yoked beside Arnoux to the pole of a\r\nhackney-coach, and that the Mar\xe9chale, astride of him, was\r\ndisembowelling him with her gold spurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFrederick Entertains\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick found a little mansion at the corner of the Rue Rumfort, and\r\nhe bought it along with the brougham, the horse, the furniture, and two\r\nflower-stands which were taken from the Arnoux\'s house to be placed on\r\neach side of his drawing-room door. In the rear of this apartment were a\r\nbedroom and a closet. The idea occurred to his mind to put up\r\nDeslauriers there. But how could he receive her--_her_, his future\r\nmistress? The presence of a friend would be an obstacle. He knocked down\r\nthe partition-wall in order to enlarge the drawing-room, and converted\r\nthe closet into a smoking-room.\r\n\r\nHe bought the works of the poets whom he loved, books of travel,\r\natlases, and dictionaries, for he had innumerable plans of study. He\r\nhurried on the workmen, rushed about to the different shops, and in his\r\nimpatience to enjoy, carried off everything without even holding out for\r\na bargain beforehand.\r\n\r\nFrom the tradesmen\'s bills, Frederick ascertained that he would have to\r\nexpend very soon forty thousand francs, not including the succession\r\nduties, which would exceed thirty-seven thousand. As his fortune was in\r\nlanded property, he wrote to the notary at Havre to sell a portion of it\r\nin order to pay off his debts, and to have some money at his disposal.\r\nThen, anxious to become acquainted at last with that vague entity,\r\nglittering and indefinable, which is known as "society," he sent a note\r\nto the Dambreuses to know whether he might be at liberty to call upon\r\nthem. Madame, in reply, said she would expect a visit from him the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nThis happened to be their reception-day. Carriages were standing in the\r\ncourtyard. Two footmen rushed forward under the marqu\xe9e, and a third at\r\nthe head of the stairs began walking in front of him.\r\n\r\nHe was conducted through an anteroom, a second room, and then a\r\ndrawing-room with high windows and a monumental mantel-shelf supporting\r\na time-piece in the form of a sphere, and two enormous porcelain vases,\r\nin each of which bristled, like a golden bush, a cluster of sconces.\r\nPictures in the manner of Espagnolet hung on the walls. The heavy\r\ntapestry porti\xe8res fell majestically, and the armchairs, the brackets,\r\nthe tables, the entire furniture, which was in the style of the Second\r\nEmpire, had a certain imposing and diplomatic air.\r\n\r\nFrederick smiled with pleasure in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nAt last he reached an oval apartment wainscoted in cypress-wood, stuffed\r\nwith dainty furniture, and letting in the light through a single sheet\r\nof plate-glass, which looked out on a garden. Madame Dambreuse was\r\nseated at the fireside, with a dozen persons gathered round her in a\r\ncircle. With a polite greeting, she made a sign to him to take a seat,\r\nwithout, however, exhibiting any surprise at not having seen him for so\r\nlong a time.\r\n\r\nJust at the moment when he was entering the room, they had been praising\r\nthe eloquence of the Abb\xe9 Coeur. Then they deplored the immorality of\r\nservants, a topic suggested by a theft which a _valet-de-chambre_ had\r\ncommitted, and they began to indulge in tittle-tattle. Old Madame de\r\nSommery had a cold; Mademoiselle de Turvisot had got married; the\r\nMontcharrons would not return before the end of January; neither would\r\nthe Bretancourts, now that people remained in the country till a late\r\nperiod of the year. And the triviality of the conversation was, so to\r\nspeak, intensified by the luxuriousness of the surroundings; but what\r\nthey said was less stupid than their way of talking, which was aimless,\r\ndisconnected, and utterly devoid of animation. And yet there were\r\npresent men versed in life--an ex-minister, the cur\xe9 of a large parish,\r\ntwo or three Government officials of high rank. They adhered to the most\r\nhackneyed commonplaces. Some of them resembled weary dowagers; others\r\nhad the appearance of horse-jockeys; and old men accompanied their\r\nwives, of whom they were old enough to be the grandfathers.\r\n\r\nMadame Dambreuse received all of them graciously. When it was mentioned\r\nthat anyone was ill, she knitted her brows with a painful expression on\r\nher face, and when balls or evening parties were discussed, assumed a\r\njoyous air. She would ere long be compelled to deprive herself of these\r\npleasures, for she was going to take away from a boarding-school a niece\r\nof her husband, an orphan. The guests extolled her devotedness: this was\r\nbehaving like a true mother of a family.\r\n\r\nFrederick gazed at her attentively. The dull skin of her face looked as\r\nif it had been stretched out, and had a bloom in which there was no\r\nbrilliancy; like that of preserved fruit. But her hair, which was in\r\ncorkscrew curls, after the English fashion, was finer than silk; her\r\neyes of a sparkling blue; and all her movements were dainty. Seated at\r\nthe lower end of the apartment, on a small sofa, she kept brushing off\r\nthe red flock from a Japanese screen, no doubt in order to let her hands\r\nbe seen to greater advantage--long narrow hands, a little thin, with\r\nfingers tilting up at the points. She wore a grey moir\xe9 gown with a\r\nhigh-necked body, like a Puritan lady.\r\n\r\nFrederick asked her whether she intended to go to La Fortelle this year.\r\nMadame Dambreuse was unable to say. He was sure, however, of one thing,\r\nthat one would be bored to death in Nogent.\r\n\r\nThen the visitors thronged in more quickly. There was an incessant\r\nrustling of robes on the carpet. Ladies, seated on the edges of chairs,\r\ngave vent to little sneering laughs, articulated two or three words, and\r\nat the end of five minutes left along with their young daughters. It\r\nsoon became impossible to follow the conversation, and Frederick\r\nwithdrew when Madame Dambreuse said to him:\r\n\r\n"Every Wednesday, is it not, Monsieur Moreau?" making up for her\r\nprevious display of indifference by these simple words.\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied. Nevertheless, he took a deep breath when he got out\r\ninto the open air; and, needing a less artificial environment, Frederick\r\nrecalled to mind that he owed the Mar\xe9chale a visit.\r\n\r\nThe door of the anteroom was open. Two Havanese lapdogs rushed forward.\r\nA voice exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Delphine! Delphine! Is that you, Felix?"\r\n\r\nHe stood there without advancing a step. The two little dogs kept\r\nyelping continually. At length Rosanette appeared, wrapped up in a sort\r\nof dressing-gown of white muslin trimmed with lace, and with her\r\nstockingless feet in Turkish slippers.\r\n\r\n"Ah! excuse me, Monsieur! I thought it was the hairdresser. One minute;\r\nI am coming back!"\r\n\r\nAnd he was left alone in the dining-room. The Venetian blinds were\r\nclosed. Frederick, as he cast a glance round, was beginning to recall\r\nthe hubbub of the other night, when he noticed on the table, in the\r\nmiddle of the room, a man\'s hat, an old felt hat, bruised, greasy,\r\ndirty. To whom did this hat belong? Impudently displaying its torn\r\nlining, it seemed to say:\r\n\r\n"I have the laugh, after all! I am the master!"\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale suddenly reappeared on the scene. She took up the hat,\r\nopened the conservatory, flung it in there, shut the door again (other\r\ndoors flew open and closed again at the same moment), and, having\r\nbrought Frederick through the kitchen, she introduced him into her\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\nIt could at once be seen that this was the most frequented room in the\r\nhouse, and, so to speak, its true moral centre. The walls, the\r\narmchairs, and a big divan with a spring were adorned with a chintz\r\npattern on which was traced a great deal of foliage. On a white marble\r\ntable stood two large washhand-basins of fine blue earthenware. Crystal\r\nshelves, forming a whatnot overhead, were laden with phials, brushes,\r\ncombs, sticks of cosmetic, and powder-boxes. The fire was reflected in a\r\nhigh cheval-glass. A sheet was hanging outside a bath, and odours of\r\nalmond-paste and of benzoin were exhaled.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll excuse the disorder. I\'m dining in the city this evening."\r\n\r\nAnd as she turned on her heel, she was near crushing one of the little\r\ndogs. Frederick declared that they were charming. She lifted up the pair\r\nof them, and raising their black snouts up to her face:\r\n\r\n"Come! do a laugh--kiss the gentleman!"\r\n\r\nA man dressed in a dirty overcoat with a fur collar here entered\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n"Felix, my worthy fellow," said she, "you\'ll have that business of yours\r\ndisposed of next Sunday without fail."\r\n\r\nThe man proceeded to dress her hair. Frederick told her he had heard\r\nnews of her friends, Madame de Rochegune, Madame de Saint-Florentin, and\r\nMadame Lombard, every woman being noble, as if it were at the mansion of\r\nthe Dambreuses. Then he talked about the theatres. An extraordinary\r\nperformance was to be given that evening at the Ambigu.\r\n\r\n"Shall you go?"\r\n\r\n"Faith, no! I\'m staying at home."\r\n\r\nDelphine appeared. Her mistress gave her a scolding for having gone out\r\nwithout permission.\r\n\r\nThe other vowed that she was just "returning from market."\r\n\r\n"Well, bring me your book. You have no objection, isn\'t that so?"\r\n\r\nAnd, reading the pass-book in a low tone, Rosanette made remarks on\r\nevery item. The different sums were not added up correctly.\r\n\r\n"Hand me over four sous!"\r\n\r\nDelphine handed the amount over to her, and, when she had sent the maid\r\naway:\r\n\r\n"Ah! Holy Virgin! could I be more unfortunate than I am with these\r\ncreatures?"\r\n\r\nFrederick was shocked at this complaint about servants. It recalled the\r\nothers too vividly to his mind, and established between the two houses a\r\nkind of vexatious equality.\r\n\r\nWhen Delphine came back again, she drew close to the Mar\xe9chale\'s side in\r\norder to whisper something in her ear.\r\n\r\n"Ah, no! I don\'t want her!"\r\n\r\nDelphine presented herself once more.\r\n\r\n"Madame, she insists."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what a plague! Throw her out!"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, an old lady, dressed in black, pushed forward the\r\ndoor. Frederick heard nothing, saw nothing. Rosanette rushed into her\r\napartment to meet her.\r\n\r\nWhen she reappeared her cheeks were flushed, and she sat down in one of\r\nthe armchairs without saying a word. A tear fell down her face; then,\r\nturning towards the young man, softly:\r\n\r\n"What is your Christian name?"\r\n\r\n"Frederick."\r\n\r\n"Ha! Federico! It doesn\'t annoy you when I address you in that way?"\r\n\r\nAnd she gazed at him in a coaxing sort of way that was almost amorous.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden she uttered an exclamation of delight at the sight of\r\nMademoiselle Vatnaz.\r\n\r\nThe lady-artist had no time to lose before presiding at her _table\r\nd\'h\xf4te_ at six o\'clock sharp; and she was panting for breath, being\r\ncompletely exhausted. She first took out of her pocket a gold chain in a\r\npaper, then various objects that she had bought.\r\n\r\n"You should know that there are in the Rue Joubert splendid Su\xe8de gloves\r\nat thirty-six sous. Your dyer wants eight days more. As for the guipure,\r\nI told you that they would dye it again. Bugneaux has got the instalment\r\nyou paid. That\'s all, I think. You owe me a hundred and eighty-five\r\nfrancs."\r\n\r\nRosanette went to a drawer to get ten napoleons. Neither of the pair had\r\nany money. Frederick offered some.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay you back," said the Vatnaz, as she stuffed the fifteen francs\r\ninto her handbag. "But you are a naughty boy! I don\'t love you any\r\nlonger--you didn\'t get me to dance with you even once the other evening!\r\nAh! my dear, I came across a case of stuffed humming-birds which are\r\nperfect loves at a shop in the Quai Voltaire. If I were in your place, I\r\nwould make myself a present of them. Look here! What do you think of\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nAnd she exhibited an old remnant of pink silk which she had purchased at\r\nthe Temple to make a medi\xe6val doublet for Delmar.\r\n\r\n"He came to-day, didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"That\'s singular."\r\n\r\nAnd, after a minute\'s silence:\r\n\r\n"Where are you going this evening?"\r\n\r\n"To Alphonsine\'s," said Rosanette, this being the third version given by\r\nher as to the way in which she was going to pass the evening.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Vatnaz went on: "And what news about the old man of the\r\nmountain?"\r\n\r\nBut, with an abrupt wink, the Mar\xe9chale bade her hold her tongue; and\r\nshe accompanied Frederick out as far as the anteroom to ascertain from\r\nhim whether he would soon see Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Pray ask him to come--not before his wife, mind!"\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs an umbrella was placed against the wall near a\r\npair of goloshes.\r\n\r\n"Vatnaz\'s goloshes," said Rosanette. "What a foot, eh? My little friend\r\nis rather strongly built!"\r\n\r\nAnd, in a melodramatic tone, making the final letter of the word roll:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tru-us-st her!"\r\n\r\nFrederick, emboldened by a confidence of this sort, tried to kiss her on\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do it! It costs nothing!"\r\n\r\nHe felt rather light-hearted as he left her, having no doubt that ere\r\nlong the Mar\xe9chale would be his mistress. This desire awakened another\r\nin him; and, in spite of the species of grudge that he owed her, he felt\r\na longing to see Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\nBesides, he would have to call at her house in order to execute the\r\ncommission with which he had been entrusted by Rosanette.\r\n\r\n"But now," thought he (it had just struck six), "Arnoux is probably at\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nSo he put off his visit till the following day.\r\n\r\nShe was seated in the same attitude as on the former day, and was sewing\r\na little boy\'s shirt.\r\n\r\nThe child, at her feet, was playing with a wooden toy menagerie. Marthe,\r\na short distance away, was writing.\r\n\r\nHe began by complimenting her on her children. She replied without any\r\nexaggeration of maternal silliness.\r\n\r\nThe room had a tranquil aspect. A glow of sunshine stole in through the\r\nwindow-panes, lighting up the angles of the different articles of\r\nfurniture, and, as Madame Arnoux sat close beside the window, a large\r\nray, falling on the curls over the nape of her neck, penetrated with\r\nliquid gold her skin, which assumed the colour of amber.\r\n\r\nThen he said:\r\n\r\n"This young lady here has grown very tall during the past three years!\r\nDo you remember, Mademoiselle, when you slept on my knees in the\r\ncarriage?"\r\n\r\nMarthe did not remember.\r\n\r\n"One evening, returning from Saint-Cloud?"\r\n\r\nThere was a look of peculiar sadness in Madame\r\n\r\nArnoux\'s face. Was it in order to prevent any allusion on his part to\r\nthe memories they possessed in common?\r\n\r\nHer beautiful black eyes, whose sclerotics were glistening, moved gently\r\nunder their somewhat drooping lids, and her pupils revealed in their\r\ndepths an inexpressible kindness of heart. He was seized with a love\r\nstronger than ever, a passion that knew no bounds. It enervated him to\r\ncontemplate the object of his attachment; however, he shook off this\r\nfeeling. How was he to make the most of himself? by what means? And,\r\nhaving turned the matter over thoroughly in his mind, Frederick could\r\nthink of none that seemed more effectual than money.\r\n\r\nHe began talking about the weather, which was less cold than it had been\r\nat Havre.\r\n\r\n"You have been there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; about a family matter--an inheritance."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I am very glad," she said, with an air of such genuine pleasure\r\nthat he felt quite touched, just as if she had rendered him a great\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nShe asked him what he intended to do, as it was necessary for a man to\r\noccupy himself with something.\r\n\r\nHe recalled to mind his false position, and said that he hoped to reach\r\nthe Council of State with the help of M. Dambreuse, the secretary.\r\n\r\n"You are acquainted with him, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Merely by name."\r\n\r\nThen, in a low tone:\r\n\r\n"_He_ brought you to the ball the other night, did he not?"\r\n\r\nFrederick remained silent.\r\n\r\n"That was what I wanted to know; thanks!"\r\n\r\nAfter that she put two or three discreet questions to him about his\r\nfamily and the part of the country in which he lived. It was very kind\r\nof him not to have forgotten them after having lived so long away from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n"But could I do so?" he rejoined. "Have you any doubt about it?"\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux arose: "I believe that you entertain towards us a true and\r\nsolid affection. _Au revoir!_"\r\n\r\nAnd she extended her hand towards him in a sincere and virile fashion.\r\n\r\nWas this not an engagement, a promise? Frederick felt a sense of delight\r\nat merely living; he had to restrain himself to keep from singing. He\r\nwanted to burst out, to do generous deeds, and to give alms. He looked\r\naround him to see if there were anyone near whom he could relieve. No\r\nwretch happened to be passing by; and his desire for self-devotion\r\nevaporated, for he was not a man to go out of his way to find\r\nopportunities for benevolence.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered his friends. The first of whom he thought was\r\nHussonnet, the second, Pellerin. The lowly position of Dussardier\r\nnaturally called for consideration. As for Cisy, he was glad to let that\r\nyoung aristocrat get a slight glimpse as to the extent of his fortune.\r\nHe wrote accordingly to all four to come to a housewarming the following\r\nSunday at eleven o\'clock sharp; and he told Deslauriers to bring\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal.\r\n\r\nThe tutor had been dismissed from the third boarding-school in which he\r\nhad been employed for not having given his consent to the distribution\r\nof prizes--a custom which he looked upon as dangerous to equality. He\r\nwas now with an engine-builder, and for the past six months had been no\r\nlonger living with Deslauriers. There had been nothing painful about\r\ntheir parting.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal had been visited by men in blouses--all patriots, all workmen,\r\nall honest fellows, but at the same time men whose society seemed\r\ndistasteful to the advocate. Besides, he disliked certain ideas of his\r\nfriend, excellent though they might be as weapons of warfare. He held\r\nhis tongue on the subject through motives of ambition, deeming it\r\nprudent to pay deference to him in order to exercise control over him,\r\nfor he looked forward impatiently to a revolutionary movement, in which\r\nhe calculated on making an opening for himself and occupying a prominent\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal\'s convictions were more disinterested. Every evening, when his\r\nwork was finished, he returned to his garret and sought in books for\r\nsomething that might justify his dreams. He had annotated the _Contrat\r\nSocial_; he had crammed himself with the _Revue Ind\xe9pendante_; he was\r\nacquainted with Mably, Morelly, Fourier, Saint-Simon, Comte, Cabet,\r\nLouis Blanc--the heavy cartload of Socialistic writers--those who claim\r\nfor humanity the dead level of barracks, those who would like to amuse\r\nit in a brothel or to bend it over a counter; and from a medley of all\r\nthese things he constructed an ideal of virtuous democracy, with the\r\ndouble aspect of a farm in which the landlord was to receive a share of\r\nthe produce, and a spinning-mill, a sort of American Laced\xe6mon, in which\r\nthe individual would only exist for the benefit of society, which was to\r\nbe more omnipotent, absolute, infallible, and divine than the Grand\r\nLamas and the Nebuchadnezzars. He had no doubt as to the approaching\r\nrealisation of this ideal; and S\xe9n\xe9cal raged against everything that he\r\nconsidered hostile to it with the reasoning of a geometrician and the\r\nzeal of an Inquisitor. Titles of nobility, crosses, plumes, liveries\r\nabove all, and even reputations that were too loud-sounding scandalised\r\nhim, his studies as well as his sufferings intensifying every day his\r\nessential hatred of every kind of distinction and every form of social\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\n"What do I owe to this gentleman that I should be polite to him? If he\r\nwants me, he can come to me."\r\n\r\nDeslauriers, however, forced him to go to Frederick\'s reunion.\r\n\r\nThey found their friend in his bedroom. Spring-roller blinds and double\r\ncurtains, Venetian mirrors--nothing was wanting there. Frederick, in a\r\nvelvet vest, was lying back on an easy-chair, smoking cigarettes of\r\nTurkish tobacco.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal wore the gloomy look of a bigot arriving in the midst of a\r\npleasure-party.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers gave him a single comprehensive glance; then, with a very\r\nlow bow:\r\n\r\n"Monseigneur, allow me to pay my respects to you!"\r\n\r\nDussardier leaped on his neck. "So you are a rich man now. Ah! upon my\r\nsoul, so much the better!"\r\n\r\nCisy made his appearance with crape on his hat. Since the death of his\r\ngrandmother, he was in the enjoyment of a considerable fortune, and was\r\nless bent on amusing himself than on being distinguished from\r\nothers--not being the same as everyone else--in short, on "having the\r\nproper stamp." This was his favourite phrase.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was now midday, and they were all yawning.\r\n\r\nFrederick was waiting for some one.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Arnoux\'s name, Pellerin made a wry face. He looked on\r\nhim as a renegade since he had abandoned the fine arts.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we pass over him--what do you say to that?"\r\n\r\nThey all approved of this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a man-servant in long gaiters; and the\r\ndining-room could be seen with its lofty oak plinths relieved with gold,\r\nand its two sideboards laden with plate.\r\n\r\nThe bottles of wine were heating on the stove; the blades of new knives\r\nwere glittering beside oysters. In the milky tint of the enamelled\r\nglasses there was a kind of alluring sweetness; and the table\r\ndisappeared from view under its load of game, fruit, and meats of the\r\nrarest quality.\r\n\r\nThese attentions were lost on S\xe9n\xe9cal. He began by asking for household\r\nbread (the hardest that could be got), and in connection with this\r\nsubject, spoke of the murders of Buzan\xe7ais and the crisis arising from\r\nlack of the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nNothing of this sort could have happened if agriculture had been better\r\nprotected, if everything had not been given up to competition, to\r\nanarchy, and to the deplorable maxim of "Let things alone! let things go\r\ntheir own way!" It was in this way that the feudalism of money was\r\nestablished--the worst form of feudalism. But let them take care! The\r\npeople in the end will get tired of it, and may make the capitalist pay\r\nfor their sufferings either by bloody proscriptions or by the plunder of\r\ntheir houses.\r\n\r\nFrederick saw, as if by a lightning-flash, a flood of men with bare arms\r\ninvading Madame Dambreuse\'s drawing-room, and smashing the mirrors with\r\nblows of pikes.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal went on to say that the workman, owing to the insufficiency of\r\nwages, was more unfortunate than the helot, the negro, and the pariah,\r\nespecially if he has children.\r\n\r\n"Ought he to get rid of them by asphyxia, as some English doctor, whose\r\nname I don\'t remember--a disciple of Malthus--advises him?"\r\n\r\nAnd, turning towards Cisy: "Are we to be obliged to follow the advice of\r\nthe infamous Malthus?"\r\n\r\nCisy, who was ignorant of the infamy and even of the existence of\r\nMalthus, said by way of reply, that after all, much human misery was\r\nrelieved, and that the higher classes----\r\n\r\n"Ha! the higher classes!" said the Socialist, with a sneer. "In the\r\nfirst place, there are no higher classes. \'Tis the heart alone that\r\nmakes anyone higher than another. We want no alms, understand! but\r\nequality, the fair division of products."\r\n\r\nWhat he required was that the workman might become a capitalist, just as\r\nthe soldier might become a colonel. The trade-wardenships, at least, in\r\nlimiting the number of apprentices, prevented workmen from growing\r\ninconveniently numerous, and the sentiment of fraternity was kept up by\r\nmeans of the f\xeates and the banners.\r\n\r\nHussonnet, as a poet, regretted the banners; so did Pellerin, too--a\r\npredilection which had taken possession of him at the Caf\xe9 Dagneaux,\r\nwhile listening to the Phalansterians talking. He expressed the opinion\r\nthat Fourier was a great man.\r\n\r\n"Come now!" said Deslauriers. "An old fool who sees in the overthrow of\r\ngovernments the effects of Divine vengeance. He is just like my lord\r\nSaint-Simon and his church, with his hatred of the French Revolution--a\r\nset of buffoons who would fain re-establish Catholicism."\r\n\r\nM. de Cisy, no doubt in order to get information or to make a good\r\nimpression, broke in with this remark, which he uttered in a mild tone:\r\n\r\n"These two men of science are not, then, of the same way of thinking as\r\nVoltaire?"\r\n\r\n"That fellow! I make you a present of him!"\r\n\r\n"How is that? Why, I thought----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, he did not love the people!"\r\n\r\nThen the conversation came down to contemporary events: the Spanish\r\nmarriages, the dilapidations of Rochefort, the new chapter-house of\r\nSaint-Denis, which had led to the taxes being doubled. Nevertheless,\r\naccording to S\xe9n\xe9cal, they were not high enough!\r\n\r\n"And why are they paid? My God! to erect the palace for apes at the\r\nMuseum, to make showy staff-officers parade along our squares, or to\r\nmaintain a Gothic etiquette amongst the flunkeys of the Ch\xe2teau!"\r\n\r\n"I have read in the _Mode_," said Cisy, "that at the Tuileries ball on\r\nthe feast of Saint-Ferdinand, everyone was disguised as a miser."\r\n\r\n"How pitiable!" said the Socialist, with a shrug of his shoulders, as if\r\nto indicate his disgust.\r\n\r\n"And the Museum of Versailles!" exclaimed Pellerin. "Let us talk about\r\nit! These idiots have foreshortened a Delacroix and lengthened a Gros!\r\nAt the Louvre they have so well restored, scratched, and made a jumble\r\nof all the canvases, that in ten years probably not one will be left. As\r\nfor the errors in the catalogue, a German has written a whole volume on\r\nthe subject. Upon my word, the foreigners are laughing at us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we are the laughing-stock of Europe," said S\xe9n\xe9cal.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis because Art is conveyed in fee-simple to the Crown."\r\n\r\n"As long as you haven\'t universal suffrage----"\r\n\r\n"Allow me!"--for the artist, having been rejected at every _salon_ for\r\nthe last twenty years, was filled with rage against Power.\r\n\r\n"Ah! let them not bother us! As for me, I ask for nothing. Only the\r\nChambers ought to pass enactments in the interests of Art. A chair of\r\n\xe6sthetics should be established with a professor who, being a practical\r\nman as well as a philosopher, would succeed, I hope, in grouping the\r\nmultitude. You would do well, Hussonnet, to touch on this matter with a\r\nword or two in your newspaper?"\r\n\r\n"Are the newspapers free? are we ourselves free?" said Deslauriers in an\r\nangry tone. "When one reflects that there might be as many as\r\ntwenty-eight different formalities to set up a boat on the river, it\r\nmakes me feel a longing to go and live amongst the cannibals! The\r\nGovernment is eating us up. Everything belongs to it--philosophy, law,\r\nthe arts, the very air of heaven; and France, bereft of all energy, lies\r\nunder the boot of the gendarme and the cassock of the devil-dodger with\r\nthe death-rattle in her throat!"\r\n\r\nThe future Mirabeau thus poured out his bile in abundance. Finally he\r\ntook his glass in his right hand, raised it, and with his other arm\r\nakimbo, and his eyes flashing:\r\n\r\n"I drink to the utter destruction of the existing order of things--that\r\nis to say, of everything included in the words Privilege, Monopoly,\r\nRegulation, Hierarchy, Authority, State!"--and in a louder voice--"which\r\nI would like to smash as I do this!" dashing on the table the beautiful\r\nwine-glass, which broke into a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nThey all applauded, and especially Dussardier.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of injustices made his heart leap up with indignation.\r\nEverything that wore a beard claimed his sympathy. He was one of those\r\npersons who fling themselves under vehicles to relieve the horses who\r\nhave fallen. His erudition was limited to two works, one entitled\r\n_Crimes of Kings_, and the other _Mysteries of the Vatican_. He had\r\nlistened to the advocate with open-mouthed delight. At length, unable to\r\nstand it any longer:\r\n\r\n"For my part, the thing I blame Louis Philippe for is abandoning the\r\nPoles!"\r\n\r\n"One moment!" said Hussonnet. "In the first place, Poland has no\r\nexistence; \'tis an invention of Lafayette! The Poles, as a general rule,\r\nall belong to the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, the real ones having been\r\ndrowned with Poniatowski." In short, "he no longer gave into it;" he had\r\n"got over all that sort of thing; it was just like the sea-serpent, the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes, and that antiquated hum-bug about the\r\nSaint-Bartholomew massacre!"\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal, while he did not defend the Poles, extolled the latest remarks\r\nmade by the men of letters. The Popes had been calumniated, inasmuch as\r\nthey, at any rate, defended the people, and he called the League "the\r\naurora of Democracy, a great movement in the direction of equality as\r\nopposed to the individualism of Protestants."\r\n\r\nFrederick was a little surprised at these views. They probably bored\r\nCisy, for he changed the conversation to the _tableaux vivants_ at the\r\nGymnase, which at that time attracted a great number of people.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal regarded them with disfavour. Such exhibitions corrupted the\r\ndaughters of the proletariat. Then, it was noticeable that they went in\r\nfor a display of shameless luxury. Therefore, he approved of the conduct\r\nof the Bavarian students who insulted Lola Mont\xe8s. In imitation of\r\nRousseau, he showed more esteem for the wife of a coal-porter than for\r\nthe mistress of a king.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t appreciate dainties," retorted Hussonnet in a majestic tone.\r\nAnd he took up the championship of ladies of this class in order to\r\npraise Rosanette. Then, as he happened to make an allusion to the ball\r\nat her house and to Arnoux\'s costume, Pellerin remarked:\r\n\r\n"People maintain that he is becoming shaky?"\r\n\r\nThe picture-dealer had just been engaged in a lawsuit with reference to\r\nhis grounds at Belleville, and he was actually in a kaolin company in\r\nLower Brittany with other rogues of the same sort.\r\n\r\nDussardier knew more about him, for his own master, M. Moussinot, having\r\nmade enquiries about Arnoux from the banker, Oscar Lef\xe9bvre, the latter\r\nhad said in reply that he considered him by no means solvent, as he knew\r\nabout bills of his that had been renewed.\r\n\r\nThe dessert was over; they passed into the drawing-room, which was hung,\r\nlike that of the Mar\xe9chale, in yellow damask in the style of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nPellerin found fault with Frederick for not having chosen in preference\r\nthe Neo-Greek style; S\xe9n\xe9cal rubbed matches against the hangings;\r\nDeslauriers did not make any remark.\r\n\r\nThere was a bookcase set up there, which he called "a little girl\'s\r\nlibrary." The principal contemporary writers were to be found there. It\r\nwas impossible to speak about their works, for Hussonnet immediately\r\nbegan relating anecdotes with reference to their personal\r\ncharacteristics, criticising their faces, their habits, their dress,\r\nglorifying fifth-rate intellects and disparaging those of the first; and\r\nall the while making it clear that he deplored modern decadence.\r\n\r\nHe instanced some village ditty as containing in itself alone more\r\npoetry than all the lyrics of the nineteenth century. He went on to say\r\nthat Balzac was overrated, that Byron was effaced, and that Hugo knew\r\nnothing about the stage.\r\n\r\n"Why, then," said S\xe9n\xe9cal, "have you not got the volumes of the\r\nworking-men poets?"\r\n\r\nAnd M. de Cisy, who devoted his attention to literature, was astonished\r\nat not seeing on Frederick\'s table some of those new physiological\r\nstudies--the physiology of the smoker, of the angler, of the man\r\nemployed at the barrier.\r\n\r\nThey went on irritating him to such an extent that he felt a longing to\r\nshove them out by the shoulders.\r\n\r\n"But they are making me quite stupid!" And then he drew Dussardier\r\naside, and wished to know whether he could do him any service.\r\n\r\nThe honest fellow was moved. He answered that his post of cashier\r\nentirely sufficed for his wants.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Frederick led Deslauriers into his own apartment, and,\r\ntaking out of his escritoire two thousand francs:\r\n\r\n"Look here, old boy, put this money in your pocket. \'Tis the balance of\r\nmy old debts to you."\r\n\r\n"But--what about the journal?" said the advocate. "You are, of course,\r\naware that I spoke about it to Hussonnet."\r\n\r\nAnd, when Frederick replied that he was "a little short of cash just\r\nnow," the other smiled in a sinister fashion.\r\n\r\nAfter the liqueurs they drank beer, and after the beer, grog; and then\r\nthey lighted their pipes once more. At last they left, at five o\'clock\r\nin the evening, and they were walking along at each others\' side without\r\nspeaking, when Dussardier broke the silence by saying that Frederick had\r\nentertained them in excellent style. They all agreed with him on that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThen Hussonnet remarked that his luncheon was too heavy. S\xe9n\xe9cal found\r\nfault with the trivial character of his household arrangements. Cisy\r\ntook the same view. It was absolutely devoid of the "proper stamp."\r\n\r\n"For my part, I think," said Pellerin, "he might have had the grace to\r\ngive me an order for a picture."\r\n\r\nDeslauriers held his tongue, as he had the bank-notes that had been\r\ngiven to him in his breeches\' pocket.\r\n\r\nFrederick was left by himself. He was thinking about his friends, and it\r\nseemed to him as if a huge ditch surrounded with shade separated him\r\nfrom them. He had nevertheless held out his hand to them, and they had\r\nnot responded to the sincerity of his heart.\r\n\r\nHe recalled to mind what Pellerin and Dussardier had said about Arnoux.\r\nUndoubtedly it must be an invention, a calumny? But why? And he had a\r\nvision of Madame Arnoux, ruined, weeping, selling her furniture. This\r\nidea tormented him all night long. Next day he presented himself at her\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAt a loss to find any way of communicating to her what he had heard, he\r\nasked her, as if in casual conversation, whether Arnoux still held\r\npossession of his building grounds at Belleville.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has them still."\r\n\r\n"He is now, I believe, a shareholder in a kaolin company in Brittany."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true."\r\n\r\n"His earthenware-works are going on very well, are they not?"\r\n\r\n"Well--I suppose so----"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he hesitated:\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with you? You frighten me!"\r\n\r\nHe told her the story about the renewals. She hung down her head, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I thought so!"\r\n\r\nIn fact, Arnoux, in order to make a good speculation, had refused to\r\nsell his grounds, had borrowed money extensively on them, and finding no\r\npurchasers, had thought of rehabilitating himself by establishing the\r\nearthenware manufactory. The expense of this had exceeded his\r\ncalculations. She knew nothing more about it. He evaded all her\r\nquestions, and declared repeatedly that it was going on very well.\r\n\r\nFrederick tried to reassure her. These in all probability were mere\r\ntemporary embarrassments. However, if he got any information, he would\r\nimpart it to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, will you not?" said she, clasping her two hands with an air of\r\ncharming supplication.\r\n\r\nSo then, he had it in his power to be useful to her. He was now entering\r\ninto her existence--finding a place in her heart.\r\n\r\nArnoux appeared.\r\n\r\n"Ha! how nice of you to come to take me out to dine!"\r\n\r\nFrederick was silent on hearing these words.\r\n\r\nArnoux spoke about general topics, then informed his wife that he would\r\nbe returning home very late, as he had an appointment with M. Oudry.\r\n\r\n"At his house?"\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly, at his house."\r\n\r\nAs they went down the stairs, he confessed that, as the Mar\xe9chale had no\r\nengagement at home, they were going on a secret pleasure-party to the\r\nMoulin Rouge; and, as he always needed somebody to be the recipient of\r\nhis outpourings, he got Frederick to drive him to the door.\r\n\r\nIn place of entering, he walked about on the footpath, looking up at the\r\nwindows on the second floor. Suddenly the curtains parted.\r\n\r\n"Ha! bravo! P\xe8re Oudry is no longer there! Good evening!"\r\n\r\nFrederick did not know what to think now.\r\n\r\nFrom this day forth, Arnoux was still more cordial than before; he\r\ninvited the young man to dine with his mistress; and ere long Frederick\r\nfrequented both houses at the same time.\r\n\r\nRosanette\'s abode furnished him with amusement. He used to call there of\r\nan evening on his way back from the club or the play. He would take a\r\ncup of tea there, or play a game of loto. On Sundays they played\r\ncharades; Rosanette, more noisy than the rest, made herself conspicuous\r\nby funny tricks, such as running on all-fours or muffling her head in a\r\ncotton cap. In order to watch the passers-by through the window, she had\r\na hat of waxed leather; she smoked chibouks; she sang Tyrolese airs. In\r\nthe afternoon, to kill time, she cut out flowers in a piece of chintz\r\nand pasted them against the window-panes, smeared her two little dogs\r\nwith varnish, burned pastilles, or drew cards to tell her fortune.\r\nIncapable of resisting a desire, she became infatuated about some\r\ntrinket which she happened to see, and could not sleep till she had gone\r\nand bought it, then bartered it for another, sold costly dresses for\r\nlittle or nothing, lost her jewellery, squandered money, and would have\r\nsold her chemise for a stage-box at the theatre. Often she asked\r\nFrederick to explain to her some word she came across when reading a\r\nbook, but did not pay any attention to his answer, for she jumped\r\nquickly to another idea, while heaping questions on top of each other.\r\nAfter spasms of gaiety came childish outbursts of rage, or else she sat\r\non the ground dreaming before the fire with her head down and her hands\r\nclasping her knees, more inert than a torpid adder. Without minding it,\r\nshe made her toilet in his presence, drew on her silk stockings, then\r\nwashed her face with great splashes of water, throwing back her figure\r\nas if she were a shivering naiad; and her laughing white teeth, her\r\nsparkling eyes, her beauty, her gaiety, dazzled Frederick, and made his\r\nnerves tingle under the lash of desire.\r\n\r\nNearly always he found Madame Arnoux teaching her little boy how to\r\nread, or standing behind Marthe\'s chair while she played her scales on\r\nthe piano. When she was doing a piece of sewing, it was a great source\r\nof delight to him to pick up her scissors now and then. In all her\r\nmovements there was a tranquil majesty. Her little hands seemed made to\r\nscatter alms and to wipe away tears, and her voice, naturally rather\r\nhollow, had caressing intonations and a sort of breezy lightness.\r\n\r\nShe did not display much enthusiasm about literature; but her\r\nintelligence exercised a charm by the use of a few simple and\r\npenetrating words. She loved travelling, the sound of the wind in the\r\nwoods, and a walk with uncovered head under the rain.\r\n\r\nFrederick listened to these confidences with rapture, fancying that he\r\nsaw in them the beginning of a certain self-abandonment on her part.\r\n\r\nHis association with these two women made, as it were, two different\r\nstrains of music in his life, the one playful, passionate, diverting,\r\nthe other grave and almost religious, and vibrating both at the same\r\ntime, they always increased in volume and gradually blended with one\r\nanother; for if Madame Arnoux happened merely to touch him with her\r\nfinger, the image of the other immediately presented itself to him as an\r\nobject of desire, because from that quarter a better opportunity was\r\nthrown in his way, and, when his heart happened to be touched while in\r\nRosanette\'s company, he was immediately reminded of the woman for whom\r\nhe felt such a consuming passion.\r\n\r\nThis confusion was, in some measure, due to a similarity which existed\r\nbetween the interiors of the two houses. One of the trunks which was\r\nformerly to be seen in the Boulevard Montmartre now adorned Rosanette\'s\r\ndining-room. The same courses were served up for dinner in both places,\r\nand even the same velvet cap was to be found trailing over the\r\neasy-chairs; then, a heap of little presents--screens, boxes, fans--went\r\nto the mistress\'s house from the wife\'s and returned again, for Arnoux,\r\nwithout the slightest embarrassment, often took back from the one what\r\nhe had given to her in order to make a present of it to the other.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale laughed with Frederick at the utter disregard for\r\npropriety which his habits exhibited. One Sunday, after dinner, she led\r\nhim behind the door, and showed him in the pocket of Arnoux\'s overcoat a\r\nbag of cakes which he had just pilfered from the table, in order, no\r\ndoubt, to regale his little family with it at home. M. Arnoux gave\r\nhimself up to some rogueries which bordered on vileness. It seemed to\r\nhim a duty to practise fraud with regard to the city dues; he never paid\r\nwhen he went to the theatre, or if he took a ticket for the second seats\r\nalways tried to make his way into the first; and he used to relate as\r\nan excellent joke that it was a custom of his at the cold baths to put\r\ninto the waiters\' collection-box a breeches\' button instead of a\r\nten-sous piece--and this did not prevent the Mar\xe9chale from loving him.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, she said, while talking about him:\r\n\r\n"Ah! he\'s making himself a nuisance to me, at last! I\'ve had enough of\r\nhim! Faith, so much the better--I\'ll find another instead!"\r\n\r\nFrederick believed that the other had already been found, and that his\r\nname was M. Oudry.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Rosanette, "what does that signify?"\r\n\r\nThen, in a voice choked with rising tears:\r\n\r\n"I ask very little from him, however, and he won\'t give me that."\r\n\r\nHe had even promised a fourth of his profits in the famous kaolin mines.\r\nNo profit made its appearance any more than the cashmere with which he\r\nhad been luring her on for the last six months.\r\n\r\nFrederick immediately thought of making her a present. Arnoux might\r\nregard it as a lesson for himself, and be annoyed at it.\r\n\r\nFor all that, he was good-natured, his wife herself said so, but so\r\nfoolish! Instead of bringing people to dine every day at his house, he\r\nnow entertained his acquaintances at a restaurant. He bought things that\r\nwere utterly useless, such as gold chains, timepieces, and household\r\narticles. Madame Arnoux even pointed out to Frederick in the lobby an\r\nenormous supply of tea-kettles, foot-warmers, and samovars. Finally, she\r\none day confessed that a certain matter caused her much anxiety. Arnoux\r\nhad made her sign a promissory note payable to M. Dambreuse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Frederick still cherished his literary projects as if it were\r\na point of honour with himself to do so. He wished to write a history of\r\n\xe6sthetics, a result of his conversations with Pellerin; next, to write\r\ndramas dealing with different epochs of the French Revolution, and to\r\ncompose a great comedy, an idea traceable to the indirect influence of\r\nDeslauriers and Hussonnet. In the midst of his work her face or that of\r\nthe other passed before his mental vision. He struggled against the\r\nlonging to see her, but was not long ere he yielded to it; and he felt\r\nsadder as he came back from Madame Arnoux\'s house.\r\n\r\nOne morning, while he was brooding over his melancholy thoughts by the\r\nfireside, Deslauriers came in. The incendiary speeches of S\xe9n\xe9cal had\r\nfilled his master with uneasiness, and once more he found himself\r\nwithout resources.\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to do?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Nothing! I know you have no money. But it will not be much trouble for\r\nyou to get him a post either through M. Dambreuse or else through\r\nArnoux. The latter ought to have need of engineers in his\r\nestablishment."\r\n\r\nFrederick had an inspiration. S\xe9n\xe9cal would be able to let him know when\r\nthe husband was away, carry letters for him and assist him on a thousand\r\noccasions when opportunities presented themselves. Services of this sort\r\nare always rendered between man and man. Besides, he would find means of\r\nemploying him without arousing any suspicion on his part. Chance offered\r\nhim an auxiliary; it was a circumstance that omened well for the future,\r\nand he hastened to take advantage of it; and, with an affectation of\r\nindifference, he replied that the thing was feasible perhaps, and that\r\nhe would devote attention to it.\r\n\r\nAnd he did so at once. Arnoux took a great deal of pains with his\r\nearthenware works. He was endeavouring to discover the copper-red of the\r\nChinese, but his colours evaporated in the process of baking. In order\r\nto avoid cracks in his ware, he mixed lime with his potter\'s clay; but\r\nthe articles got broken for the most part; the enamel of his paintings\r\non the raw material boiled away; his large plates became bulged; and,\r\nattributing these mischances to the inferior plant of his manufactory,\r\nhe was anxious to start other grinding-mills and other drying-rooms.\r\nFrederick recalled some of these things to mind, and, when he met\r\nArnoux, said that he had discovered a very able man, who would be\r\ncapable of finding his famous red. Arnoux gave a jump; then, having\r\nlistened to what the young man had to tell him, replied that he wanted\r\nassistance from nobody.\r\n\r\nFrederick spoke in a very laudatory style about S\xe9n\xe9cal\'s prodigious\r\nattainments, pointing out that he was at the same time an engineer, a\r\nchemist, and an accountant, being a mathematician of the first rank.\r\n\r\nThe earthenware-dealer consented to see him.\r\n\r\nBut they squabbled over the emoluments. Frederick interposed, and, at\r\nthe end of a week, succeeded in getting them to come to an agreement.\r\n\r\nBut as the works were situated at Creil, S\xe9n\xe9cal could not assist him in\r\nany way. This thought alone was enough to make his courage flag, as if\r\nhe had met with some misfortune. His notion was that the more Arnoux\r\nwould be kept apart from his wife the better would be his own chance\r\nwith her. Then he proceeded to make repeated apologies for Rosanette.\r\nHe referred to all the wrongs she had sustained at the other\'s hands,\r\nreferred to the vague threats which she had uttered a few days before,\r\nand even spoke about the cashmere without concealing the fact that she\r\nhad accused Arnoux of avarice.\r\n\r\nArnoux, nettled at the word (and, furthermore, feeling some uneasiness),\r\nbrought Rosanette the cashmere, but scolded her for having made any\r\ncomplaint to Frederick. When she told him that she had reminded him a\r\nhundred times of his promise, he pretended that, owing to pressure of\r\nbusiness, he had forgotten all about it.\r\n\r\nThe next day Frederick presented himself at her abode, and found the\r\nMar\xe9chale still in bed, though it was two o\'clock, with Delmar beside\r\nher finishing a _p\xe2t\xe9 de foie gras_ at a little round table. Before he\r\nhad advanced many paces, she broke out into a cry of delight, saying: "I\r\nhave him! I have him!" Then she seized him by the ears, kissed him on\r\nthe forehead, thanked him effusively, "thee\'d" and "thou\'d" him, and\r\neven wanted to make him sit down on the bed. Her fine eyes, full of\r\ntender emotion, were sparkling with pleasure. There was a smile on her\r\nhumid mouth. Her two round arms emerged through the sleeveless opening\r\nof her night-dress, and, from time to time, he could feel through the\r\ncambric the well-rounded outlines of her form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Then she seized him by the ears and kissed him.]\r\n\r\nAll this time Delmar kept rolling his eyeballs about.\r\n\r\n"But really, my dear, my own pet..."\r\n\r\nIt was the same way on the occasion when he saw her next. As soon as\r\nFrederick entered, she sat up on a cushion in order to embrace him with\r\nmore ease, called him a darling, a "dearie," put a flower in his\r\nbutton-hole, and settled his cravat. These delicate attentions were\r\nredoubled when Delmar happened to be there. Were they advances on her\r\npart? So it seemed to Frederick.\r\n\r\nAs for deceiving a friend, Arnoux, in his place, would not have had many\r\nscruples on that score, and he had every right not to adhere to rigidly\r\nvirtuous principles with regard to this man\'s mistress, seeing that his\r\nrelations with the wife had been strictly honourable, for so he\r\nthought--or rather he would have liked Arnoux to think so, in any event,\r\nas a sort of justification of his own prodigious cowardice. Nevertheless\r\nhe felt somewhat bewildered; and presently he made up his mind to lay\r\nsiege boldly to the Mar\xe9chale.\r\n\r\nSo, one afternoon, just as she was stooping down in front of her chest\r\nof drawers, he came across to her, and repeated his overtures without a\r\npause.\r\n\r\nThereupon, she began to cry, saying that she was very unfortunate, but\r\nthat people should not despise her on that account.\r\n\r\nHe only made fresh advances. She now adopted a different plan, namely,\r\nto laugh at his attempts without stopping. He thought it a clever thing\r\nto answer her sarcasms with repartees in the same strain, in which there\r\nwas even a touch of exaggeration. But he made too great a display of\r\ngaiety to convince her that he was in earnest; and their comradeship was\r\nan impediment to any outpouring of serious feeling. At last, when she\r\nsaid one day, in reply to his amorous whispers, that she would not take\r\nanother woman\'s leavings, he answered.\r\n\r\n"What other woman?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes, go and meet Madame Arnoux again!"\r\n\r\nFor Frederick used to talk about her often. Arnoux, on his side, had the\r\nsame mania. At last she lost patience at always hearing this woman\'s\r\npraises sung, and her insinuation was a kind of revenge.\r\n\r\nFrederick resented it. However, Rosanette was beginning to excite his\r\nlove to an unusual degree. Sometimes, assuming the attitude of a woman\r\nof experience, she spoke ill of love with a sceptical smile that made\r\nhim feel inclined to box her ears. A quarter of an hour afterwards, it\r\nwas the only thing of any consequence in the world, and, with her arms\r\ncrossed over her breast, as if she were clasping some one close to her:\r\n"Oh, yes, \'tis good! \'tis good!" and her eyelids would quiver in a kind\r\nof rapturous swoon. It was impossible to understand her, to know, for\r\ninstance, whether she loved Arnoux, for she made fun of him, and yet\r\nseemed jealous of him. So likewise with the Vatnaz, whom she would\r\nsometimes call a wretch, and at other times her best friend. In short,\r\nthere was about her entire person, even to the very arrangement of her\r\nchignon over her head, an inexpressible something, which seemed like a\r\nchallenge; and he desired her for the satisfaction, above all, of\r\nconquering her and being her master.\r\n\r\nHow was he to accomplish this? for she often sent him away\r\nunceremoniously, appearing only for a moment between two doors in order\r\nto say in a subdued voice, "I\'m engaged--for the evening;" or else he\r\nfound her surrounded by a dozen persons; and when they were alone, so\r\nmany impediments presented themselves one after the other, that one\r\nwould have sworn there was a bet to keep matters from going any further.\r\nHe invited her to dinner; as a rule, she declined the invitation. On one\r\noccasion, she accepted it, but did not come.\r\n\r\nA Machiavellian idea arose in his brain.\r\n\r\nHaving heard from Dussardier about Pellerin\'s complaints against\r\nhimself, he thought of giving the artist an order to paint the\r\nMar\xe9chale\'s portrait, a life-sized portrait, which would necessitate a\r\ngood number of sittings. He would not fail to be present at all of them.\r\nThe habitual incorrectness of the painter would facilitate their private\r\nconversations. So then he would urge Rosanette to get the picture\r\nexecuted in order to make a present of her face to her dear Arnoux. She\r\nconsented, for she saw herself in the midst of the Grand Salon in the\r\nmost prominent position with a crowd of people staring at her picture,\r\nand the newspapers would all talk about it, which at once would set her\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nAs for Pellerin, he eagerly snatched at the offer. This portrait ought\r\nto place him in the position of a great man; it ought to be a\r\nmasterpiece. He passed in review in his memory all the portraits by\r\ngreat masters with which he was acquainted, and decided finally in\r\nfavour of a Titian, which would be set off with ornaments in the style\r\nof Veronese. Therefore, he would carry out his design without artificial\r\nbackgrounds in a bold light, which would illuminate the flesh-tints with\r\na single tone, and which would make the accessories glitter.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I were to put on her," he thought, "a pink silk dress with an\r\nOriental bournous? Oh, no! the bournous is only a rascally thing! Or\r\nsuppose, rather, I were to make her wear blue velvet with a grey\r\nbackground, richly coloured? We might likewise give her a white guipure\r\ncollar with a black fan and a scarlet curtain behind." And thus, seeking\r\nfor ideas, he enlarged his conception, and regarded it with admiration.\r\n\r\nHe felt his heart beating when Rosanette, accompanied by Frederick,\r\ncalled at his house for the first sitting. He placed her standing up on\r\na sort of platform in the midst of the apartment, and, finding fault\r\nwith the light and expressing regret at the loss of his former studio,\r\nhe first made her lean on her elbow against a pedestal, then sit down in\r\nan armchair, and, drawing away from her and coming near her again by\r\nturns in order to adjust with a fillip the folds of her dress, he\r\nwatched her with eyelids half-closed, and appealed to Frederick\'s taste\r\nwith a passing word.\r\n\r\n"Well, no," he exclaimed; "I return to my own idea. I will set you up in\r\nthe Venetian style."\r\n\r\nShe would have a poppy-coloured velvet gown with a jewelled girdle; and\r\nher wide sleeve lined with ermine would afford a glimpse of her bare\r\narm, which was to touch the balustrade of a staircase rising behind her.\r\nAt her left, a large column would mount as far as the top of the canvas\r\nto meet certain structures so as to form an arch. Underneath one would\r\nvaguely distinguish groups of orange-trees almost black, through which\r\nthe blue sky, with its streaks of white cloud, would seem cut into\r\nfragments. On the baluster, covered with a carpet, there would be, on a\r\nsilver dish, a bouquet of flowers, a chaplet of amber, a poniard, and a\r\nlittle chest of antique ivory, rather yellow with age, which would\r\nappear to be disgorging gold sequins. Some of them, falling on the\r\nground here and there, would form brilliant splashes, as it were, in\r\nsuch a way as to direct one\'s glance towards the tip of her foot, for\r\nshe would be standing on the last step but one in a natural position, as\r\nif in the act of moving under the glow of the broad sunlight.\r\n\r\nHe went to look for a picture-case, which he laid on the platform to\r\nrepresent the step. Then he arranged as accessories, on a stool by way\r\nof balustrade, his pea-jacket, a buckler, a sardine-box, a bundle of\r\npens, and a knife; and when he had flung in front of Rosanette a dozen\r\nbig sous, he made her assume the attitude he required.\r\n\r\n"Just try to imagine that these things are riches, magnificent presents.\r\nThe head a little on one side! Perfect! and don\'t stir! This majestic\r\nposture exactly suits your style of beauty."\r\n\r\nShe wore a plaid dress and carried a big muff, and only kept from\r\nlaughing outright by an effort of self-control.\r\n\r\n"As regards the head-dress, we will mingle with it a circle of pearls.\r\nIt always produces a striking effect with red hair."\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale burst out into an exclamation, remarking that she had not\r\nred hair.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! The red of painters is not that of ordinary people."\r\n\r\nHe began to sketch the position of the masses; and he was so much\r\npreoccupied with the great artists of the Renaissance that he kept\r\ntalking about them persistently. For a whole hour he went on musing\r\naloud on those splendid lives, full of genius, glory, and sumptuous\r\ndisplays, with triumphal entries into the cities, and galas by\r\ntorchlight among half-naked women, beautiful as goddesses.\r\n\r\n"You were made to live in those days. A creature of your calibre would\r\nhave deserved a monseigneur."\r\n\r\nRosanette thought the compliments he paid her very pretty. The day was\r\nfixed for the next sitting. Frederick took it on himself to bring the\r\naccessories.\r\n\r\nAs the heat of the stove had stupefied her a little, they went home on\r\nfoot through the Rue du Bac, and reached the Pont Royal.\r\n\r\nIt was fine weather, piercingly bright and warm. Some windows of houses\r\nin the city shone in the distance, like plates of gold, whilst behind\r\nthem at the right the turrets of N\xf4tre Dame showed their outlines in\r\nblack against the blue sky, softly bathed at the horizon in grey\r\nvapours.\r\n\r\nThe wind began to swell; and Rosanette, having declared that she felt\r\nhungry, they entered the "Patisserie Anglaise."\r\n\r\nYoung women with their children stood eating in front of the marble\r\nbuffet, where plates of little cakes had glass covers pressed down on\r\nthem. Rosanette swallowed two cream-tarts. The powdered sugar formed\r\nmoustaches at the sides of her mouth. From time to time, in order to\r\nwipe it, she drew out her handkerchief from her muff, and her face,\r\nunder her green silk hood, resembled a full-blown rose in the midst of\r\nits leaves.\r\n\r\nThey resumed their walk. In the Rue de la Paix she stood before a\r\ngoldsmith\'s shop to look at a bracelet. Frederick wished to make her a\r\npresent of it.\r\n\r\n"No!" said she; "keep your money!"\r\n\r\nHe was hurt by these words.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now with the ducky? We are melancholy?"\r\n\r\nAnd, the conversation having been renewed, he began making the same\r\nprotestations of love to her as usual.\r\n\r\n"You know well \'tis impossible!"\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! because----"\r\n\r\nThey went on side by side, she leaning on his arm, and the flounces of\r\nher gown kept flapping against his legs. Then, he recalled to mind one\r\nwinter twilight when on the same footpath Madame Arnoux walked thus by\r\nhis side, and he became so much absorbed in this recollection that he no\r\nlonger saw Rosanette, and did not bestow a thought upon her.\r\n\r\nShe kept looking straight before her in a careless fashion, lagging a\r\nlittle, like a lazy child. It was the hour when people had just come\r\nback from their promenade, and equipages were making their way at a\r\nquick trot over the hard pavement.\r\n\r\nPellerin\'s flatteries having probably recurred to her mind, she heaved a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n"Ah! there are some lucky women in the world. Decidedly, I was made for\r\na rich man!"\r\n\r\nHe replied, with a certain brutality in his tone:\r\n\r\n"You have one, in the meantime!" for M. Oudry was looked upon as a man\r\nthat could count a million three times over.\r\n\r\nShe asked for nothing better than to get free from him.\r\n\r\n"What prevents you from doing so?" And he gave utterance to bitter jests\r\nabout this old bewigged citizen, pointing out to her that such an\r\nintrigue was unworthy of her, and that she ought to break it off.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the Mar\xe9chale, as if talking to herself. "\'Tis what I\r\nshall end by doing, no doubt!"\r\n\r\nFrederick was charmed by this disinterestedness. She slackened her pace,\r\nand he fancied that she was fatigued. She obstinately refused to let him\r\ntake a cab, and she parted with him at her door, sending him a kiss with\r\nher finger-tips.\r\n\r\n"Ah! what a pity! and to think that imbeciles take me for a man of\r\nwealth!"\r\n\r\nHe reached home in a gloomy frame of mind.\r\n\r\nHussonnet and Deslauriers were awaiting him. The Bohemian, seated before\r\nthe table, made sketches of Turks\' heads; and the advocate, in dirty\r\nboots, lay asleep on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"Ha! at last," he exclaimed. "But how sullen you look! Will you listen\r\nto me?"\r\n\r\nHis vogue as a tutor had fallen off, for he crammed his pupils with\r\ntheories unfavourable for their examinations. He had appeared in two or\r\nthree cases in which he had been unsuccessful, and each new\r\ndisappointment flung him back with greater force on the dream of his\r\nearlier days--a journal in which he could show himself off, avenge\r\nhimself, and spit forth his bile and his opinions. Fortune and\r\nreputation, moreover, would follow as a necessary consequence. It was in\r\nthis hope that he had got round the Bohemian, Hussonnet happening to be\r\nthe possessor of a press.\r\n\r\nAt present, he printed it on pink paper. He invented hoaxes, composed\r\nrebuses, tried to engage in polemics, and even intended, in spite of the\r\nsituation of the premises, to get up concerts. A year\'s subscription was\r\nto give a right to a place in the orchestra in one of the principal\r\ntheatres of Paris. Besides, the board of management took on itself to\r\nfurnish foreigners with all necessary information, artistic and\r\notherwise. But the printer gave vent to threats; there were three\r\nquarters\' rent due to the landlord. All sorts of embarrassments arose;\r\nand Hussonnet would have allowed _L\'Art_ to perish, were it not for the\r\nexhortations of the advocate, who kept every day exciting his mind. He\r\nhad brought the other with him, in order to give more weight to the\r\napplication he was now making.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve come about the journal," said he.\r\n\r\n"What! are you still thinking about that?" said Frederick, in an absent\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, I am thinking about it!"\r\n\r\nAnd he explained his plan anew. By means of the Bourse returns, they\r\nwould get into communication with financiers, and would thus obtain the\r\nhundred thousand francs indispensable as security. But, in order that\r\nthe print might be transformed into a political journal, it was\r\nnecessary beforehand to have a large _client\xe8le_, and for that purpose\r\nto make up their minds to go to some expense--so much for the cost of\r\npaper and printing, and for outlay at the office; in short, a sum of\r\nabout fifteen thousand francs.\r\n\r\n"I have no funds," said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"And what are we to do, then?" said Deslauriers, with folded arms.\r\n\r\nFrederick, hurt by the attitude which Deslauriers was assuming, replied:\r\n\r\n"Is that my fault?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! very fine. A man has wood in his fire, truffles on his table, a\r\ngood bed, a library, a carriage, every kind of comfort. But let another\r\nman shiver under the slates, dine at twenty sous, work like a convict,\r\nand sprawl through want in the mire--is it the rich man\'s fault?"\r\n\r\nAnd he repeated, "Is it the rich man\'s fault?" with a Ciceronian irony\r\nwhich smacked of the law-courts.\r\n\r\nFrederick tried to speak.\r\n\r\n"However, I understand one has certain wants--aristocratic wants; for,\r\nno doubt, some woman----"\r\n\r\n"Well, even if that were so? Am I not free----?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! quite free!"\r\n\r\nAnd, after a minute\'s silence:\r\n\r\n"Promises are so convenient!"\r\n\r\n"Good God! I don\'t deny that I gave them!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\nThe advocate went on:\r\n\r\n"At college we take oaths; we are going to set up a phalanx; we are\r\ngoing to imitate Balzac\'s Thirteen. Then, on meeting a friend after a\r\nseparation: \'Good night, old fellow! Go about your business!\' For he who\r\nmight help the other carefully keeps everything for himself alone."\r\n\r\n"How is that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you have not even introduced me to the Dambreuses."\r\n\r\nFrederick cast a scrutinising glance at him. With his shabby frock-coat,\r\nhis spectacles of rough glass, and his sallow face, that advocate seemed\r\nto him such a typical specimen of the penniless pedant that he could not\r\nprevent his lips from curling with a disdainful smile.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers perceived this, and reddened.\r\n\r\nHe had already taken his hat to leave. Hussonnet, filled with\r\nuneasiness, tried to mollify him with appealing looks, and, as Frederick\r\nwas turning his back on him:\r\n\r\n"Look here, my boy, become my M\xe6cenas! Protect the arts!"\r\n\r\nFrederick, with an abrupt movement of resignation, took a sheet of\r\npaper, and, having scrawled some lines on it, handed it to him. The\r\nBohemian\'s face lighted up.\r\n\r\nThen, passing across the sheet of paper to Deslauriers:\r\n\r\n"Apologise, my fine fellow!"\r\n\r\nTheir friend begged his notary to send him fifteen thousand francs as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I recognise you in that," said Deslauriers.\r\n\r\n"On the faith of a gentleman," added the Bohemian, "you are a noble\r\nfellow, you\'ll be placed in the gallery of useful men!"\r\n\r\nThe advocate remarked:\r\n\r\n"You\'ll lose nothing by it, \'tis an excellent speculation."\r\n\r\n"Faith," exclaimed Hussonnet, "I\'d stake my head at the scaffold on its\r\nsuccess!"\r\n\r\nAnd he said so many foolish things, and promised so many wonderful\r\nthings, in which perhaps he believed, that Frederick did not know\r\nwhether he did this in order to laugh at others or at himself.\r\n\r\nThe same evening he received a letter from his mother. She expressed\r\nastonishment at not seeing him yet a minister, while indulging in a\r\nlittle banter at his expense. Then she spoke of her health, and informed\r\nhim that M. Roque had now become one of her visitors.\r\n\r\n"Since he is a widower, I thought there would be no objection to\r\ninviting him to the house. Louise is greatly changed for the better."\r\nAnd in a postscript: "You have told me nothing about your fine\r\nacquaintance, M. Dambreuse; if I were you, I would make use of him."\r\n\r\nWhy not? His intellectual ambitions had left him, and his fortune (he\r\nsaw it clearly) was insufficient, for when his debts had been paid, and\r\nthe sum agreed on remitted to the others, his income would be diminished\r\nby four thousand at least! Moreover, he felt the need of giving up this\r\nsort of life, and attaching himself to some pursuit. So, next day, when\r\ndining at Madame Arnoux\'s, he said that his mother was tormenting him in\r\norder to make him take up a profession.\r\n\r\n"But I was under the impression," she said, "that M. Dambreuse was going\r\nto get you into the Council of State? That would suit you very well."\r\n\r\nSo, then, she wished him to take this course. He regarded her wish as a\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe banker, as on the first occasion, was seated at his desk, and, with\r\na gesture, intimated that he desired Frederick to wait a few minutes;\r\nfor a gentleman who was standing at the door with his back turned had\r\nbeen discussing some serious topic with him.\r\n\r\nThe subject of their conversation was the proposed amalgamation of the\r\ndifferent coal-mining companies.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the glass hung portraits of General Foy and Louis\r\nPhilippe. Cardboard shelves rose along the panels up to the ceiling, and\r\nthere were six straw chairs, M. Dambreuse not requiring a more\r\nfashionably-furnished apartment for the transaction of business. It\r\nresembled those gloomy kitchens in which great banquets are prepared.\r\n\r\nFrederick noticed particularly two chests of prodigious size which stood\r\nin the corners. He asked himself how many millions they might contain.\r\nThe banker unlocked one of them, and as the iron plate revolved, it\r\ndisclosed to view nothing inside but blue paper books full of entries.\r\n\r\nAt last, the person who had been talking to M. Dambreuse passed in front\r\nof Frederick. It was P\xe8re Oudry. The two saluted one another, their\r\nfaces colouring--a circumstance which surprised M. Dambreuse. However,\r\nhe exhibited the utmost affability, observing that nothing would be\r\neasier than to recommend the young man to the Keeper of the Seals. They\r\nwould be too happy to have him, he added, concluding his polite\r\nattentions by inviting him to an evening party which he would be giving\r\nin a few days.\r\n\r\nFrederick was stepping into a brougham on his way to this party when a\r\nnote from the Mar\xe9chale reached him. By the light of the carriage-lamps\r\nhe read:\r\n\r\n"Darling, I have followed your advice: I have just expelled my savage.\r\nAfter to-morrow evening, liberty! Say whether I am not brave!"\r\n\r\nNothing more. But it was clearly an invitation to him to take the vacant\r\nplace. He uttered an exclamation, squeezed the note into his pocket, and\r\nset forth.\r\n\r\nTwo municipal guards on horseback were stationed in the street. A row of\r\nlamps burned on the two front gates, and some servants were calling out\r\nin the courtyard to have the carriages brought up to the end of the\r\nsteps before the house under the marqu\xe9e.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the noise in the vestibule ceased.\r\n\r\nLarge trees filled up the space in front of the staircase. The porcelain\r\nglobes shed a light which waved like white moir\xe9 satin on the walls.\r\n\r\nFrederick rushed up the steps in a joyous frame of mind. An usher\r\nannounced his name. M. Dambreuse extended his hand. Almost at the very\r\nsame moment, Madame Dambreuse appeared. She wore a mauve dress trimmed\r\nwith lace. The ringlets of her hair were more abundant than usual, and\r\nnot a single jewel did she display.\r\n\r\nShe complained of his coming to visit them so rarely, and seized the\r\nopportunity to exchange a few confidential words with him.\r\n\r\nThe guests began to arrive. In their mode of bowing they twisted their\r\nbodies on one side or bent in two, or merely lowered their heads a\r\nlittle. Then, a married pair, a family passed in, and all scattered\r\nthemselves about the drawing-room, which was already filled. Under the\r\nchandelier in the centre, an enormous ottoman-seat supported a stand,\r\nthe flowers of which, bending forward, like plumes of feathers, hung\r\nover the heads of the ladies seated all around in a ring, while others\r\noccupied the easy-chairs, which formed two straight lines symmetrically\r\ninterrupted by the large velvet curtains of the windows and the lofty\r\nbays of the doors with their gilded lintels.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of men who remained standing on the floor with their hats in\r\ntheir hands seemed, at some distance, like one black mass, into which\r\nthe ribbons in the button-holes introduced red points here and there,\r\nand rendered all the more dull the monotonous whiteness of their\r\ncravats. With the exception of the very young men with the down on their\r\nfaces, all appeared to be bored. Some dandies, with an expression of\r\nsullenness on their countenances, were swinging on their heels. There\r\nwere numbers of men with grey hair or wigs. Here and there glistened a\r\nbald pate; and the visages of many of these men, either purple or\r\nexceedingly pale, showed in their worn aspect the traces of immense\r\nfatigues: for they were persons who devoted themselves either to\r\npolitical or commercial pursuits. M. Dambreuse had also invited a number\r\nof scholars and magistrates, two or three celebrated doctors, and he\r\ndeprecated with an air of humility the eulogies which they pronounced on\r\nhis entertainment and the allusions to his wealth.\r\n\r\nAn immense number of men-servants, with fine gold-laced livery, kept\r\nmoving about on every side. The large branched candlesticks, like\r\nbouquets of flame, threw a glow over the hangings. They were reflected\r\nin the mirrors; and at the bottom of the dining-room, which was adorned\r\nwith a jessamine treillage, the side-board resembled the high altar of a\r\ncathedral or an exhibition of jewellery, there were so many dishes,\r\nbells, knives and forks, silver and silver-gilt spoons in the midst of\r\ncrystal ware glittering with iridescence.\r\n\r\nThe three other reception-rooms overflowed with artistic\r\nobjects--landscapes by great masters on the walls, ivory and porcelain\r\nat the sides of the tables, and Chinese ornaments on the brackets.\r\nLacquered screens were displayed in front of the windows, clusters of\r\ncamelias rose above the mantel-shelves, and a light music vibrated in\r\nthe distance, like the humming of bees.\r\n\r\nThe quadrilles were not numerous, and the dancers, judged by the\r\nindifferent fashion in which they dragged their pumps after them, seemed\r\nto be going through the performance of a duty.\r\n\r\nFrederick heard some phrases, such as the following:\r\n\r\n"Were you at the last charity f\xeate at the H\xf4tel Lambert, Mademoiselle?"\r\n"No, Monsieur." "It will soon be intolerably warm here." "Oh! yes,\r\nindeed; quite suffocating!" "Whose polka, pray, is this?" "Good heavens,\r\nMadame, I don\'t know!"\r\n\r\nAnd, behind him, three greybeards, who had posted themselves in the\r\nrecess of a window, were whispering some _risqu\xe9_ remarks. A sportsman\r\ntold a hunting story, while a Legitimist carried on an argument with an\r\nOrl\xe9anist. And, wandering about from one group to another, he reached\r\nthe card-room, where, in the midst of grave-looking men gathered in a\r\ncircle, he recognised Martinon, now attached to the Bar of the capital.\r\n\r\nHis big face, with its waxen complexion, filled up the space encircled\r\nby his collar-like beard, which was a marvel with its even surface of\r\nblack hair; and, observing the golden mean between the elegance which\r\nhis age might yearn for and the dignity which his profession exacted\r\nfrom him, he kept his thumbs stuck under his armpits, according to the\r\ncustom of beaux, and then put his hands into his waistcoat pockets after\r\nthe manner of learned personages. Though his boots were polished to\r\nexcess, he kept his temples shaved in order to have the forehead of a\r\nthinker.\r\n\r\nAfter he had addressed a few chilling words to Frederick, he turned once\r\nmore towards those who were chatting around him. A land-owner was\r\nsaying: "This is a class of men that dreams of upsetting society."\r\n\r\n"They are calling for the organisation of labour," said another: "Can\r\nthis be conceived?"\r\n\r\n"What could you expect," said a third, "when we see M. de Genoude giving\r\nhis assistance to the _Si\xe8cle_?"\r\n\r\n"And even Conservatives style themselves Progressives. To lead us to\r\nwhat? To the Republic! as if such a thing were possible in France!"\r\n\r\nEveryone declared that the Republic was impossible in France.\r\n\r\n"No matter!" remarked one gentleman in a loud tone. "People take too\r\nmuch interest in the Revolution. A heap of histories, of different kinds\r\nof works, are published concerning it!"\r\n\r\n"Without taking into account," said Martinon, "that there are probably\r\nsubjects of far more importance which might be studied."\r\n\r\nA gentleman occupying a ministerial office laid the blame on the\r\nscandals associated with the stage:\r\n\r\n"Thus, for instance, this new drama of _La Reine Margot_ really goes\r\nbeyond the proper limits. What need was there for telling us about the\r\nValois? All this exhibits loyalty in an unfavourable light. \'Tis just\r\nlike your press! There is no use in talking, the September laws are\r\naltogether too mild. For my part, I would like to have court-martials,\r\nto gag the journalists! At the slightest display of insolence, drag them\r\nbefore a council of war, and then make an end of the business!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, take care, Monsieur! take care!" said a professor. "Don\'t attack\r\nthe precious boons we gained in 1830! Respect our liberties!" It would\r\nbe better, he contended, to adopt a policy of decentralisation, and to\r\ndistribute the surplus populations of the towns through the country\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n"But they are gangrened!" exclaimed a Catholic. "Let religion be more\r\nfirmly established!"\r\n\r\nMartinon hastened to observe:\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact, it is a restraining force."\r\n\r\nAll the evil lay in this modern longing to rise above one\'s class and to\r\npossess luxuries.\r\n\r\n"However," urged a manufacturer, "luxury aids commerce. Therefore, I\r\napprove of the Duc de Nemours\' action in insisting on having short\r\nbreeches at his evening parties."\r\n\r\n"M. Thiers came to one of them in a pair of trousers. You know his joke\r\non the subject?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; charming! But he turned round to the demagogues, and his speech on\r\nthe question of incompatibilities was not without its influence in\r\nbringing about the attempt of the twelfth of May."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pooh!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay!"\r\n\r\nThe circle had to make a little opening to give a passage to a\r\nman-servant carrying a tray, who was trying to make his way into the\r\ncard-room.\r\n\r\nUnder the green shades of the wax-lights the tables were covered with\r\ntwo rows of cards and gold coins. Frederick stopped beside one corner of\r\nthe table, lost the fifteen napoleons which he had in his pocket,\r\nwhirled lightly about, and found himself on the threshold of the boudoir\r\nin which Madame Dambreuse happened to be at that moment.\r\n\r\nIt was filled with women sitting close to one another in little groups\r\non seats without backs. Their long skirts, swelling round them, seemed\r\nlike waves, from which their waists emerged; and their breasts were\r\nclearly outlined by the slope of their corsages. Nearly every one of\r\nthem had a bouquet of violets in her hand. The dull shade of their\r\ngloves showed off the whiteness of their arms, which formed a contrast\r\nwith its human flesh tints. Over the shoulders of some of them hung\r\nfringe or mourning-weeds, and, every now and then, as they quivered with\r\nemotion, it seemed as if their bodices were about to fall down.\r\n\r\nBut the decorum of their countenances tempered the exciting effect of\r\ntheir costumes. Several of them had a placidity almost like that of\r\nanimals; and this resemblance to the brute creation on the part of\r\nhalf-nude women made him think of the interior of a harem--indeed, a\r\ngrosser comparison suggested itself to the young man\'s mind.\r\n\r\nEvery variety of beauty was to be found there--some English ladies, with\r\nthe profile familiar in "keepsakes"; an Italian, whose black eyes shot\r\nforth lava-like flashes, like a Vesuvius; three sisters, dressed in\r\nblue; three Normans, fresh as April apples; a tall red-haired girl, with\r\na set of amethysts. And the bright scintillation of diamonds, which\r\ntrembled in aigrettes worn over their hair, the luminous spots of\r\nprecious stones laid over their breasts, and the delightful radiance of\r\npearls which adorned their foreheads mingled with the glitter of gold\r\nrings, as well as with the lace, powder, the feathers, the vermilion of\r\ndainty mouths, and the mother-of-pearl hue of teeth. The ceiling,\r\nrounded like a cupola, gave to the boudoir the form of a flower-basket,\r\nand a current of perfumed air circulated under the flapping of their\r\nfans.\r\n\r\nFrederick, planting himself behind them, put up his eyeglass and scanned\r\ntheir shoulders, not all of which did he consider irreproachable. He\r\nthought about the Mar\xe9chale, and this dispelled the temptations that\r\nbeset him or consoled him for not yielding to them.\r\n\r\nHe gazed, however, at Madame Dambreuse, and he considered her charming,\r\nin spite of her mouth being rather large and her nostrils too dilated.\r\nBut she was remarkably graceful in appearance. There was, as it were, an\r\nexpression of passionate languor in the ringlets of her hair, and her\r\nforehead, which was like agate, seemed to cover a great deal, and\r\nindicated a masterful intelligence.\r\n\r\nShe had placed beside her her husband\'s niece, a rather plain-looking\r\nyoung person. From time to time she left her seat to receive those who\r\nhad just come in; and the murmur of feminine voices, made, as it were, a\r\ncackling like that of birds.\r\n\r\nThey were talking about the Tunisian ambassadors and their costumes. One\r\nlady had been present at the last reception of the Academy. Another\r\nreferred to the _Don Juan_ of Moli\xe8re, which had recently been performed\r\nat the Th\xe9\xe2tre Fran\xe7ais.\r\n\r\nBut with a significant glance towards her niece, Madame Dambreuse laid a\r\nfinger on her lips, while the smile which escaped from her contradicted\r\nthis display of austerity.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Martinon appeared at the door directly in front of her. She\r\narose at once. He offered her his arm. Frederick, in order to watch the\r\nprogress of these gallantries on Martinon\'s part, walked past the\r\ncard-table, and came up with them in the large drawing-room. Madame\r\nDambreuse very soon quitted her cavalier, and began chatting with\r\nFrederick himself in a very familiar tone.\r\n\r\nShe understood that he did not play cards, and did not dance.\r\n\r\n"Young people have a tendency to be melancholy!" Then, with a single\r\ncomprehensive glance around:\r\n\r\n"Besides, this sort of thing is not amusing--at least for certain\r\nnatures!"\r\n\r\nAnd she drew up in front of the row of armchairs, uttering a few polite\r\nremarks here and there, while some old men with double eyeglasses came\r\nto pay court to her. She introduced Frederick to some of them. M.\r\nDambreuse touched him lightly on the elbow, and led him out on the\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\nHe had seen the Minister. The thing was not easy to manage. Before he\r\ncould be qualified for the post of auditor to the Council of State, he\r\nshould pass an examination. Frederick, seized with an unaccountable\r\nself-confidence, replied that he had a knowledge of the subjects\r\nprescribed for it.\r\n\r\nThe financier was not surprised at this, after all the eulogies M. Roque\r\nhad pronounced on his abilities.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of this name, a vision of little Louise, her house and\r\nher room, passed through his mind, and he remembered how he had on\r\nnights like this stood at her window listening to the wagoners driving\r\npast. This recollection of his griefs brought back the thought of Madame\r\nArnoux, and he relapsed into silence as he continued to pace up and down\r\nthe terrace. The windows shone amid the darkness like slabs of flame.\r\nThe buzz of the ball gradually grew fainter; the carriages were\r\nbeginning to leave.\r\n\r\n"Why in the world," M. Dambreuse went on, "are you so anxious to be\r\nattached to the Council of State?"\r\n\r\nAnd he declared, in the tone of a man of broad views, that the public\r\nfunctions led to nothing--he could speak with some authority on that\r\npoint--business was much better.\r\n\r\nFrederick urged as an objection the difficulty of grappling with all the\r\ndetails of business.\r\n\r\n"Pooh! I could post you up well in them in a very short time."\r\n\r\nWould he like to be a partner in any of his own undertakings?\r\n\r\nThe young man saw, as by a lightning-flash, an enormous fortune coming\r\ninto his hands.\r\n\r\n"Let us go in again," said the banker. "You are staying for supper with\r\nus, are you not?"\r\n\r\nIt was three o\'clock. They left the terrace.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room, a table at which supper was served up awaited the\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nM. Dambreuse perceived Martinon, and, drawing near his wife, in a low\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n"Is it you who invited him?"\r\n\r\nShe answered dryly:\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course."\r\n\r\nThe niece was not present.\r\n\r\nThe guests drank a great deal of wine, and laughed very loudly; and\r\nrisky jokes did not give any offence, all present experiencing that\r\nsense of relief which follows a somewhat prolonged period of constraint.\r\n\r\nMartinon alone displayed anything like gravity. He refused to drink\r\nchampagne, as he thought this good form, and, moreover, he assumed an\r\nair of tact and politeness, for when M. Dambreuse, who had a contracted\r\nchest, complained of an oppression, he made repeated enquiries about\r\nthat gentleman\'s health, and then let his blue eyes wander in the\r\ndirection of Madame Dambreuse.\r\n\r\nShe questioned Frederick in order to find out which of the young ladies\r\nhe liked best. He had noticed none of them in particular, and besides,\r\nhe preferred the women of thirty.\r\n\r\n"There, perhaps, you show your sense," she returned.\r\n\r\nThen, as they were putting on their pelisses and paletots, M. Dambreuse\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n"Come and see me one of these mornings and we\'ll have a chat."\r\n\r\nMartinon, at the foot of the stairs, was lighting a cigar, and, as he\r\npuffed it, he presented such a heavy profile that his companion allowed\r\nthis remark to escape from him:\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, you have a fine head!"\r\n\r\n"It has turned a few other heads," replied the young magistrate, with an\r\nair of mingled self-complacency and annoyance.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Frederick was in bed, he summed up the main features of the\r\nevening party. In the first place, his own toilet (he had looked at\r\nhimself several times in the mirrors), from the cut of his coat to the\r\nknot of his pumps left nothing to find fault with. He had spoken to\r\ninfluential men, and seen wealthy ladies at close quarters. M. Dambreuse\r\nhad shown himself to be an admirable type of man, and Madame Dambreuse\r\nan almost bewitching type of woman. He weighed one by one her slightest\r\nwords, her looks, a thousand things incapable of being analysed. It\r\nwould be a right good thing to have such a mistress. And, after all, why\r\nshould he not? He would have as good a chance with her as any other man.\r\nPerhaps she was not so hard to win? Then Martinon came back to his\r\nrecollection; and, as he fell asleep, he smiled with pity for this\r\nworthy fellow.\r\n\r\nHe woke up with the thought of the Mar\xe9chale in his mind. Those words of\r\nher note, "After to-morrow evening," were in fact an appointment for the\r\nvery same day.\r\n\r\nHe waited until nine o\'clock, and then hurried to her house.\r\n\r\nSome one who had been going up the stairs before him shut the door. He\r\nrang the bell; Delphine came out and told him that "Madame" was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nFrederick persisted, begging of her to admit him. He had something of a\r\nvery serious nature to communicate to her; only a word would suffice. At\r\nlength, the hundred-sous-piece argument proved successful, and the maid\r\nlet him into the anteroom.\r\n\r\nRosanette appeared. She was in a neglig\xe9e, with her hair loose, and,\r\nshaking her head, she waved her arms when she was some paces away from\r\nhim to indicate that she could not receive him now.\r\n\r\nFrederick descended the stairs slowly. This caprice was worse than any\r\nof the others she had indulged in. He could not understand it at all.\r\n\r\nIn front of the porter\'s lodge Mademoiselle Vatnaz stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Has she received you?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been put out?"\r\n\r\n"How do you know that?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis quite plain. But come on; let us go away. I am suffocating!"\r\n\r\nShe made him accompany her along the street; she panted for breath; he\r\ncould feel her thin arm trembling on his own. Suddenly, she broke out:\r\n\r\n"Ah! the wretch!"\r\n\r\n"Who, pray?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he--he--Delmar!"\r\n\r\nThis revelation humiliated Frederick. He next asked:\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure of it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, when I tell you I followed him!" exclaimed the Vatnaz. "I saw him\r\ngoing in! Now do you understand? I ought to have expected it for that\r\nmatter--\'twas I, in my stupidity, that introduced him to her. And if you\r\nonly knew all; my God! Why, I picked him up, supported him, clothed him!\r\nAnd then all the paragraphs I got into the newspapers about him! I loved\r\nhim like a mother!"\r\n\r\nThen, with a sneer:\r\n\r\n"Ha! Monsieur wants velvet robes! You may be sure \'tis a speculation on\r\nhis part. And as for her!--to think that I knew her to earn her living\r\nas a seamstress! If it were not for me, she would have fallen into the\r\nmire twenty times over! But I will plunge her into it yet! I\'ll see her\r\ndying in a hospital--and everything about her will be known!"\r\n\r\nAnd, like a torrent of dirty water from a vessel full of refuse, her\r\nrage poured out in a tumultuous fashion into Frederick\'s ear the recital\r\nof her rival\'s disgraceful acts.\r\n\r\n"She lived with Jumillac, with Flacourt, with little Allard, with\r\nBertinaux, with Saint-Val\xe9ry, the pock-marked fellow! No, \'twas the\r\nother! They are two brothers--it makes no difference. And when she was\r\nin difficulties, I settled everything. She is so avaricious! And then,\r\nyou will agree with me, \'twas nice and kind of me to go to see her, for\r\nwe are not persons of the same grade! Am I a fast woman--I? Do I sell\r\nmyself? Without taking into account that she is as stupid as a head of\r\ncabbage. She writes \'category\' with a \'th.\' After all, they are well\r\nmet. They make a precious couple, though he styles himself an artist and\r\nthinks himself a man of genius. But, my God! if he had only\r\nintelligence, he would not have done such an infamous thing! Men don\'t,\r\nas a rule, leave a superior woman for a hussy! What do I care about him\r\nafter all? He is becoming ugly. I hate him! If I met him, mind you, I\'d\r\nspit in his face." She spat out as she uttered the words.\r\n\r\n"Yes, this is what I think about him now. And Arnoux, eh? Isn\'t it\r\nabominable? He has forgiven her so often! You can\'t conceive the\r\nsacrifices he has made for her. She ought to kiss his feet! He is so\r\ngenerous, so good!"\r\n\r\nFrederick was delighted at hearing Delmar disparaged. He had taken sides\r\nwith Arnoux. This perfidy on Rosanette\'s part seemed to him an abnormal\r\nand inexcusable thing; and, infected with this elderly spinster\'s\r\nemotion, he felt a sort of tenderness towards her. Suddenly he found\r\nhimself in front of Arnoux\'s door. Mademoiselle Vatnaz, without his\r\nattention having been drawn to it, had led him down towards the Rue\r\nPoissonni\xe8re.\r\n\r\n"Here we are!" said she. "As for me, I can\'t go up; but you, surely\r\nthere is nothing to prevent you?"\r\n\r\n"From doing what?"\r\n\r\n"From telling him everything, faith!"\r\n\r\nFrederick, as if waking up with a start, saw the baseness towards which\r\nshe was urging him.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said after a pause.\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes towards the second floor. Madame Arnoux\'s lamp was\r\nburning. In fact there was nothing to prevent him from going up.\r\n\r\n"I am going to wait for you here. Go on, then!"\r\n\r\nThis direction had the effect of chilling him, and he said:\r\n\r\n"I shall be a long time up there; you would do better to return home. I\r\nwill call on you to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" replied the Vatnaz, stamping with her foot. "Take him with\r\nyou! Bring him there! Let him catch them together!"\r\n\r\n"But Delmar will no longer be there."\r\n\r\nShe hung down her head.\r\n\r\n"Yes; that\'s true, perhaps."\r\n\r\nAnd she remained without speaking in the middle of the street, with\r\nvehicles all around her; then, fixing on him her wild-cat\'s eyes:\r\n\r\n"I may rely on you, may I not? There is now a sacred bond between us. Do\r\nwhat you say, then; we\'ll talk about it to-morrow."\r\n\r\nFrederick, in passing through the lobby, heard two voices responding to\r\none another.\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux\'s voice was saying:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t lie! don\'t lie, pray!"\r\n\r\nHe went in. The voices suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nArnoux was walking from one end of the apartment to the other, and\r\nMadame was seated on the little chair near the fire, extremely pale and\r\nstaring straight before her. Frederick stepped back, and was about to\r\nretire, when Arnoux grasped his hand, glad that some one had come to his\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n"But I am afraid----" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Stay here, I beg of you!" he whispered in his ear.\r\n\r\nMadame remarked:\r\n\r\n"You must make some allowance for this scene, Monsieur Moreau. Such\r\nthings sometimes unfortunately occur in households."\r\n\r\n"They do when we introduce them there ourselves," said Arnoux in a jolly\r\ntone. "Women have crotchets, I assure you. This, for instance, is not a\r\nbad one--see! No; quite the contrary. Well, she has been amusing\r\nherself for the last hour by teasing me with a heap of idle stories."\r\n\r\n"They are true," retorted Madame Arnoux, losing patience; "for, in fact,\r\nyou bought it yourself."\r\n\r\n"I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you yourself, at the Persian House."\r\n\r\n"The cashmere," thought Frederick.\r\n\r\nHe was filled with a consciousness of guilt, and got quite alarmed.\r\n\r\nShe quickly added:\r\n\r\n"It was on Saturday, the fourteenth."\r\n\r\n"The fourteenth," said Arnoux, looking up, as if he were searching in\r\nhis mind for a date.\r\n\r\n"And, furthermore, the clerk who sold it to you was a fair-haired young\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"How could I remember what sort of man the clerk was?"\r\n\r\n"And yet it was at your dictation he wrote the address, 18 Rue de\r\nLaval."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?" said Arnoux in amazement.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Oh! \'tis very simple: I went to get my cashmere altered, and the\r\nsuperintendent of the millinery department told me that they had just\r\nsent another of the same sort to Madame Arnoux."\r\n\r\n"Is it my fault if there is a Madame Arnoux in the same street?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but not Jacques Arnoux," she returned.\r\n\r\nThereupon, he began to talk in an incoherent fashion, protesting that he\r\nwas innocent. It was some misapprehension, some accident, one of those\r\nthings that happen in some way that is utterly unaccountable. Men should\r\nnot be condemned on mere suspicion, vague probabilities; and he\r\nreferred to the case of the unfortunate Lesurques.\r\n\r\n"In short, I say you are mistaken. Do you want me to take my oath on\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis not worth while."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\nShe looked him straight in the face without saying a word, then\r\nstretched out her hand, took down the little silver chest from the\r\nmantelpiece, and handed him a bill which was spread open.\r\n\r\nArnoux coloured up to his ears, and his swollen and distorted features\r\nbetrayed his confusion.\r\n\r\n"But," he said in faltering tones, "what does this prove?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she said, with a peculiar ring in her voice, in which sorrow and\r\nirony were blended. "Ah!"\r\n\r\nArnoux held the bill in his hands, and turned it round without removing\r\nhis eyes from it, as if he were going to find in it the solution of a\r\ngreat problem.\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes, yes; I remember," said he at length. "\'Twas a commission. You\r\nought to know about that matter, Frederick." Frederick remained silent.\r\n"A commission that P\xe8re Oudry entrusted to me."\r\n\r\n"And for whom?"\r\n\r\n"For his mistress."\r\n\r\n"For your own!" exclaimed Madame Arnoux, springing to her feet and\r\nstanding erect before him.\r\n\r\n"I swear to you!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t begin over again. I know everything."\r\n\r\n"Ha! quite right. So you\'re spying on me!"\r\n\r\nShe returned coldly:\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that wounds your delicacy?"\r\n\r\n"Since you are in a passion," said Arnoux, looking for his hat, "and\r\ncan\'t be reasoned with----"\r\n\r\nThen, with a big sigh:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t marry, my poor friend, don\'t, if you take my advice!"\r\n\r\nAnd he took himself off, finding it absolutely necessary to get into the\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\nThen there was a deep silence, and it seemed as if everything in the\r\nroom had become more motionless than before. A luminous circle above the\r\nlamp whitened the ceiling, while at the corners stretched out bits of\r\nshade resembling pieces of black gauze placed on top of one another. The\r\nticking of the clock and the crackling of the fire were the only sounds\r\nthat disturbed the stillness.\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux had just seated herself in the armchair at the opposite\r\nside of the chimney-piece. She bit her lip and shivered. She drew her\r\nhands up to her face; a sob broke from her, and she began to weep.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the little couch, and in the soothing tone in which one\r\naddresses a sick person:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suspect me of having anything to do with----?"\r\n\r\nShe made no reply. But, continuing presently to give utterance to her\r\nown thoughts:\r\n\r\n"I leave him perfectly free! There was no necessity for lying on his\r\npart!"\r\n\r\n"That is quite true," said Frederick. "No doubt," he added, "it was the\r\nresult of Arnoux\'s habits; he had acted thoughtlessly, but perhaps in\r\nmatters of a graver character----"\r\n\r\n"What do you see, then, that can be graver?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing!"\r\n\r\nFrederick bent his head with a smile of acquiescence. Nevertheless, he\r\nurged, Arnoux possessed certain good qualities; he was fond of his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"Ay, and he does all he can to ruin them!"\r\n\r\nFrederick urged that this was due to an excessively easy-going\r\ndisposition, for indeed he was a good fellow.\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"But what is the meaning of that--a good fellow?"\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded to defend Arnoux in the vaguest kind of language he\r\ncould think of, and, while expressing his sympathy with her, he\r\nrejoiced, he was delighted, at the bottom of his heart. Through\r\nretaliation or need of affection she would fly to him for refuge. His\r\nlove was intensified by the hope which had now grown immeasurably\r\nstronger in his breast.\r\n\r\nNever had she appeared to him so captivating, so perfectly beautiful.\r\nFrom time to time a deep breath made her bosom swell. Her two eyes,\r\ngazing fixedly into space, seemed dilated by a vision in the depths of\r\nher consciousness, and her lips were slightly parted, as if to let her\r\nsoul escape through them. Sometimes she pressed her handkerchief over\r\nthem tightly. He would have liked to be this dainty little piece of\r\ncambric moistened with her tears. In spite of himself, he cast a look at\r\nthe bed at the end of the alcove, picturing to himself her head lying on\r\nthe pillow, and so vividly did this present itself to his imagination\r\nthat he had to restrain himself to keep from clasping her in his arms.\r\nShe closed her eyelids, and now she appeared quiescent and languid. Then\r\nhe drew closer to her, and, bending over her, he eagerly scanned her\r\nface. At that moment, he heard the noise of boots in the lobby\r\noutside--it was the other. They heard him shutting the door of his own\r\nroom. Frederick made a sign to Madame Arnoux to ascertain from her\r\nwhether he ought to go there.\r\n\r\nShe replied "Yes," in the same voiceless fashion; and this mute exchange\r\nof thoughts between them was, as it were, an assent--the preliminary\r\nstep in adultery.\r\n\r\nArnoux was just taking off his coat to go to bed.\r\n\r\n"Well, how is she going on?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! better," said Frederick; "this will pass off."\r\n\r\nBut Arnoux was in an anxious state of mind.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know her; she has got hysterical now! Idiot of a clerk! This\r\nis what comes of being too good. If I had not given that cursed shawl to\r\nRosanette!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t regret having done so a bit. Nobody could be more grateful to you\r\nthan she is."\r\n\r\n"Do you really think so?"\r\n\r\nFrederick had not a doubt of it. The best proof of it was her dismissal\r\nof P\xe8re Oudry.\r\n\r\n"Ah! poor little thing!"\r\n\r\nAnd in the excess of his emotion, Arnoux wanted to rush off to her\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t worth while. I am calling to see her. She is unwell."\r\n\r\n"All the more reason for my going."\r\n\r\nHe quickly put on his coat again, and took up his candlestick. Frederick\r\ncursed his own stupidity, and pointed out to him that for decency\'s sake\r\nhe ought to remain this night with his wife. He could not leave her; it\r\nwould be very nasty.\r\n\r\n"I tell you candidly you would be doing wrong. There is no hurry over\r\nthere. You will go to-morrow. Come; do this for my sake."\r\n\r\nArnoux put down his candlestick, and, embracing him, said:\r\n\r\n"You are a right good fellow!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe Friend of the Family.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen began for Frederick an existence of misery. He became the parasite\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nIf anyone were indisposed, he called three times a day to know how the\r\npatient was, went to the piano-tuner\'s, contrived to do a thousand acts\r\nof kindness; and he endured with an air of contentment Mademoiselle\r\nMarthe\'s poutings and the caresses of little Eug\xe8ne, who was always\r\ndrawing his dirty hands over the young man\'s face. He was present at\r\ndinners at which Monsieur and Madame, facing each other, did not\r\nexchange a word, unless it happened that Arnoux provoked his wife with\r\nthe absurd remarks he made. When the meal was over, he would play about\r\nthe room with his son, conceal himself behind the furniture, or carry\r\nthe little boy on his back, walking about on all fours, like the\r\nBearnais.[11] At last, he would go out, and she would at once plunge\r\ninto the eternal subject of complaint--Arnoux.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Henry IV.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nIt was not his misconduct that excited her indignation, but her pride\r\nappeared to be wounded, and she did not hide her repugnance towards this\r\nman, who showed an absence of delicacy, dignity, and honour.\r\n\r\n"Or rather, he is mad!" she said.\r\n\r\nFrederick artfully appealed to her to confide in him. Ere long he knew\r\nall the details of her life. Her parents were people in a humble rank in\r\nlife at Chartres. One day, Arnoux, while sketching on the bank of the\r\nriver (at this period he believed himself to be a painter), saw her\r\nleaving the church, and made her an offer of marriage. On account of his\r\nwealth, he was unhesitatingly accepted. Besides, he was desperately in\r\nlove with her. She added:\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! he loves me still, after his fashion!"\r\n\r\nThey spent the few months immediately after their marriage in travelling\r\nthrough Italy.\r\n\r\nArnoux, in spite of his enthusiasm at the sight of the scenery and the\r\nmasterpieces, did nothing but groan over the wine, and, to find some\r\nkind of amusement, organised picnics along with some English people. The\r\nprofit which he had made by reselling some pictures tempted him to take\r\nup the fine arts as a commercial speculation. Then, he became infatuated\r\nabout pottery. Just now other branches of commerce attracted him; and,\r\nas he had become more and more vulgarised, he contracted coarse and\r\nextravagant habits. It was not so much for his vices she had to reproach\r\nhim as for his entire conduct. No change could be expected in him, and\r\nher unhappiness was irreparable.\r\n\r\nFrederick declared that his own life in the same way was a failure.\r\n\r\nHe was still a young man, however. Why should he despair? And she gave\r\nhim good advice: "Work! and marry!" He answered her with bitter smiles;\r\nfor in place of giving utterance to the real cause of his grief, he\r\npretended that it was of a different character, a sublime feeling, and\r\nhe assumed the part of an Antony to some extent, the man accursed by\r\nfate--language which did not, however, change very materially the\r\ncomplexion of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nFor certain men action becomes more difficult as desire becomes\r\nstronger. They are embarrassed by self-distrust, and terrified by the\r\nfear of making themselves disliked. Besides, deep attachments resemble\r\nvirtuous women: they are afraid of being discovered, and pass through\r\nlife with downcast eyes.\r\n\r\nThough he was now better acquainted with Madame Arnoux (for that very\r\nreason perhaps), he was still more faint-hearted than before. Each\r\nmorning he swore in his own mind that he would take a bold course. He\r\nwas prevented from doing so by an unconquerable feeling of bashfulness;\r\nand he had no example to guide him, inasmuch as she was different from\r\nother women. From the force of his dreams, he had placed her outside the\r\nordinary pale of humanity. At her side he felt himself of less\r\nimportance in the world than the sprigs of silk that escaped from her\r\nscissors.\r\n\r\nThen he thought of some monstrous and absurd devices, such as surprises\r\nat night, with narcotics and false keys--anything appearing easier to\r\nhim than to face her disdain.\r\n\r\nBesides, the children, the two servant-maids, and the relative position\r\nof the rooms caused insurmountable obstacles. So then he made up his\r\nmind to possess her himself alone, and to bring her to live with him\r\nfar away in the depths of some solitude. He even asked himself what lake\r\nwould be blue enough, what seashore would be delightful enough for her,\r\nwhether it would be in Spain, Switzerland, or the East; and expressly\r\nfixing on days when she seemed more irritated than usual, he told her\r\nthat it would be necessary for her to leave the house, to find out some\r\nground to justify such a step, and that he saw no way out of it but a\r\nseparation. However, for the sake of the children whom she loved, she\r\nwould never resort to such an extreme course. So much virtue served to\r\nincrease his respect for her.\r\n\r\nHe spent each afternoon in recalling the visit he had paid the night\r\nbefore, and in longing for the evening to come in order that he might\r\ncall again. When he did not dine with them, he posted himself about nine\r\no\'clock at the corner of the street, and, as soon as Arnoux had slammed\r\nthe hall-door behind him, Frederick quickly ascended the two flights of\r\nstairs, and asked the servant-girl in an ingenuous fashion:\r\n\r\n"Is Monsieur in?"\r\n\r\nThen he would exhibit surprise at finding that Arnoux was gone out.\r\n\r\nThe latter frequently came back unexpectedly. Then Frederick had to\r\naccompany him to the little caf\xe9 in the Rue Sainte-Anne, which Regimbart\r\nnow frequented.\r\n\r\nThe Citizen began by giving vent to some fresh grievance which he had\r\nagainst the Crown. Then they would chat, pouring out friendly abuse on\r\none another, for the earthenware manufacturer took Regimbart for a\r\nthinker of a high order, and, vexed at seeing him neglecting so many\r\nchances of winning distinction, teased the Citizen about his laziness.\r\nIt seemed to Regimbart that Arnoux was a man full of heart and\r\nimagination, but decidedly of lax morals, and therefore he was quite\r\nunceremonious towards a personage he respected so little, refusing even\r\nto dine at his house on the ground that "such formality was a bore."\r\n\r\nSometimes, at the moment of parting, Arnoux would be seized with hunger.\r\nHe found it necessary to order an omelet or some roasted apples; and, as\r\nthere was never anything to eat in the establishment, he sent out for\r\nsomething. They waited. Regimbart did not leave, and ended by consenting\r\nin a grumbling fashion to have something himself. He was nevertheless\r\ngloomy, for he remained for hours seated before a half-filled glass. As\r\nProvidence did not regulate things in harmony with his ideas, he was\r\nbecoming a hypochondriac, no longer cared even to read the newspapers,\r\nand at the mere mention of England\'s name began to bellow with rage. On\r\none occasion, referring to a waiter who attended on him carelessly, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Have we not enough of insults from the foreigner?"\r\n\r\nExcept at these critical periods he remained taciturn, contemplating "an\r\ninfallible stroke of business that would burst up the whole shop."\r\n\r\nWhilst he was lost in these reflections, Arnoux in a monotonous voice\r\nand with a slight look of intoxication, related incredible anecdotes in\r\nwhich he always shone himself, owing to his assurance; and Frederick\r\n(this was, no doubt, due to some deep-rooted resemblances) felt more or\r\nless attracted towards him. He reproached himself for this weakness,\r\nbelieving that on the contrary he ought to hate this man.\r\n\r\nArnoux, in Frederick\'s presence, complained of his wife\'s ill-temper,\r\nher obstinacy, her unjust accusations. She had not been like this in\r\nformer days.\r\n\r\n"If I were you," said Frederick, "I would make her an allowance and live\r\nalone."\r\n\r\nArnoux made no reply; and the next moment he began to sound her praises.\r\nShe was good, devoted, intelligent, and virtuous; and, passing to her\r\npersonal beauty, he made some revelations on the subject with the\r\nthoughtlessness of people who display their treasures at taverns.\r\n\r\nHis equilibrium was disturbed by a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nHe had been appointed one of the Board of Superintendence in a kaolin\r\ncompany. But placing reliance on everything that he was told, he had\r\nsigned inaccurate reports and approved, without verification, of the\r\nannual inventories fraudulently prepared by the manager. The company had\r\nnow failed, and Arnoux, being legally responsible, was, along with the\r\nothers who were liable under the guaranty, condemned to pay damages,\r\nwhich meant a loss to him of thirty thousand francs, not to speak of the\r\ncosts of the judgment.\r\n\r\nFrederick read the report of the case in a newspaper, and at once\r\nhurried off to the Rue de Paradis.\r\n\r\nHe was ushered into Madame\'s apartment. It was breakfast-time. A round\r\ntable close to the fire was covered with bowls of _caf\xe9 au lait_.\r\nSlippers trailed over the carpet, and clothes over the armchairs. Arnoux\r\nwas attired in trousers and a knitted vest, with his eyes bloodshot and\r\nhis hair in disorder. Little Eug\xe8ne was crying at the pain caused by an\r\nattack of mumps, while nibbling at a slice of bread and butter. His\r\nsister was eating quietly. Madame Arnoux, a little paler than usual, was\r\nattending on all three of them.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Arnoux, heaving a deep sigh, "you know all about it?"\r\n\r\nAnd, as Frederick gave him a pitying look: "There, you see, I have been\r\nthe victim of my own trustfulness!"\r\n\r\nThen he relapsed into silence, and so great was his prostration, that he\r\npushed his breakfast away from him. Madame Arnoux raised her eyes with a\r\nshrug of the shoulders. He passed his hand across his forehead.\r\n\r\n"After all, I am not guilty. I have nothing to reproach myself with.\r\n\'Tis a misfortune. It will be got over--ay, and so much the worse,\r\nfaith!"\r\n\r\nHe took a bite of a cake, however, in obedience to his wife\'s\r\nentreaties.\r\n\r\nThat evening, he wished that she should go and dine with him alone in a\r\nprivate room at the Maison d\'Or. Madame Arnoux did not at all understand\r\nthis emotional impulse, taking offence, in fact, at being treated as if\r\nshe were a light woman. Arnoux, on the contrary, meant it as a proof of\r\naffection. Then, as he was beginning to feel dull, he went to pay the\r\nMar\xe9chale a visit in order to amuse himself.\r\n\r\nUp to the present, he had been pardoned for many things owing to his\r\nreputation for good-fellowship. His lawsuit placed him amongst men of\r\nbad character. No one visited his house.\r\n\r\nFrederick, however, considered that he was bound in honour to go there\r\nmore frequently than ever. He hired a box at the Italian opera, and\r\nbrought them there with him every week. Meanwhile, the pair had reached\r\nthat period in unsuitable unions when an invincible lassitude springs\r\nfrom concessions which people get into the habit of making, and which\r\nrender existence intolerable. Madame Arnoux restrained her pent-up\r\nfeelings from breaking out; Arnoux became gloomy; and Frederick grew sad\r\nat witnessing the unhappiness of these two ill-fated beings.\r\n\r\nShe had imposed on him the obligation, since she had given him her\r\nconfidence, of making enquiries as to the state of her husband\'s\r\naffairs. But shame prevented him from doing so. It was painful to him to\r\nreflect that he coveted the wife of this man, at whose dinner-table he\r\nconstantly sat. Nevertheless, he continued his visits, excusing himself\r\non the ground that he was bound to protect her, and that an occasion\r\nmight present itself for being of service to her.\r\n\r\nEight days after the ball, he had paid a visit to M. Dambreuse. The\r\nfinancier had offered him twenty shares in a coal-mining speculation;\r\nFrederick did not go back there again. Deslauriers had written letters\r\nto him, which he left unanswered. Pellerin had invited him to go and see\r\nthe portrait; he always put it off. He gave way, however, to Cisy\'s\r\npersistent appeals to be introduced to Rosanette.\r\n\r\nShe received him very nicely, but without springing on his neck as she\r\nused to do formerly. His comrade was delighted at being received by a\r\nwoman of easy virtue, and above all at having a chat with an actor.\r\nDelmar was there when he called. A drama in which he appeared as a\r\npeasant lecturing Louis XIV. and prophesying the events of \'89 had made\r\nhim so conspicuous, that the same part was continually assigned to him;\r\nand now his function consisted of attacks on the monarchs of all\r\nnations. As an English brewer, he inveighed against Charles I.; as a\r\nstudent at Salamanca, he cursed Philip II.; or, as a sensitive father,\r\nhe expressed indignation against the Pompadour--this was the most\r\nbeautiful bit of acting! The brats of the street used to wait at the\r\ndoor leading to the side-scenes in order to see him; and his biography,\r\nsold between the acts, described him as taking care of his aged mother,\r\nreading the Bible, assisting the poor, in fact, under the aspect of a\r\nSaint Vincent de Paul together with a dash of Brutus and Mirabeau.\r\nPeople spoke of him as "Our Delmar." He had a mission; he became another\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nAll this had fascinated Rosanette; and she had got rid of P\xe8re Oudry,\r\nwithout caring one jot about consequences, as she was not of a covetous\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nArnoux, who knew her, had taken advantage of the state of affairs for\r\nsome time past to spend very little money on her. M. Roque had appeared\r\non the scene, and all three of them carefully avoided anything like a\r\ncandid explanation. Then, fancying that she had got rid of the other\r\nsolely on his account, Arnoux increased her allowance, for she was\r\nliving at a very expensive rate. She had even sold her cashmere in her\r\nanxiety to pay off her old debts, as she said; and he was continually\r\ngiving her money, while she bewitched him and imposed upon him\r\npitilessly. Therefore, bills and stamped paper rained all over the\r\nhouse. Frederick felt that a crisis was approaching.\r\n\r\nOne day he called to see Madame Arnoux. She had gone out. Monsieur was\r\nat work below stairs in the shop. In fact, Arnoux, in the midst of his\r\nJapanese vases, was trying to take in a newly-married pair who happened\r\nto be well-to-do people from the provinces. He talked about\r\nwheel-moulding and fine-moulding, about spotted porcelain and glazed\r\nporcelain; the others, not wishing to appear utterly ignorant of the\r\nsubject, listened with nods of approbation, and made purchases.\r\n\r\nWhen the customers had gone out, he told Frederick that he had that very\r\nmorning been engaged in a little altercation with his wife. In order to\r\nobviate any remarks about expense, he had declared that the Mar\xe9chale\r\nwas no longer his mistress. "I even told her that she was yours."\r\n\r\nFrederick was annoyed at this; but to utter reproaches might only betray\r\nhim. He faltered: "Ah! you were in the wrong--greatly in the wrong!"\r\n\r\n"What does that signify?" said Arnoux. "Where is the disgrace of passing\r\nfor her lover? I am really so myself. Would you not be flattered at\r\nbeing in that position?"\r\n\r\nHad she spoken? Was this a hint? Frederick hastened to reply:\r\n\r\n"No! not at all! on the contrary!"\r\n\r\n"Well, what then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, \'tis true; it makes no difference so far as that\'s concerned."\r\n\r\nArnoux next asked: "And why don\'t you call there oftener?"\r\n\r\nFrederick promised that he would make it his business to go there again.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I forgot! you ought, when talking about Rosanette, to let out in\r\nsome way to my wife that you are her lover. I can\'t suggest how you can\r\nbest do it, but you\'ll find out that. I ask this of you as a special\r\nfavour--eh?"\r\n\r\nThe young man\'s only answer was an equivocal grimace. This calumny had\r\nundone him. He even called on her that evening, and swore that Arnoux\'s\r\naccusation was false.\r\n\r\n"Is that really so?"\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be speaking sincerely, and, when she had taken a long\r\nbreath of relief, she said to him:\r\n\r\n"I believe you," with a beautiful smile. Then she hung down her head,\r\nand, without looking at him:\r\n\r\n"Besides, nobody has any claim on you!"\r\n\r\nSo then she had divined nothing; and she despised him, seeing that she\r\ndid not think he could love her well enough to remain faithful to her!\r\nFrederick, forgetting his overtures while with the other, looked on the\r\npermission accorded to him as an insult to himself.\r\n\r\nAfter this she suggested that he ought now and then to pay Rosanette a\r\nvisit, to get a little glimpse of what she was like.\r\n\r\nArnoux presently made his appearance, and, five minutes later, wished to\r\ncarry him off to Rosanette\'s abode.\r\n\r\nThe situation was becoming intolerable.\r\n\r\nHis attention was diverted by a letter from a notary, who was going to\r\nsend him fifteen thousand francs the following day; and, in order to\r\nmake up for his neglect of Deslauriers, he went forthwith to tell him\r\nthis good news.\r\n\r\nThe advocate was lodging in the Rue des Trois-Maries, on the fifth\r\nfloor, over a courtyard. His study, a little tiled apartment, chilly,\r\nand with a grey paper on the walls, had as its principal decoration a\r\ngold medal, the prize awarded him on the occasion of taking out his\r\ndegree as a Doctor of Laws, which was fixed in an ebony frame near the\r\nmirror. A mahogany bookcase enclosed under its glass front a hundred\r\nvolumes, more or less. The writing-desk, covered with sheep-leather,\r\noccupied the centre of the apartment. Four old armchairs upholstered in\r\ngreen velvet were placed in the corners; and a heap of shavings made a\r\nblaze in the fireplace, where there was always a bundle of sticks ready\r\nto be lighted as soon as he rang the bell. It was his consultation-hour,\r\nand the advocate had on a white cravat.\r\n\r\nThe announcement as to the fifteen thousand francs (he had, no doubt,\r\ngiven up all hope of getting the amount) made him chuckle with delight.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, old fellow, that\'s right--that\'s quite right!"\r\n\r\nHe threw some wood into the fire, sat down again, and immediately began\r\ntalking about the journal. The first thing to do was to get rid of\r\nHussonnet.\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite tired of that idiot! As for officially professing opinions,\r\nmy own notion is that the most equitable and forcible position is to\r\nhave no opinions at all."\r\n\r\nFrederick appeared astonished.\r\n\r\n"Why, the thing is perfectly plain. It is time that politics should be\r\ndealt with scientifically. The old men of the eighteenth century began\r\nit when Rousseau and the men of letters introduced into the political\r\nsphere philanthropy, poetry, and other fudge, to the great delight of\r\nthe Catholics--a natural alliance, however, since the modern reformers\r\n(I can prove it) all believe in Revelation. But, if you sing high masses\r\nfor Poland, if, in place of the God of the Dominicans, who was an\r\nexecutioner, you take the God of the Romanticists, who is an\r\nupholsterer, if, in fact, you have not a wider conception of the\r\nAbsolute than your ancestors, Monarchy will penetrate underneath your\r\nRepublican forms, and your red cap will never be more than the headpiece\r\nof a priest. The only difference will be that the cell system will take\r\nthe place of torture, the outrageous treatment of Religion that of\r\nsacrilege, and the European Concert that of the Holy Alliance; and in\r\nthis beautiful order which we admire, composed of the wreckage of the\r\nfollowers of Louis XIV., the last remains of the Voltaireans, with some\r\nImperial white-wash on top, and some fragments of the British\r\nConstitution, you will see the municipal councils trying to give\r\nannoyance to the Mayor, the general councils to their Prefect, the\r\nChambers to the King, the Press to Power, and the Administration to\r\neverybody. But simple-minded people get enraptured about the Civil Code,\r\na work fabricated--let them say what they like--in a mean and tyrannical\r\nspirit, for the legislator, in place of doing his duty to the State,\r\nwhich simply means to observe customs in a regular fashion, claims to\r\nmodel society like another Lycurgus. Why does the law impede fathers of\r\nfamilies with regard to the making of wills? Why does it place shackles\r\non the compulsory sale of real estate? Why does it punish as a\r\nmisdemeanour vagrancy, which ought not even to be regarded as a\r\ntechnical contravention of the Code. And there are other things! I know\r\nall about them! and so I am going to write a little novel, entitled\r\n\'The History of the Idea of Justice,\' which will be amusing. But I am\r\ninfernally thirsty! And you?"\r\n\r\nHe leaned out through the window, and called to the porter to go and\r\nfetch them two glasses of grog from the public-house over the way.\r\n\r\n"To sum up, I see three parties--no! three groups--in none of which do I\r\ntake the slightest interest: those who have, those who have nothing, and\r\nthose who are trying to have. But all agree in their idiotic worship of\r\nAuthority! For example, Mably recommends that the philosophers should be\r\nprevented from publishing their doctrines; M. Wronsky, the geometrician,\r\ndescribes the censorship as the \'critical expression of speculative\r\nspontaneity\'; P\xe8re Enfantin gives his blessing to the Hapsburgs for\r\nhaving passed a hand across the Alps in order to keep Italy down; Pierre\r\nLeroux wishes people to be compelled to listen to an orator; and Louis\r\nBlanc inclines towards a State religion--so much rage for government\r\nhave these vassals whom we call the people! Nevertheless, there is not a\r\nsingle legitimate government, in spite of their sempiternal principles.\r\nBut \'principle\' signifies \'origin.\' It is always necessary to go back to\r\na revolution, to an act of violence, to a transitory fact. Thus, our\r\nprinciple is the national sovereignty embodied in the Parliamentary\r\nform, though the Parliament does not assent to this! But in what way\r\ncould the sovereignty of the people be more sacred than the Divine\r\nRight? They are both fictions. Enough of metaphysics; no more phantoms!\r\nThere is no need of dogmas in order to get the streets swept! It will be\r\nsaid that I am turning society upside down. Well, after all, where would\r\nbe the harm of that? It is, indeed, a nice thing--this society of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\nFrederick could have given many answers. But, seeing that his theories\r\nwere far less advanced than those of S\xe9n\xe9cal, he was full of indulgence\r\ntowards Deslauriers. He contented himself with arguing that such a\r\nsystem would make them generally hated.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, as we should have given to each party a pledge of\r\nhatred against his neighbour, all will reckon on us. You are about to\r\nenter into it yourself, and to furnish us with some transcendent\r\ncriticism!"\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to attack accepted ideas--the Academy, the Normal\r\nSchool, the Cons\xe9rvatoire, the Com\xe9die Fran\xe7aise, everything that\r\nresembled an institution. It was in that way that they would give\r\nuniformity to the doctrines taught in their review. Then, as soon as it\r\nhad been thoroughly well-established, the journal would suddenly be\r\nconverted into a daily publication. Thereupon they could find fault with\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n"And they will respect us, you may be sure!"\r\n\r\nDeslauriers touched upon that old dream of his--the position of\r\neditor-in-chief, so that he might have the unutterable happiness of\r\ndirecting others, of entirely cutting down their articles, of ordering\r\nthem to be written or declining them. His eyes twinkled under his\r\ngoggles; he got into a state of excitement, and drank a few glasses of\r\nbrandy, one after the other, in an automatic fashion.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to stand me a dinner once a week. That\'s indispensable,\r\neven though you should have to squander half your income on it. People\r\nwould feel pleasure in going to it; it would be a centre for the\r\nothers, a lever for yourself; and by manipulating public opinion at its\r\ntwo ends--literature and politics--you will see how, before six months\r\nhave passed, we shall occupy the first rank in Paris."\r\n\r\nFrederick, as he listened to Deslauriers, experienced a sensation of\r\nrejuvenescence, like a man who, after having been confined in a room for\r\na long time, is suddenly transported into the open air. The enthusiasm\r\nof his friend had a contagious effect upon him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have been an idler, an imbecile--you are right!"\r\n\r\n"All in good time," said Deslauriers. "I have found my Frederick again!"\r\n\r\nAnd, holding up his jaw with closed fingers:\r\n\r\n"Ah! you have made me suffer! Never mind, I am fond of you all the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\nThey stood there gazing into each other\'s faces, both deeply affected,\r\nand were on the point of embracing each other.\r\n\r\nA woman\'s cap appeared on the threshold of the anteroom.\r\n\r\n"What brings you here?" said Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nIt was Mademoiselle Cl\xe9mence, his mistress.\r\n\r\nShe replied that, as she happened to be passing, she could not resist\r\nthe desire to go in to see him, and in order that they might have a\r\nlittle repast together, she had brought some cakes, which she laid on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Take care of my papers!" said the advocate, sharply. "Besides,\r\nthis is the third time that I have forbidden you to come at my\r\nconsultation-hours."\r\n\r\nShe wished to embrace him.\r\n\r\n"All right! Go away! Cut your stick!"\r\n\r\nHe repelled her; she heaved a great sigh.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are plaguing me again!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis because I love you!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask you to love me, but to oblige me!"\r\n\r\nThis harsh remark stopped Cl\xe9mence\'s tears. She took up her station\r\nbefore the window, and remained there motionless, with her forehead\r\nagainst the pane.\r\n\r\nHer attitude and her silence had an irritating effect on Deslauriers.\r\n\r\n"When you have finished, you will order your carriage, will you not?"\r\n\r\nShe turned round with a start.\r\n\r\n"You are sending me away?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\nShe fixed on him her large blue eyes, no doubt as a last appeal, then\r\ndrew the two ends of her tartan across each other, lingered for a minute\r\nor two, and went away.\r\n\r\n"You ought to call her back," said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Come, now!"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he wished to go out, Deslauriers went into the kitchen, which\r\nalso served as his dressing-room. On the stone floor, beside a pair of\r\nboots, were to be seen the remains of a meagre breakfast, and a mattress\r\nwith a coverlid was rolled up on the floor in a corner.\r\n\r\n"This will show you," said he, "that I receive few marchionesses. \'Tis\r\neasy to get enough of them, ay, faith! and some others, too! Those who\r\ncost nothing take up your time--\'tis money under another form. Now, I\'m\r\nnot rich! And then they are all so silly, so silly! Can you chat with a\r\nwoman yourself?"\r\n\r\nAs they parted, at the corner of the Pont Neuf, Deslauriers said: "It\'s\r\nagreed, then; you\'ll bring the thing to me to-morrow as soon as you have\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Agreed!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke next morning, he received through the post a cheque on the\r\nbank for fifteen thousand francs.\r\n\r\nThis scrap of paper represented to him fifteen big bags of money; and he\r\nsaid to himself that, with such a sum he could, first of all, keep his\r\ncarriage for three years instead of selling it, as he would soon be\r\nforced to do, or buy for himself two beautiful damaskeened pieces of\r\narmour, which he had seen on the Quai Voltaire, then a quantity of other\r\nthings, pictures, books and what a quantity of bouquets of flowers,\r\npresents for Madame Arnoux! anything, in short, would have been\r\npreferable to risking losing everything in that journal! Deslauriers\r\nseemed to him presumptuous, his insensibility on the night before having\r\nchilled Frederick\'s affection for him; and the young man was indulging\r\nin these feelings of regret, when he was quite surprised by the sudden\r\nappearance of Arnoux, who sat down heavily on the side of the bed, like\r\na man overwhelmed with trouble.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter now?"\r\n\r\n"I am ruined!"\r\n\r\nHe had to deposit that very day at the office of Ma\xeetre Beaumont,\r\nnotary, in the Rue Saint-Anne, eighteen thousand francs lent him by one\r\nVanneroy.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis an unaccountable disaster. I have, however, given him a mortgage,\r\nwhich ought to keep him quiet. But he threatens me with a writ if it is\r\nnot paid this afternoon promptly."\r\n\r\n"And what next?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! the next step is simple enough; he will take possession of my real\r\nestate. Once the thing is publicly announced, it means ruin to\r\nme--that\'s all! Ah! if I could find anyone to advance me this cursed\r\nsum, he might take Vanneroy\'s place, and I should be saved! You don\'t\r\nchance to have it yourself?"\r\n\r\nThe cheque had remained on the night-table near a book. Frederick took\r\nup a volume, and placed it on the cheque, while he replied:\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, my dear friend, no!"\r\n\r\nBut it was painful to him to say "no" to Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"What, don\'t you know anyone who would----?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody! and to think that in eight days I should be getting in money!\r\nThere is owing to me probably fifty thousand francs at the end of the\r\nmonth!"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you ask some of the persons that owe you money to make you an\r\nadvance?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, so I did!"\r\n\r\n"But have you any bills or promissory notes?"\r\n\r\n"Not one!"\r\n\r\n"What is to be done?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'m asking myself," said Arnoux. "\'Tisn\'t for myself, my\r\nGod! but for my children and my poor wife!"\r\n\r\nThen, letting each phrase fall from his lips in a broken fashion:\r\n\r\n"In fact--I could rough it--I could pack off all I have--and go and seek\r\nmy fortune--I don\'t know where!"\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" exclaimed Frederick.\r\n\r\nArnoux replied with an air of calmness:\r\n\r\n"How do you think I could live in Paris now?"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Frederick broke it by saying:\r\n\r\n"When could you pay back this money?"\r\n\r\nNot that he had it; quite the contrary! But there was nothing to prevent\r\nhim from seeing some friends, and making an application to them.\r\n\r\nAnd he rang for his servant to get himself dressed.\r\n\r\nArnoux thanked him.\r\n\r\n"The amount you want is eighteen thousand francs--isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I could manage easily with sixteen thousand! For I could make two\r\nthousand five hundred out of it, or get three thousand on my silver\r\nplate, if Vanneroy meanwhile would give me till to-morrow; and, I repeat\r\nto you, you may inform the lender, give him a solemn undertaking, that\r\nin eight days, perhaps even in five or six, the money will be\r\nreimbursed. Besides, the mortgage will be security for it. So there is\r\nno risk, you understand?"\r\n\r\nFrederick assured him that he thoroughly understood the state of\r\naffairs, and added that he was going out immediately.\r\n\r\nHe would be sure on his return to bestow hearty maledictions on\r\nDeslauriers, for he wished to keep his word, and in the meantime, to\r\noblige Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I applied to M. Dambreuse? But on what pretext could I ask for\r\nmoney? \'Tis I, on the contrary, that should give him some for the shares\r\nI took in his coal-mining company. Ah! let him go hang himself--his\r\nshares! I am really not liable for them!"\r\n\r\nAnd Frederick applauded himself for his own independence, as if he had\r\nrefused to do some service for M. Dambreuse.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well," said he to himself afterwards, "since I\'m going to meet with\r\na loss in this way--for with fifteen thousand francs I might gain a\r\nhundred thousand! such things sometimes happen on the Bourse--well,\r\nthen, since I am breaking my promise to one of them, am I not free?\r\nBesides, when Deslauriers might wait? No, no; that\'s wrong; let us go\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n"Ah! there\'s no hurry. The bank does not close till five o\'clock."\r\n\r\nAnd, at half-past four, when he had cashed the cheque:\r\n\r\n"\'Tis useless now; I should not find him in. I\'ll go this evening." Thus\r\ngiving himself the opportunity of changing his mind, for there always\r\nremain in the conscience some of those sophistries which we pour into it\r\nourselves. It preserves the after-taste of them, like some unwholesome\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nHe walked along the boulevards, and dined alone at the restaurant. Then\r\nhe listened to one act of a play at the Vaudeville, in order to divert\r\nhis thoughts. But his bank-notes caused him as much embarrassment as if\r\nhe had stolen them. He would not have been very sorry if he had lost\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home again he found a letter containing these words:\r\n\r\n"What news? My wife joins me, dear friend, in the hope, etc.--Yours."\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a flourish after his signature.\r\n\r\n"His wife! She appeals to me!"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Arnoux appeared, to have an answer as to whether he\r\nhad been able to obtain the sum so sorely needed.\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment; here it is," said Frederick.\r\n\r\nAnd, twenty-four hours later, he gave this reply to Deslauriers:\r\n\r\n"I have no money."\r\n\r\nThe advocate came back three days, one after the other, and urged\r\nFrederick to write to the notary. He even offered to take a trip to\r\nHavre in connection with the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week, Frederick timidly asked the worthy Arnoux for\r\nhis fifteen thousand francs. Arnoux put it off till the following day,\r\nand then till the day after. Frederick ventured out late at night,\r\nfearing lest Deslauriers might come on him by surprise.\r\n\r\nOne evening, somebody knocked against him at the corner of the\r\nMadeleine. It was he.\r\n\r\nAnd Deslauriers accompanied Frederick as far as the door of a house in\r\nthe Faubourg Poissonni\xe8re.\r\n\r\n"Wait for me!"\r\n\r\nHe waited. At last, after three quarters of an hour, Frederick came out,\r\naccompanied by Arnoux, and made signs to him to have patience a little\r\nlonger. The earthenware merchant and his companion went up the Rue de\r\nHauteville arm-in-arm, and then turned down the Rue de Chabrol.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, with gusts of tepid wind. Arnoux walked on slowly,\r\ntalking about the Galleries of Commerce--a succession of covered\r\npassages which would have led from the Boulevard Saint-Denis to the\r\nCh\xe2telet, a marvellous speculation, into which he was very anxious to\r\nenter; and he stopped from time to time in order to have a look at the\r\ngrisettes\' faces in front of the shop-windows, and then, raising his\r\nhead again, resumed the thread of his discourse.\r\n\r\nFrederick heard Deslauriers\' steps behind him like reproaches, like\r\nblows falling on his conscience. But he did not venture to claim his\r\nmoney, through a feeling of bashfulness, and also through a fear that\r\nit would be fruitless. The other was drawing nearer. He made up his mind\r\nto ask.\r\n\r\nArnoux, in a very flippant tone, said that, as he had not got in his\r\noutstanding debts, he was really unable to pay back the fifteen thousand\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n"You have no need of money, I fancy?"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Deslauriers came up to Frederick, and, taking him aside:\r\n\r\n"Be honest. Have you got the amount? Yes or no?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, no," said Frederick; "I\'ve lost it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! and in what way?"\r\n\r\n"At play."\r\n\r\nDeslauriers, without saying a single word in reply, made a very low bow,\r\nand went away. Arnoux had taken advantage of the opportunity to light a\r\ncigar in a tobacconist\'s shop. When he came back, he wanted to know from\r\nFrederick "who was that young man?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! nobody--a friend."\r\n\r\nThen, three minutes later, in front of Rosanette\'s door:\r\n\r\n"Come on up," said Arnoux; "she\'ll be glad to see you. What a savage you\r\nare just now!"\r\n\r\nA gas-lamp, which was directly opposite, threw its light on him; and,\r\nwith his cigar between his white teeth and his air of contentment, there\r\nwas something intolerable about him.\r\n\r\n"Ha! now that I think of it, my notary has been at your place this\r\nmorning about that mortgage-registry business. \'Tis my wife reminded me\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"A wife with brains!" returned Frederick automatically.\r\n\r\n"I believe you."\r\n\r\nAnd once more Arnoux began to sing his wife\'s praises. There was no one\r\nlike her for spirit, tenderness, and thrift; he added in a low tone,\r\nrolling his eyes about: "And a woman with so many charms, too!"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\nArnoux made a step closer to him.\r\n\r\n"Hold on! Why are you going?" And, with his hand half-stretched out\r\ntowards Frederick, he stared at the young man, quite abashed by the look\r\nof anger in his face.\r\n\r\nFrederick repeated in a dry tone, "Good-bye!"\r\n\r\nHe hurried down the Rue de Br\xe9da like a stone rolling headlong, raging\r\nagainst Arnoux, swearing in his own mind that he would never see the man\r\nagain, nor her either, so broken-hearted and desolate did he feel. In\r\nplace of the rupture which he had anticipated, here was the other, on\r\nthe contrary, exhibiting towards her a most perfect attachment from the\r\nends of her hair to the inmost depths of her soul. Frederick was\r\nexasperated by the vulgarity of this man. Everything, then, belonged to\r\nhim! He would meet Arnoux again at his mistress\'s door; and the\r\nmortification of a rupture would be added to rage at his own\r\npowerlessness. Besides, he felt humiliated by the other\'s display of\r\nintegrity in offering him guaranties for his money. He would have liked\r\nto strangle him, and over the pangs of disappointment floated in his\r\nconscience, like a fog, the sense of his baseness towards his friend.\r\nRising tears nearly suffocated him.\r\n\r\nDeslauriers descended the Rue des Martyrs, swearing aloud with\r\nindignation; for his project, like an obelisk that has fallen, now\r\nassumed extraordinary proportions. He considered himself robbed, as if\r\nhe had suffered a great loss. His friendship for Frederick was dead, and\r\nhe experienced a feeling of joy at it--it was a sort of compensation to\r\nhim! A hatred of all rich people took possession of him. He leaned\r\ntowards S\xe9n\xe9cal\'s opinions, and resolved to make every effort to\r\npropagate them.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Arnoux was comfortably seated in an easy-chair near the\r\nfire, sipping his cup of tea, with the Mar\xe9chale on his knees.\r\n\r\nFrederick did not go back there; and, in order to distract his attention\r\nfrom his disastrous passion, he determined to write a "History of the\r\nRenaissance." He piled up confusedly on his table the humanists, the\r\nphilosophers, and the poets, and he went to inspect some engravings of\r\nMark Antony, and tried to understand Machiavelli. Gradually, the\r\nserenity of intellectual work had a soothing effect upon him. While his\r\nmind was steeped in the personality of others, he lost sight of his\r\nown--which is the only way, perhaps, of getting rid of suffering.\r\n\r\nOne day, while he was quietly taking notes, the door opened, and the\r\nman-servant announced Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\nIt was she, indeed! and alone? Why, no! for she was holding little\r\nEug\xe8ne by the hand, followed by a nurse in a white apron. She sat down,\r\nand after a preliminary cough:\r\n\r\n"It is a long time since you came to see us."\r\n\r\nAs Frederick could think of no excuse at the moment, she added:\r\n\r\n"It was delicacy on your part!"\r\n\r\nHe asked in return:\r\n\r\n"Delicacy about what?"\r\n\r\n"About what you have done for Arnoux!" said she.\r\n\r\nFrederick made a significant gesture. "What do I care about him, indeed?\r\nIt was for your sake I did it!"\r\n\r\nShe sent off the child to play with his nurse in the drawing-room. Two\r\nor three words passed between them as to their state of health; then the\r\nconversation hung fire.\r\n\r\nShe wore a brown silk gown, which had the colour of Spanish wine, with a\r\npaletot of black velvet bordered with sable. This fur made him yearn to\r\npass his hand over it; and her head-bands, so long and so exquisitely\r\nsmooth, seemed to draw his lips towards them. But he was agitated by\r\nemotion, and, turning his eyes towards the door:\r\n\r\n"\'Tis rather warm here!"\r\n\r\nFrederick understood what her discreet glance meant.\r\n\r\n"Ah! excuse me! the two leaves of the door are merely drawn together."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s true!"\r\n\r\nAnd she smiled, as much as to say:\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a bit afraid!"\r\n\r\nHe asked her presently what was the object of her visit.\r\n\r\n"My husband," she replied with an effort, "has urged me to call on you,\r\nnot venturing to take this step himself!"\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"You know M. Dambreuse, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, slightly."\r\n\r\n"Ah! slightly."\r\n\r\nShe relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n"No matter! finish what you were going to say."\r\n\r\nThereupon she told him that, two days before, Arnoux had found himself\r\nunable to meet four bills of a thousand francs, made payable at the\r\nbanker\'s order and with his signature attached to them. She felt sorry\r\nfor having compromised her children\'s fortune. But anything was\r\npreferable to dishonour; and, if M. Dambreuse stopped the proceedings,\r\nthey would certainly pay him soon, for she was going to sell a little\r\nhouse which she had at Chartres.\r\n\r\n"Poor woman!" murmured Frederick. "I will go. Rely on me!"\r\n\r\n"Thanks!"\r\n\r\nAnd she arose to go.\r\n\r\n"Oh! there is nothing to hurry you yet."\r\n\r\nShe remained standing, examining the trophy of Mongolian arrows\r\nsuspended from the ceiling, the bookcase, the bindings, all the utensils\r\nfor writing. She lifted up the bronze bowl which held his pens. Her feet\r\nrested on different portions of the carpet. She had visited Frederick\r\nseveral times before, but always accompanied by Arnoux. They were now\r\nalone together--alone in his own house. It was an extraordinary\r\nevent--almost a successful issue of his love.\r\n\r\nShe wished to see his little garden. He offered her his arm to show her\r\nhis property--thirty feet of ground enclosed by some houses, adorned\r\nwith shrubs at the corners and flower-borders in the middle. The early\r\ndays of April had arrived. The leaves of the lilacs were already showing\r\ntheir borders of green. A breath of pure air was diffused around, and\r\nthe little birds chirped, their song alternating with the distant sound\r\nthat came from a coachmaker\'s forge.\r\n\r\nFrederick went to look for a fire-shovel; and, while they walked on side\r\nby side, the child kept making sand-pies in the walk.\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux did not believe that, as he grew older, he would have a\r\ngreat imagination; but he had a winning disposition. His sister, on the\r\nother hand, possessed a caustic humour that sometimes wounded her.\r\n\r\n"That will change," said Frederick. "We must never despair."\r\n\r\nShe returned:\r\n\r\n"We must never despair!"\r\n\r\nThis automatic repetition of the phrase he had used appeared to him a\r\nsort of encouragement; he plucked a rose, the only one in the garden.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember a certain bouquet of roses one evening, in a carriage?"\r\n\r\nShe coloured a little; and, with an air of bantering pity:\r\n\r\n"Ah, I was very young then!"\r\n\r\n"And this one," went on Frederick, in a low tone, "will it be the same\r\nway with it?"\r\n\r\nShe replied, while turning about the stem between her fingers, like the\r\nthread of a spindle:\r\n\r\n"No, I will preserve it."\r\n\r\nShe called over the nurse, who took the child in her arms; then, on the\r\nthreshold of the door in the street, Madame Arnoux inhaled the odour of\r\nthe flower, leaning her head on her shoulder with a look as sweet as a\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone up to his study, he gazed at the armchair in which she\r\nhad sat, and every object which she had touched. Some portion of her was\r\ndiffused around him. The caress of her presence lingered there still.\r\n\r\n"So, then, she came here," said he to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd his soul was bathed in the waves of infinite tenderness.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at eleven o\'clock, he presented himself at M. Dambreuse\'s\r\nhouse. He was received in the dining-room. The banker was seated\r\nopposite his wife at breakfast. Beside her sat his niece, and at the\r\nother side of the table appeared the governess, an English woman,\r\nstrongly pitted with small-pox.\r\n\r\nM. Dambreuse invited his young friend to take his place among them, and\r\nwhen he declined:\r\n\r\n"What can I do for you? I am listening to whatever you have to say to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nFrederick confessed, while affecting indifference, that he had come to\r\nmake a request in behalf of one Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! the ex-picture-dealer," said the banker, with a noiseless laugh\r\nwhich exposed his gums. "Oudry formerly gave security for him; he has\r\ngiven a lot of trouble."\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded to read the letters and newspapers which lay close\r\nbeside him on the table.\r\n\r\nTwo servants attended without making the least noise on the floor; and\r\nthe loftiness of the apartment, which had three porti\xe8res of richest\r\ntapestry, and two white marble fountains, the polish of the\r\nchafing-dish, the arrangement of the side-dishes, and even the rigid\r\nfolds of the napkins, all this sumptuous comfort impressed Frederick\'s\r\nmind with the contrast between it and another breakfast at the Arnouxs\'\r\nhouse. He did not take the liberty of interrupting M. Dambreuse.\r\n\r\nMadame noticed his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Do you occasionally see our friend Martinon?"\r\n\r\n"He will be here this evening," said the young girl in a lively tone.\r\n\r\n"Ha! so you know him?" said her aunt, fixing on her a freezing look.\r\n\r\nAt that moment one of the men-servants, bending forward, whispered in\r\nher ear.\r\n\r\n"Your dressmaker, Mademoiselle--Miss John!"\r\n\r\nAnd the governess, in obedience to this summons, left the room along\r\nwith her pupil.\r\n\r\nM. Dambreuse, annoyed at the disarrangement of the chairs by this\r\nmovement, asked what was the matter.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis Madame Regimbart."\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment! Regimbart! I know that name. I have come across his\r\nsignature."\r\n\r\nFrederick at length broached the question. Arnoux deserved some\r\nconsideration; he was even going, for the sole purpose of fulfilling his\r\nengagements, to sell a house belonging to his wife.\r\n\r\n"She is considered very pretty," said Madame Dambreuse.\r\n\r\nThe banker added, with a display of good-nature:\r\n\r\n"Are you on friendly terms with them--on intimate terms?"\r\n\r\nFrederick, without giving an explicit reply, said that he would be very\r\nmuch obliged to him if he considered the matter.\r\n\r\n"Well, since it pleases you, be it so; we will wait. I have some time to\r\nspare yet; suppose we go down to my office. Would you mind?"\r\n\r\nThey had finished breakfast. Madame Dambreuse bowed slightly towards\r\nFrederick, smiling in a singular fashion, with a mixture of politeness\r\nand irony. Frederick had no time to reflect about it, for M. Dambreuse,\r\nas soon as they were alone:\r\n\r\n"You did not come to get your shares?"\r\n\r\nAnd, without permitting him to make any excuses:\r\n\r\n"Well! well! \'tis right that you should know a little more about the\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\nHe offered Frederick a cigarette, and began his statement.\r\n\r\nThe General Union of French Coal Mines had been constituted. All that\r\nthey were waiting for was the order for its incorporation. The mere fact\r\nof the amalgamation had diminished the cost of superintendence, and of\r\nmanual labour, and increased the profits. Besides, the company had\r\nconceived a new idea, which was to interest the workmen in its\r\nundertaking. It would erect houses for them, healthful dwellings;\r\nfinally, it would constitute itself the purveyor of its _employ\xe9s_, and\r\nwould have everything supplied to them at net prices.\r\n\r\n"And they will be the gainers by it, Monsieur: there\'s true progress!\r\nthat\'s the way to reply effectively to certain Republican brawlings. We\r\nhave on our Board"--he showed the prospectus--"a peer of France, a\r\nscholar who is a member of the Institute, a retired field-officer of\r\ngenius. Such elements reassure the timid capitalists, and appeal to\r\nintelligent capitalists!"\r\n\r\nThe company would have in its favour the sanction of the State, then the\r\nrailways, the steam service, the metallurgical establishments, the gas\r\ncompanies, and ordinary households.\r\n\r\n"Thus we heat, we light, we penetrate to the very hearth of the humblest\r\nhome. But how, you will say to me, can we be sure of selling? By the aid\r\nof protective laws, dear Monsieur, and we shall get them!--that is a\r\nmatter that concerns us! For my part, however, I am a downright\r\nprohibitionist! The country before anything!"\r\n\r\nHe had been appointed a director; but he had no time to occupy himself\r\nwith certain details, amongst other things with the editing of their\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n"I find myself rather muddled with my authors. I have forgotten my\r\nGreek. I should want some one who could put my ideas into shape."\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly: "Will you be the man to perform those duties, with the\r\ntitle of general secretary?"\r\n\r\nFrederick did not know what reply to make.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is there to prevent you?"\r\n\r\nHis functions would be confined to writing a report every year for the\r\nshareholders. He would find himself day after day in communication with\r\nthe most notable men in Paris. Representing the company with the\r\nworkmen, he would ere long be worshipped by them as a natural\r\nconsequence, and by this means he would be able, later, to push him into\r\nthe General Council, and into the position of a deputy.\r\n\r\nFrederick\'s ears tingled. Whence came this goodwill? He got confused in\r\nreturning thanks. But it was not necessary, the banker said, that he\r\nshould be dependent on anyone. The best course was to take some shares,\r\n"a splendid investment besides, for your capital guarantees your\r\nposition, as your position does your capital."\r\n\r\n"About how much should it amount to?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well! whatever you please--from forty to sixty thousand francs, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\nThis sum was so trifling in M. Dambreuse\'s eyes, and his authority was\r\nso great, that the young man resolved immediately to sell a farm.\r\n\r\nHe accepted the offer. M. Dambreuse was to select one of his disengaged\r\ndays for an appointment in order to finish their arrangements.\r\n\r\n"So I can say to Jacques Arnoux----?"\r\n\r\n"Anything you like--the poor chap--anything you like!"\r\n\r\nFrederick wrote to the Arnouxs\' to make their minds easy, and he\r\ndespatched the letter by a man-servant, who brought back the letter:\r\n"All right!" His action in the matter deserved better recognition. He\r\nexpected a visit, or, at least, a letter. He did not receive a visit,\r\nand no letter arrived.\r\n\r\nWas it forgetfulness on their part, or was it intentional? Since Madame\r\nArnoux had come once, what was to prevent her from coming again? The\r\nspecies of confidence, of avowal, of which she had made him the\r\nrecipient on the occasion, was nothing better, then, than a manoeuvre\r\nwhich she had executed through interested motives.\r\n\r\n"Are they playing on me? and is she an accomplice of her husband?" A\r\nsort of shame, in spite of his desire, prevented him from returning to\r\ntheir house.\r\n\r\nOne morning (three weeks after their interview), M. Dambreuse wrote to\r\nhim, saying that he expected him the same day in an hour\'s time.\r\n\r\nOn the way, the thought of Arnoux oppressed him once more, and, not\r\nhaving been able to discover any reason for his conduct, he was seized\r\nwith a feeling of wretchedness, a melancholy presentiment. In order to\r\nshake it off, he hailed a cab, and drove to the Rue de Paradis.\r\n\r\nArnoux was away travelling.\r\n\r\n"And Madame?"\r\n\r\n"In the country, at the works."\r\n\r\n"When is Monsieur coming back?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, without fail."\r\n\r\nHe would find her alone; this was the opportune moment. Something\r\nimperious seemed to cry out in the depths of his consciousness: "Go,\r\nthen, and meet her!"\r\n\r\nBut M. Dambreuse? "Ah! well, so much the worse. I\'ll say that I was\r\nill."\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the railway-station, and, as soon as he was in the\r\ncarriage:\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have done wrong. Pshaw! what does it matter?"\r\n\r\nGreen plains stretched out to the right and to the left. The train\r\nrolled on. The little station-houses glistened like stage-scenery, and\r\nthe smoke of the locomotive kept constantly sending forth on the same\r\nside its big fleecy masses, which danced for a little while on the\r\ngrass, and were then dispersed.\r\n\r\nFrederick, who sat alone in his compartment, gazed at these objects\r\nthrough sheer weariness, lost in that languor which is produced by the\r\nvery excess of impatience. But cranes and warehouses presently appeared.\r\nThey had reached Creil.\r\n\r\nThe town, built on the slopes of two low-lying hills (the first of which\r\nwas bare, and the second crowned by a wood), with its church-tower, its\r\nhouses of unequal size, and its stone bridge, seemed to him to present\r\nan aspect of mingled gaiety, reserve, and propriety. A long flat barge\r\ndescended to the edge of the water, which leaped up under the lash of\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nFowl perched on the straw at the foot of the crucifix erected on the\r\nspot; a woman passed with some wet linen on her head.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the bridge, he found himself in an isle, where he beheld\r\non his right the ruins of an abbey. A mill with its wheels revolving\r\nbarred up the entire width of the second arm of the Oise, over which the\r\nmanufactory projected. Frederick was greatly surprised by the imposing\r\ncharacter of this structure. He felt more respect for Arnoux on account\r\nof it. Three paces further on, he turned up an alley, which had a\r\ngrating at its lower end.\r\n\r\nHe went in. The door-keeper called him back, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Have you a permit?"\r\n\r\n"For what purpose?"\r\n\r\n"For the purpose of visiting the establishment."\r\n\r\nFrederick said in a rather curt tone that he had come to see M. Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"Who is M. Arnoux?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the chief, the master, the proprietor, in fact!"\r\n\r\n"No, monsieur! These are MM. Leboeuf and Milliet\'s works!"\r\n\r\nThe good woman was surely joking! Some workmen arrived; he came up and\r\nspoke to two or three of them. They gave the same response.\r\n\r\nFrederick left the premises, staggering like a drunken man; and he had\r\nsuch a look of perplexity, that on the Pont de la Boucherie an\r\ninhabitant of the town, who was smoking his pipe, asked whether he\r\nwanted to find out anything. This man knew where Arnoux\'s manufactory\r\nwas. It was situated at Montataire.\r\n\r\nFrederick asked whether a vehicle was to be got. He was told that the\r\nonly place where he could find one was at the station. He went back\r\nthere. A shaky-looking calash, to which was yoked an old horse, with\r\ntorn harness hanging over the shafts, stood all alone in front of the\r\nluggage office. An urchin who was looking on offered to go and find P\xe8re\r\nPilon. In ten minutes\' time he came back, and announced that P\xe8re Pilon\r\nwas at his breakfast. Frederick, unable to stand this any longer, walked\r\naway. But the gates of the thoroughfare across the line were closed. He\r\nwould have to wait till two trains had passed. At last, he made a dash\r\ninto the open country.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous greenery made it look like the cover of an immense\r\nbilliard-table. The scori\xe6 of iron were ranged on both sides of the\r\ntrack, like heaps of stones. A little further on, some factory chimneys\r\nwere smoking close beside each other. In front of him, on a round\r\nhillock, stood a little turreted ch\xe2teau, with the quadrangular belfry\r\nof a church. At a lower level, long walls formed irregular lines past\r\nthe trees; and, further down again, the houses of the village spread\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey had only a single story, with staircases consisting of three steps\r\nmade of uncemented blocks. Every now and then the bell in front of a\r\ngrocery-shop could be heard tinkling. Heavy steps sank into the black\r\nmire, and a light shower was falling, which cut the pale sky with a\r\nthousand hatchings.\r\n\r\nFrederick pursued his way along the middle of the street. Then, he saw\r\non his left, at the opening of a pathway, a large wooden arch, whereon\r\nwas traced, in letters of gold, the word "Fa\xefences."\r\n\r\nIt was not without an object that Jacques Arnoux had selected the\r\nvicinity of Creil. By placing his works as close as possible to the\r\nother works (which had long enjoyed a high reputation), he had created a\r\ncertain confusion in the public mind, with a favourable result so far as\r\nhis own interests were concerned.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the building rested on the same bank of a river which\r\nflows through the meadowlands. The master\'s house, surrounded by a\r\ngarden, could be distinguished by the steps in front of it, adorned with\r\nfour vases, in which cactuses were bristling.\r\n\r\nHeaps of white clay were drying under sheds. There were others in the\r\nopen air; and in the midst of the yard stood S\xe9n\xe9cal with his\r\neverlasting blue paletot lined with red.\r\n\r\nThe ex-tutor extended towards Frederick his cold hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come to see the master? He\'s not there."\r\n\r\nFrederick, nonplussed, replied in a stupefied fashion:\r\n\r\n"I knew it." But the next moment, correcting himself:\r\n\r\n"\'Tis about a matter that concerns Madame Arnoux. Can she receive me?"\r\n\r\n"Ha! I have not seen her for the last three days," said S\xe9n\xe9cal.\r\n\r\nAnd he broke into a long string of complaints. When he accepted the post\r\nof manager, he understood that he would have been allowed to reside in\r\nParis, and not be forced to bury himself in this country district, far\r\nfrom his friends, deprived of newspapers. No matter! he had overlooked\r\nall that. But Arnoux appeared to pay no heed to his merits. He was,\r\nmoreover, shallow and retrograde--no one could be more ignorant. In\r\nplace of seeking for artistic improvements, it would have been better to\r\nintroduce firewood instead of coal and gas. The shop-keeping spirit\r\n_thrust itself in_--S\xe9n\xe9cal laid stress on the last words. In short, he\r\ndisliked his present occupation, and he all but appealed to Frederick to\r\nsay a word in his behalf in order that he might get an increase of\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\n"Make your mind easy," said the other.\r\n\r\nHe met nobody on the staircase. On the first floor, he pushed his way\r\nhead-foremost into an empty room. It was the drawing-room. He called out\r\nat the top of his voice. There was no reply. No doubt, the cook had gone\r\nout, and so had the housemaid. At length, having reached the second\r\nfloor, he pushed a door open. Madame Arnoux was alone in this room, in\r\nfront of a press with a mirror attached. The belt of her dressing-gown\r\nhung down her hips; one entire half of her hair fell in a dark wave over\r\nher right shoulder; and she had raised both arms in order to hold up her\r\nchignon with one hand and to put a pin through it with the other. She\r\nbroke into an exclamation and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThen, she came back again properly dressed. Her waist, her eyes, the\r\nrustle of her dress, her entire appearance, charmed him. Frederick felt\r\nit hard to keep from covering her with kisses.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said she, "but I could not----"\r\n\r\nHe had the boldness to interrupt her with these words:\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless--you looked very nice--just now."\r\n\r\nShe probably thought this compliment a little coarse, for her cheeks\r\nreddened. He was afraid that he might have offended her. She went on:\r\n\r\n"What lucky chance has brought you here?"\r\n\r\nHe did not know what reply to make; and, after a slight chuckle, which\r\ngave him time for reflection:\r\n\r\n"If I told you, would you believe me?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\nFrederick informed her that he had had a frightful dream a few nights\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"I dreamt that you were seriously ill--near dying."\r\n\r\n"Oh! my husband and I are never ill."\r\n\r\n"I have dreamt only of you," said he.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him calmly: "Dreams are not always realised."\r\n\r\nFrederick stammered, sought to find appropriate words to express himself\r\nin, and then plunged into a flowing period about the affinity of souls.\r\nThere existed a force which could, through the intervening bounds of\r\nspace, bring two persons into communication with each other, make known\r\nto each the other\'s feelings, and enable them to reunite.\r\n\r\nShe listened to him with downcast face, while she smiled with that\r\nbeautiful smile of hers. He watched her out of the corner of his eye\r\nwith delight, and poured out his love all the more freely through the\r\neasy channel of a commonplace remark.\r\n\r\nShe offered to show him the works; and, as she persisted, he made no\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nIn order to divert his attention with something of an amusing nature,\r\nshe showed him the species of museum that decorated the staircase. The\r\nspecimens, hung up against the wall or laid on shelves, bore witness to\r\nthe efforts and the successive fads of Arnoux. After seeking vainly for\r\nthe red of Chinese copper, he had wished to manufacture majolicas,\r\nfai\xebnce, Etruscan and Oriental ware, and had, in fact, attempted all the\r\nimprovements which were realised at a later period.\r\n\r\nSo it was that one could observe in the series big vases covered with\r\nfigures of mandarins, porringers of shot reddish-brown, pots adorned\r\nwith Arabian inscriptions, drinking-vessels in the style of the\r\nRenaissance, and large plates on which two personages were outlined as\r\nit were on bloodstone, in a delicate, a\xebrial fashion. He now made\r\nletters for signboards and wine-labels; but his intelligence was not\r\nhigh enough to attain to art, nor commonplace enough to look merely to\r\nprofit, so that, without satisfying anyone, he had ruined himself.\r\n\r\nThey were both taking a view of these things when Mademoiselle Marthe\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n"So, then, you did not recognise him?" said her mother to her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," she replied, bowing to him, while her clear and sceptical\r\nglance--the glance of a virgin--seemed to say in a whisper: "What are\r\nyou coming here for?" and she rushed up the steps with her head slightly\r\nbent over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux led Frederick into the yard attached to the works, and\r\nthen explained to him in a grave tone how different clays were ground,\r\ncleaned, and sifted.\r\n\r\n"The most important thing is the preparation of pastes."\r\n\r\nAnd she introduced him into a hall filled with vats, in which a vertical\r\naxis with horizontal arms kept turning. Frederick felt some regret that\r\nhe had not flatly declined her offer a little while before.\r\n\r\n"These things are merely the slobberings," said she.\r\n\r\nHe thought the word grotesque, and, in a measure, unbecoming on her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nWide straps ran from one end of the ceiling to the other, so as to roll\r\nthemselves round the drums, and everything kept moving continuously with\r\na provoking mathematical regularity.\r\n\r\nThey left the spot, and passed close to a ruined hut, which had formerly\r\nbeen used as a repository for gardening implements.\r\n\r\n"It is no longer of any use," said Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\nHe replied in a tremulous voice:\r\n\r\n"Happiness may have been associated with it!"\r\n\r\nThe clacking of the fire-pump drowned his words, and they entered the\r\nworkshop where rough drafts were made.\r\n\r\nSome men, seated at a narrow table, placed each in front of himself on a\r\nrevolving disc a piece of paste. Then each man with his left hand\r\nscooped out the insides of his own piece while smoothing its surface\r\nwith the right; and vases could be seen bursting into shape like\r\nblossoming flowers.\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux had the moulds for more difficult works shown to him.\r\n\r\nIn another portion of the building, the threads, the necks, and the\r\nprojecting lines were being formed. On the floor above, they removed the\r\nseams, and stopped up with plaster the little holes that had been left\r\nby the preceding operations.\r\n\r\nAt every opening in the walls, in corners, in the middle of the\r\ncorridor, everywhere, earthenware vessels had been placed side by side.\r\n\r\nFrederick began to feel bored.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps these things are tiresome to you?" said she.\r\n\r\nFearing lest it might be necessary to terminate his visit there and\r\nthen, he affected, on the contrary, a tone of great enthusiasm. He even\r\nexpressed regret at not having devoted himself to this branch of\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nShe appeared surprised.\r\n\r\n"Certainly! I would have been able to live near you."\r\n\r\nAnd as he tried to catch her eye, Madame Arnoux, in order to avoid him,\r\ntook off a bracket little balls of paste, which had come from abortive\r\nreadjustments, flattened them out into a thin cake, and pressed her hand\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n"Might I carry these away with me?" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! are you so childish?"\r\n\r\nHe was about to reply when in came S\xe9n\xe9cal.\r\n\r\nThe sub-manager, on the threshold, had noticed a breach of the rules.\r\nThe workshops should be swept every week. This was Saturday, and, as the\r\nworkmen had not done what was required, S\xe9n\xe9cal announced that they\r\nwould have to remain an hour longer.\r\n\r\n"So much the worse for you!"\r\n\r\nThey stooped over the work assigned to them unmurmuringly, but their\r\nrage could be divined by the hoarse sounds which came from their chests.\r\nThey were, moreover, very easy to manage, having all been dismissed from\r\nthe big manufactory. The Republican had shown himself a hard taskmaster\r\nto them. A mere theorist, he regarded the people only in the mass, and\r\nexhibited an utter absence of pity for individuals.\r\n\r\nFrederick, annoyed by his presence, asked Madame Arnoux in a low tone\r\nwhether they could have an opportunity of seeing the kilns. They\r\ndescended to the ground-floor; and she was just explaining the use of\r\ncaskets, when S\xe9n\xe9cal, who had followed close behind, placed himself\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nHe continued the explanation of his own motion, expatiated on the\r\nvarious kinds of combustibles, the process of placing in the kiln, the\r\npyroscopes, the cylindrical furnaces; the instruments for rounding, the\r\nlustres, and the metals, making a prodigious display of chemical terms,\r\nsuch as "chloride," "sulphuret," "borax," and "carbonate." Frederick did\r\nnot understand a single one of them, and kept turning round every minute\r\ntowards Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"You are not listening," said she. "M. S\xe9n\xe9cal, however, is very clear.\r\nHe knows all these things much better than I."\r\n\r\nThe mathematician, flattered by this eulogy, proposed to show the way in\r\nwhich colours were laid on. Frederick gave Madame Arnoux an anxious,\r\nquestioning look. She remained impassive, not caring to be alone with\r\nhim, very probably, and yet unwilling to leave him.\r\n\r\nHe offered her his arm.\r\n\r\n"No--many thanks! the staircase is too narrow!"\r\n\r\nAnd, when they had reached the top, S\xe9n\xe9cal opened the door of an\r\napartment filled with women.\r\n\r\nThey were handling brushes, phials, shells, and plates of glass. Along\r\nthe cornice, close to the wall, extended boards with figures engraved on\r\nthem; scraps of thin paper floated about, and a melting-stove sent forth\r\nfumes that made the temperature oppressive, while there mingled with it\r\nthe odour of turpentine.\r\n\r\nThe workwomen had nearly all sordid costumes. It was noticeable,\r\nhowever, that one of them wore a Madras handkerchief, and long\r\nearrings. Of slight frame, and, at the same time, plump, she had large\r\nblack eyes and the fleshy lips of a negress. Her ample bosom projected\r\nfrom under her chemise, which was fastened round her waist by the string\r\nof her petticoat; and, with one elbow on the board of the work-table and\r\nthe other arm hanging down, she gazed vaguely at the open country, a\r\nlong distance away. Beside her were a bottle of wine and some pork\r\nchops.\r\n\r\nThe regulations prohibited eating in the workshops, a rule intended to\r\nsecure cleanliness at work and to keep the hands in a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal, through a sense of duty or a longing to exercise despotic\r\nauthority, shouted out to her ere he had come near her, while pointing\r\ntowards a framed placard:\r\n\r\n"I say, you girl from Bordeaux over there! read out for me Article 9!"\r\n\r\n"Well, what then?"\r\n\r\n"What then, mademoiselle? You\'ll have to pay a fine of three francs."\r\n\r\nShe looked him straight in the face in an impudent fashion.\r\n\r\n"What does that signify to me? The master will take off your fine when\r\nhe comes back! I laugh at you, my good man!"\r\n\r\nS\xe9n\xe9cal, who was walking with his hands behind his back, like an usher\r\nin the study-room, contented himself with smiling.\r\n\r\n"Article 13, insubordination, ten francs!"\r\n\r\nThe girl from Bordeaux resumed her work. Madame Arnoux, through a sense\r\nof propriety, said nothing; but her brows contracted. Frederick\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n"Ha! you are very severe for a democrat!"\r\n\r\nThe other replied in a magisterial tone:\r\n\r\n"Democracy is not the unbounded license of individualism. It is the\r\nequality of all belonging to the same community before the law, the\r\ndistribution of work, order."\r\n\r\n"You are forgetting humanity!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux took his arm. S\xe9n\xe9cal, perhaps, offended by this mark of\r\nsilent approbation, went away.\r\n\r\nFrederick experienced an immense relief. Since morning he had been\r\nlooking out for the opportunity to declare itself; now it had arrived.\r\nBesides, Madame Arnoux\'s spontaneous movements seemed to him to contain\r\npromises; and he asked her, as if on the pretext of warming their feet,\r\nto come up to her room. But, when he was seated close beside her, he\r\nbegan once more to feel embarrassed. He was at a loss for a\r\nstarting-point. S\xe9n\xe9cal, luckily, suggested an idea to his mind.\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be more stupid," said he, "than this punishment!"\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux replied: "There are certain severe measures which are\r\nindispensable!"\r\n\r\n"What! you who are so good! Oh! I am mistaken, for you sometimes take\r\npleasure in making other people suffer!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand riddles, my friend!"\r\n\r\nAnd her austere look, still more than the words she used, checked him.\r\nFrederick was determined to go on. A volume of De Musset chanced to be\r\non the chest of drawers; he turned over some pages, then began to talk\r\nabout love, about his hopes and his transports.\r\n\r\nAll this, according to Madame Arnoux, was criminal or factitious. The\r\nyoung man felt wounded by this negative attitude with regard to his\r\npassion, and, in order to combat it, he cited, by way of proof, the\r\nsuicides which they read about every day in the newspapers, extolled the\r\ngreat literary types, Ph\xe8dre, Dido, Romeo, Desgrieux. He talked as if he\r\nmeant to do away with himself.\r\n\r\nThe fire was no longer burning on the hearth; the rain lashed against\r\nthe window-panes. Madame Arnoux, without stirring, remained with her\r\nhands resting on the sides of her armchair. The flaps of her cap fell\r\nlike the fillets of a sphinx. Her pure profile traced out its clear-cut\r\noutlines in the midst of the shadow.\r\n\r\nHe was anxious to cast himself at her feet. There was a creaking sound\r\nin the lobby, and he did not venture to carry out his intention.\r\n\r\nHe was, moreover, restrained by a kind of religious awe. That robe,\r\nmingling with the surrounding shadows, appeared to him boundless,\r\ninfinite, incapable of being touched; and for this very reason his\r\ndesire became intensified. But the fear of doing too much, and, again,\r\nof not doing enough, deprived him of all judgment.\r\n\r\n"If she dislikes me," he thought, "let her drive me away; if she cares\r\nfor me, let her encourage me."\r\n\r\nHe said, with a sigh:\r\n\r\n"So, then, you don\'t admit that a man may love--a woman?"\r\n\r\nMadame Arnoux replied:\r\n\r\n"Assuming that she is at liberty to marry, he may marry her; when she\r\nbelongs to another, he should keep away from her."\r\n\r\n"So happiness is impossible?"\r\n\r\n"No! But it is never to be found in falsehood, mental anxiety, and\r\nremorse."\r\n\r\n"What does it matter, if one is compensated by the enjoyment of supreme\r\nbliss?"\r\n\r\n"The experience is too costly."\r\n\r\nThen he sought to assail her with irony.\r\n\r\n"Would not virtue in that case be merely cowardice?"\r\n\r\n"Say rather, clear-sightedness. Even for those women who might forget\r\nduty or religion, simple good sense is sufficient. A solid foundation\r\nfor wisdom may be found in self-love."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what shop-keeping maxims these are of yours!"\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t boast of being a fine lady."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the little boy rushed in.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, are you coming to dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in a moment."\r\n\r\nFrederick arose. At the same instant, Marthe made her appearance.\r\n\r\nHe could not make up his mind to go away, and, with a look of entreaty:\r\n\r\n"These women you speak of are very unfeeling, then?"\r\n\r\n"No, but deaf when it is necessary to be so."\r\n\r\nAnd she remained standing on the threshold of her room with her two\r\nchildren beside her. He bowed without saying a word. She mutely returned\r\nhis salutation.\r\n\r\nWhat he first experienced was an unspeakable astonishment. He felt\r\ncrushed by this mode of impressing on him the emptiness of his hopes. It\r\nseemed to him as if he were lost, like a man who has fallen to the\r\nbottom of an abyss and knows that no help will come to him, and that he\r\nmust die. He walked on, however, but at random, without looking before\r\nhim. He knocked against stones; he mistook his way. A clatter of wooden\r\nshoes sounded close to his ear; it was caused by some of the\r\nworking-girls who were leaving the foundry. Then he realised where he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe railway lamps traced on the horizon a line of flames. He arrived\r\njust as the train was starting, let himself be pushed into a carriage,\r\nand fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAn hour later on the boulevards, the gaiety of Paris by night made his\r\njourney all at once recede into an already far-distant past. He resolved\r\nto be strong, and relieved his heart by vilifying Madame Arnoux with\r\ninsulting epithets.\r\n\r\n"She is an idiot, a goose, a mere brute; let us not bestow another\r\nthought on her!"\r\n\r\nWhen he got home, he found in his study a letter of eight pages on blue\r\nglazed paper, with the initials "R. A."\r\n\r\nIt began with friendly reproaches.\r\n\r\n"What has become of you, my dear? I am getting quite bored."\r\n\r\nBut the handwriting was so abominable, that Frederick was about to fling\r\naway the entire bundle of sheets, when he noticed in the postscript the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n"I count on you to come to-morrow and drive me to the races."\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of this invitation? Was it another trick of the\r\nMar\xe9chale? But a woman does not make a fool of the same man twice\r\nwithout some object; and, seized with curiosity, he read the letter over\r\nagain attentively.\r\n\r\nFrederick was able to distinguish "Misunderstanding--to have taken a\r\nwrong path--disillusions--poor children that we are!--like two rivers\r\nthat join each other!" etc.\r\n\r\nHe kept the sheets for a long time between his fingers. They had the\r\nodour of orris; and there was in the form of the characters and the\r\nirregular spaces between the lines something suggestive, as it were, of\r\na disorderly toilet, that fired his blood.\r\n\r\n"Why should I not go?" said he to himself at length. "But if Madame\r\nArnoux were to know about it? Ah! let her know! So much the better! and\r\nlet her feel jealous over it! In that way I shall be avenged!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAt the Races.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale was prepared for his visit, and had been awaiting him.\r\n\r\n"This is nice of you!" she said, fixing a glance of her fine eyes on his\r\nface, with an expression at the same time tender and mirthful.\r\n\r\nWhen she had fastened her bonnet-strings, she sat down on the divan, and\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go?" said Frederick. She looked at the clock on the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! not before half-past one!" as if she had imposed this limit to\r\nher indecision.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the hour had struck:\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, _andiamo, caro mio_!" And she gave a final touch to her\r\nhead-bands, and left directions for Delphine.\r\n\r\n"Is Madame coming home to dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Why should we, indeed? We shall dine together somewhere--at the Caf\xe9\r\nAnglais, wherever you wish."\r\n\r\n"Be it so!"\r\n\r\nHer little dogs began yelping around her.\r\n\r\n"We can bring them with us, can\'t we?"\r\n\r\nFrederick carried them himself to the vehicle. It was a hired berlin\r\nwith two post-horses and a postilion. He had put his man-servant in the\r\nback seat. The Mar\xe9chale appeared satisfied with his attentions. Then,\r\nas soon as she had seated herself, she asked him whether he had been\r\nlately at the Arnouxs\'.\r\n\r\n"Not for the past month," said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"As for me, I met him the day before yesterday. He would have even come\r\nto-day, but he has all sorts of troubles--another lawsuit--I don\'t know\r\nwhat. What a queer man!"\r\n\r\nFrederick added with an air of indifference:\r\n\r\n"Now that I think of it, do you still see--what\'s that his name\r\nis?--that ex-vocalist--Delmar?"\r\n\r\nShe replied dryly:\r\n\r\n"No; that\'s all over."\r\n\r\nSo it was clear that there had been a rupture between them. Frederick\r\nderived some hope from this circumstance.\r\n\r\nThey descended the Quartier Br\xe9da at an easy pace. As it happened to be\r\nSunday, the streets were deserted, and some citizens\' faces presented\r\nthemselves at the windows. The carriage went on more rapidly. The noise\r\nof wheels made the passers-by turn round; the leather of the hood, which\r\nhad slid down, was glittering. The man-servant doubled himself up, and\r\nthe two Havanese, beside one another, seemed like two ermine muffs laid\r\non the cushions. Frederick let himself jog up and down with the rocking\r\nof the carriage-straps. The Mar\xe9chale turned her head to the right and\r\nto the left with a smile on her face.\r\n\r\nHer straw hat of mother-of-pearl colour was trimmed with black lace. The\r\nhood of her bournous floated in the wind, and she sheltered herself\r\nfrom the rays of the sun under a parasol of lilac satin pointed at the\r\ntop like a pagoda.\r\n\r\n"What loves of little fingers!" said Frederick, softly taking her other\r\nhand, her left being adorned with a gold bracelet in the form of a\r\ncurb-chain.\r\n\r\n"I say! that\'s pretty! Where did it come from?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'ve had it a long time," said the Mar\xe9chale.\r\n\r\nThe young man did not challenge this hypocritical answer in any way. He\r\npreferred to profit by the circumstance. And, still keeping hold of the\r\nwrist, he pressed his lips on it between the glove and the cuff.\r\n\r\n"Stop! People will see us!"\r\n\r\n"Pooh! What does it signify?"\r\n\r\nAfter passing by the Place de la Concorde, they drove along the Quai de\r\nla Conf\xe9rence and the Quai de Billy, where might be noticed a cedar in a\r\ngarden. Rosanette believed that Lebanon was situated in China; she\r\nlaughed herself at her own ignorance, and asked Frederick to give her\r\nlessons in geography. Then, leaving the Trocad\xe9ro at the right, they\r\ncrossed the Pont de J\xe9na, and drew up at length in the middle of the\r\nChamp de Mars, near some other vehicles already drawn up in the\r\nHippodrome.\r\n\r\nThe grass hillocks were covered with common people. Some spectators\r\nmight be seen on the balcony of the Military School; and the two\r\npavilions outside the weighing-room, the two galleries contained within\r\nits enclosure, and a third in front of that of the king, were filled\r\nwith a fashionably dressed crowd whose deportment showed their regard\r\nfor this as yet novel form of amusement.\r\n\r\nThe public around the course, more select at this period, had a less\r\nvulgar aspect. It was the era of trouser-straps, velvet collars, and\r\nwhite gloves. The ladies, attired in showy colours, displayed gowns with\r\nlong waists; and seated on the tiers of the stands, they formed, so to\r\nspeak, immense groups of flowers, spotted here and there with black by\r\nthe men\'s costumes. But every glance was directed towards the celebrated\r\nAlgerian Bou-Maza, who sat, impassive, between two staff officers in one\r\nof the private galleries. That of the Jockey Club contained none but\r\ngrave-looking gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe more enthusiastic portion of the throng were seated underneath,\r\nclose to the track, protected by two lines of sticks which supported\r\nropes. In the immense oval described by this passage, cocoanut-sellers\r\nwere shaking their rattles, others were selling programmes of the races,\r\nothers were hawking cigars, with loud cries. On every side there was a\r\ngreat murmur. The municipal guards passed to and fro. A bell, hung from\r\na post covered with figures, began ringing. Five horses appeared, and\r\nthe spectators in the galleries resumed their seats.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, big clouds touched with their winding outlines the tops of\r\nthe elms opposite. Rosanette was afraid that it was going to rain.\r\n\r\n"I have umbrellas," said Frederick, "and everything that we need to\r\nafford ourselves diversion," he added, lifting up the chest, in which\r\nthere was a stock of provisions in a basket.\r\n\r\n"Bravo! we understand each other!"\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll understand each other still better, shall we not?"\r\n\r\n"That may be," she said, colouring.\r\n\r\nThe jockeys, in silk jackets, were trying to draw up their horses in\r\norder, and were holding them back with both hands. Somebody lowered a\r\nred flag. Then the entire five bent over the bristling manes, and off\r\nthey started. At first they remained pressed close to each other in a\r\nsingle mass; this presently stretched out and became cut up. The jockey\r\nin the yellow jacket was near falling in the middle of the first round;\r\nfor a long time it was uncertain whether Filly or Tibi should take the\r\nlead; then Tom Pouce appeared in front. But Clubstick, who had been in\r\nthe rear since the start, came up with the others and outstripped them,\r\nso that he was the first to reach the winning-post, beating Sir Charles\r\nby two lengths. It was a surprise. There was a shout of applause; the\r\nplanks shook with the stamping of feet.\r\n\r\n"We are amusing ourselves," said the Mar\xe9chale. "I love you, darling!"\r\n\r\nFrederick no longer doubted that his happiness was secure. Rosanette\'s\r\nlast words were a confirmation of it.\r\n\r\nA hundred paces away from him, in a four-wheeled cabriolet, a lady could\r\nbe seen. She stretched her head out of the carriage-door, and then\r\nquickly drew it in again. This movement was repeated several times.\r\nFrederick could not distinguish her face. He had a strong suspicion,\r\nhowever, that it was Madame Arnoux. And yet this seemed impossible! Why\r\nshould she have come there?\r\n\r\nHe stepped out of his own vehicle on the pretence of strolling into the\r\nweighing-room.\r\n\r\n"You are not very gallant!" said Rosanette.\r\n\r\nHe paid no heed to her, and went on. The four-wheeled cabriolet, turning\r\nback, broke into a trot.\r\n\r\nFrederick at the same moment, found himself button-holed by Cisy.\r\n\r\n"Good-morrow, my dear boy! how are you going on? Hussonnet is over\r\nthere! Are you listening to me?"\r\n\r\nFrederick tried to shake him off in order to get up with the\r\nfour-wheeled cabriolet. The Mar\xe9chale beckoned to him to come round to\r\nher. Cisy perceived her, and obstinately persisted in bidding her\r\ngood-day.\r\n\r\nSince the termination of the regular period of mourning for his\r\ngrandmother, he had realised his ideal, and succeeded in "getting the\r\nproper stamp." A Scotch plaid waistcoat, a short coat, large bows over\r\nthe pumps, and an entrance-card stuck in the ribbon of his hat; nothing,\r\nin fact, was wanting to produce what he described himself as his\r\n_chic_--a _chic_ characterised by Anglomania and the swagger of the\r\nmusketeer. He began by finding fault with the Champ de Mars, which he\r\nreferred to as an "execrable turf," then spoke of the Chantilly races,\r\nand the droll things that had occurred there, swore that he could drink\r\na dozen glasses of champagne while the clock was striking the midnight\r\nhour, offered to make a bet with the Mar\xe9chale, softly caressed her two\r\nlapdogs; and, leaning against the carriage-door on one elbow, he kept\r\ntalking nonsense, with the handle of his walking-stick in his mouth, his\r\nlegs wide apart, and his back stretched out. Frederick, standing beside\r\nhim, was smoking, while endeavouring to make out what had become of the\r\ncabriolet.\r\n\r\nThe bell having rung, Cisy took himself off, to the great delight of\r\nRosanette, who said he had been boring her to death.\r\n\r\nThe second race had nothing special about it; neither had the third,\r\nsave that a man was thrown over the shaft of a cart while it was taking\r\nplace. The fourth, in which eight horses contested the City Stakes, was\r\nmore interesting.\r\n\r\nThe spectators in the gallery had clambered to the top of their seats.\r\nThe others, standing up in the vehicles, followed with opera-glasses in\r\ntheir hands the movements of the jockeys. They could be seen starting\r\nout like red, yellow, white, or blue spots across the entire space\r\noccupied by the crowd that had gathered around the ring of the\r\nhippodrome. At a distance, their speed did not appear to be very great;\r\nat the opposite side of the Champ de Mars, they seemed even to be\r\nslackening their pace, and to be merely slipping along in such a way\r\nthat the horses\' bellies touched the ground without their outstretched\r\nlegs bending at all. But, coming back at a more rapid stride, they\r\nlooked bigger; they cut the air in their wild gallop. The sun\'s rays\r\nquivered; pebbles went flying about under their hoofs. The wind, blowing\r\nout the jockeys\' jackets, made them flutter like veils. Each of them\r\nlashed the animal he rode with great blows of his whip in order to reach\r\nthe winning-post--that was the goal they aimed at. One swept away the\r\nfigures, another was hoisted off his saddle, and, in the midst of a\r\nburst of applause, the victorious horse dragged his feet to the\r\nweighing-room, all covered with sweat, his knees stiffened, his neck and\r\nshoulders bent down, while his rider, looking as if he were expiring in\r\nhis saddle, clung to the animal\'s flanks.\r\n\r\nThe final start was retarded by a dispute which had arisen. The crowd,\r\ngetting tired, began to scatter. Groups of men were chatting at the\r\nlower end of each gallery. The talk was of a free-and-easy description.\r\nSome fashionable ladies left, scandalised by seeing fast women in their\r\nimmediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nThere were also some specimens of the ladies who appeared at public\r\nballs, some light-comedy actresses of the boulevards, and it was not the\r\nbest-looking portion of them that got the most appreciation. The elderly\r\nGeorgine Aubert, she whom a writer of vaudevilles called the Louis XI.\r\nof her profession, horribly painted, and giving vent every now and then\r\nto a laugh resembling a grunt, remained reclining at full length in her\r\nbig calash, covered with a sable fur-tippet, as if it were midwinter.\r\nMadame de Remoussat, who had become fashionable by means of a notorious\r\ntrial in which she figured, sat enthroned on the seat of a brake in\r\ncompany with some Americans; and Th\xe9r\xe8se Bachelu, with her look of a\r\nGothic virgin, filled with her dozen furbelows the interior of a trap\r\nwhich had, in place of an apron, a flower-stand filled with roses. The\r\nMar\xe9chale was jealous of these magnificent displays. In order to attract\r\nattention, she began to make vehement gestures and to speak in a very\r\nloud voice.\r\n\r\nGentlemen recognised her, and bowed to her. She returned their\r\nsalutations while telling Frederick their names. They were all counts,\r\nviscounts, dukes, and marquises, and carried a high head, for in all\r\neyes he could read a certain respect for his good fortune.\r\n\r\nCisy had a no less happy air in the midst of the circle of mature men\r\nthat surrounded them. Their faces wore cynical smiles above their\r\ncravats, as if they were laughing at him. At length he gave a tap in\r\nthe hand of the oldest of them, and made his way towards the Mar\xe9chale.\r\n\r\nShe was eating, with an affectation of gluttony, a slice of _p\xe2t\xe9 de\r\nfoie gras_. Frederick, in order to make himself agreeable to her,\r\nfollowed her example, with a bottle of wine on his knees.\r\n\r\nThe four-wheeled cabriolet reappeared. It _was_ Madame Arnoux! Her face\r\nwas startlingly pale.\r\n\r\n"Give me some champagne," said Rosanette.\r\n\r\nAnd, lifting up her glass, full to the brim as high as possible, she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Look over there! Look at my protector\'s wife, one of the virtuous\r\nwomen!"\r\n\r\nThere was a great burst of laughter all round her; and the cabriolet\r\ndisappeared from view. Frederick tugged impatiently at her dress, and\r\nwas on the point of flying into a passion. But Cisy was there, in the\r\nsame attitude as before, and, with increased assurance, he invited\r\nRosanette to dine with him that very evening.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" she replied; "we\'re going together to the Caf\xe9 Anglais."\r\n\r\nFrederick, as if he had heard nothing, remained silent; and Cisy quitted\r\nthe Mar\xe9chale with a look of disappointment on his face.\r\n\r\nWhile he had been talking to her at the right-hand door of the carriage,\r\nHussonnet presented himself at the opposite side, and, catching the\r\nwords "Caf\xe9 Anglais":\r\n\r\n"It\'s a nice establishment; suppose we had a pick there, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Just as you like," said Frederick, who, sunk down in the corner of the\r\nberlin, was gazing at the horizon as the four-wheeled cabriolet vanished\r\nfrom his sight, feeling that an irreparable thing had happened, and\r\nthat there was an end of his great love. And the other woman was there\r\nbeside him, the gay and easy love! But, worn out, full of conflicting\r\ndesires, and no longer even knowing what he wanted, he was possessed by\r\na feeling of infinite sadness, a longing to die.\r\n\r\nA great noise of footsteps and of voices made him raise his head. The\r\nlittle ragamuffins assembled round the track sprang over the ropes and\r\ncame to stare at the galleries. Thereupon their occupants rose to go. A\r\nfew drops of rain began to fall. The crush of vehicles increased, and\r\nHussonnet got lost in it.\r\n\r\n"Well! so much the better!" said Frederick.\r\n\r\n"We like to be alone better--don\'t we?" said the Mar\xe9chale, as she\r\nplaced her hand in his.\r\n\r\nThen there swept past him with a glitter of copper and steel a\r\nmagnificent landau to which were yoked four horses driven in the Daumont\r\nstyle by two jockeys in velvet vests with gold fringes. Madame Dambreuse\r\nwas by her husband\'s side, and Martinon was on the other seat facing\r\nthem. All three of them gazed at Frederick in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"They have recognised me!" said he to himself.\r\n\r\nRosanette wished to stop in order to get a better view of the people\r\ndriving away from the course. Madame Arnoux might again make her\r\nappearance! He called out to the postilion:\r\n\r\n"Go on! go on! forward!" And the berlin dashed towards the\r\nChamps-\xc9lys\xe9es in the midst of the other vehicles--calashes, britzkas,\r\nwurths, tandems, tilburies, dog-carts, tilted carts with leather\r\ncurtains, in which workmen in a jovial mood were singing, or one-horse\r\nchaises driven by fathers of families. In victorias crammed with people\r\nsome young fellows seated on the others\' feet let their legs both hang\r\ndown. Large broughams, which had their seats lined with cloth, carried\r\ndowagers fast asleep, or else a splendid machine passed with a seat as\r\nsimple and coquettish as a dandy\'s black coat.\r\n\r\nThe shower grew heavier. Umbrellas, parasols, and mackintoshes were put\r\ninto requisition. People cried out at some distance away: "Good-day!"\r\n"Are you quite well?" "Yes!" "No!" "Bye-bye!"--and the faces succeeded\r\neach other with the rapidity of Chinese shadows.\r\n\r\nFrederick and Rosanette did not say a word to each other, feeling a sort\r\nof dizziness at seeing all these wheels continually revolving close to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt times, the rows of carriages, too closely pressed together, stopped\r\nall at the same time in several lines. Then they remained side by side,\r\nand their occupants scanned one another. Over the sides of panels\r\nadorned with coats-of-arms indifferent glances were cast on the crowd.\r\nEyes full of envy gleamed from the interiors of hackney-coaches.\r\nDepreciatory smiles responded to the haughty manner in which some people\r\ncarried their heads. Mouths gaping wide expressed idiotic admiration;\r\nand, here and there, some lounger, in the middle of the road, fell back\r\nwith a bound, in order to avoid a rider who had been galloping through\r\nthe midst of the vehicles, and had succeeded in getting away from them.\r\nThen, everything set itself in motion once more; the coachmen let go the\r\nreins, and lowered their long whips; the horses, excited, shook their\r\ncurb-chains, and flung foam around them; and the cruppers and the\r\nharness getting moist, were smoking with the watery evaporation, through\r\nwhich struggled the rays of the sinking sun. Passing under the Arc de\r\nTriomphe, there stretched out at the height of a man, a reddish light,\r\nwhich shed a glittering lustre on the naves of the wheels, the handles\r\nof the carriage-doors, the ends of the shafts, and the rings of the\r\ncarriage-beds; and on the two sides of the great avenue--like a river in\r\nwhich manes, garments, and human heads were undulating--the trees, all\r\nglittering with rain, rose up like two green walls. The blue of the sky\r\noverhead, reappearing in certain places, had the soft hue of satin.\r\n\r\nThen, Frederick recalled the days, already far away, when he yearned for\r\nthe inexpressible happiness of finding himself in one of these carriages\r\nby the side of one of these women. He had attained to this bliss, and\r\nyet he was not thereby one jot the happier.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased falling. The pedestrians, who had sought shelter\r\nbetween the columns of the Public Storerooms, took their departure.\r\nPersons who had been walking along the Rue Royale, went up again towards\r\nthe boulevard. In front of the residence of the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs a group of boobies had taken up their posts on the steps.\r\n\r\nWhen it had got up as high as the Chinese Baths, as there were holes in\r\nthe pavement, the berlin slackened its pace. A man in a hazel-coloured\r\npaletot was walking on the edge of the footpath. A splash, spurting out\r\nfrom under the springs, showed itself on his back. The man turned round\r\nin a rage. Frederick grew pale; he had recognised Deslauriers.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the Caf\xe9 Anglais he sent away the carriage. Rosanette had\r\ngone in before him while he was paying the postilion.\r\n\r\nHe found her subsequently on the stairs chatting with a gentleman.\r\nFrederick took her arm; but in the lobby a second gentleman stopped her.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said she; "I am at your service."\r\n\r\nAnd he entered the private room alone. Through the two open windows\r\npeople could be seen at the casements of the other houses opposite.\r\nLarge watery masses were quivering on the pavement as it began to dry,\r\nand a magnolia, placed on the side of a balcony, shed a perfume through\r\nthe apartment. This fragrance and freshness had a relaxing effect on his\r\nnerves. He sank down on the red divan underneath the glass.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale here entered the room, and, kissing him on the forehead:\r\n\r\n"Poor pet! there\'s something annoying you!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so," was his reply.\r\n\r\n"You are not alone; take heart!"--which was as much as to say: "Let us\r\neach forget our own concerns in a bliss which we shall enjoy in common."\r\n\r\nThen she placed the petal of a flower between her lips and extended it\r\ntowards him so that he might peck at it. This movement, full of grace\r\nand of almost voluptuous gentleness, had a softening influence on\r\nFrederick.\r\n\r\n"Why do you give me pain?" said he, thinking of Madame Arnoux.\r\n\r\n"I give you pain?"\r\n\r\nAnd, standing before him, she looked at him with her lashes drawn close\r\ntogether and her two hands resting on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nAll his virtue, all his rancour gave way before the utter weakness of\r\nhis will.\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n"Because you won\'t love me," and he took her on his knees.\r\n\r\nShe gave way to him. He pressed his two hands round her waist. The\r\ncrackling sound of her silk dress inflamed him.\r\n\r\n"Where are they?" said Hussonnet\'s voice in the lobby outside.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale arose abruptly, and went across to the other side of the\r\nroom, where she sat down with her back to the door.\r\n\r\nShe ordered oysters, and they seated themselves at table.\r\n\r\nHussonnet was not amusing. By dint of writing every day on all sorts of\r\nsubjects, reading many newspapers, listening to a great number of\r\ndiscussions, and uttering paradoxes for the purpose of dazzling people,\r\nhe had in the end lost the exact idea of things, blinding himself with\r\nhis own feeble fireworks. The embarrassments of a life which had\r\nformerly been frivolous, but which was now full of difficulty, kept him\r\nin a state of perpetual agitation; and his impotency, which he did not\r\nwish to avow, rendered him snappish and sarcastic. Referring to a new\r\nballet entitled _Ozai_, he gave a thorough blowing-up to the dancing,\r\nand then, when the opera was in question, he attacked the Italians, now\r\nreplaced by a company of Spanish actors, "as if people had not quite\r\nenough of Castilles[12] already!" Frederick was shocked at this, owing\r\nto his romantic attachment to Spain, and, with a view to diverting the\r\nconversation into a new channel, he enquired about the Coll\xe9ge of\r\nFrance, where Edgar Quinet and Mickiewicz had attended. But Hussonnet,\r\nan admirer of M. de Maistre, declared himself on the side of Authority\r\nand Spiritualism. Nevertheless, he had doubts about the most\r\nwell-established facts, contradicted history, and disputed about things\r\nwhose certainty could not be questioned; so that at mention of the word\r\n"geometry," he exclaimed: "What fudge this geometry is!" All this he\r\nintermingled with imitations of actors. Sainville was specially his\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: This pun of Hussonnet turns on the double sense of the\r\nword "Castille," which not only means a place in Spain, but also an\r\naltercation.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nFrederick was quite bored by these quibbles. In an outburst of\r\nimpatience he pushed his foot under the table, and pressed it on one of\r\nthe little dogs.\r\n\r\nThereupon both animals began barking in a horrible fashion.\r\n\r\n"You ought to get them sent home!" said he, abruptly.\r\n\r\nRosanette did not know anyone to whom she could intrust them.\r\n\r\nThen, he turned round to the Bohemian:\r\n\r\n"Look here, Hussonnet; sacrifice yourself!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, my boy! That would be a very obliging act!"\r\n\r\nHussonnet set off, without even requiring to have an appeal made to him.\r\n\r\nIn what way could they repay him for his kindness? Frederick did not\r\nbestow a thought on it. He was even beginning to rejoice at finding\r\nhimself alone with her, when a waiter entered.\r\n\r\n"Madame, somebody is asking for you!"\r\n\r\n"What! again?"\r\n\r\n"However, I must see who it is," said Rosanette.\r\n\r\nHe was thirsting for her; he wanted her. This disappearance seemed to\r\nhim an act of prevarication, almost a piece of rudeness. What, then,\r\ndid she mean? Was it not enough to have insulted Madame Arnoux? So much\r\nfor the latter, all the same! Now he hated all women; and he felt the\r\ntears choking him, for his love had been misunderstood and his desire\r\neluded.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale returned, and presented Cisy to him.\r\n\r\n"I have invited Monsieur. I have done right, have I not?"\r\n\r\n"How is that! Oh! certainly."\r\n\r\nFrederick, with the smile of a criminal about to be executed, beckoned\r\nto the gentleman to take a seat.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale began to run her eye through the bill of fare, stopping at\r\nevery fantastic name.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we eat a turban of rabbits _\xe0 la Richeli\xe9u_ and a pudding _\xe0 la\r\nd\'Orl\xe9ans_?"[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The word "Orl\xe9ans" means light woollen cloth, and\r\npossibly Cisy\'s pun might be rendered: "Oh! no cloth pudding,\r\nplease."--Translator.]\r\n\r\n"Oh! not Orl\xe9ans, pray!" exclaimed Cisy, who was a Legitimist, and\r\nthought of making a pun.\r\n\r\n"Would you prefer a turbot _\xe0 la_ Chambord?" she next asked.\r\n\r\nFrederick was disgusted with this display of politeness.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale made up her mind to order a simple fillet of beef cut up\r\ninto steaks, some crayfishes, truffles, a pine-apple salad, and vanilla\r\nices.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see what next. Go on for the present! Ah! I was forgetting! Bring\r\nme a sausage!--not with garlic!"\r\n\r\nAnd she called the waiter "young man," struck her glass with her knife,\r\nand flung up the crumbs of her bread to the ceiling. She wished to\r\ndrink some Burgundy immediately.\r\n\r\n"It is not taken in the beginning," said Frederick.\r\n\r\nThis was sometimes done, according to the Vicomte.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no. Never!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed; I assure you!"\r\n\r\n"Ha! you see!"\r\n\r\nThe look with which she accompanied these words meant: "This is a rich\r\nman--pay attention to what he says!"\r\n\r\nMeantime, the door was opening every moment; the waiters kept shouting;\r\nand on an infernal piano in the adjoining room some one was strumming a\r\nwaltz. Then the races led to a discussion about horsemanship and the two\r\nrival systems. Cisy was upholding Baucher and Frederick the Comte d\'Aure\r\nwhen Rosanette shrugged her shoulders:\r\n\r\n"Enough--my God!--he is a better judge of these things than you\r\nare--come now!"\r\n\r\nShe kept nibbling at a pomegranate, with her elbow resting on the table.\r\nThe wax-candles of the candelabrum in front of her were flickering in\r\nthe wind. This white light penetrated her skin with mother-of-pearl\r\ntones, gave a pink hue to her lids, and made her eyeballs glitter. The\r\nred colour of the fruit blended with the purple of her lips; her thin\r\nnostrils heaved; and there was about her entire person an air of\r\ninsolence, intoxication, and recklessness that exasperated Frederick,\r\nand yet filled his heart with wild desires.\r\n\r\nThen, she asked, in a calm voice, who owned that big landau with\r\nchestnut-coloured livery.\r\n\r\nCisy replied that it was "the Comtesse Dambreuse"\r\n\r\n"They\'re very rich--aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! very rich! although Madame Dambreuse, who was merely a Mademoiselle\r\nBoutron and the daughter of a prefect, had a very modest fortune."\r\n\r\nHer husband, on the other hand, must have inherited several\r\nestates--Cisy enumerated them: as he visited the Dambreuses, he knew\r\ntheir family history.\r\n\r\nFrederick, in order to make himself disagreeable to the other, took a\r\npleasure in contradicting him. He maintained that Madame Dambreuse\'s\r\nmaiden name was De Boutron, which proved that she was of a noble family.\r\n\r\n"No matter! I\'d like to have her equipage!" said the Mar\xe9chale, throwing\r\nherself back on the armchair.\r\n\r\nAnd the sleeve of her dress, slipping up a little, showed on her left\r\nwrist a bracelet adorned with three opals.\r\n\r\nFrederick noticed it.\r\n\r\n"Look here! why----"\r\n\r\nAll three looked into one another\'s faces, and reddened.\r\n\r\nThe door was cautiously half-opened; the brim of a hat could be seen,\r\nand then Hussonnet\'s profile exhibited itself.\r\n\r\n"Pray excuse me if I disturb the lovers!"\r\n\r\nBut he stopped, astonished at seeing Cisy, and that Cisy had taken his\r\nown seat.\r\n\r\nAnother cover was brought; and, as he was very hungry, he snatched up at\r\nrandom from what remained of the dinner some meat which was in a dish,\r\nfruit out of a basket, and drank with one hand while he helped himself\r\nwith the other, all the time telling them the result of his mission. The\r\ntwo bow-wows had been taken home. Nothing fresh at the house. He had\r\nfound the cook in the company of a soldier--a fictitious story which he\r\nhad especially invented for the sake of effect.\r\n\r\nThe Mar\xe9chale took down her cloak from the window-screw. Frederick made\r\na rush towards the bell, calling out to the waiter, who was some\r\ndistance away:\r\n\r\n"A carriage!"\r\n\r\n"I have one of my own," said the Vicomte.\r\n\r\n"But, Monsieur!"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, Monsieur!"\r\n\r\nAnd they stared into each other\'s eyes, both pale and their hands\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\nAt last, the Mar\xe9chale took Cisy\'s arm, and pointing towards the\r\nBohemian seated at the table:\r\n\r\n"Pray mind him! He\'s choking himself. I wouldn\'t care to let his\r\ndevotion to my pugs be the cause of his death."\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind him.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Hussonnet.\r\n\r\n"Well, what?"\r\n\r\n"I thought----"\r\n\r\n"What did you think?"\r\n\r\n"Were you not----?"\r\n\r\nHe completed the sentence with a gesture.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no--never in all my life!"\r\n\r\nHussonnet did not press the matter further.\r\n\r\nHe had an object in inviting himself to dinner. His journal,--which was\r\nno longer called _L\'Art_, but _Le Flambart_,[14] with this epigraph,\r\n"Gunners, to your cannons!"--not being at all in a flourishing\r\ncondition, he had a mind to change it into a weekly review, conducted\r\nby himself, without any assistance from Deslauriers. He again referred\r\nto the old project and explained his latest plan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _The Blaser._]\r\n\r\nFrederick, probably not understanding what he was talking about, replied\r\nwith some vague words. Hussonnet snatched up several cigars from the\r\ntables, said "Good-bye, old chap," and disappeared.\r\n\r\nFrederick called for the bill. It had a long list of items; and the\r\nwaiter, with his napkin under his arm, was expecting to be paid by\r\nFrederick, when another, a sallow-faced individual, who resembled\r\nMartinon, came and said to him:\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon; they forgot at the bar to add in the charge for the cab."\r\n\r\n"What cab?"\r\n\r\n"The cab the gentleman took a short time ago for the little dogs."\r\n\r\nAnd the waiter put on a look of gravity, as if he pitied the poor young\r\nman. Frederick felt inclined to box the fellow\'s ears. He gave the\r\nwaiter the twenty francs\' change as a _pour-boire_.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Monseigneur," said the man with the napkin, bowing low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Sentimental Education Vol 1, by Gustave Flaubert\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION VOL 1 ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 34828-8.txt or 34828-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/4/8/2/34828/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Edwards, Mary Meehan and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\r\nfile was produced from images generously made available\r\nby The Internet Archive)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
