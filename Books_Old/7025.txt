He might\r\nshelter himself under the plea that every anonymous writer is, like the\r\ncelebrated Junius, only a phantom, and that therefore, although an\r\napparition, of a more benign, as well as much meaner description, he\r\ncannot be bound to plead to a charge of inconsistency. A better apology\r\nmay be found in the imitating the confession of honest Benedict, that,\r\nwhen he said he would die a bachelor, he did not think he should live to\r\nbe married. The best of all would be, if, as has eminently happened in\r\nthe case of some distinguished contemporaries, the merit of the work\r\nshould, in the reader's estimation, form an excuse for the Author's\r\nbreach of promise. Without presuming to hope that this may prove the\r\ncase, it is only further necessary to mention, that his resolution, like\r\nthat of Benedict, fell a sacrifice, to temptation at least, if not to\r\nstratagem.\r\n\r\nIt is now about six months since the Author, through the medium of his\r\nrespectable Publishers, received a parcel of Papers, containing the\r\nOutlines of this narrative, with a permission, or rather with a request,\r\ncouched in highly flattering terms, that they might be given to the\r\nPublic, with such alterations as should be found suitable.*\r\n\r\n* As it maybe necessary, in the present Edition(1829), to speak upon the\r\nsquare, the Author thinks it proper to own, that the communication\r\nalluded to is entirely imaginary.\r\n\r\nThese were of course so numerous, that, besides the suppression of names,\r\nand of incidents approaching too much to reality, the work may in a great\r\nmeasure be, said to be new written. Several anachronisms have probably\r\ncrept in during the course of these changes; and the mottoes for the\r\nChapters have been selected without any reference to the supposed date of\r\nthe incidents. For these, of course, the Editor is responsible. Some\r\nothers occurred in the original materials, but they are of little\r\nconsequence. In point of minute accuracy, it may be stated, that the\r\nbridge over the Forth, or rather the Avondhu (or Black River), near the\r\nhamlet of Aberfoil, had not an existence thirty years ago. It does not,\r\nhowever, become the Editor to be the first to point out these errors; and\r\nhe takes this public opportunity to thank the unknown and nameless\r\ncorrespondent, to whom the reader will owe the principal share of any\r\namusement which he may derive from the following pages.\r\n\r\n1st December 1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION---(1829)\r\n\r\nWhen the author projected this further encroachment on the patience of an\r\nindulgent public, he was at some loss for a title; a good name being very\r\nnearly of as much consequence in literature as in life. The title of _Rob\r\nRoy_ was suggested by the late Mr. Constable, whose sagacity and\r\nexperience foresaw the germ of popularity which it included.\r\n\r\nNo introduction can be more appropriate to the work than some account of\r\nthe singular character whose name is given to the title-page, and who,\r\nthrough good report and bad report, has maintained a wonderful degree of\r\nimportance in popular recollection. This cannot be ascribed to the\r\ndistinction of his birth, which, though that of a gentleman, had in it\r\nnothing of high destination, and gave him little right to command in his\r\nclan. Neither, though he lived a busy, restless, and enterprising life,\r\nwere his feats equal to those of other freebooters, who have been less\r\ndistinguished. He owed his fame in a great measure to his residing on the\r\nvery verge of the Highlands, and playing such pranks in the beginning of\r\nthe 18th century, as are usually ascribed to Robin Hood in the middle\r\nages,--and that within forty miles of Glasgow, a great commercial city,\r\nthe seat of a learned university. Thus a character like his, blending the\r\nwild virtues, the subtle policy, and unrestrained license of an American\r\nIndian, was flourishing in Scotland during the Augustan age of Queen Anne\r\nand George I. Addison, it is probable, or Pope, would have been\r\nconsiderably surprised if they had known that there existed in the same\r\nisland with them a personage of Rob Roy's peculiar habits and profession.\r\nIt is this strong contrast betwixt the civilised and cultivated mode of\r\nlife on the one side of the Highland line, and the wild and lawless\r\nadventures which were habitually undertaken and achieved by one who dwelt\r\non the opposite side of that ideal boundary, which creates the interest\r\nattached to his name. Hence it is that even yet,\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Far and near, through vale and hill,\r\n                      Are faces that attest the same,\r\n                  And kindle like a fire new stirr'd,\r\n                      At sound of Rob Roy's name.\r\n\r\nThere were several advantages which Rob Roy enjoyed for sustaining to\r\nadvantage the character which he assumed.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of these was his descent from, and connection with,\r\nthe clan MacGregor, so famous for their misfortunes, and the indomitable\r\nspirit with which they maintained themselves as a clan, linked and banded\r\ntogether in spite of the most severe laws, executed with unheard-of\r\nrigour against those who bore this forbidden surname. Their history was\r\nthat of several others of the original Highland clans, who were\r\nsuppressed by more powerful neighbours, and either extirpated, or forced\r\nto secure themselves by renouncing their own family appellation, and\r\nassuming that of the conquerors. The peculiarity in the story of the\r\nMacGregors, is their retaining, with such tenacity, their separate\r\nexistence and union as a clan under circumstances of the utmost urgency.\r\nThe history of the tribe is briefly as follows--But we must premise that\r\nthe tale depends in some degree on tradition; therefore, excepting when\r\nwritten documents are, quoted, it must be considered as in some degree\r\ndubious.\r\n\r\nThe sept of MacGregor claimed a descent from Gregor, or Gregorius, third\r\nson, it is said, of Alpin King of Scots, who flourished about 787. Hence\r\ntheir original patronymic is MacAlpine, and they are usually termed the\r\nClan Alpine. An individual tribe of them retains the same name. They are\r\naccounted one of the most ancient clans in the Highlands, and it is\r\ncertain they were a people of original Celtic descent, and occupied at\r\none period very extensive possessions in Perthshire and Argyleshire,\r\nwhich they imprudently continued to hold by the _coir a glaive,_ that is,\r\nthe right of the sword. Their neighbours, the Earls of Argyle and\r\nBreadalbane, in the meanwhile, managed to leave the lands occupied by the\r\nMacGregors engrossed in those charters which they easily obtained from\r\nthe Crown; and thus constituted a legal right in their own favour,\r\nwithout much regard to its justice. As opportunity occurred of annoying\r\nor extirpating their neighbours, they gradually extended their own\r\ndomains, by usurping, under the pretext of such royal grants, those of\r\ntheir more uncivilised neighbours. A Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochow, known\r\nin the Highlands by the name of _Donacha Dhu nan Churraichd,_ that is,\r\nBlack Duncan with the Cowl, it being his pleasure to wear such a\r\nhead-gear, is said to have been peculiarly successful in those acts of\r\nspoliation upon the clan MacGregor.\r\n\r\nThe devoted sept, ever finding themselves iniquitously driven from their\r\npossessions, defended themselves by force, and occasionally gained\r\nadvantages, which they used cruelly enough. This conduct, though natural,\r\nconsidering the country and time, was studiously represented at the\r\ncapital as arising from an untameable and innate ferocity, which nothing,\r\nit was said, could remedy, save cutting off the tribe of MacGregor root\r\nand branch.\r\n\r\nIn an act of Privy Council at Stirling, 22d September 1563, in the reign\r\nof Queen Mary, commission is granted to the most powerful nobles, and\r\nchiefs of the clans, to pursue the clan Gregor with fire and sword. A\r\nsimilar warrant in 1563, not only grants the like powers to Sir John\r\nCampbell of Glenorchy, the descendant of Duncan with the Cowl, but\r\ndischarges the lieges to receive or assist any of the clan Gregor, or\r\nafford them, under any colour whatever, meat, drink, or clothes.\r\n\r\nAn atrocity which the clan Gregor committed in 1589, by the murder of\r\nJohn Drummond of Drummond-ernoch, a forester of the royal forest of\r\nGlenartney, is elsewhere given, with all its horrid circumstances. The\r\nclan swore upon the severed head of the murdered man, that they would\r\nmake common cause in avowing the deed. This led to an act of the Privy\r\nCouncil, directing another crusade against the \xe2\x80\x9cwicked clan Gregor, so\r\nlong continuing in blood, slaughter, theft, and robbery,\xe2\x80\x9d in which\r\nletters of fire and sword are denounced against them for the space of\r\nthree years. The reader will find this particular fact illustrated in the\r\nIntroduction to the Legend of Montrose in the present edition of these\r\nNovels.\r\n\r\nOther occasions frequently occurred, in which the MacGregors testified\r\ncontempt for the laws, from which they had often experienced severity,\r\nbut never protection. Though they were gradually deprived of their\r\npossessions, and of all ordinary means of procuring subsistence, they\r\ncould not, nevertheless, be supposed likely to starve for famine, while\r\nthey had the means of taking from strangers what they considered as\r\nrightfully their own. Hence they became versed in predatory forays, and\r\naccustomed to bloodshed. Their passions were eager, and, with a little\r\nmanagement on the part of some of their most powerful neighbours, they\r\ncould easily be _hounded out,_ to use an expressive Scottish phrase, to\r\ncommit violence, of which the wily instigators took the advantage, and\r\nleft the ignorant MacGregors an undivided portion of blame and\r\npunishment. This policy of pushing on the fierce clans of the Highlands\r\nand Borders to break the peace of the country, is accounted by the\r\nhistorian one of the most dangerous practices of his own period, in which\r\nthe MacGregors were considered as ready agents.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these severe denunciations,---which were acted upon in\r\nthe same spirit in which they were conceived, some of the clan still\r\npossessed property, and the chief of the name in 1592 is designed\r\nAllaster MacGregor of Glenstrae. He is said to have been a brave and\r\nactive man; but, from the tenor of his confession at his death, appears\r\nto have been engaged in many and desperate feuds, one of which finally\r\nproved fatal to himself and many of his followers. This was the\r\ncelebrated conflict at Glenfruin, near the southwestern extremity of Loch\r\nLomond, in the vicinity of which the MacGregors continued to exercise\r\nmuch authority by the _coir a glaive,_ or right of the strongest, which\r\nwe have already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere had been a long and bloody feud betwixt the MacGregors and the\r\nLaird of Luss, head of the family of Colquhoun, a powerful race on the\r\nlower part of Loch Lomond. The MacGregors' tradition affirms that the\r\nquarrel began on a very trifling subject. Two of the MacGregors being\r\nbenighted, asked shelter in a house belonging to a dependant of the\r\nColquhouns, and were refused. They then retreated to an out-house, took a\r\nwedder from the fold, killed it, and supped off the carcass, for which\r\n(it is said) they offered payment to the proprietor. The Laird of Luss\r\nseized on the offenders, and, by the summary process which feudal barons\r\nhad at their command, had them both condemned and executed. The\r\nMacGregors verify this account of the feud by appealing to a proverb\r\ncurrent amongst them, execrating the hour _(Mult dhu an Carbail ghil)_\r\nthat the black wedder with the white tail was ever lambed. To avenge this\r\nquarrel, the Laird of MacGregor assembled his clan, to the number of\r\nthree or four hundred men, and marched towards Luss from the banks of\r\nLoch Long, by a pass called _Raid na Gael,_ or the Highlandman's Pass.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Colquhoun received early notice of this incursion, and\r\ncollected a strong force, more than twice the number of that of the\r\ninvaders. He had with him the gentlemen of the name of Buchanan, with the\r\nGrahams, and other gentry of the Lennox, and a party of the citizens of\r\nDumbarton, under command of Tobias Smollett, a magistrate, or bailie, of\r\nthat town, and ancestor of the celebrated author.\r\n\r\nThe parties met in the valley of Glenfruin, which signifies the Glen of\r\nSorrow---a name that seemed to anticipate the event of the day, which,\r\nfatal to the conquered party, was at least equally so to the victors, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbabe unborn\xe2\x80\x9d of Clan Alpine having reason to repent it. The MacGregors,\r\nsomewhat discouraged by the appearance of a force much superior to their\r\nown, were cheered on to the attack by a Seer, or second-sighted person,\r\nwho professed that he saw the shrouds of the dead wrapt around their\r\nprincipal opponents. The clan charged with great fury on the front of the\r\nenemy, while John MacGregor, with a strong party, made an unexpected\r\nattack on the flank. A great part of the Colquhouns' force consisted in\r\ncavalry, which could not act in the boggy ground. They were said to have\r\ndisputed the field manfully, but were at length completely routed, and a\r\nmerciless slaughter was exercised on the fugitives, of whom betwixt two\r\nand three hundred fell on the field and in the pursuit. If the MacGregors\r\nlost, as is averred, only two men slain in the action, they had slight\r\nprovocation for an indiscriminate massacre. It is said that their fury\r\nextended itself to a party of students for clerical orders, who had\r\nimprudently come to see the battle. Some doubt is thrown on this fact,\r\nfrom the indictment against the chief of the clan Gregor being silent on\r\nthe subject, as is the historian Johnston, and a Professor Ross, who\r\nwrote an account of the battle twenty-nine years after it was fought. It\r\nis, however, constantly averred by the tradition of the country, and a\r\nstone where the deed was done is called _Leck-a-Mhinisteir,_ the Minister\r\nor Clerk's Flagstone. The MacGregors, by a tradition which is now found\r\nto be inaccurate, impute this cruel action to the ferocity of a single\r\nman of their tribe, renowned for size and strength, called Dugald, _Ciar\r\nMhor,_ or the great Mouse-coloured Man. He was MacGregor's\r\nfoster-brother, and the chief committed the youths to his charge, with\r\ndirections to keep them safely till the affray was over. Whether fearful\r\nof their escape, or incensed by some sarcasms which they threw on his\r\ntribe, or whether out of mere thirst of blood, this savage, while the\r\nother MacGregors were engaged in the pursuit, poniarded his helpless and\r\ndefenceless prisoners. When the chieftain, on his return, demanded where\r\nthe youths were, the _Ciar_ (pronounced Kiar) _Mhor_ drew out his bloody\r\ndirk, saying in Gaelic, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk that, and God save me!\xe2\x80\x9d The latter words\r\nallude to the exclamation which his victims used when he was murdering\r\nthem. It would seem, therefore, that this horrible part of the story is\r\nfounded on fact, though the number of the youths so slain is probably\r\nexaggerated in the Lowland accounts. The common people say that the blood\r\nof the Ciar Mhor's victims can never be washed off the stone. When\r\nMacGregor learnt their fate, he expressed the utmost horror at the deed,\r\nand upbraided his foster-brother with having done that which would\r\noccasion the destruction of him and his clan. This supposed homicide was\r\nthe ancestor of Rob Roy, and the tribe from which he was descended. He\r\nlies buried at the church of Fortingal, where his sepulchre, covered with\r\na large stone,* is still shown, and where his great strength and courage\r\nare the theme of many traditions.*\r\n\r\n* Note A. The Grey Stone of MacGregor.\r\n\r\n** Note B. Dugald Ciar Mhor.\r\n\r\nMacGregor's brother was one of the very few of the tribe who was slain.\r\nHe was buried near the field of battle, and the place is marked by a rude\r\nstone, called the Grey Stone of MacGregor.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Colquhoun, being well mounted, escaped for the time to the\r\ncastle of Banochar, or Benechra. It proved no sure defence, however, for\r\nhe was shortly after murdered in a vault of the castle,---the family\r\nannals say by the MacGregors, though other accounts charge the deed upon\r\nthe MacFarlanes.\r\n\r\nThis battle of Glenfruin, and the severity which the victors exercised in\r\nthe pursuit, was reported to King James VI. in a manner the most\r\nunfavourable to the clan Gregor, whose general character, being that of\r\nlawless though brave men, could not much avail them in such a case. That\r\nJames might fully understand the extent of the slaughter, the widows of\r\nthe slain, to the number of eleven score, in deep mourning, riding upon\r\nwhite palfreys, and each bearing her husband's bloody shirt on a spear,\r\nappeared at Stirling, in presence of a monarch peculiarly accessible to\r\nsuch sights of fear and sorrow, to demand vengeance for the death of\r\ntheir husbands, upon those by whom they had been made desolate.\r\n\r\nThe remedy resorted to was at least as severe as the cruelties which it\r\nwas designed to punish. By an Act of the Privy Council, dated 3d April\r\n1603, the name of MacGregor was expressly abolished, and those who had\r\nhitherto borne it were commanded to change it for other surnames, the\r\npain of death being denounced against those who should call themselves\r\nGregor or MacGregor, the names of their fathers. Under the same penalty,\r\nall who had been at the conflict of Glenfruin, or accessory to other\r\nmarauding parties charged in the act, were prohibited from carrying\r\nweapons, except a pointless knife to eat their victuals. By a subsequent\r\nact of Council, 24th June 1613, death was denounced against any persons\r\nof the tribe formerly called MacGregor, who should presume to assemble in\r\ngreater numbers than four. Again, by an Act of Parliament, 1617, chap.\r\n26, these laws were continued, and extended to the rising generation, in\r\nrespect that great numbers of the children of those against whom the acts\r\nof Privy Council had been directed, were stated to be then approaching to\r\nmaturity, who, if permitted to resume the name of their parents, would\r\nrender the clan as strong as it was before.\r\n\r\nThe execution of those severe acts was chiefly intrusted in the west to\r\nthe Earl of Argyle and the powerful clan of Campbell, and to the Earl of\r\nAthole and his followers in the more eastern Highlands of Perthshire. The\r\nMacGregors failed not to resist with the most determined courage; and\r\nmany a valley in the West and North Highlands retains memory of the\r\nsevere conflicts, in which the proscribed clan sometimes obtained\r\ntransient advantages, and always sold their lives dearly. At length the\r\npride of Allaster MacGregor, the chief of the clan, was so much lowered\r\nby the sufferings of his people, that he resolved to surrender himself to\r\nthe Earl of Argyle, with his principal followers, on condition that they\r\nshould be sent out of Scotland. If the unfortunate chief's own account be\r\ntrue, he had more reasons than one for expecting some favour from the\r\nEarl, who had in secret advised and encouraged him to many of the\r\ndesperate actions for which he was now called to so severe a reckoning.\r\nBut Argyle, as old Birrell expresses himself, kept a Highlandman's\r\npromise with them, fulfilling it to the ear, and breaking it to the\r\nsense. MacGregor was sent under a strong guard to the frontier of\r\nEngland, and being thus, in the literal sense, sent out of Scotland,\r\nArgyle was judged to have kept faith with him, though the same party\r\nwhich took him there brought him back to Edinburgh in custody.\r\n\r\nMacGregor of Glenstrae was tried before the Court of Justiciary, 20th\r\nJanuary 1604, and found guilty. He appears to have been instantly\r\nconveyed from the bar to the gallows; for Birrell, of the same date,\r\nreports that he was hanged at the Cross, and, for distinction sake, was\r\nsuspended higher by his own height than two of his kindred and friends.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February following, more men of the MacGregors were\r\nexecuted, after a long imprisonment, and several others in the beginning\r\nof March.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Argyle's service, in conducting to the surrender of the\r\ninsolent and wicked race and name of MacGregor, notorious common\r\nmalefactors, and in the in-bringing of MacGregor, with a great many of\r\nthe leading men of the clan, worthily executed to death for their\r\noffences, is thankfully acknowledged by an Act of Parliament, 1607, chap.\r\n16, and rewarded with a grant of twenty chalders of victual out of the\r\nlands of Kintire.\r\n\r\nThe MacGregors, notwithstanding the letters of fire and sword, and orders\r\nfor military execution repeatedly directed against them by the Scottish\r\nlegislature, who apparently lost all the calmness of conscious dignity\r\nand security, and could not even name the outlawed clan without\r\nvituperation, showed no inclination to be blotted out of the roll of\r\nclanship. They submitted to the law, indeed, so far as to take the names\r\nof the neighbouring families amongst whom they happened to live,\r\nnominally becoming, as the case might render it most convenient,\r\nDrummonds, Campbells, Grahams, Buchanans, Stewarts, and the like; but to\r\nall intents and purposes of combination and mutual attachment, they\r\nremained the clan Gregor, united together for right or wrong, and\r\nmenacing with the general vengeance of their race, all who committed\r\naggressions against any individual of their number.\r\n\r\nThey continued to take and give offence with as little hesitation as\r\nbefore the legislative dispersion which had been attempted, as appears\r\nfrom the preamble to statute 1633, chapter 30, setting forth, that the\r\nclan Gregor, which had been suppressed and reduced to quietness by the\r\ngreat care of the late King James of eternal memory, had nevertheless\r\nbroken out again, in the counties of Perth, Stirling, Clackmannan,\r\nMonteith, Lennox, Angus, and Mearns; for which reason the statute\r\nre-establishes the disabilities attached to the clan, and, grants a new\r\ncommission for enforcing the laws against that wicked and rebellious\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extreme severities of King James I. and Charles I.\r\nagainst this unfortunate people, who were rendered furious by\r\nproscription, and then punished for yielding to the passions which had\r\nbeen wilfully irritated, the MacGregors to a man attached themselves\r\nduring the civil war to the cause of the latter monarch. Their bards have\r\nascribed this to the native respect of the MacGregors for the crown of\r\nScotland, which their ancestors once wore, and have appealed to their\r\narmorial bearings, which display a pine-tree crossed saltire wise with a\r\nnaked sword, the point of which supports a royal crown. But, without\r\ndenying that such motives may have had their weight, we are disposed to\r\nthink, that a war which opened the low country to the raids of the clan\r\nGregor would have more charms for them than any inducement to espouse the\r\ncause of the Covenanters, which would have brought them into contact with\r\nHighlanders as fierce as themselves, and having as little to lose.\r\nPatrick MacGregor, their leader, was the son of a distinguished chief,\r\nnamed Duncan Abbarach, to whom Montrose wrote letters as to his trusty\r\nand special friend, expressing his reliance on his devoted loyalty, with\r\nan assurance, that when once his Majesty's affairs were placed upon a\r\npermanent footing, the grievances of the clan MacGregor should be\r\nredressed.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent period of these melancholy times, we find the clan Gregor\r\nclaiming the immunities of other tribes, when summoned by the Scottish\r\nParliament to resist the invasion of the Commonwealth's army, in 1651. On\r\nthe last day of March in that year, a supplication to the King and\r\nParliament, from Calum MacCondachie Vich Euen, and Euen MacCondachie\r\nEuen, in their own name, and that of the whole name of MacGregor, set\r\nforth, that while, in obedience to the orders of Parliament, enjoining\r\nall clans to come out in the present service under their chieftains, for\r\nthe defence of religion, king, and kingdoms, the petitioners were drawing\r\ntheir men to guard the passes at the head of the river Forth, they were\r\ninterfered with by the Earl of Athole and the Laird of Buchanan, who had\r\nrequired the attendance of many of the clan Gregor upon their arrays.\r\nThis interference was, doubtless, owing to the change of name, which\r\nseems to have given rise to the claim of the Earl of Athole and the Laird\r\nof Buchanan to muster the MacGregors under their banners, as Murrays or\r\nBuchanans. It does not appear that the petition of the MacGregors, to be\r\npermitted to come out in a body, as other clans, received any answer. But\r\nupon the Restoration, King Charles, in the first Scottish Parliament of\r\nhis reign (statute 1661, chap. 195), annulled the various acts against\r\nthe clan Gregor, and restored them to the full use of their family name,\r\nand the other privileges of liege subjects, setting forth, as a reason\r\nfor this lenity, that those who were formerly designed MacGregors had,\r\nduring the late troubles, conducted themselves with such loyalty and\r\naffection to his Majesty, as might justly wipe off all memory of former\r\nmiscarriages, and take away all marks of reproach for the same.\r\n\r\nIt is singular enough, that it seems to have aggravated the feelings of\r\nthe non-conforming Presbyterians, when the penalties which were most\r\nunjustly imposed upon themselves were relaxed towards the poor\r\nMacGregors;--so little are the best men, any more than the worst, able to\r\njudge with impartiality of the same measures, as applied to themselves,\r\nor to others. Upon the Restoration, an influence inimical to this\r\nunfortunate clan, said to be the same with that which afterwards dictated\r\nthe massacre of Glencoe, occasioned the re-enaction of the penal statutes\r\nagainst the MacGregors. There are no reasons given why these highly penal\r\nacts should have been renewed; nor is it alleged that the clan had been\r\nguilty of late irregularities. Indeed, there is some reason to think that\r\nthe clause was formed of set purpose, in a shape which should elude\r\nobservation; for, though containing conclusions fatal to the rights of so\r\nmany Scottish subjects, it is neither mentioned in the title nor the\r\nrubric of the Act of Parliament in which it occurs, and is thrown briefly\r\nin at the close of the statute 1693, chap. 61, entitled, an Act for the\r\nJusticiary in the Highlands.\r\n\r\nIt does not, however, appear that after the Revolution the acts against\r\nthe clan were severely enforced; and in the latter half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, they were not enforced at all. Commissioners of supply were\r\nnamed in Parliament by the proscribed title of MacGregor, and decrees of\r\ncourts of justice were pronounced, and legal deeds entered into, under\r\nthe same appellative. The MacGregors, however, while the laws continued\r\nin the statute-book, still suffered under the deprivation of the name\r\nwhich was their birthright, and some attempts were made for the purpose\r\nof adopting another, MacAlpine or Grant being proposed as the title of\r\nthe whole clan in future. No agreement, however, could be entered into;\r\nand the evil was submitted to as a matter of necessity, until full\r\nredress was obtained from the British Parliament, by an act abolishing\r\nfor ever the penal statutes which had been so long imposed upon this\r\nancient race. This statute, well merited by the services of many a\r\ngentleman of the clan in behalf of their King and country, was passed,\r\nand the clan proceeded to act upon it with the same spirit of ancient\r\ntimes, which had made them suffer severely under a deprivation that would\r\nhave been deemed of little consequence by a great part of their\r\nfellow-subjects.\r\n\r\nThey entered into a deed recognising John Murray of Lanrick, Esq.\r\n(afterwards Sir John MacGregor, Baronet), representative of the family of\r\nGlencarnock, as lawfully descended from the ancient stock and blood of\r\nthe Lairds and Lords of MacGregor, and therefore acknowledged him as\r\ntheir chief on all lawful occasions and causes whatsoever. The deed was\r\nsubscribed by eight hundred and twenty-six persons of the name of\r\nMacGregor, capable of bearing arms. A great many of the clan during the\r\nlast war formed themselves into what was called the Clan Alpine Regiment,\r\nraised in 1799, under the command of their Chief and his brother Colonel\r\nMacGregor.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly noticed the history of this clan, which presents a rare\r\nand interesting example of the indelible character of the patriarchal\r\nsystem, the author must now offer some notices of the individual who\r\ngives name to these volumes.\r\n\r\nIn giving an account of a Highlander, his pedigree is first to be\r\nconsidered. That of Rob Roy was deduced from Ciar Mhor, the great\r\nmouse-coloured man, who is accused by tradition of having slain the young\r\nstudents at the battle of Glenfruin.\r\n\r\nWithout puzzling ourselves and our readers with the intricacies of\r\nHighland genealogy, it is enough to say, that after the death of Allaster\r\nMacGregor of Glenstrae, the clan, discouraged by the unremitting\r\npersecution of their enemies, seem not to have had the means of placing\r\nthemselves under the command of a single chief. According to their places\r\nof residence and immediate descent, the several families were led and\r\ndirected by _Chieftains,_ which, in the Highland acceptation, signifies\r\nthe head of a particular branch of a tribe, in opposition to _Chief,_ who\r\nis the leader and commander of the whole name.\r\n\r\nThe family and descendants of Dugald Ciar Mhor lived chiefly in the\r\nmountains between Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, and occupied a good deal\r\nof property there--whether by sufferance, by the right of the sword,\r\nwhich it was never safe to dispute with them, or by legal titles of\r\nvarious kinds, it would be useless to inquire and unnecessary to detail.\r\nEnough;--there they certainly were--a people whom their most powerful\r\nneighbours were desirous to conciliate, their friendship in peace being\r\nvery necessary to the quiet of the vicinage, and their assistance in war\r\nequally prompt and effectual.\r\n\r\nRob Roy MacGregor Campbell, which last name he bore in consequence of the\r\nActs of Parliament abolishing his own, was the younger son of Donald\r\nMacGregor of Glengyle, said to have been a Lieutenant-Colonel (probably\r\nin the service of James II.), by his wife, a daughter of Campbell of\r\nGlenfalloch. Rob's own designation was of Inversnaid; but he appears to\r\nhave acquired a right of some kind or other to the property or possession\r\nof Craig Royston, a domain of rock and forest, lying on the east side of\r\nLoch Lomond, where that beautiful lake stretches into the dusky mountains\r\nof Glenfalloch.\r\n\r\nThe time of his birth is uncertain. But he is said to have been active in\r\nthe scenes of war and plunder which succeeded the Revolution; and\r\ntradition affirms him to have been the leader in a predatory incursion\r\ninto the parish of Kippen, in the Lennox, which took place in the year\r\n1691. It was of almost a bloodless character, only one person losing his\r\nlife; but from the extent of the depredation, it was long distinguished\r\nby the name of the Her'-ship, or devastation, of Kippen.* The time of his\r\ndeath is also uncertain, but as he is said to have survived the year\r\n1733, and died an aged man, it is probable he may have been twenty-five\r\nabout the time of the Her'-ship of Kippen, which would assign his birth\r\nto the middle of the 17th century.\r\n\r\n* See _Statistcal Account of Scotland,_ 1st edition, vol. xviii. p. 332.\r\nParish of * Kippen.\r\n\r\nIn the more quiet times which succeeded the Revolution, Rob Roy, or Red\r\nRobert, seems to have exerted his active talents, which were of no mean\r\norder, as a drover, or trader in cattle, to a great extent. It may well\r\nbe supposed that in those days no Lowland, much less English drovers,\r\nventured to enter the Highlands. The cattle, which were the staple\r\ncommodity of the mountains, were escorted down to fairs, on the borders\r\nof the Lowlands, by a party of Highlanders, with their arms rattling\r\naround them; and who dealt, however, in all honour and good faith with\r\ntheir Southern customers. A fray, indeed, would sometimes arise, when the\r\nLowlandmen, chiefly Borderers, who had to supply the English market, used\r\nto dip their bonnets in the next brook, and wrapping them round their\r\nhands, oppose their cudgels to the naked broadswords, which had not\r\nalways the superiority. I have heard from aged persons who had been\r\nengaged in such affrays, that the Highlanders used remarkably fair play,\r\nnever using the point of the sword, far less their pistols or daggers; so\r\nthat\r\n\r\n               With many a stiff thwack and many a bang,\r\n                   Hard crabtree and cold iron rang.\r\n\r\nA slash or two, or a broken head, was easily accommodated, and as the\r\ntrade was of benefit to both parties, trifling skirmishes were not\r\nallowed to interrupt its harmony. Indeed it was of vital interest to the\r\nHighlanders, whose income, so far as derived from their estates, depended\r\nentirely on the sale of black cattle; and a sagacious and experienced\r\ndealer benefited not only himself, but his friends and neighbours, by his\r\nspeculations. Those of Rob Roy were for several years so successful as to\r\ninspire general confidence, and raise him in the estimation of the\r\ncountry in which he resided.\r\n\r\nHis importance was increased by the death of his father, in consequence\r\nof which he succeeded to the management of his nephew Gregor MacGregor of\r\nGlengyle's property, and, as his tutor, to such influence with the clan\r\nand following as was due to the representative of Dugald Ciar. Such\r\ninfluence was the more uncontrolled, that this family of the MacGregors\r\nseemed to have refused adherence to MacGregor of Glencarnock, the\r\nancestor of the present Sir Ewan MacGregor, and asserted a kind of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Rob Roy acquired an interest by purchase,\r\nwadset, or otherwise, to the property of Craig Royston already mentioned.\r\nHe was in particular favour, during this prosperous period of his life,\r\nwith his nearest and most powerful neighbour, James, first Duke of\r\nMontrose, from whom he received many marks of regard. His Grace consented\r\nto give his nephew and himself a right of property on the estates of\r\nGlengyle and Inversnaid, which they had till then only held as kindly\r\ntenants. The Duke also, with a view to the interest of the country and\r\nhis own estate, supported our adventurer by loans of money to a\r\nconsiderable amount, to enable him to carry on his speculations in the\r\ncattle trade.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that species of commerce was and is liable to sudden\r\nfluctuations; and Rob Roy was, by a sudden depression of markets, and, as\r\na friendly tradition adds, by the bad faith of a partner named MacDonald,\r\nwhom he had imprudently received into his confidence, and intrusted with\r\na considerable sum of money, rendered totally insolvent. He absconded, of\r\ncourse--not empty-handed, if it be true, as stated in an advertisement\r\nfor his apprehension, that he had in his possession sums to the amount of\r\nL1000 sterling, obtained from several noblemen and gentlemen under\r\npretence of purchasing cows for them in the Highlands. This advertisement\r\nappeared in June 1712, and was several times repeated. It fixes the\r\nperiod when Rob Roy exchanged his commercial adventures for speculations\r\nof a very different complexion.*\r\n\r\n* See Appendix, No. I.\r\n\r\nHe appears at this period first to have removed from his ordinary\r\ndwelling at Inversnaid, ten or twelve Scots miles (which is double the\r\nnumber of English) farther into the Highlands, and commenced the lawless\r\nsort of life which he afterwards followed. The Duke of Montrose, who\r\nconceived himself deceived and cheated by MacGregor's conduct, employed\r\nlegal means to recover the money lent to him. Rob Roy's landed property\r\nwas attached by the regular form of legal procedure, and his stock and\r\nfurniture made the subject of arrest and sale.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this diligence of the law, as it is called in Scotland,\r\nwhich the English more bluntly term distress, was used in this case with\r\nuncommon severity, and that the legal satellites, not usually the\r\ngentlest persons in the world, had insulted MacGregor's wife, in a manner\r\nwhich would have aroused a milder man than he to thoughts of unbounded\r\nvengeance. She was a woman of fierce and haughty temper, and is not\r\nunlikely to have disturbed the officers in the execution of their duty,\r\nand thus to have incurred ill treatment, though, for the sake of\r\nhumanity, it is to be hoped that the story sometimes told is a popular\r\nexaggeration. It is certain that she felt extreme anguish at being\r\nexpelled from the banks of Loch Lomond, and gave vent to her feelings in\r\na fine piece of pipe-music, still well known to amateurs by the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy's Lament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fugitive is thought to have found his first place of refuge in Glen\r\nDochart, under the Earl of Breadalbane's protection; for, though that\r\nfamily had been active agents in the destruction of the MacGregors in\r\nformer times, they had of late years sheltered a great many of the name\r\nin their old possessions. The Duke of Argyle was also one of Rob Roy's\r\nprotectors, so far as to afford him, according to the Highland phrase,\r\nwood and water--the shelter, namely, that is afforded by the forests and\r\nlakes of an inaccessible country.\r\n\r\nThe great men of the Highlands in that time, besides being anxiously\r\nambitious to keep up what was called their Following, or military\r\nretainers, were also desirous to have at their disposal men of resolute\r\ncharacter, to whom the world and the world's law were no friends, and who\r\nmight at times ravage the lands or destroy the tenants of a feudal enemy,\r\nwithout bringing responsibility on their patrons. The strife between the\r\nnames of Campbell and Graham, during the civil wars of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, had been stamped with mutual loss and inveterate enmity. The\r\ndeath of the great Marquis of Montrose on the one side, the defeat at\r\nInverlochy, and cruel plundering of Lorn, on the other, were reciprocal\r\ninjuries not likely to be forgotten. Rob Roy was, therefore, sure of\r\nrefuge in the country of the Campbells, both as having assumed their\r\nname, as connected by his mother with the family of Glenfalloch, and as\r\nan enemy to the rival house of Montrose. The extent of Argyle's\r\npossessions, and the power of retreating thither in any emergency, gave\r\ngreat encouragement to the bold schemes of revenge which he had adopted.\r\n\r\nThis was nothing short of the maintenance of a predatory war against the\r\nDuke of Montrose, whom he considered as the author of his exclusion from\r\ncivil society, and of the outlawry to which he had been sentenced by\r\nletters of horning and caption (legal writs so called), as well as the\r\nseizure of his goods, and adjudication of his landed property. Against\r\nhis Grace, therefore, his tenants, friends, allies, and relatives, he\r\ndisposed himself to employ every means of annoyance in his power; and\r\nthough this was a circle sufficiently extensive for active depredation,\r\nRob, who professed himself a Jacobite, took the liberty of extending his\r\nsphere of operations against all whom he chose to consider as friendly to\r\nthe revolutionary government, or to that most obnoxious of measures--the\r\nUnion of the Kingdoms. Under one or other of these pretexts, all his\r\nneighbours of the Lowlands who had anything to lose, or were unwilling to\r\ncompound for security by paying him an annual sum for protection or\r\nforbearance, were exposed to his ravages.\r\n\r\nThe country in which this private warfare, or system of depredation, was\r\nto be carried on, was, until opened up by roads, in the highest degree\r\nfavourable for his purpose. It was broken up into narrow valleys, the\r\nhabitable part of which bore no proportion to the huge wildernesses of\r\nforest, rocks, and precipices by which they were encircled, and which\r\nwas, moreover, full of inextricable passes, morasses, and natural\r\nstrengths, unknown to any but the inhabitants themselves, where a few men\r\nacquainted with the ground were capable, with ordinary address, of\r\nbaffling the pursuit of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe opinions and habits of the nearest neighbours to the Highland line\r\nwere also highly favourable to Rob Roy's purpose. A large proportion of\r\nthem were of his own clan of MacGregor, who claimed the property of\r\nBalquhidder, and other Highland districts, as having been part of the\r\nancient possessions of their tribe; though the harsh laws, under the\r\nseverity of which they had suffered so deeply, had assigned the ownership\r\nto other families. The civil wars of the seventeenth century had\r\naccustomed these men to the use of arms, and they were peculiarly brave\r\nand fierce from remembrance of their sufferings. The vicinity of a\r\ncomparatively rich Lowland district gave also great temptations to\r\nincursion. Many belonging to other clans, habituated to contempt of\r\nindustry, and to the use of arms, drew towards an unprotected frontier\r\nwhich promised facility of plunder; and the state of the country, now so\r\npeaceable and quiet, verified at that time the opinion which Dr. Johnson\r\nheard with doubt and suspicion, that the most disorderly and lawless\r\ndistricts of the Highlands were those which lay nearest to the Lowland\r\nline. There was, therefore, no difficulty in Rob Roy, descended of a\r\ntribe which was widely dispersed in the country we have described,\r\ncollecting any number of followers whom he might be able to keep in\r\naction, and to maintain by his proposed operations.\r\n\r\nHe himself appears to have been singularly adapted for the profession\r\nwhich he proposed to exercise. His stature was not of the tallest, but\r\nhis person was uncommonly strong and compact. The greatest peculiarities\r\nof his frame were the breadth of his shoulders, and the great and almost\r\ndisproportionate length of his arms; so remarkable, indeed, that it was\r\nsaid he could, without stooping, tie the garters of his Highland hose,\r\nwhich are placed two inches below the knee. His countenance was open,\r\nmanly, stern at periods of danger, but frank and cheerful in his hours of\r\nfestivity. His hair was dark red, thick, and frizzled, and curled short\r\naround the face. His fashion of dress showed, of course, the knees and\r\nupper part of the leg, which was described to me, as resembling that of a\r\nHighland bull, hirsute, with red hair, and evincing muscular strength\r\nsimilar to that animal. To these personal qualifications must be added a\r\nmasterly use of the Highland sword, in which his length of arm gave him\r\ngreat advantage--and a perfect and intimate knowledge of all the recesses\r\nof the wild country in which he harboured, and the character of the\r\nvarious individuals, whether friendly or hostile, with whom he might come\r\nin contact.\r\n\r\nHis mental qualities seem to have been no less adapted to the\r\ncircumstances in which he was placed. Though the descendant of the\r\nblood-thirsty Ciar Mhor, he inherited none of his ancestor's ferocity. On\r\nthe contrary, Rob Roy avoided every appearance of cruelty, and it is not\r\naverred that he was ever the means of unnecessary bloodshed, or the actor\r\nin any deed which could lead the way to it. His schemes of plunder were\r\ncontrived and executed with equal boldness and sagacity, and were almost\r\nuniversally successful, from the skill with which they were laid, and the\r\nsecrecy and rapidity with which they were executed. Like Robin Hood of\r\nEngland, he was a kind and gentle robber,--and, while he took from the\r\nrich, was liberal in relieving the poor. This might in part be policy;\r\nbut the universal tradition of the country speaks it to have arisen from\r\na better motive. All whom I have conversed with, and I have in my youth\r\nseen some who knew Rob Roy personally, give him the character of a\r\nbenevolent and humane man \xe2\x80\x9cin his way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis ideas of morality were those of an Arab chief, being such as\r\nnaturally arose out of his wild education. Supposing Rob Roy to have\r\nargued on the tendency of the life which he pursued, whether from choice\r\nor from necessity, he would doubtless have assumed to himself the\r\ncharacter of a brave man, who, deprived of his natural rights by the\r\npartiality of laws, endeavoured to assert them by the strong hand of\r\nnatural power; and he is most felicitously described as reasoning thus,\r\nin the high-toned poetry of my gifted friend Wordsworth:\r\n\r\n                 Say, then, that he was wise as brave,\r\n                 As wise in thought as bold in deed;\r\n                     For in the principles of things\r\n                      _He_ sought his moral creed.\r\n\r\n                 Said generous Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat need of Books?\r\n                 Burn all the statutes and their shelves!\r\n                     They stir us up against our kind,\r\n                     And worse, against ourselves.\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a passion, make a law,\r\n                    Too false to guide us or control;\r\n                    And for the law itself we fight\r\n                    In bitterness of soul.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cAnd puzzled, blinded, then we lose\r\n                 Distinctions that are plain and few;\r\n                       These find I graven on my heart,\r\n                       That tells me what to do.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cThe creatures see of flood and field,\r\n                     And those that travel on the wind\r\n                 With them no strife can last; they live\r\n                    In peace, and peace of mind.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cFor why? Because the good old rule\r\n                    Sufficeth them; the simple plan,\r\n                That they should take who have the power,\r\n                    And they should keep who can.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cA lesson which is quickly learn'd,\r\n                    A signal through which all can see;\r\n                Thus, nothing here provokes the strong\r\n                           To wanton cruelty.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cAnd freakishness of mind is check'd,\r\n                    He tamed who foolishly aspires,\r\n                While to the measure of his might\r\n                       Each fashions his desires.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cAll kinds and creatures stand and fall\r\n                    By strength of prowess or of wit;\r\n               'Tis God's appointment who must sway,\r\n                         And who is to submit.\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9cSince then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin, \xe2\x80\x9cright is plain,\r\n                    And longest life is but a day,\r\n               To have my ends, maintain my rights,\r\n                      I'll take the shortest way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n               And thus among these rocks he lived,\r\n               Through summer's heat and winter's snow\r\n\r\n                        The eagle, he was lord above,\r\n                        And Rob was lord below.\r\n\r\nWe are not, however, to suppose the character of this distinguished\r\noutlaw to be that of an actual hero, acting uniformly and consistently on\r\nsuch moral principles as the illustrious bard who, standing by his grave,\r\nhas vindicated his fame. On the contrary, as is common with barbarous\r\nchiefs, Rob Roy appears to have mixed his professions of principle with a\r\nlarge alloy of craft and dissimulation, of which his conduct during the\r\ncivil war is sufficient proof. It is also said, and truly, that although\r\nhis courtesy was one of his strongest characteristics, yet sometimes he\r\nassumed an arrogance of manner which was not easily endured by the\r\nhigh-spirited men to whom it was addressed, and drew the daring outlaw\r\ninto frequent disputes, from which he did not always come off with\r\ncredit. From this it has been inferred, that Rob Roy was more of a bully\r\nthan a hero, or at least that he had, according to the common phrase, his\r\nfighting days. Some aged men who knew him well, have described him also\r\nas better at a _taich-tulzie,_ or scuffle within doors, than in mortal\r\ncombat. The tenor of his life may be quoted to repel this charge; while,\r\nat the same time, it must be allowed, that the situation in which he was\r\nplaced rendered him prudently averse to maintaining quarrels, where\r\nnothing was to be had save blows, and where success would have raised up\r\nagainst him new and powerful enemies, in a country where revenge was\r\nstill considered as a duty rather than a crime. The power of commanding\r\nhis passions on such occasions, far from being inconsistent with the part\r\nwhich MacGregor had to perform, was essentially necessary, at the period\r\nwhen he lived, to prevent his career from being cut short.\r\n\r\nI may here mention one or two occasions on which Rob Roy appears to have\r\ngiven way in the manner alluded to. My late venerable friend, John Ramsay\r\nof Ochtertyre, alike eminent as a classical scholar and as an authentic\r\nregister of the ancient history and manners of Scotland, informed me,\r\nthat on occasion of a public meeting at a bonfire in the town of Doune,\r\nRob Roy gave some offence to James Edmondstone of Newton, the same\r\ngentleman who was unfortunately concerned in the slaughter of Lord Rollo\r\n(see Maclaurin's Criminal Trials, No. IX.), when Edmondstone compelled\r\nMacGregor to quit the town on pain of being thrown by him into the\r\nbonfire. \xe2\x80\x9cI broke one off your ribs on a former occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nnow, Rob, if you provoke me farther, I will break your neck.\xe2\x80\x9d But it must\r\nbe remembered that Edmondstone was a man of consequence in the Jacobite\r\nparty, as he carried the royal standard of James VII. at the battle of\r\nSheriffmuir, and also, that he was near the door of his own\r\nmansion-house, and probably surrounded by his friends and adherents. Rob\r\nRoy, however, suffered in reputation for retiring under such a threat.\r\n\r\nAnother well-vouched case is that of Cunningham of Boquhan.\r\n\r\nHenry Cunningham, Esq. of Boquhan, was a gentleman of Stirlingshire, who,\r\nlike many _exquisites_ of our own time, united a natural high spirit and\r\ndaring character with an affectation of delicacy of address and manners\r\namounting to foppery.*\r\n\r\n* His courage and affectation of foppery were united, which is less\r\nfrequently the case, with a spirit of innate modesty. He is thus\r\ndescribed in Lord Binning's satirical verses, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cArgyle's Levee:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cSix times had Harry bowed unseen,\r\n                        Before he dared advance;\r\n                   The Duke then, turning round well pleased,\r\n                        Said, 'Sure you've been in France!\r\n                   A more polite and jaunty man\r\n                        I never saw before:'\r\n                   Then Harry bowed, and blushed, and bowed,\r\n                        And strutted to the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSee a Collection of original Poems, by Scotch Gentlemen, vol. ii. p. 125.\r\n\r\nHe chanced to be in company with Rob Roy, who, either in contempt of\r\nBoquhan's supposed effeminacy, or because he thought him a safe person to\r\nfix a quarrel on (a point which Rob's enemies alleged he was wont to\r\nconsider), insulted him so grossly that a challenge passed between them.\r\nThe goodwife of the clachan had hidden Cunningham's sword, and while he\r\nrummaged the house in quest of his own or some other, Rob Roy went to the\r\nShieling Hill, the appointed place of combat, and paraded there with\r\ngreat majesty, waiting for his antagonist. In the meantime, Cunningham\r\nhad rummaged out an old sword, and, entering the ground of contest in all\r\nhaste, rushed on the outlaw with such unexpected fury that he fairly\r\ndrove him off the field, nor did he show himself in the village again for\r\nsome time. Mr. MacGregor Stirling has a softened account of this anecdote\r\nin his new edition of Nimmo's Stirlingshire; still he records Rob Roy's\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Rob Roy suffered disasters, and incurred great personal\r\ndanger. On one remarkable occasion he was saved by the coolness of his\r\nlieutenant, Macanaleister or Fletcher, the _Little John_ of his band--a\r\nfine active fellow, of course, and celebrated as a marksman. It happened\r\nthat MacGregor and his party had been surprised and dispersed by a\r\nsuperior force of horse and foot, and the word was given to \xe2\x80\x9csplit and\r\nsquander.\xe2\x80\x9d Each shifted for himself, but a bold dragoon attached himself\r\nto pursuit of Rob, and overtaking him, struck at him with his broadsword.\r\nA plate of iron in his bonnet saved the MacGregor from being cut down to\r\nthe teeth; but the blow was heavy enough to bear him to the ground,\r\ncrying as he fell, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Macanaleister, is there naething in her?\xe2\x80\x9d (_i.e._\r\nin the gun). The trooper, at the same time, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cD--n ye, your\r\nmother never wrought your night-cap!\xe2\x80\x9d had his arm raised for a second\r\nblow, when Macanaleister fired, and the ball pierced the dragoon's heart.\r\n\r\nSuch as he was, Rob Roy's progress in his occupation is thus described by\r\na gentleman of sense and talent, who resided within the circle of his\r\npredatory wars, had probably felt their effects, and speaks of them, as\r\nmight be expected, with little of the forbearance with which, from their\r\npeculiar and romantic character, they are now regarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man (Rob Roy MacGregor) was a person of sagacity, and neither\r\nwanted stratagem nor address; and having abandoned himself to all\r\nlicentiousness, set himself at the head of all the loose, vagrant, and\r\ndesperate people of that clan, in the west end of Perth and Stirling\r\nshires, and infested those whole countries with thefts, robberies, and\r\ndepredations. Very few who lived within his reach (that is, within the\r\ndistance of a nocturnal expedition) could promise to themselves security,\r\neither for their persons or effects, without subjecting themselves to pay\r\nhim a heavy and shameful tax of _black-mail._ He at last proceeded to\r\nsuch a degree of audaciousness that he committed robberies, raised\r\ncontributions, and resented quarrels, at the head of a very considerable\r\nbody of armed men, in open day, and in the face of the government.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* Mr. Grahame of Gartmore's Causes of the Disturbances in the Highlands.\r\nSee Jamieson's edition of Burt's Letters from the North of Scotland,\r\nAppendix, vol. ii. p. 348.\r\n\r\nThe extent and success of these depredations cannot be surprising, when\r\nwe consider that the scene of them was laid in a country where the\r\ngeneral law was neither enforced nor respected.\r\n\r\nHaving recorded that the general habit of cattle-stealing had blinded\r\neven those of the better classes to the infamy of the practice, and that\r\nas men's property consisted entirely in herds, it was rendered in the\r\nhighest degree precarious, Mr. Grahame adds--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn these accounts there is no culture of ground, no improvement of\r\npastures, and from the same reasons, no manufactures, no trade; in short,\r\nno industry. The people are extremely prolific, and therefore so\r\nnumerous, that there is not business in that country, according to its\r\npresent order and economy, for the one-half of them. Every place is full\r\nof idle people, accustomed to arms, and lazy in everything but rapines\r\nand depredations. As _buddel_ or _aquavitae_ houses are to be found\r\neverywhere through the country, so in these they saunter away their time,\r\nand frequently consume there the returns of their illegal purchases. Here\r\nthe laws have never been executed, nor the authority of the magistrate\r\never established. Here the officer of the law neither dare nor can\r\nexecute his duty, and several places are about thirty miles from lawful\r\npersons. In short, here is no order, no authority, no government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe period of the rebellion, 1715, approached soon after Rob Roy had\r\nattained celebrity. His Jacobite partialities were now placed in\r\nopposition to his sense of the obligations which he owed to the indirect\r\nprotection of the Duke of Argyle. But the desire of \xe2\x80\x9cdrowning his\r\nsounding steps amid the din of general war\xe2\x80\x9d induced him to join the\r\nforces of the Earl of Mar, although his patron the Duke of Argyle was at\r\nthe head of the army opposed to the Highland insurgents.\r\n\r\nThe MacGregors, a large sept of them at least, that of Ciar Mhor, on this\r\noccasion were not commanded by Rob Roy, but by his nephew already\r\nmentioned, Gregor MacGregor, otherwise called James Grahame of Glengyle,\r\nand still better remembered by the Gaelic epithet of _Ghlune Dhu, i.e._\r\nBlack Knee, from a black spot on one of his knees, which his Highland\r\ngarb rendered visible. There can be no question, however, that being then\r\nvery young, Glengyle must have acted on most occasions by the advice and\r\ndirection of so experienced a leader as his uncle.\r\n\r\nThe MacGregors assembled in numbers at that period, and began even to\r\nthreaten the Lowlands towards the lower extremity of Loch Lomond. They\r\nsuddenly seized all the boats which were upon the lake, and, probably\r\nwith a view to some enterprise of their own, drew them overland to\r\nInversnaid, in order to intercept the progress of a large body of\r\nwest-country whigs who were in arms for the government, and moving in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nThe whigs made an excursion for the recovery of the boats. Their forces\r\nconsisted of volunteers from Paisley, Kilpatrick, and elsewhere, who,\r\nwith the assistance of a body of seamen, were towed up the river Leven in\r\nlong-boats belonging to the ships of war then lying in the Clyde. At Luss\r\nthey were joined by the forces of Sir Humphrey Colquhoun, and James\r\nGrant, his son-in-law, with their followers, attired in the Highland\r\ndress of the period, which is picturesquely described.* The whole party\r\ncrossed to Craig-Royston, but the MacGregors did not offer combat.\r\n\r\n* \xe2\x80\x9cAt night they arrived at Luss, where they were joined by Sir Humphrey\r\nColquhoun of Luss, and James Grant of Plascander, his son-in-law,\r\nfollowed by forty or fifty stately fellows in their short hose and belted\r\nplaids, armed each of them with a well-fixed gun on his shoulder, a\r\nstrong handsome target, with a sharp-pointed steel of above half an ell\r\nin length screwed into the navel of it, on his left arm, a sturdy\r\nclaymore by his side, and a pistol or two, with a dirk and knife, in his\r\nbelt.\xe2\x80\x9d--_Rae's History of the Rebellion,_ 4to, p. 287.\r\n\r\nIf we are to believe the account of the expedition given by the historian\r\nRae, they leapt on shore at Craig-Royston with the utmost intrepidity, no\r\nenemy appearing to oppose them, and by the noise of their drums, which\r\nthey beat incessantly, and the discharge of their artillery and small\r\narms, terrified the MacGregors, whom they appear never to have seen, out\r\nof their fastnesses, and caused them to fly in a panic to the general\r\ncamp of the Highlanders at Strath-Fillan.* The low-country men succeeded\r\nin getting possession of the boats at a great expenditure of noise and\r\ncourage, and little risk of danger.\r\n\r\n* Note C. The Loch Lomond Expedition.\r\n\r\nAfter this temporary removal from his old haunts, Rob Roy was sent by the\r\nEarl of Mar to Aberdeen, to raise, it is believed, a part of the clan\r\nGregor, which is settled in that country. These men were of his own\r\nfamily (the race of the Ciar Mhor). They were the descendants of about\r\nthree hundred MacGregors whom the Earl of Murray, about the year 1624,\r\ntransported from his estates in Menteith to oppose against his enemies\r\nthe MacIntoshes, a race as hardy and restless as they were themselves.\r\n\r\nBut while in the city of Aberdeen, Rob Roy met a relation of a very\r\ndifferent class and character from those whom he was sent to summon to\r\narms. This was Dr. James Gregory (by descent a MacGregor), the patriarch\r\nof a dynasty of professors distinguished for literary and scientific\r\ntalent, and the grandfather of the late eminent physician and\r\naccomplished scholar, Professor Gregory of Edinburgh. This gentleman was\r\nat the time Professor of Medicine in King's College, Aberdeen, and son of\r\nDr. James Gregory, distinguished in science as the inventor of the\r\nreflecting telescope. With such a family it may seem our friend Rob could\r\nhave had little communion. But civil war is a species of misery which\r\nintroduces men to strange bed-fellows. Dr. Gregory thought it a point of\r\nprudence to claim kindred, at so critical a period, with a man so\r\nformidable and influential. He invited Rob Roy to his house, and treated\r\nhim with so much kindness, that he produced in his generous bosom a\r\ndegree of gratitude which seemed likely to occasion very inconvenient\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nThe Professor had a son about eight or nine years old,--a lively, stout\r\nboy of his age,--with whose appearance our Highland Robin Hood was much\r\ntaken. On the day before his departure from the house of his learned\r\nrelative, Rob Roy, who had pondered deeply how he might requite his\r\ncousin's kindness, took Dr. Gregory aside, and addressed him to this\r\npurport:--\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear kinsman, I have been thinking what I could do to show\r\nmy sense of your hospitality. Now, here you have a fine spirited boy of a\r\nson, whom you are ruining by cramming him with your useless\r\nbook-learning, and I am determined, by way of manifesting my great\r\ngood-will to you and yours, to take him with me and make a man of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The learned Professor was utterly overwhelmed when his warlike kinsman\r\nannounced his kind purpose in language which implied no doubt of its\r\nbeing a proposal which, would be, and ought to be, accepted with the\r\nutmost gratitude. The task of apology or explanation was of a most\r\ndelicate description; and there might have been considerable danger in\r\nsuffering Rob Roy to perceive that the promotion with which he threatened\r\nthe son was, in the father's eyes, the ready road to the gallows. Indeed,\r\nevery excuse which he could at first think of--such as regret for putting\r\nhis friend to trouble with a youth who had been educated in the Lowlands,\r\nand so on--only strengthened the chieftain's inclination to patronise his\r\nyoung kinsman, as he supposed they arose entirely from the modesty of the\r\nfather. He would for a long time take no apology, and even spoke of\r\ncarrying off the youth by a certain degree of kindly violence, whether\r\nhis father consented, or not. At length the perplexed Professor pleaded\r\nthat his son was very young, and in an infirm state of health, and not\r\nyet able to endure the hardships of a mountain life; but that in another\r\nyear or two he hoped his health would be firmly established, and he would\r\nbe in a fitting condition to attend on his brave kinsman, and follow out\r\nthe splendid destinies to which he opened the way. This agreement being\r\nmade, the cousins parted,--Rob Roy pledging his honour to carry his young\r\nrelation to the hills with him on his next return to Aberdeenshire, and\r\nDr. Gregory, doubtless, praying in his secret soul that he might never\r\nsee Rob's Highland face again.\r\n\r\nJames Gregory, who thus escaped being his kinsman's recruit, and in all\r\nprobability his henchman, was afterwards Professor of Medicine in the\r\nCollege, and, like most of his family, distinguished by his scientific\r\nacquirements. He was rather of an irritable and pertinacious disposition;\r\nand his friends were wont to remark, when he showed any symptom of these\r\nfoibles, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! this comes of not having been educated by Rob Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe connection between Rob Roy and his classical kinsman did not end with\r\nthe period of Rob's transient power. At a period considerably subsequent\r\nto the year 1715, he was walking in the Castle Street of Aberdeen, arm in\r\narm with his host, Dr. James Gregory, when the drums in the barracks\r\nsuddenly beat to arms, and soldiers were seen issuing from the barracks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf these lads are turning out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, taking leave of his cousin\r\nwith great composure, \xe2\x80\x9cit is time for me to look after my safety.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he dived down a close, and, as John Bunyan says, \xe2\x80\x9cwent upon his\r\nway and was seen no more.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* The first of these anecdotes, which brings the highest pitch of\r\ncivilisation so  closely in contact with the half-savage state of\r\nsociety, I have heard told by the late distinguished Dr. Gregory; and the\r\nmembers of his family have had the kindness to collate the story with\r\ntheir recollections and family documents, and furnish the authentic\r\nparticulars. The second rests on the recollection of an old man, who was\r\npresent when Rob took French leave of his literary cousin on hearing the\r\ndrums beat, and communicated the circumstance to Mr. Alexander Forbes, a\r\nconnection of Dr. Gregory by marriage, who is still alive.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that Rob Roy's conduct during the insurrection of\r\n1715 was very equivocal. His person and followers were in the Highland\r\narmy, but his heart seems to have been with the Duke of Argyle's. Yet the\r\ninsurgents were constrained to trust to him as their only guide, when\r\nthey marched from Perth towards Dunblane, with the view of crossing the\r\nForth at what are called the Fords of Frew, and when they themselves said\r\nhe could not be relied upon.\r\n\r\nThis movement to the westward, on the part of the insurgents, brought on\r\nthe battle of Sheriffmuir--indecisive, indeed, in its immediate results,\r\nbut of which the Duke of Argyle reaped the whole advantage. In this\r\naction, it will be recollected that the right wing of the Highlanders\r\nbroke and cut to pieces Argyle's left wing, while the clans on the left\r\nof Mar's army, though consisting of Stewarts, Mackenzies, and Camerons,\r\nwere completely routed. During this medley of flight and pursuit, Rob Roy\r\nretained his station on a hill in the centre of the Highland position;\r\nand though it is said his attack might have decided the day, he could not\r\nbe prevailed upon to charge. This was the more unfortunate for the\r\ninsurgents, as the leading of a party of the Macphersons had been\r\ncommitted to MacGregor. This, it is said, was owing to the age and\r\ninfirmity of the chief of that name, who, unable to lead his clan in\r\nperson, objected to his heir-apparent, Macpherson of Nord, discharging\r\nhis duty on that occasion; so that the tribe, or a part of them, were\r\nbrigaded with their allies the MacGregors. While the favourable moment\r\nfor action was gliding away unemployed, Mar's positive orders reached Rob\r\nRoy that he should presently attack. To which he coolly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\r\nif they cannot do it without me, they cannot do it with me.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the\r\nMacphersons, named Alexander, one of Rob's original profession,\r\n_videlicet,_ a drover, but a man of great strength and spirit, was so\r\nincensed at the inactivity of this temporary leader, that he threw off\r\nhis plaid, drew his sword, and called out to his clansmen, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us endure\r\nthis no longer! if he will not lead you I will.\xe2\x80\x9d Rob Roy replied, with\r\ngreat coolness, \xe2\x80\x9cWere the question about driving Highland stots or\r\nkyloes, Sandie, I would yield to your superior skill; but as it respects\r\nthe leading of men, I must be allowed to be the better judge.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cDid the\r\nmatter respect driving Glen-Eigas stots,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Macpherson, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nquestion with Rob would not be, which was to be last, but which was to be\r\nforemost.\xe2\x80\x9d Incensed at this sarcasm, MacGregor drew his sword, and they\r\nwould have fought upon the spot if their friends on both sides had not\r\ninterfered. But the moment of attack was completely lost. Rob did not,\r\nhowever, neglect his own private interest on the occasion. In the\r\nconfusion of an undecided field of battle, he enriched his followers by\r\nplundering the baggage and the dead on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe fine old satirical ballad on the battle of Sheriffmuir does not\r\nforget to stigmatise our hero's conduct on this memorable occasion--\r\n\r\n                        Rob Roy he stood watch\r\n                        On a hill for to catch\r\n                 The booty for aught that I saw, man;\r\n                         For he ne'er advanced\r\n                 From the place where he stanced,\r\n                 Till nae mair was to do there at a', man.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sort of neutrality which Rob Roy had continued to\r\nobserve during the progress of the Rebellion, he did not escape some of\r\nits penalties. He was included in the act of attainder, and the house in\r\nBreadalbane, which was his place of retreat, was burned by General Lord\r\nCadogan, when, after the conclusion of the insurrection, he marched\r\nthrough the Highlands to disarm and punish the offending clans. But upon\r\ngoing to Inverary with about forty or fifty of his followers, Rob\r\nobtained favour, by an apparent surrender of their arms to Colonel\r\nPatrick Campbell of Finnah, who furnished them and their leader with\r\nprotections under his hand. Being thus in a great measure secured from\r\nthe resentment of government, Rob Roy established his residence at\r\nCraig-Royston, near Loch Lomond, in the midst of his own kinsmen, and\r\nlost no time in resuming his private quarrel with the Duke of Montrose.\r\nFor this purpose he soon got on foot as many men, and well armed too, as\r\nhe had yet commanded. He never stirred without a body-guard of ten or\r\ntwelve picked followers, and without much effort could increase them to\r\nfifty or sixty.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was not wanting in efforts to destroy this troublesome\r\nadversary. His Grace applied to General Carpenter, commanding the forces\r\nin Scotland, and by his orders three parties of soldiers were directed\r\nfrom the three different points of Glasgow, Stirling, and Finlarig near\r\nKillin. Mr. Graham of Killearn, the Duke of Montrose's relation and\r\nfactor, Sheriff-depute also of Dumbartonshire, accompanied the troops,\r\nthat they might act under the civil authority, and have the assistance of\r\na trusty guide well acquainted with the hills. It was the object of these\r\nseveral columns to arrive about the same time in the neighbourhood of Rob\r\nRoy's residence, and surprise him and his followers. But heavy rains, the\r\ndifficulties of the country, and the good intelligence which the Outlaw\r\nwas always supplied with, disappointed their well-concerted combination.\r\nThe troops, finding the birds were flown, avenged themselves by\r\ndestroying the nest. They burned Rob Roy's house,--though not with\r\nimpunity; for the MacGregors, concealed among the thickets and cliffs,\r\nfired on them, and killed a grenadier.\r\n\r\nRob Roy avenged himself for the loss which he sustained on this occasion\r\nby an act of singular audacity. About the middle of November 1716, John\r\nGraham of Killearn, already mentioned as factor of the Montrose family,\r\nwent to a place called Chapel Errock, where the tenants of the Duke were\r\nsummoned to appear with their termly rents. They appeared accordingly,\r\nand the factor had received ready money to the amount of about L300, when\r\nRob Roy entered the room at the head of an armed party. The Steward\r\nendeavoured to protect the Duke's property by throwing the books of\r\naccounts and money into a garret, trusting they might escape notice. But\r\nthe experienced freebooter was not to be baffled where such a prize was\r\nat stake. He recovered the books and cash, placed himself calmly in the\r\nreceipt of custom, examined the accounts, pocketed the money, and gave\r\nreceipts on the Duke's part, saying he would hold reckoning with the Duke\r\nof Montrose out of the damages which he had sustained by his Grace's\r\nmeans, in which he included the losses he had suffered, as well by the\r\nburning of his house by General Cadogan, as by the later expedition\r\nagainst Craig-Royston. He then requested Mr. Graham to attend him; nor\r\ndoes it appear that he treated him with any personal violence, or even\r\nrudeness, although he informed him he regarded him as a hostage, and\r\nmenaced rough usage in case he should be pursued, or in danger of being\r\novertaken. Few more audacious feats have been performed. After some rapid\r\nchanges of place (the fatigue attending which was the only annoyance that\r\nMr. Graham seems to have complained of), he carried his prisoner to an\r\nisland on Loch Katrine, and caused him to write to the Duke, to state\r\nthat his ransom was fixed at L3400 merks, being the balance which\r\nMacGregor pretended remained due to him, after deducting all that he owed\r\nto the Duke of Montrose.\r\n\r\nHowever, after detaining Mr. Graham five or six days in custody on the\r\nisland, which is still called Rob Roy's Prison, and could be no\r\ncomfortable dwelling for November nights, the Outlaw seems to have\r\ndespaired of attaining further advantage from his bold attempt, and\r\nsuffered his prisoner to depart uninjured, with the account-books, and\r\nbills granted by the tenants, taking especial care to retain the cash.*\r\n\r\n* The reader will find two original letters of the Duke of Montrose, with\r\nthat which Mr. Graham of Killearn despatched from his prison-house by the\r\nOutlaw's command, in the Appendix, No. II.\r\n\r\nAbout 1717, our Chieftain had the dangerous adventure of falling into the\r\nhands of the Duke of Athole, almost as much his enemy as the Duke of\r\nMontrose himself; but his cunning and dexterity again freed him from\r\ncertain death. See a contemporary account of this curious affair in the\r\nAppendix, No. V.\r\n\r\nOther pranks are told of Rob, which argue the same boldness and sagacity\r\nas the seizure of Killearn. The Duke of Montrose, weary of his insolence,\r\nprocured a quantity of arms, and distributed them among his tenantry, in\r\norder that they might defend themselves against future violences. But\r\nthey fell into different hands from those they were intended for. The\r\nMacGregors made separate attacks on the houses of the tenants, and\r\ndisarmed them all one after another, not, as was supposed, without the\r\nconsent of many of the persons so disarmed.\r\n\r\nAs a great part of the Duke's rents were payable in kind, there were\r\ngirnels (granaries) established for storing up the corn at Moulin, and\r\nelsewhere on the Buchanan estate. To these storehouses Rob Roy used to\r\nrepair with a sufficient force, and of course when he was least expected,\r\nand insist upon the delivery of quantities of grain--sometimes for his\r\nown use, and sometimes for the assistance of the country people; always\r\ngiving regular receipts in his own name, and pretending to reckon with\r\nthe Duke for what sums he received.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile a garrison was established by Government, the ruins of\r\nwhich may be still seen about half-way betwixt Loch Lomond and Loch\r\nKatrine, upon Rob Roy's original property of Inversnaid. Even this\r\nmilitary establishment could not bridle the restless MacGregor. He\r\ncontrived to surprise the little fort, disarm the soldiers, and destroy\r\nthe fortification. It was afterwards re-established, and again taken by\r\nthe MacGregors under Rob Roy's nephew Ghlune Dhu, previous to the\r\ninsurrection of 1745-6. Finally, the fort of Inversnaid was a third time\r\nrepaired after the extinction of civil discord; and when we find the\r\ncelebrated General Wolfe commanding in it, the imagination is strongly\r\naffected by the variety of time and events which the circumstance brings\r\nsimultaneously to recollection. It is now totally dismantled.*\r\n\r\n* About 1792, when the author chanced to pass that way while on a tour\r\nthrough the Highlands, a garrison, consisting of a single veteran, was\r\nstill maintained at Inversnaid. The venerable warder was reaping his\r\nbarley croft in all peace and tranquillity and when we asked admittance\r\nto repose ourselves, he told us we would find the key of the Fort under\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nIt was not, strictly speaking, as a professed depredator that Rob Roy now\r\nconducted his operations, but as a sort of contractor for the police; in\r\nScottish phrase, a lifter of black-mail. The nature of this contract has\r\nbeen described in the Novel of Waverley, and in the notes on that work.\r\nMr. Grahame of Gartmore's description of the character may be here\r\ntranscribed:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe confusion and disorders of the country were so great, and the\r\nGovernment go absolutely neglected it, that the sober people were obliged\r\nto purchase some security to their effects by shameful and ignominious\r\ncontracts of _black-mail._ A person who had the greatest correspondence\r\nwith the thieves was agreed with to preserve the lands contracted for\r\nfrom thefts, for certain sums to be paid yearly. Upon this fund he\r\nemployed one half of the thieves to recover stolen cattle, and the other\r\nhalf of them to steal, in order to make this agreement and black-mail\r\ncontract necessary. The estates of those gentlemen who refused to\r\ncontract, or give countenance to that pernicious practice, are plundered\r\nby the thieving part of the watch, in order to force them to purchase\r\ntheir protection. Their leader calls himself the _Captain_ of the\r\n_Watch,_ and his banditti go by that name. And as this gives them a kind\r\nof authority to traverse the country, so it makes them capable of doing\r\nany mischief. These corps through the Highlands make altogether a very\r\nconsiderable body of men, inured from their infancy to the greatest\r\nfatigues, and very capable, to act in a military way when occasion\r\noffers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who are ignorant and enthusiastic, who are in absolute dependence\r\nupon their chief or landlord, who are directed in their consciences by\r\nRoman Catholic priests, or nonjuring clergymen, and who are not masters\r\nof any property, may easily be formed into any mould. They fear no\r\ndangers, as they have nothing to lose, and so can with ease be induced to\r\nattempt anything. Nothing can make their condition worse: confusions and\r\ntroubles do commonly indulge them in such licentiousness, that by these\r\nthey better it.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* Letters from the North of Scotland, vol. ii. pp. 344, 345.\r\n\r\nAs the practice of contracting for black-mail was an obvious\r\nencouragement to rapine, and a great obstacle to the course of justice,\r\nit was, by the statute 1567, chap. 21, declared a capital crime both on\r\nthe part of him who levied and him who paid this sort of tax. But the\r\nnecessity of the case prevented the execution of this severe law, I\r\nbelieve, in any one instance; and men went on submitting to a certain\r\nunlawful imposition rather than run the risk of utter ruin--just as it is\r\nnow found difficult or impossible to prevent those who have lost a very\r\nlarge sum of money by robbery, from compounding with the felons for\r\nrestoration of a part of their booty.\r\n\r\nAt what rate Rob Roy levied black-mail I never heard stated; but there is\r\na formal contract by which his nephew, in 1741, agreed with various\r\nlandholders of estates in the counties of Perth, Stirling, and Dumbarton,\r\nto recover cattle stolen from them, or to pay the value within six months\r\nof the loss being intimated, if such intimation were made to him with\r\nsufficient despatch, in consideration of a payment of L5 on each L100 of\r\nvalued rent, which was not a very heavy insurance. Petty thefts were not\r\nincluded in the contract; but the theft of one horse, or one head of\r\nblack cattle, or of sheep exceeding the number of six, fell under the\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nRob Roy's profits upon such contracts brought him in a considerable\r\nrevenue in money or cattle, of which he made a popular use; for he was\r\npublicly liberal as well as privately beneficent. The minister of the\r\nparish of Balquhidder, whose name was Robertson, was at one time\r\nthreatening to pursue the parish for an augmentation of his stipend. Rob\r\nRoy took an opportunity to assure him that he would do well to abstain\r\nfrom this new exaction--a hint which the minister did not fail to\r\nunderstand. But to make him some indemnification, MacGregor presented him\r\nevery year with a cow and a fat sheep; and no scruples as to the mode in\r\nwhich the donor came by them are said to have affected the reverend\r\ngentleman's conscience.\r\n\r\nThe following amount of the proceedings of Rob Roy, on an application to\r\nhim from one of his contractors, had in it something very interesting to\r\nme, as told by an old countryman in the Lennox who was present on the\r\nexpedition. But as there is no point or marked incident in the story, and\r\nas it must necessarily be without the half-frightened, half-bewildered\r\nlook with which the narrator accompanied his recollections, it may\r\npossibly lose, its effect when transferred to paper.\r\n\r\nMy informant stated himself to have been a lad of fifteen, living with\r\nhis father on the estate of a gentleman in the Lennox, whose name I have\r\nforgotten, in the capacity of herd. On a fine morning in the end of\r\nOctober, the period when such calamities were almost always to be\r\napprehended, they found the Highland thieves had been down upon them, and\r\nswept away ten or twelve head of cattle. Rob Roy was sent for, and came\r\nwith a party of seven or eight armed men. He heard with great gravity all\r\nthat could be told him of the circumstances of the _creagh,_ and\r\nexpressed his confidence that the _herd-widdiefows_* could not have\r\ncarried their booty far, and that he should be able to recover them.\r\n\r\n* Mad herdsmen--a name given to cattle-stealers [properly one who\r\ndeserves to fill a _widdie,_ or halter].\r\n\r\nHe desired that two Lowlanders should be sent on the party, as it was not\r\nto be expected that any of his gentlemen would take the trouble of\r\ndriving the cattle when he should recover possession of them. My\r\ninformant and his father were despatched on the expedition. They had no\r\ngood will to the journey; nevertheless, provided with a little food, and\r\nwith a dog to help them to manage the cattle, they set off with\r\nMacGregor. They travelled a long day's journey in the direction of the\r\nmountain Benvoirlich, and slept for the night in a ruinous hut or bothy.\r\nThe next morning they resumed their journey among the hills, Rob Roy\r\ndirecting their course by signs and marks on the heath which my informant\r\ndid not understand.\r\n\r\nAbout noon Rob commanded the armed party to halt, and to lie couched in\r\nthe heather where it was thickest. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you and your son,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the\r\noldest Lowlander, \xe2\x80\x9cgo boldly over the hill;--you will see beneath you, in\r\na glen on the other side, your master's cattle, feeding, it may be, with\r\nothers; gather your own together, taking care to disturb no one else, and\r\ndrive them to this place. If any one speak to or threaten you, tell them\r\nthat I am here, at the head of twenty men.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if they abuse us,\r\nor kill us?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lowland, peasant, by no means delighted at finding\r\nthe embassy imposed on him and his son. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they do you any wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRob, \xe2\x80\x9cI will never forgive them as long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d The Lowlander was by\r\nno means content with this security, but did not think it safe to dispute\r\nRob's injunctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cattle Lifting--000]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe and his son climbed the hill therefore, found a deep valley, where\r\nthere grazed, as Rob had predicted, a large herd of cattle. They\r\ncautiously selected those which their master had lost, and took measures\r\nto drive them over the hill. As soon as they began to remove them, they\r\nwere surprised by hearing cries and screams; and looking around in fear\r\nand trembling they saw a woman seeming to have started out of the earth,\r\nwho _flyted_ at them, that is, scolded them, in Gaelic. When they\r\ncontrived, however, in the best Gaelic they could muster, to deliver the\r\nmessage Rob Roy told them, she became silent, and disappeared without\r\noffering them any further annoyance. The chief heard their story on their\r\nreturn, and spoke with great complacency of the art which he possessed of\r\nputting such things to rights without any unpleasant bustle. The party\r\nwere now on their road home, and the danger, though not the fatigue, of\r\nthe expedition was at an end.\r\n\r\nThey drove on the cattle with little repose until it was nearly dark,\r\nwhen Rob proposed to halt for the night upon a wide moor, across which a\r\ncold north-east wind, with frost on its wing, was whistling to the tune\r\nof the Pipers of Strath-Dearn.*\r\n\r\n* The winds which sweep a wild glen in Badenoch are so called.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, sheltered by their plaids, lay down on the heath\r\ncomfortably enough, but the Lowlanders had no protection whatever. Rob\r\nRoy observing this, directed one of his followers to afford the old man a\r\nportion of his plaid; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the callant (boy), he may,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nfreebooter, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep himself warm by walking about and watching the cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n My informant heard this sentence with no small distress; and as the frost\r\nwind grew more and more cutting, it seemed to freeze the very blood in\r\nhis young veins. He had been exposed to weather all his life, he said,\r\nbut never could forget the cold of that night; insomuch that, in the\r\nbitterness of his heart, he cursed the bright moon for giving no heat\r\nwith so much light. At length the sense of cold and weariness became so\r\nintolerable that he resolved to desert his watch to seek some repose and\r\nshelter. With that purpose he couched himself down behind one of the most\r\nbulky of the Highlanders, who acted as lieutenant to the party. Not\r\nsatisfied with having secured the shelter of the man's large person, he\r\ncoveted a share of his plaid, and by imperceptible degrees drew a corner\r\nof it round him. He was now comparatively in paradise, and slept sound\r\ntill daybreak, when he awoke, and was terribly afraid on observing that\r\nhis nocturnal operations had altogether uncovered the dhuiniewassell's\r\nneck and shoulders, which, lacking the plaid which should have protected\r\nthem, were covered with _cranreuch_ (_i.e._ hoar frost). The lad rose in\r\ngreat dread of a beating, at least, when it should be found how\r\nluxuriously he had been accommodated at the expense of a principal person\r\nof the party. Good Mr. Lieutenant, however, got up and shook himself,\r\nrubbing off the hoar frost with his plaid, and muttering something of a\r\n_cauld neight._ They then drove on the cattle, which were restored to\r\ntheir owner without farther adventure--The above can hardly be termed a\r\ntale, but yet it contains materials both for the poet and artist.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps about the same time that, by a rapid march into the\r\nBalquhidder hills at the head of a body of his own tenantry, the Duke of\r\nMontrose actually surprised Rob Roy, and made him prisoner. He was\r\nmounted behind one of the Duke's followers, named James Stewart, and made\r\nfast to him by a horse-girth. The person who had him thus in charge was\r\ngrandfather of the intelligent man of the same name, now deceased, who\r\nlately kept the inn in the vicinity of Loch Katrine, and acted as a guide\r\nto visitors through that beautiful scenery. From him I learned the story\r\nmany years before he was either a publican, or a guide, except to\r\nmoorfowl shooters.--It was evening (to resume the story), and the Duke\r\nwas pressing on to lodge his prisoner, so long sought after in vain, in\r\nsome place of security, when, in crossing the Teith or Forth, I forget\r\nwhich, MacGregor took an opportunity to conjure Stewart, by all the ties\r\nof old acquaintance and good neighbourhood, to give him some chance of an\r\nescape from an assured doom. Stewart was moved with compassion, perhaps\r\nwith fear. He slipt the girth-buckle, and Rob, dropping down from behind\r\nthe horse's croupe, dived, swam, and escaped, pretty much as described in\r\nthe Novel. When James Stewart came on shore, the Duke hastily demanded\r\nwhere his prisoner was; and as no distinct answer was returned, instantly\r\nsuspected Stewart's connivance at the escape of the Outlaw; and, drawing\r\na steel pistol from his belt, struck him down with a blow on the head,\r\nfrom the effects of which, his descendant said, he never completely\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nIn the success of his repeated escapes from the pursuit of his powerful\r\nenemy, Rob Roy at length became wanton and facetious. He wrote a mock\r\nchallenge to the Duke, which he circulated among his friends to amuse\r\nthem over a bottle. The reader will find this document in the Appendix.*\r\nIt is written in a good hand, and not particularly deficient in grammar\r\nor spelling.\r\n\r\n* Appendix, No. III.\r\n\r\nOur Southern readers must be given to understand that it was a piece of\r\nhumour,--a _quiz,_ in short,--on the part of the Outlaw, who was too\r\nsagacious to propose such a rencontre in reality. This letter was written\r\nin the year 1719.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Rob Roy composed another epistle, very little to\r\nhis own reputation, as he therein confesses having played booty during\r\nthe civil war of 1715. It is addressed to General Wade, at that time\r\nengaged in disarming the Highland clans, and making military roads\r\nthrough the country. The letter is a singular composition. It sets out\r\nthe writer's real and unfeigned desire to have offered his service to\r\nKing George, but for his liability to be thrown into jail for a civil\r\ndebt, at the instance of the Duke of Montrose. Being thus debarred from\r\ntaking the right side, he acknowledged he embraced the wrong one, upon\r\nFalstaff's principle, that since the King wanted men and the rebels\r\nsoldiers, it were worse shame to be idle in such a stirring world, than\r\nto embrace the worst side, were it as black as rebellion could make it.\r\nThe impossibility of his being neutral in such a debate, Rob seems to lay\r\ndown as an undeniable proposition. At the same time, while he\r\nacknowledges having been forced into an unnatural rebellion against King\r\nGeorge, he pleads that he not only avoided acting offensively against his\r\nMajesty's forces on all occasions, but, on the contrary, sent to them\r\nwhat intelligence he could collect from time to time; for the truth of\r\nwhich he refers to his Grace the Duke of Argyle. What influence this plea\r\nhad on General Wade, we have no means of knowing.\r\n\r\nRob Roy appears to have continued to live very much as usual. His fame,\r\nin the meanwhile, passed beyond the narrow limits of the country in which\r\nhe resided. A pretended history of him appeared in London during his\r\nlifetime, under the title of the Highland Rogue. It is a catch-penny\r\npublication, bearing in front the effigy of a species of ogre, with a\r\nbeard of a foot in length; and his actions are as much exaggerated as his\r\npersonal appearance. Some few of the best known adventures of the hero\r\nare told, though with little accuracy; but the greater part of the\r\npamphlet is entirely fictitious. It is great pity so excellent a theme\r\nfor a narrative of the kind had not fallen into the hands of De Foe, who\r\nwas engaged at the time on subjects somewhat similar, though inferior in\r\ndignity and interest.\r\n\r\nAs Rob Roy advanced in years, he became more peaceable in his habits, and\r\nhis nephew Ghlune Dhu, with most of his tribe, renounced those peculiar\r\nquarrels with the Duke of Montrose, by which his uncle had been\r\ndistinguished. The policy of that great family had latterly been rather\r\nto attach this wild tribe by kindness than to follow the mode of violence\r\nwhich had been hitherto ineffectually resorted to. Leases at a low rent\r\nwere granted to many of the MacGregors, who had heretofore held\r\npossessions in the Duke's Highland property merely by occupancy; and\r\nGlengyle (or Black-knee), who continued to act as collector of\r\nblack-mail, managed his police, as a commander of the Highland watch\r\narrayed at the charge of Government. He is said to have strictly\r\nabstained from the open and lawless depredations which his kinsman had\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nIt was probably after this state of temporary quiet had been obtained,\r\nthat Rob Roy began to think of the concerns of his future state. He had\r\nbeen bred, and long professed himself, a Protestant; but in his later\r\nyears he embraced the Roman Catholic faith,--perhaps on Mrs. Cole's\r\nprinciple, that it was a comfortable religion for one of his calling. He\r\nis said to have alleged as the cause of his conversion, a desire to\r\ngratify the noble family of Perth, who were then strict Catholics.\r\nHaving, as he observed, assumed the name of the Duke of Argyle, his first\r\nprotector, he could pay no compliment worth the Earl of Perth's\r\nacceptance save complying with his mode of religion. Rob did not pretend,\r\nwhen pressed closely on the subject, to justify all the tenets of\r\nCatholicism, and acknowledged that extreme unction always appeared to him\r\na great waste of _ulzie,_ or oil.*\r\n\r\n* Such an admission is ascribed to the robber Donald Bean Lean in\r\nWaverley, chap. lxii,\r\n\r\nIn the last years of Rob Roy's life, his clan was involved in a dispute\r\nwith one more powerful than themselves. Stewart of Appin, a chief of the\r\ntribe so named, was proprietor of a hill-farm in the Braes of\r\nBalquhidder, called Invernenty. The MacGregors of Rob Roy's tribe claimed\r\na right to it by ancient occupancy, and declared they would oppose to the\r\nuttermost the settlement of any person upon the farm not being of their\r\nown name. The Stewarts came down with two hundred men, well armed, to do\r\nthemselves justice by main force. The MacGregors took the field, but were\r\nunable to muster an equal strength. Rob Roy, fending himself the weaker\r\nparty, asked a parley, in which he represented that both clans were\r\nfriends to the _King,_ and, that he was unwilling they should be weakened\r\nby mutual conflict, and thus made a merit of surrendering to Appin the\r\ndisputed territory of Invernenty. Appin, accordingly, settled as tenants\r\nthere, at an easy quit-rent, the MacLarens, a family dependent on the\r\nStewarts, and from whose character for strength and bravery, it was\r\nexpected that they would make their right good if annoyed by the\r\nMacGregors. When all this had been amicably adjusted, in presence of the\r\ntwo clans drawn up in arms near the Kirk of Balquhidder, Rob Roy,\r\napparently fearing his tribe might be thought to have conceded too much\r\nupon the occasion, stepped forward and said, that where so many gallant\r\nmen were met in arms, it would be shameful to part without it trial of\r\nskill, and therefore he took the freedom to invite any gentleman of the\r\nStewarts present to exchange a few blows with him for the honour of their\r\nrespective clans. The brother-in-law of Appin, and second chieftain of\r\nthe clan, Alaster Stewart of Invernahyle, accepted the challenge, and\r\nthey encountered with broadsword and target before their respective\r\nkinsmen.*\r\n\r\n* Some accounts state that Appin himself was Rob Roy's antagonist on this\r\noccasion. My recollection, from the account of Invernahyle himself, was\r\nas stated in the text. But the period when I received the information is\r\nnow so distant, that it is possible I may be mistaken. Invernahyle was\r\nrather of low stature, but very well made, athletic, and an excellent\r\nswordsman.\r\n\r\nThe combat lasted till Rob received a slight wound in the arm, which was\r\nthe usual termination of such a combat when fought for honour only, and\r\nnot with a mortal purpose. Rob Roy dropped his point, and congratulated\r\nhis adversary on having been the first man who ever drew blood from him.\r\nThe victor generously acknowledged, that without the advantage of youth,\r\nand the agility accompanying it, he probably could not have come off with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThis was probably one of Rob Roy's last exploits in arms. The time of his\r\ndeath is not known with certainty, but he is generally said to have\r\nsurvived 1738, and to have died an aged man. When he found himself\r\napproaching his final change, he expressed some contrition for particular\r\nparts of his life. His wife laughed at these scruples of conscience, and\r\nexhorted him to die like a man, as he had lived. In reply, he rebuked her\r\nfor her violent passions, and the counsels she had given him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nput strife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbetwixt me and the best men of the country, and\r\nnow you would place enmity between me and my God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition, no way inconsistent with the former, if the\r\ncharacter of Rob Roy be justly considered, that while on his deathbed, he\r\nlearned that a person with whom he was at enmity proposed to visit him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRaise me from my bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid; \xe2\x80\x9cthrow my plaid around me, and\r\nbring me my claymore, dirk, and pistols--it shall never be said that a\r\nfoeman saw Rob Roy MacGregor defenceless and unarmed.\xe2\x80\x9d His foeman,\r\nconjectured to be one of the MacLarens before and after mentioned,\r\nentered and paid his compliments, inquiring after the health of his\r\nformidable neighbour. Rob Roy maintained a cold haughty civility during\r\ntheir short conference, and so soon as he had left the house. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9call is over--let the piper play, _Ha til mi tulidh_\xe2\x80\x9d (we return no\r\nmore); and he is said to have expired before the dirge was finished.\r\n\r\nThis singular man died in bed in his own house, in the parish of\r\nBalquhidder. He was buried in the churchyard of the same parish, where\r\nhis tombstone is only distinguished by a rude attempt at the figure of a\r\nbroadsword.\r\n\r\nThe character of Rob Roy is, of course, a mixed one. His sagacity,\r\nboldness, and prudence, qualities so highly necessary to success in war,\r\nbecame in some degree vices, from the manner in which they were employed.\r\nThe circumstances of his education, however, must be admitted as some\r\nextenuation of his habitual transgressions against the law; and for his\r\npolitical tergiversations, he might in that distracted period plead the\r\nexample of men far more powerful, and less excusable in becoming the\r\nsport of circumstances, than the poor and desperate outlaw. On the other\r\nhand, he was in the constant exercise of virtues, the more meritorious as\r\nthey seem inconsistent with his general character. Pursuing the\r\noccupation of a predatory chieftain,--in modern phrase a captain of\r\nbanditti,--Rob Roy was moderate in his revenge, and humane in his\r\nsuccesses. No charge of cruelty or bloodshed, unless in battle, is\r\nbrought against his memory. In like manner, the formidable outlaw was the\r\nfriend of the poor, and, to the utmost of his ability, the support of the\r\nwidow and the orphan--kept his word when pledged--and died lamented in\r\nhis own wild country, where there were hearts grateful for his\r\nbeneficence, though their minds were not sufficiently instructed to\r\nappreciate his errors.\r\n\r\nThe author perhaps ought to stop here; but the fate of a part of Rob\r\nRoy's family was so extraordinary, as to call for a continuation of this\r\nsomewhat prolix account, as affording an interesting chapter, not on\r\nHighland manners alone, but on every stage of society in which the people\r\nof a primitive and half-civilised tribe are brought into close contact\r\nwith a nation, in which civilisation and polity have attained a complete\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nRob had five sons,--Coll, Ronald, James, Duncan, and Robert. Nothing\r\noccurs worth notice concerning three of them; but James, who was a very\r\nhandsome man, seems to have had a good deal of his father's spirit, and\r\nthe mantle of Dougal Ciar Mhor had apparently descended on the shoulders\r\nof Robin Oig, that is, young Robin. Shortly after Rob Roy's death, the\r\nill-will which the MacGregors entertained against the MacLarens again\r\nbroke out, at the instigation, it was said, of Rob's widow, who seems\r\nthus far to have deserved the character given to her by her husband, as\r\nan Ate' stirring up to blood and strife. Robin Oig, under her\r\ninstigation, swore that as soon as he could get back a certain gun which\r\nhad belonged to his father, and had been lately at Doune to be repaired,\r\nhe would shoot MacLaren, for having presumed to settle on his mother's\r\nland.*\r\n\r\n* This fatal piece was taken from Robin Oig, when he was seized many\r\nyears afterwards. It remained in possession of the magistrates before\r\nwhom he was brought for examination, and now makes part of a small\r\ncollection of arms belonging to the Author. It is a Spanish-barrelled\r\ngun, marked with the letters R. M. C., for Robert MacGregor Campbell.\r\n\r\nHe was as good as his word, and shot MacLaren when between the stilts of\r\nhis plough, wounding him mortally.\r\n\r\nThe aid of a Highland leech was procured, who probed the wound with a\r\nprobe made out of a castock; _i.e._, the stalk of a colewort or cabbage.\r\nThis learned gentleman declared he would not venture to prescribe, not\r\nknowing with what shot the patient had been wounded. MacLaren died, and\r\nabout the same time his cattle were houghed, and his live stock destroyed\r\nin a barbarous manner.\r\n\r\nRobin Oig, after this feat--which one of his biographers represents as\r\nthe unhappy discharge of a gun--retired to his mother's house, to boast\r\nthat he had drawn the first blood in the quarrel aforesaid. On the\r\napproach of troops, and a body of the Stewarts, who were bound to take up\r\nthe cause of their tenant, Robin Oig absconded, and escaped all search.\r\n\r\nThe doctor already mentioned, by name Callam MacInleister, with James and\r\nRonald, brothers to the actual perpetrator of the murder, were brought to\r\ntrial. But as they contrived to represent the action as a rash deed\r\ncommitted by \xe2\x80\x9cthe daft callant Rob,\xe2\x80\x9d to which they were not accessory,\r\nthe jury found their accession to the crime was Not Proven. The alleged\r\nacts of spoil and violence on the MacLarens' cattle, were also found to\r\nbe unsupported by evidence. As it was proved, however, that the two\r\nbrothers, Ronald and James, were held and reputed thieves, they were\r\nappointed to find caution to the extent of L200, for their good behaviour\r\nfor seven years.*\r\n\r\n* Note D. Author's expedition against the MacLarens.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of clanship was at that time, so strong--to which must be\r\nadded the wish to secure the adherence of stout, able-bodied, and, as the\r\nScotch phrase then went, _pretty_ men--that the representative of the\r\nnoble family of Perth condescended to act openly as patron of the\r\nMacGregors, and appeared as such upon their trial. So at least the author\r\nwas informed by the late Robert MacIntosh, Esq., advocate. The\r\ncircumstance may, however, have occurred later than 1736--the year in\r\nwhich this first trial took place.\r\n\r\nRobin Oig served for a time in the 42d regiment, and was present at the\r\nbattle of Fontenoy, where he was made prisoner and wounded. He was\r\nexchanged, returned to Scotland, and obtained his discharge. He\r\nafterwards appeared openly in the MacGregor's country; and,\r\nnotwithstanding his outlawry, married a daughter of Graham of Drunkie, a\r\ngentleman of some property. His wife died a few years afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of 1745 soon afterwards called the MacGregors to arms.\r\nRobert MacGregor of Glencarnoch, generally regarded as the chief of the\r\nwhole name, and grandfather of Sir John, whom the clan received in that\r\ncharacter, raised a MacGregor regiment, with which he joined the standard\r\nof the Chevalier. The race of Ciar Mhor, however, affecting independence,\r\nand commanded by Glengyle and his cousin James Roy MacGregor, did not\r\njoin this kindred corps, but united themselves to the levies of the\r\ntitular Duke of Perth, until William MacGregor Drummond of Bolhaldie,\r\nwhom they regarded as head of their branch, of Clan Alpine, should come\r\nover from France. To cement the union after the Highland fashion, James\r\nlaid down the name of Campbell, and assumed that of Drummond, in\r\ncompliment to Lord Perth. He was also called James Roy, after his father,\r\nand James Mhor, or Big James, from his height. His corps, the relics of\r\nhis father Rob's band, behaved with great activity; with only twelve men\r\nhe succeeded in surprising and burning, for the second time, the fort at\r\nInversnaid, constructed for the express purpose of bridling the country\r\nof the MacGregors.\r\n\r\nWhat rank or command James MacGregor had, is uncertain. He calls himself\r\nMajor; and Chevalier Johnstone calls him Captain. He must have held rank\r\nunder Ghlune Dhu, his kinsman, but his active and audacious character\r\nplaced him above the rest of his brethren. Many of his followers were\r\nunarmed; he supplied the want of guns and swords with scythe-blades set\r\nstraight upon their handles.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Prestonpans, James Roy distinguished himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHis\r\ncompany,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chevalier Johnstone, \xe2\x80\x9cdid great execution with their\r\nscythes.\xe2\x80\x9d They cut the legs of the horses in two--the riders through the\r\nmiddle of their bodies. MacGregor was brave and intrepid, but at the same\r\ntime, somewhat whimsical and singular. When advancing to the charge with\r\nhis company, he received five wounds, two of them from balls that pierced\r\nhis body through and through. Stretched on the ground, with his head\r\nresting on his hand, he called out loudly to the Highlanders of his\r\ncompany, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lads, I am not dead. By G--, I shall see if any of you does\r\nnot do his duty.\xe2\x80\x9d The victory, as is well known, was instantly obtained.\r\n\r\nIn some curious letters of James Roy,* it appears that his thigh-bone was\r\nbroken on this occasion, and that he, nevertheless, rejoined the army\r\nwith six companies, and was present at the battle of Culloden.\r\n\r\n* Published in Blackwood's Magazine, vol. ii. p. 228.\r\n\r\nAfter that defeat, the clan MacGregor kept together in a body, and did\r\nnot disperse till they had returned into their own country. They brought\r\nJames Roy with them in a litter; and, without being particularly\r\nmolested, he was permitted to reside in the MacGregor's country along\r\nwith his brothers.\r\n\r\nJames MacGregor Drummond was attainted for high treason with persons of\r\nmore importance. But it appears he had entered into some communication\r\nwith Government, as, in the letters quoted, he mentions having obtained a\r\npass from the Lord Justice-Clerk in 1747, which was a sufficient\r\nprotection to him from the military. The circumstance is obscurely stated\r\nin one of the letters already quoted, but may perhaps, joined to\r\nsubsequent incidents, authorise the suspicion that James, like his\r\nfather, could look at both sides of the cards. As the confusion of the\r\ncountry subsided, the MacGregors, like foxes which had baffled the\r\nhounds, drew back to their old haunts, and lived unmolested. But an\r\natrocious outrage, in which the sons of Rob Roy were concerned, brought\r\nat length on the family the full vengeance of the law.\r\n\r\nJames Roy was a married man, and had fourteen children. But his brother,\r\nRobin Oig, was now a widower; and it was resolved, if possible, that he\r\nshould make his fortune by carrying off and marrying, by force if\r\nnecessary, some woman of fortune from the Lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of the half-civilised Highlanders was less shocked at the\r\nidea of this particular species of violence, than might be expected from\r\ntheir general kindness to the weaker sex when they make part of their own\r\nfamilies. But all their views were tinged with the idea that they lived\r\nin a state of war; and in such a state, from the time of the siege of\r\nTroy to \xe2\x80\x9cthe moment when Previsa fell,\xe2\x80\x9d * the female captives are, to\r\nuncivilised victors, the most valuable part of the booty--\r\n\r\n* Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto II.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cThe wealthy are slaughtered, the lovely are spared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe need not refer to the rape of the Sabines, or to a similar instance in\r\nthe Book of Judges, for evidence that such deeds of violence have been\r\ncommitted upon a large scale. Indeed, this sort of enterprise was so\r\ncommon along the Highland line as to give rise to a variety of songs and\r\nballads.*\r\n\r\n* See Appendix, No. VI.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Ireland, as well as those of Scotland, prove the crime to\r\nhave been common in the more lawless parts of both countries; and any\r\nwoman who happened to please a man of spirit who came of a good house,\r\nand possessed a few chosen friends, and a retreat in the mountains, was\r\nnot permitted the alternative of saying him nay. What is more, it would\r\nseem that the women themselves, most interested in the immunities of\r\ntheir sex, were, among the lower classes, accustomed to regard such\r\nmarriages as that which is presently to be detailed as \xe2\x80\x9cpretty Fanny's\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d or rather, the way of Donald with pretty Fanny. It is not a great\r\nmany years since a respectable woman, above the lower rank of life,\r\nexpressed herself very warmly to the author on his taking the freedom to\r\ncensure the behaviour of the MacGregors on the occasion in question. She\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was no use in giving a bride too much choice upon such\r\noccasions; that the marriages were the happiest long syne which had been\r\ndone offhand.\xe2\x80\x9d Finally, she averred that her \xe2\x80\x9cown mother had never seen\r\nher father till the night he brought her up from the Lennox, with ten\r\nhead of black cattle, and there had not been a happier couple in the\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames Drummond and his brethren having similar opinions with the author's\r\nold acquaintance, and debating how they might raise the fallen fortunes\r\nof their clan, formed a resolution to settle their brother's fortune by\r\nstriking up an advantageous marriage betwixt Robin Oig and one Jean Key,\r\nor Wright, a young woman scarce twenty years old, and who had been left\r\nabout two months a widow by the death of her husband. Her property was\r\nestimated at only from 16,000 to 18,000 merks, but it seems to have been\r\nsufficient temptation to these men to join in the commission of a great\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThis poor young victim lived with her mother in her own house at\r\nEdinbilly, in the parish of Balfron and shire of Stirling. At this place,\r\nin the night of 3d December 1750, the sons of Rob Roy, and particularly\r\nJames Mhor and Robin Oig, rushed into the house where the object of their\r\nattack was resident, presented guns, swords, and pistols to the males of\r\nthe family, and terrified the women by threatening to break open the\r\ndoors if Jean Key was not surrendered, as, said James Roy, \xe2\x80\x9chis brother\r\nwas a young fellow determined to make his fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d Having, at length,\r\ndragged the object of their lawless purpose from her place of\r\nconcealment, they tore her from her mother's arms, mounted her on a horse\r\nbefore one of the gang, and carried her off in spite, of her screams and\r\ncries, which were long heard after the terrified spectators of the\r\noutrage could no longer see the party retreat through the darkness. In\r\nher attempts to escape, the poor young woman threw herself from the horse\r\non which they had placed her, and in so doing wrenched her side. They\r\nthen laid her double over the pummel of the saddle, and transported her\r\nthrough the mosses and moors till the pain of the injury she had suffered\r\nin her side, augmented by the uneasiness of her posture, made her consent\r\nto sit upright. In the execution of this crime they stopped at more\r\nhouses than one, but none of the inhabitants dared interrupt their\r\nproceedings. Amongst others who saw them was that classical and\r\naccomplished scholar the late Professor William Richardson of Glasgow,\r\nwho used to describe as a terrible dream their violent and noisy entrance\r\ninto the house where he was then residing. The Highlanders filled the\r\nlittle kitchen, brandishing their arms, demanding what they pleased, and\r\nreceiving whatever they demanded. James Mhor, he said, was a tall, stern,\r\nand soldier-like man. Robin Oig looked more gentle; dark, but yet ruddy\r\nin complexion--a good-looking young savage. Their victim was so\r\ndishevelled in her dress, and forlorn in her appearance and demeanour,\r\nthat he could hardly tell whether she was alive or dead.\r\n\r\nThe gang carried the unfortunate woman to Rowardennan, where they had a\r\npriest unscrupulous enough to read the marriage service, while James Mhor\r\nforcibly held the bride up before him; and the priest declared the couple\r\nman and wife, even while she protested against the infamy of his conduct.\r\nUnder the same threats of violence, which had been all along used to\r\nenforce their scheme, the poor victim was compelled to reside with the\r\npretended husband who was thus forced upon her. They even dared to carry\r\nher to the public church of Balquhidder, where the officiating clergyman\r\n(the same who had been Rob Roy's pensioner) only asked them if they were\r\nmarried persons. Robert MacGregor answered in the affirmative; the\r\nterrified female was silent.\r\n\r\nThe country was now too effectually subjected to the law for this vile\r\noutrage to be followed by the advantages proposed by the actors, Military\r\nparties were sent out in every direction to seize the MacGregors, who\r\nwere for two or three weeks compelled to shift from one place to another\r\nin the mountains, bearing the unfortunate Jean Key along with them. In\r\nthe meanwhile, the Supreme Civil Court issued a warrant, sequestrating\r\nthe property of Jean Key, or Wright, which removed out of the reach of\r\nthe actors in the violence the prize which they expected. They had,\r\nhowever, adopted a belief of the poor woman's spirit being so far broken\r\nthat she would prefer submitting to her condition, and adhering to Robin\r\nOig as her husband, rather than incur the disgrace, of appearing in such\r\na cause in an open court. It was, indeed, a delicate experiment; but\r\ntheir kinsman Glengyle, chief of their immediate family, was of a temper\r\naverse to lawless proceedings;* and the captive's friends having had\r\nrecourse to his advice, they feared that he would withdraw his protection\r\nif they refused to place the prisoner at liberty.\r\n\r\n* Such, at least, was his general character; for when James Mhor, while\r\nperpetrating the violence at Edinbilly, called out, in order to overawe\r\nopposition, that Glengyle was lying in the moor with a hundred men to\r\npatronise his enterprise, Jean Key told him he lied, since she was\r\nconfident Glengyle would never countenance so scoundrelly a business.\r\n\r\nThe brethren resolved, therefore, to liberate the unhappy woman, but\r\npreviously had recourse to every measure which should oblige her, either\r\nfrom fear or otherwise, to own her marriage with Robin Oig. The\r\ncailliachs (old Highland hags) administered drugs, which were designed to\r\nhave the effect of philtres, but were probably deleterious. James Mhor at\r\none time threatened, that if she did not acquiesce in the match she would\r\nfind that there were enough of men in the Highlands to bring the heads of\r\ntwo of her uncles who were pursuing the civil lawsuit. At another time he\r\nfell down on his knees, and confessed he had been accessory to wronging\r\nher, but begged she would not ruin his innocent wife and large family.\r\nShe was made to swear she would not prosecute the brethren for the\r\noffence they had committed; and she was obliged by threats to subscribe\r\npapers which were tendered to her, intimating that she was carried off in\r\nconsequence of her own previous request.\r\n\r\nJames Mhor Drummond accordingly brought his pretended sister-in-law to\r\nEdinburgh, where, for some little time, she was carried about from one\r\nhouse to another, watched by those with whom she was lodged, and never\r\npermitted to go out alone, or even to approach the window. The Court of\r\nSession, considering the peculiarity of the case, and regarding Jean Key\r\nas being still under some forcible restraint, took her person under their\r\nown special charge, and appointed her to reside in the family of Mr.\r\nWightman of Mauldsley, a gentleman of respectability, who was married to\r\none of her near relatives. Two sentinels kept guard on the house day and\r\nnight--a precaution not deemed superfluous when the MacGregors were in\r\nquestion. She was allowed to go out whenever she chose, and to see\r\nwhomsoever she had a mind, as well as the men of law employed in the\r\ncivil suit on either side. When she first came to Mr. Wightman's house\r\nshe seemed broken down with affright and suffering, so changed in\r\nfeatures that her mother hardly knew her, and so shaken in mind that she\r\nscarce could recognise her parent. It was long before she could be\r\nassured that she was in perfect safely. But when she at length received\r\nconfidence in her situation, she made a judicial declaration, or\r\naffidavit, telling the full history of her wrongs, imputing to fear her\r\nformer silence on the subject, and expressing her resolution not to\r\nprosecute those who had injured her, in respect of the oath she had been\r\ncompelled to take. From the possible breach of such an oath, though a\r\ncompulsory one, she was relieved by the forms of Scottish jurisprudence,\r\nin that respect more equitable than those of England, prosecutions for\r\ncrimes being always conducted at the expense and charge of the King,\r\nwithout inconvenience or cost to the private party who has sustained the\r\nwrong. But the unhappy sufferer did not live to be either accuser or\r\nwitness against those who had so deeply injured her.\r\n\r\nJames Mhor Drummond had left Edinburgh so soon as his half-dead prey had\r\nbeen taken from his clutches. Mrs. Key, or Wright, was released from her\r\nspecies of confinement there, and removed to Glasgow, under the escort of\r\nMr. Wightman. As they passed the Hill of Shotts, her escort chanced to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a very wild spot; what if the MacGregors should come upon\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d was her immediate answer, \xe2\x80\x9cthe very sight of them\r\nwould kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d She continued to reside at Glasgow, without venturing to\r\nreturn to her own house at Edinbilly. Her pretended husband made some\r\nattempts to obtain an interview with her, which she steadily rejected.\r\nShe died on the 4th October 1751. The information for the Crown hints\r\nthat her decease might be the consequence of the usage she received. But\r\nthere is a general report that she died of the small-pox. In the\r\nmeantime, James Mhor, or Drummond, fell into the hands of justice. He was\r\nconsidered as the instigator of the whole affair. Nay, the deceased had\r\ninformed her friends that on the night of her being carried off, Robin\r\nOig, moved by her cries and tears, had partly consented to let her\r\nreturn, when James came up with a pistol in his hand, and, asking whether\r\nhe was such a coward as to relinquish an enterprise in which he had\r\nrisked everything to procure him a fortune, in a manner compelled his\r\nbrother to persevere. James's trial took place on 13th July 1752, and was\r\nconducted with the utmost fairness and impartiality. Several witnesses,\r\nall of the MacGregor family, swore that the marriage was performed with\r\nevery appearance of acquiescence on the woman's part; and three or four\r\nwitnesses, one of them sheriff-substitute of the county, swore she might\r\nhave made her escape if she wished, and the magistrate stated that he\r\noffered her assistance if she felt desirous to do so. But when asked why\r\nhe, in his official capacity, did not arrest the MacGregors, he could\r\nonly answer, that he had not force sufficient to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe judicial declarations of Jean Key, or Wright, stated the violent\r\nmanner in which she had been carried off, and they were confirmed by many\r\nof her friends, from her private communications with them, which the\r\nevent of her death rendered good evidence. Indeed, the fact of her\r\nabduction (to use a Scottish law term) was completely proved by impartial\r\nwitnesses. The unhappy woman admitted that she had pretended acquiescence\r\nin her fate on several occasions, because she dared not trust such as\r\noffered to assist her to escape, not even the sheriff-substitute.\r\n\r\nThe jury brought in a special verdict, finding that Jean Key, or Wright,\r\nhad been forcibly carried off from her house, as charged in the\r\nindictment, and that the accused had failed to show that she was herself\r\nprivy and consenting to this act of outrage. But they found the forcible\r\nmarriage, and subsequent violence, was not proved; and also found, in\r\nalleviation of the panel's guilt in the premises, that Jean Key did\r\nafterwards acquiesce in her condition. Eleven of the jury, using the\r\nnames of other four who were absent, subscribed a letter to the Court,\r\nstating it was their purpose and desire, by such special verdict, to take\r\nthe panel's case out of the class of capital crimes.\r\n\r\nLearned informations (written arguments) on the import of the verdict,\r\nwhich must be allowed a very mild one in the circumstances, were laid\r\nbefore the High Court of Justiciary. This point is very learnedly debated\r\nin these pleadings by Mr. Grant, Solicitor for the Crown, and the\r\ncelebrated Mr. Lockhart, on the part of the prisoner; but James Mhor did\r\nnot wait the event of the Court's decision.\r\n\r\nHe had been committed to the Castle of Edinburgh on some reports that an\r\nescape would be attempted. Yet he contrived to achieve his liberty even\r\nfrom that fortress. His daughter had the address to enter the prison,\r\ndisguised as a cobbler, bringing home work, as she pretended. In this\r\ncobbler's dress her father quickly arrayed himself. The wife and daughter\r\nof the prisoner were heard by the sentinels scolding the supposed cobbler\r\nfor having done his work ill, and the man came out with his hat slouched\r\nover his eyes, and grumbling, as if at the manner in which they had\r\ntreated him. In this way the prisoner passed all the guards without\r\nsuspicion, and made his escape to France. He was afterwards outlawed by\r\nthe Court of Justiciary, which proceeded to the trial of Duncan\r\nMacGregor, or Drummond, his brother, 15th January 1753. The accused had\r\nunquestionably been with the party which carried off Jean Key; but no\r\nevidence being brought which applied to him individually and directly,\r\nthe jury found him not guilty--and nothing more is known of his fate.\r\n\r\nThat of James MacGregor, who, from talent and activity, if not by\r\nseniority, may be considered as head of the family, has been long\r\nmisrepresented; as it has been generally averred in Law Reports, as well\r\nas elsewhere, that his outlawry was reversed, and that he returned and\r\ndied in Scotland. But the curious letters published in Blackwood's\r\nMagazine for December 1817, show this to be an error. The first of these\r\ndocuments is a petition to Charles Edward. It is dated 20th September\r\n1753, and pleads his service to the cause of the Stuarts, ascribing his\r\nexile to the persecution of the Hanoverian Government, without any\r\nallusion to the affair of Jean Key, or the Court of Justiciary. It is\r\nstated to be forwarded by MacGregor Drummond of Bohaldie, whom, as before\r\nmentioned, James Mhor acknowledged as his chief.\r\n\r\nThe effect which this petition produced does not appear. Some temporary\r\nrelief was perhaps obtained. But, soon after, this daring adventurer was\r\nengaged in a very dark intrigue against an exile of his own country, and\r\nplaced pretty nearly in his own circumstances. A remarkable Highland\r\nstory must be here briefly alluded to. Mr. Campbell of Glenure, who had\r\nbeen named factor for Government on the forfeited estates of Stewart of\r\nArdshiel, was shot dead by an assassin as he passed through the wood of\r\nLettermore, after crossing the ferry of Ballachulish. A gentleman, named\r\nJames Stewart, a natural brother of Ardshiel, the forfeited person, was\r\ntried as being accessory to the murder, and condemned and executed upon\r\nvery doubtful evidence; the heaviest part of which only amounted to the\r\naccused person having assisted a nephew of his own, called Allan Breck\r\nStewart, with money to escape after the deed was done. Not satisfied with\r\nthis vengeance, which was obtained in a manner little to the honour of\r\nthe dispensation of justice at the time, the friends of the deceased\r\nGlenure were equally desirous to obtain possession of the person of Allan\r\nBreck Stewart, supposed to be the actual homicide. James Mhor Drummond\r\nwas secretly applied to to trepan Stewart to the sea-coast, and bring him\r\nover to Britain, to almost certain death. Drummond MacGregor had kindred\r\nconnections with the slain Glenure; and, besides, the MacGregors and\r\nCampbells had been friends of late, while the former clan and the\r\nStewarts had, as we have seen, been recently at feud; lastly, Robert Oig\r\nwas now in custody at Edinburgh, and James was desirous to do some\r\nservice by which his brother might be saved. The joint force of these\r\nmotives may, in James's estimation of right and wrong, have been some\r\nvindication for engaging in such an enterprise, although, as must be\r\nnecessarily supposed, it could only be executed by treachery of a gross\r\ndescription. MacGregor stipulated for a license to return to England,\r\npromising to bring Allan Breck thither along with him. But the intended\r\nvictim was put upon his guard by two countrymen, who suspected James's\r\nintentions towards him. He escaped from his kidnapper, after, as\r\nMacGregor alleged, robbing his portmanteau of some clothes and four\r\nsnuff-boxes. Such a charge, it may be observed, could scarce have been\r\nmade unless the parties had been living on a footing of intimacy, and had\r\naccess to each other's baggage.\r\n\r\nAlthough James Drummond had thus missed his blow in the matter of Allan\r\nBreck Stewart, he used his license to make a journey to London, and had\r\nan interview, as he avers, with Lord Holdernesse. His Lordship, and the\r\nUnder-Secretary, put many puzzling questions to him; and, as he says,\r\noffered him a situation, which would bring him bread, in the Government's\r\nservice. This office was advantageous as to emolument; but in the opinion\r\nof James Drummond, his acceptance of it would have been a disgrace to his\r\nbirth, and have rendered him a scourge to his country. If such a tempting\r\noffer and sturdy rejection had any foundation in fact, it probably\r\nrelates to some plan of espionage on the Jacobites, which the Government\r\nmight hope to carry on by means of a man who, in the matter of Allan\r\nBreck Stewart, had shown no great nicety of feeling. Drummond MacGregor\r\nwas so far accommodating as to intimate his willingness to act in any\r\nstation in which other gentlemen of honour served, but not otherwise;--an\r\nanswer which, compared with some passages of his past life, may remind\r\nthe reader of Ancient Pistol standing upon his reputation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus proved intractable, as he tells the story, to the proposals\r\nof Lord Holdernesse, James Drummond was ordered instantly to quit\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOn his return to France, his condition seems to have been utterly\r\ndisastrous. He was seized with fever and gravel--ill, consequently, in\r\nbody, and weakened and dispirited in mind. Allan Breck Stewart threatened\r\nto put him to death in revenge of the designs he had harboured against\r\nhim.*\r\n\r\n* Note E. Allan Breck Stewart.\r\n\r\nThe Stewart clan were in the highest degree unfriendly to him: and his\r\nlate expedition to London had been attended with many suspicious\r\ncircumstances, amongst which it was not the slightest that he had kept\r\nhis purpose secret from his chief Bohaldie. His intercourse with Lord\r\nHoldernesse was suspicious. The Jacobites were probably, like Don Bernard\r\nde Castel Blaze, in Gil Blas, little disposed to like those who kept\r\ncompany with Alguazils. Mac-Donnell of Lochgarry, a man of unquestioned\r\nhonour, lodged an information against James Drummond before the High\r\nBailie of Dunkirk, accusing him of being a spy, so that he found himself\r\nobliged to leave that town and come to Paris, with only the sum of\r\nthirteen livres for his immediate subsistence, and with absolute beggary\r\nstaring him in the face.\r\n\r\nWe do not offer the convicted common thief, the accomplice in MacLaren's\r\nassassination, or the manager of the outrage against Jean Key, as an\r\nobject of sympathy; but it is melancholy to look on the dying struggles\r\neven of a wolf or a tiger, creatures of a species directly hostile to our\r\nown; and, in like manner, the utter distress of this man, whose faults\r\nmay have sprung from a wild system of education, working on a haughty\r\ntemper, will not be perused without some pity. In his last letter to\r\nBohaldie, dated Paris, 25th September 1754, he describes his state of\r\ndestitution as absolute, and expresses himself willing to exercise his\r\ntalents in breaking or breeding horses, or as a hunter or fowler, if he\r\ncould only procure employment in such an inferior capacity till something\r\nbetter should occur. An Englishman may smile, but a Scotchman will sigh\r\nat the postscript, in which the poor starving exile asks the loan of his\r\npatron's bagpipes that he might play over some of the melancholy tunes of\r\nhis own land. But the effect of music arises, in a great degree, from\r\nassociation; and sounds which might jar the nerves of a Londoner or\r\nParisian, bring back to the Highlander his lofty mountain, wild lake, and\r\nthe deeds of his fathers of the glen. To prove MacGregor's claim to our\r\nreader's compassion, we here insert the last part of the letter alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all appearance I am born to suffer crosses, and it seems they're not\r\nat an end; for such is my wretched case at present, that I do not know\r\nearthly where to go or what to do, as I have no subsistence to keep body\r\nand soul together. All that I have carried here is about 13 livres, and\r\nhave taken a room at my old quarters in Hotel St. Pierre, Rue de Cordier.\r\nI send you the bearer, begging of you to let me know if you are to be in\r\ntown soon, that I may have the pleasure of seeing you, for I have none to\r\nmake application to but you alone; and all I want is, if it was possible\r\nyou could contrive where I could be employed without going to entire\r\nbeggary. This probably is a difficult point, yet unless it's attended\r\nwith some difficulty, you might think nothing of it, as your long head\r\ncan bring about matters of much more difficulty and consequence than\r\nthis. If you'd disclose this matter to your friend Mr. Butler, it's\r\npossible he might have some employ wherein I could be of use, as I\r\npretend to know as much of breeding and riding of horse as any in France,\r\nbesides that I am a good hunter either on horseback or by footing. You\r\nmay judge my reduction, as I propose the meanest things to lend a turn\r\ntill better cast up. I am sorry that I am obliged to give you so much\r\ntrouble, but I hope you are very well assured that I am grateful for what\r\nyou have done for me, and I leave you to judge of my present wretched\r\ncase. I am, and shall for ever continue, dear Chief, your own to command,\r\nJas. MacGregor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. S.--If you'd send your pipes by the bearer, and all the other little\r\ntrinkims belonging to it, I would put them in order, and play some\r\nmelancholy tunes, which I may now with safety, and in real truth. Forgive\r\nmy not going directly to you, for if I could have borne the seeing of\r\nyourself, I could not choose to be seen by my friends in my wretchedness,\r\nnor by any of my acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile MacGregor wrote in this disconsolate manner, Death, the sad but\r\nsure remedy for mortal evils, and decider of all doubts and\r\nuncertainties, was hovering near him. A memorandum on the back of the\r\nletter says the writer died about a week after, in October 1754.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to mention the fate of Robin Oig--for the other sons of\r\nRob Roy seem to have been no way distinguished. Robin was apprehended by\r\na party of military from the fort of Inversnaid, at the foot of Gartmore,\r\nand was conveyed to Edinburgh 26th May 1753. After a delay, which may\r\nhave been protracted by the negotiations of James for delivering up Allan\r\nBreck Stewart upon promise of his brother's life, Robin Oig, on the 24th\r\nof December 1753, was brought to the bar of the High Court of Justiciary,\r\nand indicted by the name of Robert MacGregor, alias Campbell, alias\r\nDrummond, alias Robert Oig; and the evidence led against him resembled\r\nexactly that which was brought by the Crown on the former trial. Robert's\r\ncase was in some degree more favourable than his brother's;--for, though\r\nthe principal in the forcible marriage, he had yet to plead that he had\r\nshown symptoms of relenting while they were carrying Jean Key off, which\r\nwere silenced by the remonstrances and threats of his harder natured\r\nbrother James. A considerable space of time had also elapsed since the\r\npoor woman died, which is always a strong circumstance in favour of the\r\naccused; for there is a sort of perspective in guilt, and crimes of an\r\nold date seem less odious than those of recent occurrence. But\r\nnotwithstanding these considerations, the jury, in Robert's case, did not\r\nexpress any solicitude to save his life as they had done that of James.\r\nThey found him guilty of being art and part in the forcible abduction of\r\nJean Key from her own dwelling.*\r\n\r\n* The Trials of the Sons of Rob Roy, with anecdotes of Himself and his\r\nFamily, were published at Edinburgh, 1818, in 12mo.\r\n\r\nRobin Oig was condemned to death, and executed on the 14th February 1754.\r\nAt the place of execution he behaved with great decency; and professing\r\nhimself a Catholic, imputed all his misfortunes to his swerving from the\r\ntrue church two or three years before. He confessed the violent methods\r\nhe had used to gain Mrs. Key, or Wright, and hoped his fate would stop\r\nfurther proceedings against his brother James.*\r\n\r\n* James died near three months before, but his family might easily remain\r\na long time without the news of that event.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers observed that his body, after hanging the usual time, was\r\ndelivered to his friends to be carried to the Highlands. To this the\r\nrecollection of a venerable friend, recently taken from us in the fulness\r\nof years, then a schoolboy at Linlithgow, enables the author to add, that\r\na much larger body of MacGregors than had cared to advance to Edinburgh\r\nreceived the corpse at that place with the coronach and other wild\r\nemblems of Highland mourning, and so escorted it to Balquhidder. Thus we\r\nmay conclude this long account of Rob Roy and his family with the classic\r\nphrase,\r\n\r\n                          Ite. Conclamatum est.\r\n\r\nI have only to add, that I have selected the above from many anecdotes of\r\nRob Roy which were, and may still be, current among the mountains where\r\nhe flourished; but I am far from warranting their exact authenticity.\r\nClannish partialities were very apt to guide the tongue and pen, as well\r\nas the pistol and claymore, and the features of an anecdote are\r\nwonderfully softened or exaggerated as the story is told by a MacGregor\r\nor a Campbell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I.--ADVERTISEMENT\r\nFOR THE APPREHENSION OF ROB ROY.\r\n\r\n(From the Edinburgh Evening Courant, June 18 to June 21, A.D. 1732. No.\r\n1058.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Robert Campbell, commonly known by the name of Rob Roy MacGregor,\r\nbeing lately intrusted by several noblemen and gentlemen with\r\nconsiderable sums for buying cows for them in the Highlands, has\r\ntreacherously gone off with the money, to the value of L1000 sterling,\r\nwhich he carries along with him. All Magistrates and Officers of his\r\nMajesty's forces are intreated to seize upon the said Rob Roy, and the\r\nmoney which he carries with him, until the persons concerned in the money\r\nbe heard against him; and that notice be given, when he is apprehended,\r\nto the keepers of the Exchange Coffee-house at Edinburgh, and the keeper\r\nof the Coffee-house at Glasgow, where the parties concerned will be\r\nadvertised, and the seizers shall be very reasonably rewarded for their\r\npains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that this Hue and Cry, which is afterwards repeated in\r\nthe same paper, contains no description of Rob Roy's person, which, of\r\ncourse, we must suppose to have been pretty generally known. As it is\r\ndirected against Rob Roy personally, it would seem to exclude the idea of\r\nthe cattle being carried off by his partner, MacDonald, who would\r\ncertainly have been mentioned in the advertisement, if the creditors\r\nconcerned had supposed him to be in possession of the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.--LETTERS\r\nFROM AND TO THE DUKE OF MONTROSE\r\nRESPECTING ROB ROY'S ARREST OF MR. GRAHAME OF KILLEARN.\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Montrose to--_*\r\n\r\n* It does not appear to whom this letter was addressed. Certainly, from\r\nits style and tenor, It was designed for some person high in rank and\r\noffice--perhaps the King's Advocate for the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlasgow, the 21st November, 1716.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,--I was surprised last night with the account of a very\r\nremarkable instance of the insolence of that very notorious rogue Rob\r\nRoy, whom your lordship has often heard named. The honour of his\r\nMajesty's Government being concerned in it, I thought it my duty to\r\nacquaint your lordship of the particulars by an express.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Grahame of Killearn (whom I have had occasion to mention frequently\r\nto you, for the good service he did last winter during the rebellion)\r\nhaving the charge of my Highland estate, went to Monteath, which is a\r\npart of it, on Monday last, to bring in my rents, it being usual for him\r\nto be there for two or three nights together at this time of the year, in\r\na country house, for the conveniency of meeting the tenants, upon that\r\naccount. The same night, about 9 of the clock, Rob Roy, with a party of\r\nthose ruffians whom he has still kept about him since the late rebellion,\r\nsurrounded the house where Mr. Grahame was with some of my tenants doing\r\nhis business, ordered his men to present their guns in att the windows of\r\nthe room where he was sitting, while he himself at the same time with\r\nothers entered at the door, with cocked pistols, and made Mr. Grahame\r\nprisoner, carrying him away to the hills with the money he had got, his\r\nbooks and papers, and my tenants' bonds for their fines, amounting to\r\nabove a thousand pounds sterling, whereof the one-half had been paid last\r\nyear, and the other was to have been paid now; and att the same time had\r\nthe insolence to cause him to write a letter to me (the copy of which is\r\nenclosed) offering me terms of a treaty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat your Lordship may have the better view of this matter, it will be\r\nnecessary that I should inform you, that this fellow has now, of a long\r\ntime, put himself at the head of the Clan M'Gregor, a race of people who\r\nin all ages have distinguished themselves beyond others, by robberies,\r\ndepredations, and murders, and have been the constant harbourers and\r\nentertainers of vagabonds and loose people. From the time of the\r\nRevolution he has taken every opportunity to appear against the\r\nGovernment, acting rather as a robber than doing any real service to\r\nthose whom he pretended to appear for, and has really done more mischief\r\nto the countrie than all the other Highlanders have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome three or four years before the last rebellion broke out, being\r\noverburdened with debts, he quitted his ordinary residence, and removed\r\nsome twelve or sixteen miles farther into the Highlands, putting himself\r\nunder the protection of the Earl of Bredalbin. When my Lord Cadogan was\r\nin the Highlands, he ordered his house att this place to be burnt, which\r\nyour Lordship sees he now places to my account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis obliges him to return to the same countrie he went from, being a\r\nmost rugged inaccessible place, where he took up his residence anew\r\namongst his own friends and relations; but well judging that it was\r\npossible to surprise him, he, with about forty-five of his followers,\r\nwent to Inverary, and made a sham surrender of their arms to Coll.\r\nCampbell of Finab, Commander of one of the Independent Companies, and\r\nreturned home with his men, each of them having the Coll.'s protection.\r\nThis happened in the beginning of summer last; yet not long after he\r\nappeared with his men twice in arms, in opposition to the King's troops:\r\nand one of those times attackt them, rescued a prisoner from them, and\r\nall this while sent abroad his party through the countrie, plundering the\r\ncountrie people, and amongst the rest some of my tenants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing informed of these disorders after I came to Scotland, I applied to\r\nLieut.-Genll. Carpenter, who ordered three parties from Glasgow,\r\nStirling, and Finlarig, to march in the night by different routes, in\r\norder to surprise him and his men in their houses, which would have its\r\neffect certainly, if the great rains that happened to fall that verie\r\nnight had not retarded the march of the troops, so as some of the parties\r\ncame too late to the stations that they were ordered for. All that could\r\nbe done upon the occasion was to burn a countrie house, where Rob Roy\r\nthen resided, after some of his clan had, from the rocks, fired upon the\r\nking's troops, by which a grenadier was killed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Grahame of Killearn, being my deputy-sheriff in that countrie, went\r\nalong with the party that marched from Stirling; and doubtless will now\r\nmeet with the worse treatment from that barbarous people on that account.\r\nBesides, that he is my relation, and that they know how active he has\r\nbeen in the service of the Government--all which, your Lordship may\r\nbelieve, puts me under very great concern for the gentleman, while, at\r\nthe same time, I can foresee no manner of way how to relieve him, other\r\nthan to leave him to chance and his own management.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had my thoughts before of proposing to Government the building of some\r\nbarracks as the only expedient for suppressing these rebels, and securing\r\nthe peace of the countrie; and in that view I spoke to Genll. Carpenter,\r\nwho has now a scheme of it in his hands; and I am persuaded that will be\r\nthe true method for restraining them effectually; but, in the meantime,\r\nit will be necessary to lodge some of the troops in those places, upon\r\nwhich I intend to write to the Generall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sensible I have troubled your Lordship with a very long letter,\r\nwhich I should be ashamed of, were I myself singly concerned; but where\r\nthe honour of the King's Government is touched, I need make no apologie,\r\nand I shall only beg leave to add, that I am, with great respect, and\r\ntruth,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyr.

I refer the way and manner I was apprehended, to the\r\nbearer, and shall only, in short, acquaint your Grace with the demands,\r\nwhich are, that your Grace shall discharge him of all soumes he owes your\r\nGrace, and give him the soume of 3400 merks for his loss and damages\r\nsustained by him, both at Craigrostown and at his house, Auchinchisallen;\r\nand that your Grace shall give your word not to trouble or prosecute him\r\nafterwards; till which time he carries me, all the money I received this\r\nday, my books and bonds for entress, not yet paid, along with him, with\r\nassurance of hard usage, if any party are sent after him. The soume I\r\nreceived this day, conform to the nearest computation I can make before\r\nseveral of the gentlemen, is 3227L. 2sh. 8d. Scots, of which I gave them\r\nnotes.

It seems Rob Roy, when he came\r\nto consider a little better of it, found that, he could not mend his\r\nmatters by retaining Killearn his prisoner, which could only expose him\r\nstill the more to the justice of the Government; and therefore thought\r\nfit to dismiss him on Sunday evening last, having kept him from the\r\nMonday night before, under a very uneasy kind of restraint, being obliged\r\nto change continually from place to place. He gave him back the books,\r\npapers, and bonds, but kept the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, with great truth, Sir,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour most humble servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMONTROSE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Some papers connected with Rob Roy Macgregor, signed \xe2\x80\x9cRo.

That impertinent criticks or flatterers may not brand me\r\nfor challenging a man that's repute of a poor dastardly soul, let such\r\nknow that I admit of the two great supporters of his character and the\r\ncaptain of his bands to joyne with him in the combat. Then sure your\r\nGrace wont have the impudence to clamour att court for multitudes to hunt\r\nme like a fox, under pretence that I am not to be found above ground.\r\nThis saves your Grace and the troops any further trouble of searching;\r\nthat is, if your ambition of glory press you to embrace this unequald\r\nventure offerd of Rob's head. But if your Grace's piety, prudence, and\r\ncowardice, forbids hazarding this gentlemanly expedient, then let your\r\ndesire of peace restore what you have robed from me by the tyranny of\r\nyour present cituation, otherwise your overthrow as a man is determined;\r\nand advertise your friends never more to look for the frequent civility\r\npayed them, of sending them home without their arms only. Even their\r\nformer cravings wont purchase that favour; so your Grace by this has\r\npeace in your offer, if the sound of wax be frightful, and chuse you\r\nwhilk, your good friend or mortal enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis singular rhodomontade is enclosed in a letter to a friend of Rob\r\nRoy, probably a retainer of the Duke of Argyle in Isle, which is in these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,--Receive the enclosd paper, qn you are takeing yor Botle it will\r\ndivert yorself and comrad's.

The war he alludes\r\nto is probably some vague report of invasion from Spain. Such rumours\r\nwere likely enough to be afloat, in consequence of the disembarkation of\r\nthe troops who were taken at Glensheal in the preceding year, 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IV.--LETTER\r\n\r\nFROM ROBERT CAMPBELL, _alias_ M'GREGOR,\r\nCOMMONLY CALLED ROB ROY, TO FIELD-MARSHAL WADE,\r\n\r\nThen receiving the submission of disaffected Chieftains and Clans.*\r\n\r\n* This curious epistle is copied from an authentic narrative of Marshal\r\nWade's proceedings in the Highlands, communicated by the late eminent\r\nantiquary, George Chalmers, Esq., to Mr. Robert Jamieson, of the Register\r\nHouse, Edinburgh, and  published in the Appendix to an Edition of Burt's\r\nLetters from the North of Scotland, 2 vols. 8vo, Edinburgh, 1818.\r\n\r\nSir,--The great humanity with which you have constantly acted in the\r\ndischarge of the trust reposed in you, and your ever having made use of\r\nthe great powers with which you were vested as the means of doing good\r\nand charitable offices to such as ye found proper objects of compassion,\r\nwill, I hope, excuse my importunity in endeavouring to approve myself not\r\nabsolutely unworthy of that mercy and favour which your Excellency has so\r\ngenerously procured from his Majesty for others in my unfortunate\r\ncircumstances. I am very sensible nothing can be alledged sufficient to\r\nexcuse so great a crime as I have been guilty of it, that of Rebellion.\r\nBut I humbly beg leave to lay before your Excellency some particulars in\r\nthe circumstance of my guilt, which, I hope, will extenuate it in some\r\nmeasure. It was my misfortune, at the time the Rebellion broke out, to be\r\nliable to legal diligence and caption, at the Duke of Montrose's\r\ninstance, for debt alledged due to him. To avoid being flung into prison,\r\nas I must certainly have been, had I followed my real inclinations in\r\njoining the King's troops at Stirling, I was forced to take party with\r\nthe adherents of the Pretender; for the country being all in arms, it was\r\nneither safe nor indeed possible for me to stand neuter. I should not,\r\nhowever, plead my being forced into that unnatural rebellion against his\r\nMajesty, King George, if I could not at the same time assure your\r\nExcellency, that I not only avoided acting offensively against his\r\nMajesty's forces upon all occasions, but on the contrary, sent his Grace\r\nthe Duke of Argyle all the intelligence I could from time to time, of the\r\nstrength and situation of the rebels; which I hope his Grace will do me\r\nthe justice to acknowledge. As to the debt to the Duke of Montrose, I\r\nhave discharged it to the utmost farthing. I beg your Excellency would be\r\npersuaded that, had it been in my power, as it was in my inclination, I\r\nshould always have acted for the service of his Majesty King George, and\r\nthat one reason of my begging the favour of your intercession with his\r\nMajesty for the pardon of my life, is the earnest desire I have to employ\r\nit in his service, whose goodness, justice, and humanity, are so\r\nconspicuous to all mankind.--I am, with all duty and respect, your\r\nExcellency's most, &c.,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobert Campbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IVa.--LETTER.\r\n\r\nESCAPE OF ROB ROY FROM THE DUKE OF ATHOLE.\r\n\r\nThe following copy of a letter which passed from one clergyman of the\r\nChurch of Scotland to another, was communicated to me by John Gregorson,\r\nEsq. of Ardtornish. The escape of Rob Roy is mentioned, like other\r\ninteresting news of the time with which it is intermingled. The\r\ndisagreement between the Dukes of Athole and Argyle seems to have\r\nanimated the former against Rob Roy, as one of Argyle's partisans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRev. and dear Brother,\r\n\r\nYrs of the 28th Jun I had by the bearer. Im pleased yo have got back\r\nagain yr Delinquent which may probably safe you of the trouble of her\r\nchild. I'm sory I've yet very little of certain news to give you from\r\nCourt tho' I've seen all the last weekes prints, only I find in them a\r\npasage which is all the account I can give you of the Indemnity yt when\r\nthe estates of forfaulted Rebells Comes to be sold all Just debts\r\nDocumented are to be preferred to Officers of the Court of enquiry. The\r\nBill in favours of that Court against the Lords of Session in Scotland in\r\npast the house of Commons and Come before the Lords which is thought to\r\nbe considerably more ample yn formerly wt respect to the Disposeing of\r\nestates Canvassing and paying of Debts. It's said yt the examinations of\r\nCadugans accounts is droped but it wants Confirmations here as yet.\r\nOxford's tryals should be entered upon Saturday last. We hear that the\r\nDuchess of Argyle is wt child. I doe not hear yt the Divisions at Court\r\nare any thing abated or of any appearance of the Dukes having any thing\r\nof his Maj: favour. I heartily wish the present humours at Court may not\r\nprove an encouragmt to watchfull and restles enemies.\r\n\r\nMy accounts of Rob Roy his escape are yt after severall Embassies between\r\nhis Grace (who I hear did Correspond wt some at Court about it) and Rob\r\nhe at length upon promise of protectione Came to waite upon the Duke &\r\nbeing presently secured his Grace sent post to Edr to acquent the Court\r\nof his being aprehended & call his friends at Edr and to desire a party\r\nfrom Gen Carpinter to receive and bring him to Edr which party came the\r\nlength of Kenross in Fife, he was to be delivered to them by a party his\r\nGrace had demanded from the Governour at Perth, who when upon their march\r\ntowards Dunkell to receive him, were mete wt and returned by his Grace\r\nhaving resolved to deliver him by a party of his own men and left Rob at\r\nLogierate under a strong guard till yt party should be ready to receive\r\nhim.

When serious in this privat Conversations he is making some\r\nfew steps carelessly from the Door about the house till he comes close by\r\nthis horse which he soon mounted and made off. This is no small\r\nmortifican to the guard because of the delay it give to there hopes of a\r\nConsiderable additionall charge agt John Roy.* my wife was upon Thursday\r\nlast delivered of a Son after sore travell of which she still continues\r\nvery weak.\r\n\r\n* _i.e._ John the Red--John Duke of Argyle, so called from his\r\ncomplexion, more commonly styled \xe2\x80\x9cRed John the Warriour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI give yl Lady hearty thanks for the Highland plaid.

One example\r\nis found in Mr. Robert Jamieson's Popular Scottish Songs:--\r\n\r\n                        Bonny Babby Livingstone\r\n                        Gaed out to see the kye,\r\n                        And she has met with Glenlyon,\r\n                        Who has stolen her away.\r\n\r\n                        He took free her her sattin coat,\r\n                        But an her silken gown,\r\n                        Syne roud her in his tartan plaid,\r\n                        And happd her round and roun'.\r\n\r\nIn another ballad we are told how--\r\n\r\n                       Four-and-twenty Hieland men,\r\n                       Came doun by Fiddoch Bide,\r\n                       And they have sworn a deadly aith,\r\n                       Jean Muir suld be a bride:\r\n\r\n                       And they have sworn a deadly aith,\r\n                       Ilke man upon his durke,\r\n                       That she should wed with Duncan Ger,\r\n                       Or they'd make bloody works.\r\n\r\nThis last we have from tradition, but there are many others in the\r\ncollections of Scottish Ballads to the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe achievement of Robert Oig, or young Rob Roy, as the Lowlanders called\r\nhim, was celebrated in a ballad, of which there are twenty different and\r\nvarious editions. The tune is lively and wild, and we select the\r\nfollowing words from memory:--\r\n\r\n                  Rob Roy is frae the Hielands come,\r\n                      Down to the Lowland border;\r\n                   And he has stolen that lady away,\r\n                      To haud his house in order.\r\n\r\n                   He set her on a milk-white steed,\r\n                       Of none he stood in awe;\r\n                   Untill they reached the Hieland hills,\r\n                             Aboon the Balmaha'!*\r\n\r\n* A pass on the eastern margin of Loch Lomond, and an entrance to the\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Saying, Be content, be content,\r\n                       Be content with me, lady;\r\n                      Where will ye find in Lennox land,\r\n                      Sae braw a man as me, lady?\r\n\r\n                      Rob Roy he was my father called,\r\n                      MacGregor was his name, lady;\r\n                      A' the country, far and near,\r\n                      Have heard MacGregor's fame, lady.\r\n\r\n                      He was a hedge about his friends,\r\n                      A heckle to his foes, lady;\r\n                      If any man did him gainsay,\r\n                      He felt his deadly blows, lady.\r\n\r\n                      I am as bold, I am as bold,\r\n                      I am as bold and more, lady;\r\n                      Any man that doubts my word,\r\n                      May try my gude claymore, lady.\r\n\r\n                       Then be content, be content.\r\n                       Be content with me, lady;\r\n                       For now you are my wedded wife,\r\n                       Until the day you die, lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VI--GHLUNE DHU.\r\n\r\nThe following notices concerning this Chief fell under the Author's eye\r\nwhile the sheets were in the act of going through the press. They occur\r\nin manuscript memoirs, written by a person intimately acquainted with the\r\nincidents of 1745.\r\n\r\nThis Chief had the important task intrusted to him of defending the\r\nCastle of Doune, in which the Chevalier placed a garrison to protect his\r\ncommunication with the Highlands, and to repel any sallies which might be\r\nmade from Stirling Castle--Ghlune Dhu distinguished himself by his good\r\nconduct in this charge.\r\n\r\nGhlune Dhu is thus described:--\xe2\x80\x9cGlengyle is, in person, a tall handsome\r\nman, and has more of the mien of the ancient heroes than our modern fine\r\ngentlemen are possessed of. He is honest and disinterested to a\r\nproverb--extremely modest--brave and intrepid--and born one of the best\r\npartisans in Europe. In short, the whole people of that country declared\r\nthat never did men live under so mild a government as Glengyle's, not a\r\nman having so much as lost a chicken while he continued there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would appear from this curious passage, that Glengyle--not Stewart of\r\nBalloch, as averred in a note on Waverley--commanded the garrison of\r\nDoune. Balloch might, no doubt, succeed MacGregor in the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION TO ROB ROY\r\n\r\nIn the magnum opus, the author's final edition of the Waverley Novels,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d appears out of its chronological order, and comes next after\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Antiquary.\xe2\x80\x9d In this, as in other matters, the present edition\r\nfollows that of 1829. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Antiquary,\xe2\x80\x9d as we said, contained in its\r\npreface the author's farewell to his art. This valediction was meant as\r\nprelude to a fresh appearance in a new disguise. Constable, who had\r\nbrought out the earlier works, did not publish the \xe2\x80\x9cTales of my Landlord\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Black Dwarf\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOld Mortality \xe2\x80\x9c), which Scott had nearly finished\r\nby November 12, 1816. The four volumes appeared from the houses of Mr.\r\nMurray and Mr. Blackwood, on December 1, 1816. Within less than a month\r\ncame out \xe2\x80\x9cHarold the Dauntless,\xe2\x80\x9d by the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bridal of\r\nTriermain.\xe2\x80\x9d Scott's work on the historical part of the \xe2\x80\x9cAnnual Register\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n had also been unusually arduous. At Abbotsford, or at Ashiestiel, his\r\nmode of life was particularly healthy; in Edinburgh, between the claims\r\nof the courts, of literature, and of society, he was scarcely ever in the\r\nopen air. Thus hard sedentary work caused, between the publication\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cOld Mortality\xe2\x80\x9d and that of \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy,\xe2\x80\x9d the first of those alarming\r\nillnesses which overshadowed the last fifteen years of his life. The\r\nearliest attack of cramp in the stomach occurred on March 5, 1817, when\r\nhe \xe2\x80\x9cretired from the room with a scream of agony which electrified his\r\nguests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiving on \xe2\x80\x9cparritch,\xe2\x80\x9d as he tells Miss Baillie (for his national spirit\r\nrejected arrowroot), Scott had yet energy enough to plan a dramatic piece\r\nfor Terry, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Doom of Devorgoil.\xe2\x80\x9d But in April he announced to John\r\nBallantyne \xe2\x80\x9ca good subject\xe2\x80\x9d for a novel, and on May 6, John, after a\r\nvisit to Abbotsford with Constable, proclaimed to James Ballantyne the\r\nadvent of \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe anecdote about the title is well known. Constable suggested it, and\r\nScott was at first wisely reluctant to \xe2\x80\x9cwrite up to a title.\xe2\x80\x9d Names like\r\nRob Roy, Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Cleopatra, and so forth, tell the\r\nreader too much, and, Scott imagined, often excite hopes which cannot be\r\nfulfilled. However, in the geniality of an after-dinner hour in the\r\ngardens of Abbotsford, Scott allowed Constable to be sponsor. Many things\r\nhad lately brought Rob into his mind. In 1812 Scott had acquired Rob\r\nRoy's gun--\xe2\x80\x9ca long Spanish-barrelled piece, with his initials R. M. C.,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n C standing for Campbell, a name assumed in compliment to the Argyll\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nRob's spleuchan had also been presented by Mr. Train to Sir Walter, in\r\n1816, and may have directed his thoughts to this popular freebooter.\r\nThough Rob flourished in the '15, he was really a character very near\r\nScott, whose friend Invernahyle had fought Rob with broadsword and\r\ntarget--a courteous combat like that between Ajax and Hector.\r\n\r\nAt Tullibody Scott had met, in 1793, a gentleman who once visited Rob,\r\nand arranged to pay him blackmail.\r\n\r\nMr. William Adam had mentioned to Scott in 1816 the use of the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccurlie-wurlies\xe2\x80\x9d for highly decorated architecture, and recognised the\r\nphrase, next year, in the mouth of Andrew Fairservice.\r\n\r\nIn the meeting at Abbotsford (May 2, 1817) Scott was very communicative,\r\nsketched Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and improvised a dialogue between Rob and\r\nthe magistrate. A week later he quoted to Southey, Swift's lines--\r\nToo bad for a blessing, too good for a curse,--which probably suggested\r\nAndrew Fairservice's final estimate of Scott's hero,--\xe2\x80\x9cover bad for\r\nblessing, and ower gude for banning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese are the trifles which show the bent of Scott's mind at this period.\r\nThe summer of 1817 he spent in working at the \xe2\x80\x9cAnnual Register\xe2\x80\x9d and at\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBorder Antiquities.\xe2\x80\x9d When the courts rose, he visited Rob's cave at\r\nthe head of Loch Lomond; and this visit seems to have been gossiped\r\nabout, as literary people, hearing of the new novel, expected the cave to\r\nbe a very prominent feature. He also went to Glasgow, and refreshed his\r\nmemory of the cathedral; nor did he neglect old books, such as \xe2\x80\x9cA Tour\r\nthrough Great Britain, by a Gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (4th Edition, 1748). This yielded\r\nhim the Bailie's account of Glasgow commerce \xe2\x80\x9cin Musselburgh stuffs and\r\nEdinburgh shalloons,\xe2\x80\x9d and the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csortable cargoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHence, too, Scott took the description of the rise of Glasgow. Thus Scott\r\nwas taking pains with his preparations. The book was not written in\r\npost-haste. Announced to Constable early in May, the last sheet was not\r\ncorrected till about December 21, when Scott wrote to Ballantyne:--\r\n\r\nDEAR JAMES,--\r\n\r\n                        With great joy I send you Roy.\r\n                          'T was a tough job,\r\n                        But we're done with Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d was published on the last day of 1817. The toughness of the job\r\nwas caused by constant pain, and by struggles with \xe2\x80\x9cthe lassitude of\r\nopium.\xe2\x80\x9d So seldom sentimental, so rarely given to expressing his\r\nmelancholy moods in verse, Scott, while composing \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the\r\nbeautiful poem \xe2\x80\x9cThe sun upon the Weirdlaw Hill,\xe2\x80\x9d in which, for this once,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpity of self through all makes broken moan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome stress may be laid on the state of Sir Walter's health at this\r\nmoment, because a living critic has tried to show that, in his case,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cevery pang of the stomach paralyses the brain;\xe2\x80\x9d that he \xe2\x80\x9cnever had a fit\r\nof the cramp without spoiling a chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d--[Mr. Ruskin's \xe2\x80\x9cFiction Fair\r\nand Foul,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNineteenth Century,\xe2\x80\x9d 1880, p. 955.]--\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d is a\r\nsufficient answer to these theories. The mind of Scott was no slave to\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nThe success of the story is pleasantly proved by a sentence in a review\r\nof the day: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an event unprecedented in the annals either of\r\nliterature or of the custom-house that the entire cargo of a packet, or\r\nsmack, bound from Leith to London, should be the impression of a novel,\r\nfor which the public curiosity was so much upon the alert as to require\r\nthis immense importation to satisfy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen thousand copies of a three-volume novel are certainly a ponderous\r\ncargo, and Constable printed no fewer in his first edition. Scott was\r\nassured of his own triumph in February 1819, when a dramatised version of\r\nhis novel was acted in Edinburgh by the company of Mr. William Murray, a\r\ndescendant of the traitor Murray of Broughton. Mr. Charles Mackay made a\r\ncapital Bailie, and the piece remains a favourite with Scotch audiences.\r\nIt is plain, from the reviews, that in one respect \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d rather\r\ndisappointed the world. They had expected Rob to be a much more imposing\r\nand majestic cateran, and complained that his foot was set too late on\r\nhis native heather. They found too much of the drover and intriguer, too\r\nlittle of the traditional driver of the spoil. This was what Scott\r\nforesaw when he objected to \xe2\x80\x9cwriting up to a title.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, he did not\r\nwrite up to, it, and, as the \xe2\x80\x9cScots Magazine\xe2\x80\x9d said, \xe2\x80\x9cshaped his story in\r\nsuch a manner as to throw busybodies out in their chase, with a slight\r\ndegree of malicious finesse.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll the expeditions to the wonderful cave\r\nhave been thrown away, for the said cave is not once, we think, mentioned\r\nfrom beginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d equals \xe2\x80\x9cWaverley\xe2\x80\x9d in its pictures of Highland and Lowland\r\nsociety and character. Scott had clearly set himself to state his\r\nopinions about the Highlands as they were under the patriarchal system of\r\ngovernment. The Highlanders were then a people, not lawless, indeed, but\r\nall their law was the will of their chief. Bailie Nicol Jarvie makes a\r\nstatement of their economic and military condition as accurate as it is\r\nhumorous. The modern \xe2\x80\x9cHighland Question\xe2\x80\x9d may be studied as well in the\r\nBailie's words as in volumes of history and wildernesses of blue-books.\r\nA people patriarchal and military as the Arabs of the desert were\r\nsuddenly dragged into modern commercial and industrial society. All old\r\nbonds were snapped in a moment; emigration (at first opposed by some of\r\nthe chiefs) and the French wars depleted the country of its \xe2\x80\x9clang-leggit\r\ncallants, gaun wanting the breeks.\xe2\x80\x9d Cattle took the place of men, sheep\r\nof cattle, deer of sheep, and, in the long peace, a population grew up\r\nagain--a population destitute of employment even more than of old,\r\nbecause war and robbery had ceased to be outlets for its energy. Some\r\nchiefs, as Dr. Johnson said, treated their lands as an attorney treats\r\nhis row of cheap houses in a town. Hence the Highland Question,--a\r\nquestion in which Scott's sympathies were with the Highlanders.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy,\xe2\x80\x9d naturally, is no mere \xe2\x80\x9cnovel with a purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d no economic\r\ntract in disguise. Among Scott's novels it stands alone as regards its\r\npictures of passionate love. The love of Diana Vernon is no less\r\npassionate for its admirable restraint. Here Scott displays, without\r\naffectation, a truly Greek reserve in his art. The deep and strong\r\naffection of Diana Vernon would not have been otherwise handled by him\r\nwho drew the not more immortal picture of Antigone. Unlike modern\r\nnovelists, Sir Walter deals neither in analysis nor in rapturous\r\neffusions. We can, unfortunately, imagine but too easily how some writers\r\nwould peep and pry into the concealed emotions of that maiden heart; how\r\nothers would revel in tears, kisses, and caresses. In place of all these\r\nScott writes:--\r\n\r\n     She extended her hand, but I clasped her to my bosom. She sighed as\r\n     she extricated herself from the embrace which she permitted, escaped\r\n     to the door which led to her own apartment, and I saw her no more.\r\n\r\nMonths pass, in a mist of danger and intrigue, before the lovers meet\r\nagain in the dusk and the solitude.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the girl's voice through the\r\n     moonlight, \xe2\x80\x9cshould not whistle his favourite airs when he wishes to\r\n     remain undiscovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     And Diana Vernon--for she, wrapped in a horseman's cloak, was the\r\n     last speaker--whistled in playful mimicry the second part of the\r\n     tune, which was on my lips when they came up.\r\n\r\nSurely there was never, in story or in song, a lady so loving and so\r\nlight of heart, save Rosalind alone. Her face touches Frank's, as she\r\nsays goodbye for ever \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a moment never to be forgotten,\r\ninexpressibly bitter, yet mixed with a sensation of pleasure so deeply\r\nsoothing and affecting as at once to unlock all the floodgates of the\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rides into the night, her lover knows the _hysterica passio_ of poor\r\nLear, but \xe2\x80\x9cI had scarce given vent to my feelings in this paroxysm ere I\r\nwas ashamed of my weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were men and women who knew how to love, and how to live.\r\nAll men who read \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d are innocent rivals of Frank Osbaldistone.\r\nDi Vernon holds her place in our hearts with Rosalind, and these airy\r\naffections, like the actual emotions which they mimic, are not matters\r\nfor words. This lady, so gay, so brave, so witty and fearless, so tender\r\nand true, who \xe2\x80\x9cendured trials which might have dignified the history of a\r\nmartyr, . . . who spent the day in darkness and the night in vigil, and\r\nnever breathed a murmur of weakness or complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d is as immortal in\r\nmen's memories as the actual heroine of the White Rose, Flora Macdonald.\r\nHer place is with Helen and Antigone, with Rosalind and Imogen, the\r\ndeathless daughters of dreams. She brightens the world as she passes, and\r\nour own hearts tell us all the story when Osbaldistone says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nhow I lamented her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the central interest, which, for once, is the interest of love, \xe2\x80\x9cRob\r\nRoy\xe2\x80\x9d attains the nobility, the reserve, the grave dignity of the highest\r\nart. It is not easy to believe that Frank Osbaldistone is worthy of his\r\nlady; but here no man is a fair judge. In the four novels--\xe2\x80\x9cWaverley,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cGuy Mannering,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Antiquary,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d--which we have studied,\r\nthe hero has always been a young poet. Waverley versified; so did\r\nMannering; Lovel \xe2\x80\x9chad attempted a few lyrical pieces;\xe2\x80\x9d and, in\r\nOsbaldistone's rhymes, Scott parodied his own\r\n\r\n                           blast of that dread horn\r\n                       On Fontarabian echoes borne.\r\n\r\nAll the heroes, then, have been poets, and Osbaldistone's youth may have\r\nbeen suggested by Scott's memories of his own, and of the father who\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfeared that he would never be better than a gangrel scrapegut.\xe2\x80\x9d Like\r\nHenry Morton, in \xe2\x80\x9cOld Mortality,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank Osbaldistone is on the political\r\nside taken by Scott's judgment, not by his emotions. To make Di Vernon\r\nconvert him to Jacobitism would have been to repeat the story of\r\nWaverley. Still, he would have been more sympathetic if he had been\r\nconverted. He certainly does not lack spirit, as a sportsman, or \xe2\x80\x9con an\r\noccasion,\xe2\x80\x9d as Sir William Hope says in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Scots' Fencing Master,\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nhe encounters Rashleigh in the college gardens. Frank, in short, is all\r\nthat a hero should be, and is glorified by his affection.\r\n\r\nOf the other characters, perhaps Rob Roy is too sympathetically drawn.\r\nThe materials for a judgment are afforded by Scott's own admirable\r\nhistorical introduction. The Rob Roy who so calmly \xe2\x80\x9cplayed booty,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nkept a foot in either camp, certainly falls below the heroic. His\r\nlanguage has been criticised in late years, and it has been insisted that\r\nthe Highlanders never talked Lowland Scotch. But Scott has anticipated\r\nthese cavils in the eighteenth chapter of the second volume. Certainly no\r\nLowlander knew the Highlanders better than he did, and his ear for\r\ndialect was as keen as his musical ear was confessedly obtuse.\r\nScott had the best means of knowing whether Helen MacGregor would be\r\nlikely to soar into heroics as she is apt to do. In fact, here \xe2\x80\x9cwe may\r\ntrust the artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe novel is as rich as any in subordinate characters full of life and\r\nhumour. Morris is one of the few utter cowards in Scott. He has none of\r\nthe passionate impulses towards courage of the hapless hero in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fair\r\nMaid of Perth.\xe2\x80\x9d The various Osbaldistones are nicely discriminated by\r\nDiana Vernon, in one of those \xe2\x80\x9cBeatrix moods\xe2\x80\x9d which Scott did not always\r\nadmire, when they were displayed by \xe2\x80\x9cLady Anne\xe2\x80\x9d and other girls of flesh\r\nand blood. Rashleigh is of a nature unusual in Scott. He is, perhaps, Sir\r\nWalter's nearest approach, for malignant egotism, to an Iago. Of Bailie\r\nNicol Jarvie commendation were impertinent. All Scotland arose, called\r\nhim hers, laughed at and applauded her civic child. Concerning Andrew\r\nFairservice, the first edition tells us what the final edition leaves us\r\nto guess--that Tresham \xe2\x80\x9cmay recollect him as gardener at Osbaldistone\r\nHall.\xe2\x80\x9d Andrew was not a friend who could be shaken off. Diana may have\r\nruled the hall, but Andrew must have remained absolute in the gardens,\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x9csomething to maw that he would like to see mawn, or something to\r\nsaw that he would like to see sawn, or something to ripe that he would\r\nlike to see ripen, and sae he e'en daikered on wi' the family frae year's\r\nend to year's end,\xe2\x80\x9d and life's end. His master \xe2\x80\x9cneeded some carefu' body\r\nto look after him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnly Shakspeare and Scott could have given us medicines to make us like\r\nthis cowardly, conceited \xe2\x80\x9cjimp honest\xe2\x80\x9d fellow, Andrew Fairservice, who\r\njust escapes being a hypocrite by dint of some sincere old Covenanting\r\nleaven in his veins. We make bold to say that the creator of Parolles and\r\nLucie, and many another lax and lovable knave, would, had he been a Scot,\r\nhave drawn Andrew Fairservice thus, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe critics of the hour censured, as they were certain to censure, the\r\nconstruction, and especially the conclusion, of \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d No doubt the\r\ncritics were right. In both Scott and Shakspeare there is often seen a\r\nperfect disregard of the denouement. Any moderately intelligent person\r\ncan remark on the huddled-up ends and hasty marriages in many of\r\nShakspeare's comedies; Moliere has been charged with the same offence;\r\nand, if blame there be, Scott is almost always to blame. Thackeray is\r\nlittle better. There must be some reason that explains why men of genius\r\ngo wrong where every newspaper critic, every milliner's girl acquainted\r\nwith circulating libraries, can detect the offence.\r\n\r\nIn the closing remarks of \xe2\x80\x9cOld Mortality\xe2\x80\x9d Scott expresses himself\r\nhumorously on this matter of the denouement. His schoolmaster author\r\ntakes his proofsheets to Miss Martha Buskbody, who was the literary set\r\nin Gandercleugh, having read through the whole stock of three circulating\r\nlibraries. Miss Buskbody criticises the Dominic as Lady Louisa Stuart\r\nhabitually criticised Sir Walter. \xe2\x80\x9cYour plan of omitting a formal\r\nconclusion will never do!\xe2\x80\x9d The Dominie replies, \xe2\x80\x9cReally, madam, you must\r\nbe aware that every volume of a narrative turns less and less interesting\r\nas the author draws to a conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though\r\nexcellent hyson, is necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He compares the orthodox happy ending to \xe2\x80\x9cthe luscious lump of\r\nhalf-dissolved sugar\xe2\x80\x9d usually found at the bottom of the cup. This topic\r\nmight be discussed, and indeed has been discussed, endlessly. In our\r\nactual lives it is probable that most of us have found ourselves living\r\nfor a year, or a month, or a week, in a chapter or half a volume of a\r\nnovel, and these have been our least happy experiences. But we have also\r\nfound that the romance vanishes away like a ghost, dwindles out, closes\r\nwith ragged ends, has no denouement. Then the question presents itself,\r\nAs art is imitation, should not novels, as a rule, close thus? The\r\nexperiment has frequently been tried, especially by the modern geniuses\r\nwho do not conceal their belief that their art is altogether finer than\r\nScott's, or, perhaps, than Shakspeare's.\r\n\r\nIn his practice, and in his Dominie's critical remarks, Sir Walter\r\nappears inclined to agree with them. He was just as well aware as his\r\nreviewers, or as Lady Louisa Stuart, that the conclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chuddled up,\xe2\x80\x9d that the sudden demise of all the young Baldistones is a\r\nhigh-handed measure. He knew that, in real life, Frank and Di Vernon\r\nwould never have met again after that farewell on the moonlit road. But\r\nhe yielded to Miss Buskbody's demand for \xe2\x80\x9ca glimpse of sunshine in the\r\nlast chapter;\xe2\x80\x9d he understood the human liking for the final lump of\r\nsugar. After all, fiction is not, any more than any other art, a mere\r\nimitation of life: it is an arrangement, a selection. Scott was too kind,\r\ntoo humane, to disappoint us, the crowd of human beings who find much of\r\nour happiness in dreams. He could not keep up his own interest in his\r\ncharacters after he had developed them; he could take pleasure in giving\r\nthem life,--he had little pleasure in ushering them into an earthly\r\nparadise; so that part of his business he did carelessly, as his only\r\nrivals in literature have also done it.\r\n\r\nThe critics censured, not unjustly, the \xe2\x80\x9cmachinery\xe2\x80\x9d of the story,--these\r\nmysterious \xe2\x80\x9cassets\xe2\x80\x9d of Osbaldistone and Tresham, whose absence was to\r\nprecipitate the Rising of 1715. The \xe2\x80\x9cEdinburgh Review\xe2\x80\x9d lost its heart\r\n(Jeffrey's heart was always being lost) to Di Vernon. But it pronounces\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9ca king with legs of marble, or a youth with an ivory shoulder,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n heroes of the \xe2\x80\x9cArabian Nights\xe2\x80\x9d and of Pindar, was probable, compared with\r\nthe wit and accomplishments of Diana. This is hypercriticism. Diana's\r\neducation, under Rashleigh, had been elaborate; her acquaintance with\r\nShakspeare, her main strength, is unusual in women, but not beyond the\r\nlimits of belief. Here she is in agreeable contrast to Rose Bradwardine,\r\nwho had never heard of \xe2\x80\x9cRomeo and Juliet.\xe2\x80\x9d In any case, Diana compels\r\nbelief as well as wins affection, while we are fortunate enough to be in\r\nher delightful company.\r\n\r\nAs long as we believe in her, it is not of moment to consider whether her\r\ncharms are incompatible with probability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy\xe2\x80\x9d was finished in spite of \xe2\x80\x9ca very bad touch of the cramp for\r\nabout three weeks in November, which, with its natural attendants of\r\ndulness and, weakness, made me unable to get our matters forward till\r\nlast week,\xe2\x80\x9d says Scott to Constable. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d adds the unconquerable\r\nauthor, \xe2\x80\x9cI am resting myself here a few days before commencing my new\r\nlabours, which will be untrodden ground, and, I think, pretty likely to\r\nsucceed.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cnew labours\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of Mid-Lothian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nANDREW LANG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROB ROY\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIRST.\r\n\r\n                How have I sinn'd, that this affliction\r\n            Should light so heavy on me? I have no more sons,\r\n                And this no more mine own.--My grand curse\r\n            Hang o'er his head that thus transformed thee!--\r\n                Travel? I'll send my horse to travel next.\r\n                                               Monsieur Thomas.\r\n\r\nYou have requested me, my dear friend, to bestow some of that leisure,\r\nwith which Providence has blessed the decline of my life, in registering\r\nthe hazards and difficulties which attended its commencement. The\r\nrecollection of those adventures, as you are pleased to term them, has\r\nindeed left upon my mind a chequered and varied feeling of pleasure and\r\nof pain, mingled, I trust, with no slight gratitude and veneration to the\r\nDisposer of human events, who guided my early course through much risk\r\nand labour, that the ease with which he has blessed my prolonged life\r\nmight seem softer from remembrance and contrast. Neither is it possible\r\nfor me to doubt, what you have often affirmed, that the incidents which\r\nbefell me among a people singularly primitive in their government and\r\nmanners, have something interesting and attractive for those who love to\r\nhear an old man's stories of a past age.\r\n\r\nStill, however, you must remember, that the tale told by one friend, and\r\nlistened to by another, loses half its charms when committed to paper;\r\nand that the narratives to which you have attended with interest, as\r\nheard from the voice of him to whom they occurred, will appear less\r\ndeserving of attention when perused in the seclusion of your study. But\r\nyour greener age and robust constitution promise longer life than will,\r\nin all human probability, be the lot of your friend. Throw, then, these\r\nsheets into some secret drawer of your escritoire till we are separated\r\nfrom each other's society by an event which may happen at any moment, and\r\nwhich must happen within the course of a few--a very few years. When we\r\nare parted in this world, to meet, I hope, in a better, you will, I am\r\nwell aware, cherish more than it deserves the memory of your departed\r\nfriend, and will find in those details which I am now to commit to paper,\r\nmatter for melancholy, but not unpleasing reflection. Others bequeath to\r\nthe confidants of their bosom portraits of their external features--I put\r\ninto your hands a faithful transcript of my thoughts and feelings, of my\r\nvirtues and of my failings, with the assured hope, that the follies and\r\nheadstrong impetuosity of my youth will meet the same kind construction\r\nand forgiveness which have so often attended the faults of my matured\r\nage.\r\n\r\nOne advantage, among the many, of addressing my Memoirs (if I may give\r\nthese sheets a name so imposing) to a dear and intimate friend, is, that\r\nI may spare some of the details, in this case unnecessary, with which I\r\nmust needs have detained a stranger from what I have to say of greater\r\ninterest. Why should I bestow all my tediousness upon you, because I have\r\nyou in my power, and have ink, paper, and time before me? At the same\r\ntime, I dare not promise that I may not abuse the opportunity so\r\ntemptingly offered me, to treat of myself and my own concerns, even\r\nthough I speak of circumstances as well known to you as to myself. The\r\nseductive love of narrative, when we ourselves are the heroes of the\r\nevents which we tell, often disregards the attention due to the time and\r\npatience of the audience, and the best and wisest have yielded to its\r\nfascination. I need only remind you of the singular instance evinced by\r\nthe form of that rare and original edition of Sully's Memoirs, which you\r\n(with the fond vanity of a book-collector) insist upon preferring to that\r\nwhich is reduced to the useful and ordinary form of Memoirs, but which I\r\nthink curious, solely as illustrating how far so great a man as the\r\nauthor was accessible to the foible of self-importance. If I recollect\r\nrightly, that venerable peer and great statesman had appointed no fewer\r\nthan four gentlemen of his household to draw up the events of his life,\r\nunder the title of Memorials of the Sage and Royal Affairs of State,\r\nDomestic, Political, and Military, transacted by Henry IV., and so forth.\r\nThese grave recorders, having made their compilation, reduced the Memoirs\r\ncontaining all the remarkable events of their master's life into a\r\nnarrative, addressed to himself in _propria persona._ And thus, instead\r\nof telling his own story, in the third person, like Julius Caesar, or in\r\nthe first person, like most who, in the hall, or the study, undertake to\r\nbe the heroes of their own tale, Sully enjoyed the refined, though\r\nwhimsical pleasure, of having the events of his life told over to him by\r\nhis secretaries, being himself the auditor, as he was also the hero, and\r\nprobably the author, of the whole book. It must have been a great sight\r\nto have seen the ex-minister, as bolt upright as a starched ruff and\r\nlaced cassock could make him, seated in state beneath his canopy, and\r\nlistening to the recitation of his compilers, while, standing bare in his\r\npresence, they informed him gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cThus said the duke--so did the duke\r\ninfer--such were your grace's sentiments upon this important\r\npoint--such were your secret counsels to the king on that other\r\nemergency,\xe2\x80\x9d--circumstances, all of which must have been much better\r\nknown to their hearer than to themselves, and most of which could only\r\nbe derived from his own special communication.\r\n\r\nMy situation is not quite so ludicrous as that of the great Sully, and\r\nyet there would be something whimsical in Frank Osbaldistone giving Will\r\nTresham a formal account of his birth, education, and connections in the\r\nworld. I will, therefore, wrestle with the tempting spirit of P. P.,\r\nClerk of our Parish, as I best may, and endeavour to tell you nothing\r\nthat is familiar to you already. Some things, however, I must recall to\r\nyour memory, because, though formerly well known to you, they may have\r\nbeen forgotten through lapse of time, and they afford the ground-work of\r\nmy destiny.\r\n\r\nYou must remember my father well; for, as your own was a member of the\r\nmercantile house, you knew him from infancy. Yet you hardly saw him in\r\nhis best days, before age and infirmity had quenched his ardent spirit of\r\nenterprise and speculation. He would have been a poorer man, indeed, but\r\nperhaps as happy, had he devoted to the extension of science those active\r\nenergies, and acute powers of observation, for which commercial pursuits\r\nfound occupation. Yet, in the fluctuations of mercantile speculation,\r\nthere is something captivating to the adventurer, even independent of the\r\nhope of gain. He who embarks on that fickle sea, requires to possess the\r\nskill of the pilot and the fortitude of the navigator, and after all may\r\nbe wrecked and lost, unless the gales of fortune breathe in his favour.\r\nThis mixture of necessary attention and inevitable hazard,--the frequent\r\nand awful uncertainty whether prudence shall overcome fortune, or fortune\r\nbaffle the schemes of prudence, affords full occupation for the powers,\r\nas well as for the feelings of the mind, and trade has all the\r\nfascination of gambling without its moral guilt.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 18th century, when I (Heaven help me) was a youth of some\r\ntwenty years old, I was summoned suddenly from Bourdeaux to attend my\r\nfather on business of importance. I shall never forget our first\r\ninterview. You recollect the brief, abrupt, and somewhat stern mode in\r\nwhich he was wont to communicate his pleasure to those around him.\r\nMethinks I see him even now in my mind's eye;--the firm and upright\r\nfigure,--the step, quick and determined,--the eye, which shot so keen and\r\nso penetrating a glance,--the features, on which care had already planted\r\nwrinkles,--and hear his language, in which he never wasted word in vain,\r\nexpressed in a voice which had sometimes an occasional harshness, far\r\nfrom the intention of the speaker.\r\n\r\nWhen I dismounted from my post-horse, I hastened to my father's\r\napartment. He was traversing it with an air of composed and steady\r\ndeliberation, which even my arrival, although an only son unseen for four\r\nyears, was unable to discompose. I threw myself into his arms. He was a\r\nkind, though not a fond father, and the tear twinkled in his dark eye,\r\nbut it was only for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDubourg writes to me that he is satisfied with you, Frank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy, sir\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have less reason to be so\xe2\x80\x9d he added, sitting down at his bureau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, sir\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry and happy, Frank, are words that, on most occasions, signify\r\nlittle or nothing--Here is your last letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it out from a number of others tied up in a parcel of red tape,\r\nand curiously labelled and filed. There lay my poor epistle, written on\r\nthe subject the nearest to my heart at the time, and couched in words\r\nwhich I had thought would work compassion if not conviction,--there, I\r\nsay, it lay, squeezed up among the letters on miscellaneous business in\r\nwhich my father's daily affairs had engaged him. I cannot help smiling\r\ninternally when I recollect the mixture of hurt vanity, and wounded\r\nfeeling, with which I regarded my remonstrance, to the penning of which\r\nthere had gone, I promise you, some trouble, as I beheld it extracted\r\nfrom amongst letters of advice, of credit, and all the commonplace\r\nlumber, as I then thought them, of a merchant's correspondence. Surely,\r\nthought I, a letter of such importance (I dared not say, even to myself,\r\nso well written) deserved a separate place, as well as more anxious\r\nconsideration, than those on the ordinary business of the counting-house.\r\n\r\nBut my father did not observe my dissatisfaction, and would not have\r\nminded it if he had. He proceeded, with the letter in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\r\nFrank, is yours of the 21st ultimo, in which you advise me (reading from\r\nmy letter), that in the most important business of forming a plan, and\r\nadopting a profession for life, you trust my paternal goodness will hold\r\nyou entitled to at least a negative voice; that you have insuperable--ay,\r\ninsuperable is the word--I wish, by the way, you would write a more\r\ndistinct current hand--draw a score through the tops of your t's, and\r\nopen the loops of your l's--insuperable objections to the arrangements\r\nwhich I have proposed to you. There is much more to the same effect,\r\noccupying four good pages of paper, which a little attention to\r\nperspicuity and distinctness of expression might have comprised within as\r\nmany lines. For, after all, Frank, it amounts but to this, that you will\r\nnot do as I would have you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot, sir, in the present instance, not that I will not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWords avail very little with me, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father, whose\r\ninflexibility always possessed the air of the most perfect calmness of\r\nself-possession. \xe2\x80\x9c_Can not_ may be a more civil phrase than _will not,_\r\nbut the expressions are synonymous where there is no moral impossibility.\r\nBut I am not a friend to doing business hastily; we will talk this matter\r\nover after dinner.--Owen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOwen appeared, not with the silver locks which you were used to venerate,\r\nfor he was then little more than fifty; but he had the same, or an\r\nexactly similar uniform suit of light-brown clothes,--the same pearl-grey\r\nsilk stockings,--the same stock, with its silver buckle,--the same\r\nplaited cambric ruffles, drawn down over his knuckles in the parlour, but\r\nin the counting-house carefully folded back under the sleeves, that they\r\nmight remain unstained by the ink which he daily consumed;--in a word,\r\nthe same grave, formal, yet benevolent cast of features, which continued\r\nto his death to distinguish the head clerk of the great house of\r\nOsbaldistone and Tresham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwen,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father, as the kind old man shook me affectionately by\r\nthe hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must dine with us to-day, and hear the news Frank has\r\nbrought us from our friends in Bourdeaux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOwen made one of his stiff bows of respectful gratitude; for, in those\r\ndays, when the distance between superiors and inferiors was enforced in a\r\nmanner to which the present times are strangers, such an invitation was a\r\nfavour of some little consequence.\r\n\r\nI shall long remember that dinner-party. Deeply affected by feelings of\r\nanxiety, not unmingled with displeasure, I was unable to take that active\r\nshare in the conversation which my father seemed to expect from me; and I\r\ntoo frequently gave unsatisfactory answers to the questions with which he\r\nassailed me. Owen, hovering betwixt his respect for his patron, and his\r\nlove for the youth he had dandled on his knee in childhood, like the\r\ntimorous, yet anxious ally of an invaded nation, endeavoured at every\r\nblunder I made to explain my no-meaning, and to cover my retreat;\r\nmanoeuvres which added to my father's pettish displeasure, and brought a\r\nshare of it upon my kind advocate, instead of protecting me. I had not,\r\nwhile residing in the house of Dubourg, absolutely conducted myself like\r\n\r\n             A clerk condemn'd his father's soul to cross,\r\n             Who penn'd a stanza when he should engross;--\r\n\r\nbut, to say truth, I had frequented the counting-house no more than I had\r\nthought absolutely necessary to secure the good report of the Frenchman,\r\nlong a correspondent of our firm, to whom my father had trusted for\r\ninitiating me into the mysteries of commerce. In fact, my principal\r\nattention had been dedicated to literature and manly exercises. My father\r\ndid not altogether discourage such acquirements, whether mental or\r\npersonal. He had too much good sense not to perceive, that they sate\r\ngracefully upon every man, and he was sensible that they relieved and\r\ndignified the character to which he wished me to aspire. But his chief\r\nambition was, that I should succeed not merely to his fortune, but to the\r\nviews and plans by which he imagined he could extend and perpetuate the\r\nwealthy inheritance which he designed for me.\r\n\r\nLove of his profession was the motive which he chose should be most\r\nostensible, when he urged me to tread the same path; but he had others\r\nwith which I only became acquainted at a later period. Impetuous in his\r\nschemes, as well as skilful and daring, each new adventure, when\r\nsuccessful, became at once the incentive, and furnished the means, for\r\nfarther speculation. It seemed to be necessary to him, as to an ambitious\r\nconqueror, to push on from achievement to achievement, without stopping\r\nto secure, far less to enjoy, the acquisitions which he made. Accustomed\r\nto see his whole fortune trembling in the scales of chance, and dexterous\r\nat adopting expedients for casting the balance in his favour, his health\r\nand spirits and activity seemed ever to increase with the animating\r\nhazards on which he staked his wealth; and he resembled a sailor,\r\naccustomed to brave the billows and the foe, whose confidence rises on\r\nthe eve of tempest or of battle. He was not, however, insensible to the\r\nchanges which increasing age or supervening malady might make in his own\r\nconstitution; and was anxious in good time to secure in me an assistant,\r\nwho might take the helm when his hand grew weary, and keep the vessel's\r\nway according to his counsel and instruction. Paternal affection, as well\r\nas the furtherance of his own plans, determined him to the same\r\nconclusion. Your father, though his fortune was vested in the house, was\r\nonly a sleeping partner, as the commercial phrase goes; and Owen, whose\r\nprobity and skill in the details of arithmetic rendered his services\r\ninvaluable as a head clerk, was not possessed either of information or\r\ntalents sufficient to conduct the mysteries of the principal management.\r\nIf my father were suddenly summoned from life, what would become of the\r\nworld of schemes which he had formed, unless his son were moulded into a\r\ncommercial Hercules, fit to sustain the weight when relinquished by the\r\nfalling Atlas? and what would become of that son himself, if, a stranger\r\nto business of this description, he found himself at once involved in the\r\nlabyrinth of mercantile concerns, without the clew of knowledge necessary\r\nfor his extraction? For all these reasons, avowed and secret, my father\r\nwas determined I should embrace his profession; and when he was\r\ndetermined, the resolution of no man was more immovable. I, however, was\r\nalso a party to be consulted, and, with something of his own pertinacity,\r\nI had formed a determination precisely contrary. It may, I hope, be some\r\npalliative for the resistance which, on this occasion, I offered to my\r\nfather's wishes, that I did not fully understand upon what they were\r\nfounded, or how deeply his happiness was involved in them. Imagining\r\nmyself certain of a large succession in future, and ample maintenance in\r\nthe meanwhile, it never occurred to me that it might be necessary, in\r\norder to secure these blessings, to submit to labour and limitations\r\nunpleasant to my taste and temper. I only saw in my father's proposal for\r\nmy engaging in business, a desire that I should add to those heaps of\r\nwealth which he had himself acquired; and imagining myself the best judge\r\nof the path to my own happiness, I did not conceive that I should\r\nincrease that happiness by augmenting a fortune which I believed was\r\nalready sufficient, and more than sufficient, for every use, comfort, and\r\nelegant enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I am compelled to repeat, that my time at Bourdeaux had not\r\nbeen spent as my father had proposed to himself. What he considered as\r\nthe chief end of my residence in that city, I had postponed for every\r\nother, and would (had I dared) have neglected altogether. Dubourg, a\r\nfavoured and benefited correspondent of our mercantile house, was too\r\nmuch of a shrewd politician to make such reports to the head of the firm\r\nconcerning his only child, as would excite the displeasure of both; and\r\nhe might also, as you will presently hear, have views of selfish\r\nadvantage in suffering me to neglect the purposes for which I was placed\r\nunder his charge. My conduct was regulated by the bounds of decency and\r\ngood order, and thus far he had no evil report to make, supposing him so\r\ndisposed; but, perhaps, the crafty Frenchman would have been equally\r\ncomplaisant, had I been in the habit of indulging worse feelings than\r\nthose of indolence and aversion to mercantile business. As it was, while\r\nI gave a decent portion of my time to the commercial studies he\r\nrecommended, he was by no means envious of the hours which I dedicated to\r\nother and more classical attainments, nor did he ever find fault with me\r\nfor dwelling upon Corneille and Boileau, in preference to Postlethwayte\r\n(supposing his folio to have then existed, and Monsieur Dubourg able to\r\nhave pronounced his name), or Savary, or any other writer on commercial\r\neconomy. He had picked up somewhere a convenient expression, with which\r\nhe rounded off every letter to his correspondent,--\xe2\x80\x9cI was all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat a father could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father never quarrelled with a phrase, however frequently repeated,\r\nprovided it seemed to him distinct and expressive; and Addison himself\r\ncould not have found expressions so satisfactory to him as, \xe2\x80\x9cYours\r\nreceived, and duly honoured the bills enclosed, as per margin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKnowing, therefore, very well what he desired me to, be, Mr. Osbaldistone\r\nmade no doubt, from the frequent repetition of Dubourg's favourite\r\nphrase, that I was the very thing he wished to see me; when, in an evil\r\nhour, he received my letter, containing my eloquent and detailed apology\r\nfor declining a place in the firm, and a desk and stool in the corner of\r\nthe dark counting-house in Crane Alley, surmounting in height those of\r\nOwen, and the other clerks, and only inferior to the tripod of my father\r\nhimself. All was wrong from that moment. Dubourg's reports became as\r\nsuspicious as if his bills had been noted for dishonour. I was summoned\r\nhome in all haste, and received in the manner I have already communicated\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SECOND.\r\n\r\n     I begin shrewdly to suspect the young man of a terrible\r\n     taint--Poetry; with which idle disease if he be infected,\r\n     there's no hope of him in astate course. _Actum est_ of him\r\n     for a commonwealth's man, if he goto't in rhyme once.\r\n                                        Ben Jonson's _Bartholomew Fair._\r\n\r\nMy father had, generally speaking, his temper under complete\r\nself-command, and his anger rarely indicated itself by words, except in\r\na sort of dry testy manner, to those who had displeased him. He never\r\nused threats, or expressions of loud resentment. All was arranged with\r\nhim on system, and it was his practice to do \xe2\x80\x9cthe needful\xe2\x80\x9d on every\r\noccasion, without wasting words about it. It was, therefore, with a\r\nbitter smile that he listened to my imperfect answers concerning the\r\nstate of commerce in France, and unmercifully permitted me to involve\r\nmyself deeper and deeper in the mysteries of agio, tariffs, tare and\r\ntret; nor can I charge my memory with his having looked positively\r\nangry, until he found me unable to explain the exact effect which the\r\ndepreciation of the louis d'or had produced on the negotiation of bills\r\nof exchange. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most remarkable national occurrence in my time,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nmy father (who nevertheless had seen the Revolution)--\xe2\x80\x9cand he knows no\r\nmore of it than a post on the quay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Owen, in his timid and conciliatory manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccannot have forgotten, that by an _arret_ of the King of France, dated\r\n1st May 1700, it was provided that the _porteur,_ within ten days after\r\ndue, must make demand\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father, interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x9cwill, I dare say,\r\nrecollect for the moment anything you are so kind as hint to him. But,\r\nbody o' me! how Dubourg could permit him! Hark ye, Owen, what sort of a\r\nyouth is Clement Dubourg, his nephew there, in the office, the\r\nblack-haired lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the cleverest clerks, sir, in the house; a prodigious young man\r\nfor his time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Owen; for the gaiety and civility of the young\r\nFrenchman had won his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, I suppose _he_ knows something of the nature of exchange.\r\nDubourg was determined I should have one youngster at least about my hand\r\nwho understood business. But I see his drift, and he shall find that I do\r\nso when he looks at the balance-sheet. Owen, let Clement's salary be paid\r\nup to next quarter-day, and let him ship himself back to Bourdeaux in his\r\nfather's ship, which is clearing out yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDismiss Clement Dubourg, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Owen, with a faltering voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, dismiss him instantly; it is enough to have a stupid\r\nEnglishman in the counting-house to make blunders, without keeping a\r\nsharp Frenchman there to profit by them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had lived long enough in the territories of the _Grand Monarque_ to\r\ncontract a hearty aversion to arbitrary exertion of authority, even if it\r\nhad not been instilled into me with my earliest breeding; and I could not\r\nrefrain from interposing, to prevent an innocent and meritorious young\r\nman from paying the penalty of having acquired that proficiency which my\r\nfather had desired for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d when Mr. Osbaldistone had done speaking; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nthink it but just, that if I have been negligent of my studies, I should\r\npay the forfeit myself. I have no reason to charge Monsieur Dubourg with\r\nhaving neglected to give me opportunities of improvement, however little\r\nI may have profited by them; and with respect to Monsieur Clement\r\nDubourg\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith respect to him, and to you, I shall take the measures which I see\r\nneedful,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my father; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is fair in you, Frank, to take your\r\nown blame on your own shoulders--very fair, that cannot be denied.--I\r\ncannot acquit old Dubourg,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking to Owen, \xe2\x80\x9cfor having merely\r\nafforded Frank the means of useful knowledge, without either seeing that\r\nhe took advantage of them or reporting to me if he did not. You see,\r\nOwen, he has natural notions of equity becoming a British merchant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the head-clerk, with his usual formal inclination of\r\nthe head, and a slight elevation of his right hand, which he had acquired\r\nby a habit of sticking his pen behind his ear before he spoke--\xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nFrancis seems to understand the fundamental principle of all moral\r\naccounting, the great ethic rule of three. Let A do to B, as he would\r\nhave B do to him; the product will give the rule of conduct required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father smiled at this reduction of the golden rule to arithmetical\r\nform, but instantly proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this signifies nothing, Frank; you have been throwing away your time\r\nlike a boy, and in future you must learn to live like a man. I shall put\r\nyou under Owen's care for a few months, to recover the lost ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to reply, but Owen looked at me with such a supplicatory and\r\nwarning gesture, that I was involuntarily silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued my father, \xe2\x80\x9cresume the subject of mine of the\r\n1st ultimo, to which you sent me an answer which was unadvised and\r\nunsatisfactory. So now, fill your glass, and push the bottle to Owen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWant of courage--of audacity if you will--was never my failing. I\r\nanswered firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI was sorry that my letter was unsatisfactory,\r\nunadvised it was not; for I had given the proposal his goodness had made\r\nme, my instant and anxious attention, and it was with no small pain that\r\nI found myself obliged to decline it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father bent his keen eye for a moment on me, and instantly withdrew\r\nit. As he made no answer, I thought myself obliged to proceed, though\r\nwith some hesitation, and he only interrupted me by monosyllables.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis impossible, sir, for me to have higher respect for any character than\r\nI have for the commercial, even were it not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt connects nation with nation, relieves the wants, and contributes to\r\nthe wealth of all; and is to the general commonwealth of the civilised\r\nworld what the daily intercourse of ordinary life is to private society,\r\nor rather, what air and food are to our bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, sir, I find myself compelled to persist in declining to adopt a\r\ncharacter which I am so ill qualified to support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take care that you acquire the qualifications necessary. You are\r\nno longer the guest and pupil of Dubourg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear sir, it is no defect of teaching which I plead, but my own\r\ninability to profit by instruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense.--Have you kept your journal in the terms I desired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe pleased to bring it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe volume thus required was a sort of commonplace book, kept by my\r\nfather's recommendation, in which I had been directed to enter notes of\r\nthe miscellaneous information which I had acquired in the course of my\r\nstudies. Foreseeing that he would demand inspection of this record, I had\r\nbeen attentive to transcribe such particulars of information as he would\r\nmost likely be pleased with, but too often the pen had discharged the\r\ntask without much correspondence with the head. And it had also happened,\r\nthat, the book being the receptacle nearest to my hand, I had\r\noccasionally jotted down memoranda which had little regard to traffic. I\r\nnow put it into my father's hand, devoutly hoping he might light on\r\nnothing that would increase his displeasure against me. Owen's face,\r\nwhich had looked something blank when the question was put, cleared up at\r\nmy ready answer, and wore a smile of hope, when I brought from my\r\napartment, and placed before my father, a commercial-looking volume,\r\nrather broader than it was long, having brazen clasps and a binding of\r\nrough calf. This looked business-like, and was encouraging to my\r\nbenevolent well-wisher. But he actually smiled with pleasure as he heard\r\nmy father run over some part of the contents, muttering his critical\r\nremarks as he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_--Brandies--Barils and barricants, also tonneaux.--At Nantz 29--Velles\r\nto the barique at Cognac and Rochelle 27--At Bourdeaux 32_--Very right,\r\nFrank--_Duties on tonnage and custom-house, see Saxby's Tables_--That's\r\nnot well; you should have transcribed the passage; it fixes the thing in\r\nthe memory--_Reports outward and inward--Corn debentures--Over-sea\r\nCockets--Linens--Isingham--Gentish--Stock-fish--Titling--Cropling--\r\nLub-fish._ You should have noted that they are all, nevertheless to be\r\nentered as titlings.--How many inches long is a titling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOwen, seeing me at fault, hazarded a whisper, of which I fortunately\r\ncaught the import.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighteen inches, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a lub-fish is twenty-four--very right. It is important to remember\r\nthis, on account of the Portuguese trade--But what have we here?--\r\n_Bourdeaux founded in the year--Castle of the Trompette--Palace of\r\nGallienus_--Well, well, that's very right too.--This is a kind of\r\nwaste-book, Owen, in which all the transactions of the day,--emptions,\r\norders, payments, receipts, acceptances, draughts, commissions, and\r\nadvices,--are entered miscellaneously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat they may be regularly transferred to the day-book and ledger,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Owen: \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad Mr. Francis is so methodical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI perceived myself getting so fast into favour, that I began to fear the\r\nconsequence would be my father's more obstinate perseverance in his\r\nresolution that I must become a merchant; and as I was determined on the\r\ncontrary, I began to wish I had not, to use my friend Mr. Owen's phrase,\r\nbeen so methodical. But I had no reason for apprehension on that score;\r\nfor a blotted piece of paper dropped out of the book, and, being taken up\r\nby my father, he interrupted a hint from Owen, on the propriety of\r\nsecuring loose memoranda with a little paste, by exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the\r\nmemory of Edward the Black Prince--What's all this?--verses!--By Heaven,\r\nFrank, you are a greater blockhead than I supposed you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father, you must recollect, as a man of business, looked upon the\r\nlabour of poets with contempt; and as a religious man, and of the\r\ndissenting persuasion, he considered all such pursuits as equally trivial\r\nand profane. Before you condemn him, you must recall to remembrance how\r\ntoo many of the poets in the end of the seventeenth century had led their\r\nlives and employed their talents. The sect also to which my father\r\nbelonged, felt, or perhaps affected, a puritanical aversion to the\r\nlighter exertions of literature. So that many causes contributed to\r\naugment the unpleasant surprise occasioned by the ill-timed discovery of\r\nthis unfortunate copy of verses. As for poor Owen, could the bob-wig\r\nwhich he then wore have uncurled itself, and stood on end with horror, I\r\nam convinced the morning's labour of the friseur would have been undone,\r\nmerely by the excess of his astonishment at this enormity. An inroad on\r\nthe strong-box, or an erasure in the ledger, or a mis-summation in a\r\nfitted account, could hardly have surprised him more disagreeably. My\r\nfather read the lines sometimes with an affectation of not being able to\r\nunderstand the sense--sometimes in a mouthing tone of mock heroic--always\r\nwith an emphasis of the most bitter irony, most irritating to the nerves\r\nof an author.\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cO for the voice of that wild horn,\r\n                     On Fontarabian echoes borne,\r\n                           The dying hero's call,\r\n                     That told imperial Charlemagne,\r\n                     How Paynim sons of swarthy Spain\r\n                     Had wrought his champion's fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Fontarabian echoes!_\xe2\x80\x9d continued my father, interrupting himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nFontarabian Fair would have been more to the purpose--_Paynim!_--What's\r\nPaynim?--Could you not say Pagan as well, and write English at least, if\r\nyou must needs write nonsense?--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cSad over earth and ocean sounding.\r\n                And England's distant cliffs astounding.\r\n                     Such are the notes should say\r\n                How Britain's hope, and France's fear,\r\n                     Victor of Cressy and Poitier,\r\n                          In Bordeaux dying lay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoitiers, by the way, is always spelt with an _s,_ and I know no reason\r\nwhy orthography should give place to rhyme.--\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9c'Raise my faint head, my squires,' he said,\r\n                  'And let the casement be display'd,\r\n                       That I may see once more\r\n                   The splendour of the setting sun\r\n                   Gleam on thy mirrored wave, Garonne,\r\n                       And Blaye's empurpled shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Garonne_ and _sun_ is a bad rhyme. Why, Frank, you do not even\r\nunderstand the beggarly trade you have chosen.\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9c'Like me, he sinks to Glory's sleep,\r\n                  His fall the dews of evening steep,\r\n                         As if in sorrow shed,\r\n                  So soft shall fall the trickling tear,\r\n                  When England's maids and matrons hear\r\n                        Of their Black Edward dead.\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9c'And though my sun of glory set,\r\n                 Nor France, nor England, shall forget\r\n                        The terror of my name;\r\n                 And oft shall Britain's heroes rise,\r\n                 New planets in these southern skies,\r\n                       Through clouds of blood and flame.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cloud of flame is something new--Good-morrow, my masters all, and a\r\nmerry Christmas to you!--Why, the bellman writes better lines.\xe2\x80\x9d He then\r\ntossed the paper from him with an air of superlative contempt, and\r\nconcluded--\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my credit, Frank, you are a greater blockhead than I\r\ntook you for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat could I say, my dear Tresham? There I stood, swelling with indignant\r\nmortification, while my father regarded me with a calm but stern look of\r\nscorn and pity; and poor Owen, with uplifted hands and eyes, looked as\r\nstriking a picture of horror as if he had just read his patron's name in\r\nthe Gazette. At length I took courage to speak, endeavouring that my tone\r\nof voice should betray my feelings as little as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite aware, sir, how ill qualified I am to play the conspicuous\r\npart in society you have destined for me; and, luckily, I am not\r\nambitious of the wealth I might acquire. Mr. Owen would be a much more\r\neffective assistant.\xe2\x80\x9d I said this in some malice, for I considered Owen\r\nas having deserted my cause a little too soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwen!\xe2\x80\x9d said my father--\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy is mad--actually insane. And, pray, sir,\r\nif I may presume to inquire, having coolly turned me over to Mr. Owen\r\n(although I may expect more attention from any one than from my son),\r\nwhat may your own sage projects be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should wish, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, summoning up my courage, \xe2\x80\x9cto travel for\r\ntwo or three years, should that consist with your pleasure; otherwise,\r\nalthough late, I would willingly spend the same time at Oxford or\r\nCambridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of common sense! was the like ever heard?--to put yourself\r\nto school among pedants and Jacobites, when you might be pushing your\r\nfortune in the world! Why not go to Westminster or Eton at once, man, and\r\ntake to Lilly's Grammar and Accidence, and to the birch, too, if you like\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sir, if you think my plan of improvement too late, I would\r\nwillingly return to the Continent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have already spent too much time there to little purpose, Mr.\r\nFrancis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I would choose the army, sir, in preference to any other active\r\nline of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoose the d--l!\xe2\x80\x9d answered my father, hastily, and then checking\r\nhimself--\xe2\x80\x9cI profess you make me as great a fool as you are yourself. Is\r\nhe not enough to drive one mad, Owen?\xe2\x80\x9d--Poor Owen shook his head, and\r\nlooked down. \xe2\x80\x9cHark ye, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d continued my father, \xe2\x80\x9cI will cut all this\r\nmatter very short. I was at your age when my father turned me out of\r\ndoors, and settled my legal inheritance on my younger brother. I left\r\nOsbaldistone Hall on the back of a broken-down hunter, with ten guineas\r\nin my purse. I have never crossed the threshold again, and I never will.\r\nI know not, and I care not, if my fox-hunting brother is alive, or has\r\nbroken his neck; but he has children, Frank, and one of them shall be my\r\nson if you cross me farther in this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do your pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered--rather, I fear, with more sullen\r\nindifference than respect, \xe2\x80\x9cwith what is your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Frank, what I have _is_ my own, if labour in getting, and care in\r\naugmenting, can make a right of property; and no drone shall feed on my\r\nhoneycomb. Think on it well: what I have said is not without reflection,\r\nand what I resolve upon I will execute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonoured sir!--dear sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Owen, tears rushing into his eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are not wont to be in such a hurry in transacting business of\r\nimportance. Let Mr. Francis run up the balance before you shut the\r\naccount; he loves you, I am sure; and when he puts down his filial\r\nobedience to the _per contra,_ I am sure his objections will disappear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I will ask him twice,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cto be my\r\nfriend, my assistant, and my confidant?--to be a partner of my cares and\r\nof my fortune?--Owen, I thought you had known me better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me as if he meant to add something more, but turned\r\ninstantly away, and left the room abruptly. I was, I own, affected by\r\nthis view of the case, which had not occurred to me; and my father would\r\nprobably have had little reason to complain of me, had he commenced the\r\ndiscussion with this argument.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. I had much of his own obduracy of resolution, and\r\nHeaven had decreed that my sin should be my punishment, though not to the\r\nextent which my transgression merited. Owen, when we were left alone,\r\ncontinued to look at me with eyes which tears from time to time\r\nmoistened, as if to discover, before attempting the task of intercessor,\r\nupon what point my obstinacy was most assailable. At length he began,\r\nwith broken and disconcerted accents,--\xe2\x80\x9cO L--d, Mr. Francis!--Good\r\nHeavens, sir!--My stars, Mr. Osbaldistone!--that I should ever have seen\r\nthis day--and you so young a gentleman, sir!--For the love of Heaven!\r\nlook at both sides of the account--think what you are going to lose--a\r\nnoble fortune, sir--one of the finest houses in the City, even under the\r\nold firm of Tresham and Trent, and now Osbaldistone and Tresham--You\r\nmight roll in gold, Mr. Francis--And, my dear young Mr. Frank, if there\r\nwas any particular thing in the business of the house which you disliked,\r\nI would\xe2\x80\x9d (sinking his voice to a whisper) \xe2\x80\x9cput it in order for you\r\ntermly, or weekly, or daily, if you will--Do, my dear Mr. Francis, think\r\nof the honour due to your father, that your days may be long in the\r\nland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you, Mr. Owen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I--\xe2\x80\x9cvery much obliged indeed;\r\nbut my father is best judge how to bestow his money. He talks of one of\r\nmy cousins: let him dispose of his wealth as he pleases--I will never\r\nsell my liberty for gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold, sir?--I wish you saw the balance-sheet of profits at last term--It\r\nwas in five figures--five figures to each partner's sum total, Mr.\r\nFrank--And all this is to go to a Papist, and a north-country booby, and\r\na disaffected person besides--It will break my heart, Mr. Francis, that\r\nhave been toiling more like a dog than a man, and all for love of\r\nthe firm. Think how it will sound, Osbaldistone, Tresham, and\r\nOsbaldistone--or perhaps, who knows\xe2\x80\x9d (again lowering his voice),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOsbaldistone, Osbaldistone, and Tresham, for our Mr. Osbaldistone can\r\nbuy them all out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Owen, my cousin's name being also Osbaldistone, the name of the\r\ncompany will sound every bit as well in your ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO fie upon you, Mr. Francis, when you know how well I love you--Your\r\ncousin, indeed!--a Papist, no doubt, like his father, and a disaffected\r\nperson to the Protestant succession--that's another item, doubtless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many very good men Catholics, Mr. Owen,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined I.\r\n\r\nAs Owen was about to answer with unusual animation, my father re-entered\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cOwen, and I was wrong; we will take more time\r\nto think over this matter.--Young man, you will prepare to give me an\r\nanswer on this important subject this day month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed in silence, sufficiently glad of a reprieve, and trusting it\r\nmight indicate some relaxation in my father's determination.\r\n\r\nThe time of probation passed slowly, unmarked by any accident whatever. I\r\nwent and came, and disposed of my time as I pleased, without question or\r\ncriticism on the part of my father. Indeed, I rarely saw him, save at\r\nmeal-times, when he studiously avoided a discussion which you may well\r\nsuppose I was in no hurry to press onward. Our conversation was of the\r\nnews of the day, or on such general topics as strangers discourse upon to\r\neach other; nor could any one have guessed, from its tenor, that there\r\nremained undecided betwixt us a dispute of such importance. It haunted\r\nme, however, more than once, like the nightmare. Was it possible he would\r\nkeep his word, and disinherit his only son in favour of a nephew whose\r\nvery existence he was not perhaps quite certain of? My grandfather's\r\nconduct, in similar circumstances, boded me no good, had I considered the\r\nmatter rightly. But I had formed an erroneous idea of my father's\r\ncharacter, from the importance which I recollected I maintained with him\r\nand his whole family before I went to France. I was not aware that there\r\nare men who indulge their children at an early age, because to do so\r\ninterests and amuses them, and who can yet be sufficiently severe when\r\nthe same children cross their expectations at a more advanced period. On\r\nthe contrary, I persuaded myself, that all I had to apprehend was some\r\ntemporary alienation of affection--perhaps a rustication of a few weeks,\r\nwhich I thought would rather please me than otherwise, since it would\r\ngive me an opportunity of setting about my unfinished version of Orlando\r\nFurioso, a poem which I longed to render into English verse. I suffered\r\nthis belief to get such absolute possession of my mind, that I had\r\nresumed my blotted papers, and was busy in meditation on the\r\noft-recurring rhymes of the Spenserian stanza, when I heard a low and\r\ncautious tap at the door of my apartment. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and Mr. Owen\r\nentered. So regular were the motions and habits of this worthy man, that\r\nin all probability this was the first time he had ever been in the second\r\nstory of his patron's house, however conversant with the first; and I am\r\nstill at a loss to know in what manner he discovered my apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, interrupting my expression of surprise and\r\npleasure at seeing, him, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know if I am doing well in what I am\r\nabout to say--it is not right to speak of what passes in the\r\ncompting-house out of doors--one should not tell, as they say, to the\r\npost in the warehouse, how many lines there are in the ledger. But young\r\nTwineall has been absent from the house for a fortnight and more, until\r\ntwo days since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, Mr. Francis;--your father gave him a private commission; and I am\r\nsure he did not go down to Falmouth about the pilchard affair; and the\r\nExeter business with Blackwell and Company has been settled; and the\r\nmining people in Cornwall, Trevanion and Treguilliam, have paid all they\r\nare likely to pay; and any other matter of business must have been put\r\nthrough my books:--in short, it's my faithful belief that Twineall has\r\nbeen down in the north.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d so said I, somewhat startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has spoken about nothing, sir, since he returned, but his new boots,\r\nand his Ripon spurs, and a cockfight at York--it's as true as the\r\nmultiplication-table. Do, Heaven bless you, my dear child, make up your\r\nmind to please your father, and to be a man and a merchant at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt at that instant a strong inclination to submit, and to make Owen\r\nhappy by requesting him to tell my father that I resigned myself to his\r\ndisposal. But pride--pride, the source of so much that is good and so\r\nmuch that is evil in our course of life, prevented me. My acquiescence\r\nstuck in my throat; and while I was coughing to get it up, my father's\r\nvoice summoned Owen. He hastily left the room, and the opportunity was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nMy father was methodical in everything. At the very same time of the day,\r\nin the same apartment, and with the same tone and manner which he had\r\nemployed an exact month before, he recapitulated the proposal he had made\r\nfor taking me into partnership, and assigning me a department in the\r\ncounting-house, and requested to have my final decision. I thought at the\r\ntime there was something unkind in this; and I still think that my\r\nfather's conduct was injudicious. A more conciliatory treatment would, in\r\nall probability, have gained his purpose. As it was, I stood fast, and,\r\nas respectfully as I could, declined the proposal he made to me.\r\nPerhaps--for who can judge of their own heart?--I felt it unmanly to\r\nyield on the first summons, and expected farther solicitation, as at\r\nleast a pretext for changing my mind. If so, I was disappointed; for my\r\nfather turned coolly to Owen, and only said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see it is as I told\r\nyou.--Well, Frank\xe2\x80\x9d (addressing me), \xe2\x80\x9cyou are nearly of age, and as well\r\nqualified to judge of what will constitute your own happiness as you\r\never are like to be; therefore, I say no more. But as I am not bound to\r\ngive in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to\r\nmine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my\r\nassistance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, not a little abashed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat being bred to no profession, and\r\nhaving no funds of my own, it was obviously impossible for me to subsist\r\nwithout some allowance from my father; that my wishes were very moderate;\r\nand that I hoped my aversion for the profession to which he had designed\r\nme, would not occasion his altogether withdrawing his paternal support\r\nand protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, you wish to lean on my arm, and yet to walk your own\r\nway? That can hardly be, Frank;--however, I suppose you mean to obey my\r\ndirections, so far as they do not cross your own humour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to speak--\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing\r\nthis to be the case, you will instantly set out for the north of England,\r\nto pay your uncle a visit, and see the state of his family. I have chosen\r\nfrom among his sons (he has six, I believe) one who, I understand, is\r\nmost worthy to fill the place I intended for you in the counting-house.\r\nBut some farther arrangements may be necessary, and for these your\r\npresence may be requisite. You shall have farther instructions at\r\nOsbaldistone Hall, where you will please to remain until you hear from\r\nme. Everything will be ready for your departure to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words my father left the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does all this mean, Mr. Owen?\xe2\x80\x9d said I to my sympathetic friend,\r\nwhose countenance wore a cast of the deepest dejection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have ruined yourself, Mr. Frank, that's all. When your father talks\r\nin that quiet determined manner, there will be no more change in him than\r\nin a fitted account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved; for the next morning, at five o'clock, I found myself\r\non the road to York, mounted on a reasonably good horse, and with fifty\r\nguineas in my pocket; travelling, as it would seem, for the purpose of\r\nassisting in the adoption of a successor to myself in my father's house\r\nand favour, and, for aught I knew, eventually in his fortune also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The slack sail shifts from side to side,\r\n                  The boat, untrimm'd, admits the tide,\r\n                  Borne down, adrift, at random tost,\r\n                  The oar breaks short, the rudder's lost.\r\n                                        Gay's _Fables._\r\n\r\nI have tagged with rhyme and blank verse the subdivisions of this\r\nimportant narrative, in order to seduce your continued attention by\r\npowers of composition of stronger attraction than my own. The preceding\r\nlines refer to an unfortunate navigator, who daringly unloosed from its\r\nmoorings a boat, which he was unable to manage, and thrust it off into\r\nthe full tide of a navigable river. No schoolboy, who, betwixt frolic and\r\ndefiance, has executed a similar rash attempt, could feel himself, when\r\nadrift in a strong current, in a situation more awkward than mine, when I\r\nfound myself driving, without a compass, on the ocean of human life.\r\nThere had been such unexpected ease in the manner in which my father\r\nslipt a knot, usually esteemed the strongest which binds society\r\ntogether, and suffered me to depart as a sort of outcast from his family,\r\nthat it strangely lessened the confidence in my own personal\r\naccomplishments, which had hitherto sustained me. Prince Prettyman, now a\r\nprince, and now a fisher's son, had not a more awkward sense of his\r\ndegradation. We are so apt, in our engrossing egotism, to consider all\r\nthose accessories which are drawn around us by prosperity, as pertaining\r\nand belonging to our own persons, that the discovery of our unimportance,\r\nwhen left to our own proper resources, becomes inexpressibly mortifying.\r\nAs the hum of London died away on my ear, the distant peal of her\r\nsteeples more than once sounded to my ears the admonitory \xe2\x80\x9cTurn again,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n erst heard by her future Lord Mayor; and when I looked back from Highgate\r\non her dusky magnificence, I felt as if I were leaving behind me comfort,\r\nopulence, the charms of society, and all the pleasures of cultivated\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut the die was cast. It was, indeed, by no means probable that a late\r\nand ungracious compliance with my father's wishes would have reinstated\r\nme in the situation which I had lost. On the contrary, firm and strong of\r\npurpose as he himself was, he might rather have been disgusted than\r\nconciliated by my tardy and compulsory acquiescence in his desire that I\r\nshould engage in commerce. My constitutional obstinacy came also to my\r\naid, and pride whispered how poor a figure I should make, when an airing\r\nof four miles from London had blown away resolutions formed during a\r\nmonth's serious deliberation. Hope, too, that never forsakes the young\r\nand hardy, lent her lustre to my future prospects. My father could not be\r\nserious in the sentence of foris-familiation, which he had so\r\nunhesitatingly pronounced. It must be but a trial of my disposition,\r\nwhich, endured with patience and steadiness on my part, would raise me in\r\nhis estimation, and lead to an amicable accommodation of the point in\r\ndispute between us. I even settled in my own mind how far I would concede\r\nto him, and on what articles of our supposed treaty I would make a firm\r\nstand; and the result was, according to my computation, that I was to be\r\nreinstated in my full rights of filiation, paying the easy penalty of\r\nsome ostensible compliances to atone for my past rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, I was lord of my person, and experienced that feeling\r\nof independence which the youthful bosom receives with a thrilling\r\nmixture of pleasure and apprehension. My purse, though by no means amply\r\nreplenished, was in a situation to supply all the wants and wishes of a\r\ntraveller. I had been accustomed, while at Bourdeaux, to act as my own\r\nvalet; my horse was fresh, young, and active, and the buoyancy of my\r\nspirits soon surmounted the melancholy reflections with which my journey\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nI should have been glad to have journeyed upon a line of road better\r\ncalculated to afford reasonable objects of curiosity, or a more\r\ninteresting country, to the traveller. But the north road was then, and\r\nperhaps still is, singularly deficient in these respects; nor do I\r\nbelieve you can travel so far through Britain in any other direction\r\nwithout meeting more of what is worthy to engage the attention. My mental\r\nruminations, notwithstanding my assumed confidence, were not always of an\r\nunchequered nature. The Muse too,--the very coquette who had led me into\r\nthis wilderness,--like others of her sex, deserted me in my utmost need,\r\nand I should have been reduced to rather an uncomfortable state of\r\ndulness, had it not been for the occasional conversation of strangers who\r\nchanced to pass the same way. But the characters whom I met with were of\r\na uniform and uninteresting description. Country parsons, jogging\r\nhomewards after a visitation; farmers, or graziers, returning from a\r\ndistant market; clerks of traders, travelling to collect what was due to\r\ntheir masters, in provincial towns; with now and then an officer going\r\ndown into the country upon the recruiting service, were, at this period,\r\nthe persons by whom the turnpikes and tapsters were kept in exercise. Our\r\nspeech, therefore, was of tithes and creeds, of beeves and grain, of\r\ncommodities wet and dry, and the solvency of the retail dealers,\r\noccasionally varied by the description of a siege, or battle, in\r\nFlanders, which, perhaps, the narrator only gave me at second hand.\r\nRobbers, a fertile and alarming theme, filled up every vacancy; and the\r\nnames of the Golden Farmer, the Flying Highwayman, Jack Needham, and\r\nother Beggars' Opera heroes, were familiar in our mouths as household\r\nwords. At such tales, like children closing their circle round the fire\r\nwhen the ghost story draws to its climax, the riders drew near to each\r\nother, looked before and behind them, examined the priming of their\r\npistols, and vowed to stand by each other in case of danger; an\r\nengagement which, like other offensive and defensive alliances, sometimes\r\nglided out of remembrance when there was an appearance of actual peril.\r\n\r\nOf all the fellows whom I ever saw haunted by terrors of this nature, one\r\npoor man, with whom I travelled a day and a half, afforded me most\r\namusement. He had upon his pillion a very small, but apparently a very\r\nweighty portmanteau, about the safety of which he seemed particularly\r\nsolicitous; never trusting it out of his own immediate care, and\r\nuniformly repressing the officious zeal of the waiters and ostlers, who\r\noffered their services to carry it into the house. With the same\r\nprecaution he laboured to conceal, not only the purpose of his journey,\r\nand his ultimate place of destination, but even the direction of each\r\nday's route. Nothing embarrassed him more than to be asked by any one,\r\nwhether he was travelling upwards or downwards, or at what stage he\r\nintended to bait. His place of rest for the night he scrutinised with the\r\nmost anxious care, alike avoiding solitude, and what he considered as bad\r\nneighbourhood; and at Grantham, I believe, he sate up all night to avoid\r\nsleeping in the next room to a thick-set squinting fellow, in a black\r\nwig, and a tarnished gold-laced waistcoat. With all these cares on his\r\nmind, my fellow traveller, to judge by his thews and sinews, was a man\r\nwho might have set danger at defiance with as much impunity as most men.\r\nHe was strong and well built; and, judging from his gold-laced hat and\r\ncockade, seemed to have served in the army, or, at least, to belong to\r\nthe military profession in one capacity or other. His conversation also,\r\nthough always sufficiently vulgar, was that of a man of sense, when the\r\nterrible bugbears which haunted his imagination for a moment ceased to\r\noccupy his attention. But every accidental association recalled them. An\r\nopen heath, a close plantation, were alike subjects of apprehension; and\r\nthe whistle of a shepherd lad was instantly converted into the signal of\r\na depredator. Even the sight of a gibbet, if it assured him that one\r\nrobber was safely disposed of by justice, never failed to remind him how\r\nmany remained still unhanged.\r\n\r\nI should have wearied of this fellow's company, had I not been still more\r\ntired of my own thoughts. Some of the marvellous stories, however, which\r\nhe related, had in themselves a cast of interest, and another whimsical\r\npoint of his peculiarities afforded me the occasional opportunity of\r\namusing myself at his expense. Among his tales, several of the\r\nunfortunate travellers who fell among thieves, incurred that calamity\r\nfrom associating themselves on the road with a well-dressed and\r\nentertaining stranger, in whose company they trusted to find protection\r\nas well as amusement; who cheered their journey with tale and song,\r\nprotected them against the evils of over-charges and false reckonings,\r\nuntil at length, under pretext of showing a near path over a desolate\r\ncommon, he seduced his unsuspicious victims from the public road into\r\nsome dismal glen, where, suddenly blowing his whistle, he assembled his\r\ncomrades from their lurking-place, and displayed himself in his true\r\ncolours--the captain, namely, of the band of robbers to whom his unwary\r\nfellow-travellers had forfeited their purses, and perhaps their lives.\r\nTowards the conclusion of such a tale, and when my companion had wrought\r\nhimself into a fever of apprehension by the progress of his own\r\nnarrative, I observed that he usually eyed me with a glance of doubt and\r\nsuspicion, as if the possibility occurred to him, that he might, at that\r\nvery moment, be in company with a character as dangerous as that which\r\nhis tale described. And ever and anon, when such suggestions pressed\r\nthemselves on the mind of this ingenious self-tormentor, he drew off from\r\nme to the opposite side of the high-road, looked before, behind, and\r\naround him, examined his arms, and seemed to prepare himself for flight\r\nor defence, as circumstances might require.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion implied on such occasions seemed to me only momentary, and\r\ntoo ludicrous to be offensive. There was, in fact, no particular\r\nreflection on my dress or address, although I was thus mistaken for a\r\nrobber. A man in those days might have all the external appearance of a\r\ngentleman, and yet turn out to be a highwayman. For the division of\r\nlabour in every department not having then taken place so fully as since\r\nthat period, the profession of the polite and accomplished adventurer,\r\nwho nicked you out of your money at White's, or bowled you out of it at\r\nMarylebone, was often united with that of the professed ruffian, who on\r\nBagshot Heath, or Finchley Common, commanded his brother beau to stand\r\nand deliver. There was also a touch of coarseness and hardness about the\r\nmanners of the times, which has since, in a great degree, been softened\r\nand shaded away. It seems to me, on recollection, as if desperate men had\r\nless reluctance then than now to embrace the most desperate means of\r\nretrieving their fortune. The times were indeed past, when Anthony-a-Wood\r\nmourned over the execution of two men, goodly in person, and of\r\nundisputed courage and honour, who were hanged without mercy at Oxford,\r\nmerely because their distress had driven them to raise contributions on\r\nthe highway. We were still farther removed from the days of \xe2\x80\x9cthe mad\r\nPrince and Poins.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet, from the number of unenclosed and extensive\r\nheaths in the vicinity of the metropolis, and from the less populous\r\nstate of remote districts, both were frequented by that species of\r\nmounted highwaymen, that may possibly become one day unknown, who carried\r\non their trade with something like courtesy; and, like Gibbet in the\r\nBeaux Stratagem, piqued themselves on being the best behaved men on the\r\nroad, and on conducting themselves with all appropriate civility in the\r\nexercise of their vocation. A young man, therefore, in my circumstances\r\nwas not entitled to be highly indignant at the mistake which confounded\r\nhim with this worshipful class of depredators.\r\n\r\nNeither was I offended. On the contrary, I found amusement in alternately\r\nexciting, and lulling to sleep, the suspicions of my timorous companion,\r\nand in purposely so acting as still farther to puzzle a brain which\r\nnature and apprehension had combined to render none of the clearest. When\r\nmy free conversation had lulled him into complete security, it required\r\nonly a passing inquiry concerning the direction of his journey, or the\r\nnature of the business which occasioned it, to put his suspicions once\r\nmore in arms. For example, a conversation on the comparative strength and\r\nactivity of our horses, took such a turn as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said my companion, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the gallop I grant you; but allow me to\r\nsay, your horse (although he is a very handsome gelding--that must be\r\nowned,) has too little bone to be a good roadster. The trot, sir\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (striking his Bucephalus with his spurs),--\xe2\x80\x9cthe trot is the true pace for\r\na hackney; and, were we near a town, I should like to try that\r\ndaisy-cutter of yours upon a piece of level road (barring canter) for a\r\nquart of claret at the next inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContent, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I; \xe2\x80\x9cand here is a stretch of ground very\r\nfavourable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHem, ahem,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my friend with hesitation; \xe2\x80\x9cI make it a rule of\r\ntravelling never to blow my horse between stages; one never knows what\r\noccasion he may have to put him to his mettle: and besides, sir, when I\r\nsaid I would match you, I meant with even weight; you ride four stone\r\nlighter than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; but I am content to carry weight. Pray, what may that\r\nportmanteau of yours weigh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy p-p-portmanteau?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, hesitating--\xe2\x80\x9cO very little--a\r\nfeather--just a few shirts and stockings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it heavier, from its appearance. I'll hold you the quart\r\nof claret it makes the odds betwixt our weight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're mistaken, sir, I assure you--quite mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my friend,\r\nedging off to the side of the road, as was his wont on these alarming\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am willing to venture the wine; or, I will bet you ten pieces to\r\nfive, that I carry your portmanteau on my croupe, and out-trot you into\r\nthe bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis proposal raised my friend's alarm to the uttermost. His nose changed\r\nfrom the natural copper hue which it had acquired from many a comfortable\r\ncup of claret or sack, into a palish brassy tint, and his teeth chattered\r\nwith apprehension at the unveiled audacity of my proposal, which seemed\r\nto place the barefaced plunderer before him in full atrocity. As he\r\nfaltered for an answer, I relieved him in some degree by a question\r\nconcerning a steeple, which now became visible, and an observation that\r\nwe were now so near the village as to run no risk from interruption on\r\nthe road. At this his countenance cleared up: but I easily perceived that\r\nit was long ere he forgot a proposal which seemed to him so fraught with\r\nsuspicion as that which I had now hazarded. I trouble you with this\r\ndetail of the man's disposition, and the manner in which I practised upon\r\nit, because, however trivial in themselves, these particulars were\r\nattended by an important influence on future incidents which will occur\r\nin this narrative. At the time, this person's conduct only inspired me\r\nwith contempt, and confirmed me in an opinion which I already\r\nentertained, that of all the propensities which teach mankind to torment\r\nthemselves, that of causeless fear is the most irritating, busy, painful,\r\nand pitiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n             The Scots are poor, cries surly English pride.\r\n             True is the charge; nor by themselves denied.\r\n             Are they not, then, in strictest reason clear,\r\n             Who wisely come to mend their fortunes here?\r\n                                             Churchill.\r\n\r\nThere was, in the days of which I write, an old-fashioned custom on the\r\nEnglish road, which I suspect is now obsolete, or practised only by the\r\nvulgar. Journeys of length being made on horseback, and, of course, by\r\nbrief stages, it was usual always to make a halt on the Sunday in some\r\ntown where the traveller might attend divine service, and his horse have\r\nthe benefit of the day of rest, the institution of which is as humane to\r\nour brute labourers as profitable to ourselves. A counterpart to this\r\ndecent practice, and a remnant of old English hospitality, was, that the\r\nlandlord of a principal inn laid aside his character of a publican on the\r\nseventh day, and invited the guests who chanced to be within his walls to\r\ntake a part of his family beef and pudding. This invitation was usually\r\ncomplied with by all whose distinguished rank did not induce them to\r\nthink compliance a derogation; and the proposal of a bottle of wine after\r\ndinner, to drink the landlord's health, was the only recompense ever\r\noffered or accepted.\r\n\r\nI was born a citizen of the world, and my inclination led me into all\r\nscenes where my knowledge of mankind could be enlarged; I had, besides,\r\nno pretensions to sequester myself on the score of superior dignity, and\r\ntherefore seldom failed to accept of the Sunday's hospitality of mine\r\nhost, whether of the Garter, Lion, or Bear. The honest publican, dilated\r\ninto additional consequence by a sense of his own importance, while\r\npresiding among the guests on whom it was his ordinary duty to attend,\r\nwas in himself an entertaining, spectacle; and around his genial orbit,\r\nother planets of inferior consequence performed their revolutions. The\r\nwits and humorists, the distinguished worthies of the town or village,\r\nthe apothecary, the attorney, even the curate himself, did not disdain to\r\npartake of this hebdomadal festivity. The guests, assembled from\r\ndifferent quarters, and following different professions, formed, in\r\nlanguage, manners, and sentiments, a curious contrast to each other, not\r\nindifferent to those who desired to possess a knowledge of mankind in its\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nIt was on such a day, and such an occasion, that my timorous acquaintance\r\nand I were about to grace the board of the ruddy-faced host of the Black\r\nBear, in the town of Darlington, and bishopric of Durham, when our\r\nlandlord informed us, with a sort of apologetic tone, that there was a\r\nScotch gentleman to dine with us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman!--what sort of a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d said my companion somewhat\r\nhastily--his mind, I suppose, running on gentlemen of the pad, as they\r\nwere then termed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a Scotch sort of a gentleman, as I said before,\xe2\x80\x9d returned mine\r\nhost; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are all gentle, ye mun know, though they ha' narra shirt to\r\nback; but this is a decentish hallion--a canny North Briton as e'er\r\ncross'd Berwick Bridge--I trow he's a dealer in cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us have his company, by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my companion; and then,\r\nturning to me, he gave vent to the tenor of his own reflections. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrespect the Scotch, sir; I love and honour the nation for their sense of\r\nmorality. Men talk of their filth and their poverty: but commend me to\r\nsterling honesty, though clad in rags, as the poet saith. I have been\r\ncredibly assured, sir, by men on whom I can depend, that there was never\r\nknown such a thing in Scotland as a highway robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's because they have nothing to lose,\xe2\x80\x9d said mine host, with the\r\nchuckle of a self-applauding wit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, landlord,\xe2\x80\x9d answered a strong deep voice behind him, \xe2\x80\x9cit's e'en\r\nbecause your English gaugers and supervisors,* that you have sent down\r\nbenorth the Tweed, have taen up the trade of thievery over the heads of\r\nthe native professors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* The introduction of gaugers, supervisors, and examiners, was one of the\r\ngreat complaints of the Scottish nation, though a natural consequence of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said, Mr. Campbell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cI did not think\r\nthoud'st been sae near us, mon. But thou kens I'm an outspoken Yorkshire\r\ntyke. And how go markets in the south?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven in the ordinar,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Campbell; \xe2\x80\x9cwise folks buy and sell,\r\nand fools are bought and sold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wise men and fools both eat their dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d answered our jolly\r\nentertainer; \xe2\x80\x9cand here a comes--as prime a buttock of beef as e'er hungry\r\nmen stuck fork in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he eagerly whetted his knife, assumed his seat of empire at\r\nthe head of the board, and loaded the plates of his sundry guests with\r\nhis good cheer.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I had heard the Scottish accent, or, indeed, that\r\nI had familiarly met with an individual of the ancient nation by whom it\r\nwas spoken. Yet, from an early period, they had occupied and interested\r\nmy imagination. My father, as is well known to you, was of an ancient\r\nfamily in Northumberland, from whose seat I was, while eating the\r\naforesaid dinner, not very many miles distant. The quarrel betwixt him\r\nand his relatives was such, that he scarcely ever mentioned the race from\r\nwhich he sprung, and held as the most contemptible species of vanity, the\r\nweakness which is commonly termed family pride. His ambition was only to\r\nbe distinguished as William Osbaldistone, the first, at least one of the\r\nfirst, merchants on Change; and to have proved him the lineal\r\nrepresentative of William the Conqueror would have far less flattered his\r\nvanity than the hum and bustle which his approach was wont to produce\r\namong the bulls, bears, and brokers of Stock-alley. He wished, no doubt,\r\nthat I should remain in such ignorance of my relatives and descent as\r\nmight insure a correspondence between my feelings and his own on this\r\nsubject. But his designs, as will happen occasionally to the wisest,\r\nwere, in some degree at least, counteracted by a being whom his pride\r\nwould never have supposed of importance adequate to influence them in any\r\nway. His nurse, an old Northumbrian woman, attached to him from his\r\ninfancy, was the only person connected with his native province for whom\r\nhe retained any regard; and when fortune dawned upon him, one of the\r\nfirst uses which he made of her favours, was to give Mabel Rickets a\r\nplace of residence within his household. After the death of my mother,\r\nthe care of nursing me during my childish illnesses, and of rendering all\r\nthose tender attentions which infancy exacts from female affection,\r\ndevolved on old Mabel. Interdicted by her master from speaking to him on\r\nthe subject of the heaths, glades, and dales of her beloved\r\nNorthumberland, she poured herself forth to my infant ear in descriptions\r\nof the scenes of her youth, and long narratives of the events which\r\ntradition declared to have passed amongst them. To these I inclined my\r\near much more seriously than to graver, but less animated instructors.\r\nEven yet, methinks I see old Mabel, her head slightly agitated by the\r\npalsy of age, and shaded by a close cap, as white as the driven\r\nsnow,--her face wrinkled, but still retaining the healthy tinge which it\r\nhad acquired in rural labour--I think I see her look around on the brick\r\nwalls and narrow street which presented themselves before our windows,\r\nas she concluded with a sigh the favourite old ditty, which I then\r\npreferred, and--why should I not tell the truth?--which I still prefer\r\nto all the opera airs ever minted by the capricious brain of an Italian\r\nMus. D.--\r\n\r\n             Oh, the oak, the ash, and the bonny ivy tree,\r\n             They flourish best at home in the North Countrie!\r\n\r\nNow, in the legends of Mabel, the Scottish nation was ever freshly\r\nremembered, with all the embittered declamation of which the narrator was\r\ncapable. The inhabitants of the opposite frontier served in her\r\nnarratives to fill up the parts which ogres and giants with seven-leagued\r\nboots occupy in the ordinary nursery tales. And how could it be\r\notherwise? Was it not the Black Douglas who slew with his own hand the\r\nheir of the Osbaldistone family the day after he took possession of his\r\nestate, surprising him and his vassals while solemnizing a feast suited\r\nto the occasion? Was it not Wat the Devil, who drove all the year-old\r\nhogs off the braes of Lanthorn-side, in the very recent days of my\r\ngrandfather's father? And had we not many a trophy, but, according to old\r\nMabel's version of history, far more honourably gained, to mark our\r\nrevenge of these wrongs? Did not Sir Henry Osbaldistone, fifth baron of\r\nthe name, carry off the fair maid of Fairnington, as Achilles did his\r\nChryseis and Briseis of old, and detain her in his fortress against all\r\nthe power of her friends, supported by the most mighty Scottish chiefs of\r\nwarlike fame? And had not our swords shone foremost at most of those\r\nfields in which England was victorious over her rival? All our family\r\nrenown was acquired--all our family misfortunes were occasioned--by the\r\nnorthern wars.\r\n\r\nWarmed by such tales, I looked upon the Scottish people during my\r\nchildhood, as a race hostile by nature to the more southern inhabitants\r\nof this realm; and this view of the matter was not much corrected by the\r\nlanguage which my father sometimes held with respect to them. He had\r\nengaged in some large speculations concerning oak-woods, the property of\r\nHighland proprietors, and alleged, that he found them much more ready to\r\nmake bargains, and extort earnest of the purchase-money, than punctual in\r\ncomplying on their side with the terms of the engagements. The Scottish\r\nmercantile men, whom he was under the necessity of employing as a sort of\r\nmiddle-men on these occasions, were also suspected by my father of having\r\nsecured, by one means or other, more than their own share of the profit\r\nwhich ought to have accrued. In short, if Mabel complained of the\r\nScottish arms in ancient times, Mr. Osbaldistone inveighed no less\r\nagainst the arts of these modern Sinons; and between them, though without\r\nany fixed purpose of doing so, they impressed my youthful mind with a\r\nsincere aversion to the northern inhabitants of Britain, as a people\r\nbloodthirsty in time of war, treacherous during truce, interested,\r\nselfish, avaricious, and tricky in the business of peaceful life, and\r\nhaving few good qualities, unless there should be accounted such, a\r\nferocity which resembled courage in martial affairs, and a sort of wily\r\ncraft which supplied the place of wisdom in the ordinary commerce of\r\nmankind. In justification, or apology, for those who entertained such\r\nprejudices, I must remark, that the Scotch of that period were guilty of\r\nsimilar injustice to the English, whom they branded universally as a race\r\nof purse-proud arrogant epicures. Such seeds of national dislike remained\r\nbetween the two countries, the natural consequences of their existence as\r\nseparate and rival states. We have seen recently the breath of a\r\ndemagogue blow these sparks into a temporary flame, which I sincerely\r\nhope is now extinguished in its own ashes. *\r\n\r\n* This seems to have been written about the time of Wilkes and Liberty.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, with an impression of dislike, that I contemplated the\r\nfirst Scotchman I chanced to meet in society. There was much about him\r\nthat coincided with my previous conceptions. He had the hard features and\r\nathletic form said to be peculiar to his country, together with the\r\nnational intonation and slow pedantic mode of expression, arising from a\r\ndesire to avoid peculiarities of idiom or dialect. I could also observe\r\nthe caution and shrewdness of his country in many of the observations\r\nwhich he made, and the answers which he returned. But I was not prepared\r\nfor the air of easy self-possession and superiority with which he seemed\r\nto predominate over the company into which he was thrown, as it were by\r\naccident. His dress was as coarse as it could be, being still decent;\r\nand, at a time when great expense was lavished upon the wardrobe, even of\r\nthe lowest who pretended to the character of gentleman, this indicated\r\nmediocrity of circumstances, if not poverty. His conversation intimated\r\nthat he was engaged in the cattle trade, no very dignified professional\r\npursuit. And yet, under these disadvantages, he seemed, as a matter of\r\ncourse, to treat the rest of the company with the cool and condescending\r\npoliteness which implies a real, or imagined, superiority over those\r\ntowards whom it is used. When he gave his opinion on any point, it was\r\nwith that easy tone of confidence used by those superior to their society\r\nin rank or information, as if what he said could not be doubted, and was\r\nnot to be questioned. Mine host and his Sunday guests, after an effort or\r\ntwo to support their consequence by noise and bold averment, sunk\r\ngradually under the authority of Mr. Campbell, who thus fairly possessed\r\nhimself of the lead in the conversation. I was tempted, from curiosity,\r\nto dispute the ground with him myself, confiding in my knowledge of the\r\nworld, extended as it was by my residence abroad, and in the stores with\r\nwhich a tolerable education had possessed my mind. In the latter respect\r\nhe offered no competition, and it was easy to see that his natural powers\r\nhad never been cultivated by education. But I found him much better\r\nacquainted than I was myself with the present state of France, the\r\ncharacter of the Duke of Orleans, who had just succeeded to the regency\r\nof that kingdom, and that of the statesmen by whom he was surrounded; and\r\nhis shrewd, caustic, and somewhat satirical remarks, were those of a man\r\nwho had been a close observer of the affairs of that country.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of politics, Campbell observed a silence and moderation\r\nwhich might arise from caution. The divisions of Whig and Tory then shook\r\nEngland to her very centre, and a powerful party, engaged in the Jacobite\r\ninterest, menaced the dynasty of Hanover, which had been just established\r\non the throne. Every alehouse resounded with the brawls of contending\r\npoliticians, and as mine host's politics were of that liberal description\r\nwhich quarrelled with no good customer, his hebdomadal visitants were\r\noften divided in their opinion as irreconcilably as if he had feasted the\r\nCommon Council. The curate and the apothecary, with a little man, who\r\nmade no boast of his vocation, but who, from the flourish and snap of his\r\nfingers, I believe to have been the barber, strongly espoused the cause\r\nof high church and the Stuart line. The excise-man, as in duty bound, and\r\nthe attorney, who looked to some petty office under the Crown, together\r\nwith my fellow-traveller, who seemed to enter keenly into the contest,\r\nstaunchly supported the cause of King George and the Protestant\r\nsuccession. Dire was the screaming--deep the oaths! Each party appealed\r\nto Mr. Campbell, anxious, it seemed, to elicit his approbation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a Scotchman, sir; a gentleman of your country must stand up for\r\nhereditary right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a Presbyterian,\xe2\x80\x9d assumed the other class of disputants; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ncannot be a friend to arbitrary power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said our Scotch oracle, after having gained, with some\r\ndifficulty, a moment's pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI havena much dubitation that King George\r\nweel deserves the predilection of his friends; and if he can haud the\r\ngrip he has gotten, why, doubtless, he may made the gauger, here, a\r\ncommissioner of the revenue, and confer on our friend, Mr. Quitam, the\r\npreferment of solicitor-general; and he may also grant some good deed or\r\nreward to this honest gentleman who is sitting upon his portmanteau,\r\nwhich he prefers to a chair: And, questionless, King James is also a\r\ngrateful person, and when he gets his hand in play, he may, if he be so\r\nminded, make this reverend gentleman archprelate of Canterbury, and Dr.\r\nMixit chief physician to his household, and commit his royal beard to the\r\ncare of my friend Latherum. But as I doubt mickle whether any of the\r\ncompeting sovereigns would give Rob Campbell a tass of aquavitae, if he\r\nlacked it, I give my vote and interest to Jonathan Brown, our landlord,\r\nto be the King and Prince of Skinkers, conditionally that he fetches us\r\nanother bottle as good as the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sally was received with general applause, in which the landlord\r\ncordially joined; and when he had given orders for fulfilling the\r\ncondition on which his preferment was to depend, he failed not to\r\nacquaint them, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, for as peaceable a gentleman as Mr. Campbell was,\r\nhe was, moreover, as bold as a lion--seven highwaymen had he defeated\r\nwith his single arm, that beset him as he came from Whitson-Tryste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art deceived, friend Jonathan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, interrupting him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey were but barely two, and two cowardly loons as man could wish to\r\nmeet withal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you, sir, really,\xe2\x80\x9d said my fellow-traveller, edging his chair (I\r\nshould have said his portmanteau) nearer to Mr. Campbell, \xe2\x80\x9creally and\r\nactually beat two highwaymen yourself alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn troth did I, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Campbell; \xe2\x80\x9cand I think it nae great thing\r\nto make a sang about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my acquaintance, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be happy to have\r\nthe pleasure of your company on my journey--I go northward, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis piece of gratuitous information concerning the route he proposed to\r\nhimself, the first I had heard my companion bestow upon any one, failed\r\nto excite the corresponding confidence of the Scotchman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can scarce travel together,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, drily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, sir, doubtless,\r\nare well mounted, and I for the present travel on foot, or on a Highland\r\nshelty, that does not help me much faster forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he called for a reckoning for the wine, and throwing down the\r\nprice of the additional bottle which he had himself introduced, rose as\r\nif to take leave of us. My companion made up to him, and taking him by\r\nthe button, drew him aside into one of the windows. I could not help\r\noverhearing him pressing something--I supposed his company upon the\r\njourney, which Mr. Campbell seemed to decline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will pay your charges, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, in a tone as if he\r\nthought the argument should bear down all opposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, somewhat contemptuously; \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbusiness at Rothbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am in no great hurry; I can ride out of the way, and never miss a\r\nday or so for good company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my faith, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot render you the service you\r\nseem to desiderate. I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, drawing himself up haughtily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctravelling on my own private affairs, and if ye will act by my\r\nadvisement, sir, ye will neither unite yourself with an absolute stranger\r\non the road, nor communicate your line of journey to those who are asking\r\nye no questions about it.\xe2\x80\x9d He then extricated his button, not very\r\nceremoniously, from the hold which detained him, and coming up to me as\r\nthe company were dispersing, observed, \xe2\x80\x9cYour friend, sir, is too\r\ncommunicative, considering the nature of his trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, looking towards the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cis no friend\r\nof mine, but an acquaintance whom I picked up on the road. I know neither\r\nhis name nor business, and you seem to be deeper in his confidence than I\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only meant,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he seems a thought rash in\r\nconferring the honour of his company on those who desire it not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cknows his own affairs best, and I should be\r\nsorry to constitute myself a judge of them in any respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell made no farther observation, but merely wished me a good\r\njourney, and the party dispersed for the evening.\r\n\r\nNext day I parted company with my timid companion, as I left the great\r\nnorthern road to turn more westerly in the direction of Osbaldistone\r\nManor, my uncle's seat. I cannot tell whether he felt relieved or\r\nembarrassed by my departure, considering the dubious light in which he\r\nseemed to regard me. For my own part, his tremors ceased to amuse me,\r\nand, to say the truth, I was heartily glad to get rid of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                How melts my beating heart as I behold\r\n           Each lovely nymph, our island's boast and pride,\r\n                Push on the generous steed, that sweeps along\r\n           O'er rough, o'er smooth, nor heeds the steepy hill,\r\n                Nor falters in the extended vale below!\r\n                                               The Chase.\r\n\r\nI approached my native north, for such I esteemed it, with that\r\nenthusiasm which romantic and wild scenery inspires in the lovers of\r\nnature. No longer interrupted by the babble of my companion, I could now\r\nremark the difference which the country exhibited from that through which\r\nI had hitherto travelled. The streams now more properly deserved the\r\nname, for, instead of slumbering stagnant among reeds and willows, they\r\nbrawled along beneath the shade of natural copsewood; were now hurried\r\ndown declivities, and now purled more leisurely, but still in active\r\nmotion, through little lonely valleys, which, opening on the road from\r\ntime to time, seemed to invite the traveller to explore their recesses.\r\nThe Cheviots rose before me in frowning majesty; not, indeed, with the\r\nsublime variety of rock and cliff which characterizes mountains of the\r\nprimary class but huge, round-headed, and clothed with a dark robe of\r\nrusset, gaining, by their extent and desolate appearance, an influence\r\nupon the imagination, as a desert district possessing a character of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe abode of my fathers, which I was now approaching, was situated in a\r\nglen, or narrow valley, which ran up among those hills. Extensive\r\nestates, which once belonged to the family of Osbaldistone, had been long\r\ndissipated by the misfortunes or misconduct of my ancestors; but enough\r\nwas still attached to the old mansion, to give my uncle the title of a\r\nman of large property. This he employed (as I was given to understand by\r\nsome inquiries which I made on the road) in maintaining the prodigal\r\nhospitality of a northern squire of the period, which he deemed essential\r\nto his family dignity.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of an eminence I had already had a distant view of\r\nOsbaldistone Hall, a large and antiquated edifice, peeping out from a\r\nDruidical grove of huge oaks; and I was directing my course towards it,\r\nas straightly and as speedily as the windings of a very indifferent road\r\nwould permit, when my horse, tired as he was, pricked up his ears at the\r\nenlivening notes of a pack of hounds in full cry, cheered by the\r\noccasional bursts of a French horn, which in those days was a constant\r\naccompaniment to the chase. I made no doubt that the pack was my uncle's,\r\nand drew up my horse with the purpose of suffering the hunters to pass\r\nwithout notice, aware that a hunting-field was not the proper scene to\r\nintroduce myself to a keen sportsman, and determined when they had passed\r\non, to proceed to the mansion-house at my own pace, and there to await\r\nthe return of the proprietor from his sport. I paused, therefore, on a\r\nrising ground, and, not unmoved by the sense of interest which that\r\nspecies of silvan sport is so much calculated to inspire (although my\r\nmind was not at the moment very accessible to impressions of this\r\nnature), I expected with some eagerness the appearance of the huntsmen.\r\n\r\nThe fox, hard run, and nearly spent, first made his appearance from the\r\ncopse which clothed the right-hand side of the valley. His drooping\r\nbrush, his soiled appearance, and jaded trot, proclaimed his fate\r\nimpending; and the carrion crow, which hovered over him, already\r\nconsidered poor Reynard as soon to be his prey. He crossed the stream\r\nwhich divides the little valley, and was dragging himself up a ravine on\r\nthe other side of its wild banks, when the headmost hounds, followed by\r\nthe rest of the pack in full cry, burst from the coppice, followed by the\r\nhuntsman and three or four riders. The dogs pursued the trace of Reynard\r\nwith unerring instinct; and the hunters followed with reckless haste,\r\nregardless of the broken and difficult nature of the ground. They were\r\ntall, stout young men, well mounted, and dressed in green and red, the\r\nuniform of a sporting association, formed under the auspices of old Sir\r\nHildebrand Osbaldistone.--\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousins!\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, as they swept past me.\r\nThe next reflection was, what is my reception likely to be among these\r\nworthy successors of Nimrod? and how improbable is it that I, knowing\r\nlittle or nothing of rural sports, shall find myself at ease, or happy,\r\nin my uncle's family. A vision that passed me interrupted these\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nIt was a young lady, the loveliness of whose very striking features was\r\nenhanced by the animation of the chase and the glow of the exercise,\r\nmounted on a beautiful horse, jet black, unless where he was flecked by\r\nspots of the snow-white foam which embossed his bridle. She wore, what\r\nwas then somewhat unusual, a coat, vest, and hat, resembling those of a\r\nman, which fashion has since called a riding habit. The mode had been\r\nintroduced while I was in France, and was perfectly new to me. Her long\r\nblack hair streamed on the breeze, having in the hurry of the chase\r\nescaped from the ribbon which bound it. Some very broken ground, through\r\nwhich she guided her horse with the most admirable address and presence\r\nof mind, retarded her course, and brought her closer to me than any of\r\nthe other riders had passed. I had, therefore, a full view of her\r\nuncommonly fine face and person, to which an inexpressible charm was\r\nadded by the wild gaiety of the scene, and the romance of her singular\r\ndress and unexpected appearance. As she passed me, her horse made, in his\r\nimpetuosity, an irregular movement, just while, coming once more upon\r\nopen ground, she was again putting him to his speed. It served as an\r\napology for me to ride close up to her, as if to her assistance. There\r\nwas, however, no cause for alarm; it was not a stumble, nor a false step;\r\nand, if it had, the fair Amazon had too much self-possession to have been\r\nderanged by it. She thanked my good intentions, however, by a smile, and\r\nI felt encouraged to put my horse to the same pace, and to keep in her\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. The clamour of \xe2\x80\x9cWhoop! dead! dead!\xe2\x80\x9d--and the\r\ncorresponding flourish of the French horn, soon announced to us that\r\nthere was no more occasion for haste, since the chase was at a close. One\r\nof the young men whom we had seen approached us, waving the brush of the\r\nfox in triumph, as if to upbraid my fair companion,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied,--\xe2\x80\x9cI see; but make no noise about it: if Phoebe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, patting the neck of the beautiful animal on which she rode,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chad not got among the cliffs, you would have had little cause for\r\nboasting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey met as she spoke, and I observed them both look at me, and converse\r\na moment in an under-tone, the young lady apparently pressing the\r\nsportsman to do something which he declined shyly, and with a sort of\r\nsheepish sullenness. She instantly turned her horse's head towards me,\r\nsaying,--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, Thornie, if you won't, I must, that's all.--Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she continued, addressing me, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been endeavouring to persuade this\r\ncultivated young gentleman to make inquiry of you whether, in the course\r\nof your travels in these parts, you have heard anything of a friend of\r\nours, one Mr. Francis Osbaldistone, who has been for some days expected\r\nat Osbaldistone Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was too happy to acknowledge myself to be the party inquired after, and\r\nto express my thanks for the obliging inquiries of the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cas my kinsman's politeness seems to\r\nbe still slumbering, you will permit me (though I suppose it is highly\r\nimproper) to stand mistress of ceremonies, and to present to you young\r\nSquire Thorncliff Osbaldistone, your cousin, and Die Vernon, who has also\r\nthe honour to be your accomplished cousin's poor kinswoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a mixture of boldness, satire, and simplicity in the manner in\r\nwhich Miss Vernon pronounced these words. My knowledge of life was\r\nsufficient to enable me to take up a corresponding tone as I expressed my\r\ngratitude to her for her condescension, and my extreme pleasure at having\r\nmet with them. To say the truth, the compliment was so expressed, that\r\nthe lady might easily appropriate the greater share of it, for Thorncliff\r\nseemed an arrant country bumpkin, awkward, shy, and somewhat sulky\r\nwithal. He shook hands with me, however, and then intimated his intention\r\nof leaving me that he might help the huntsman and his brothers to couple\r\nup the hounds,--a purpose which he rather communicated by way of\r\ninformation to Miss Vernon than as apology to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, following him with eyes in which\r\ndisdain was admirably painted--\xe2\x80\x9cthe prince of grooms and cock-fighters,\r\nand blackguard horse-coursers. But there is not one of them to mend\r\nanother.--Have you read Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead whom, ma'am?--I do not even remember the author's name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO lud! on what a strand are you wrecked!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\npoor forlorn and ignorant stranger, unacquainted with the very Alcoran of\r\nthe savage tribe whom you are come to reside among--Never to have heard\r\nof Markham, the most celebrated author on farriery! then I fear you are\r\nequally a stranger to the more modern names of Gibson and Bartlett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, indeed, Miss Vernon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you not blush to own it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we must\r\nforswear your alliance. Then, I suppose, you can neither give a ball, nor\r\na mash, nor a horn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I trust all these matters to an ostler, or to my groom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIncredible carelessness!--And you cannot shoe a horse, or cut his mane\r\nand tail; or worm a dog, or crop his ears, or cut his dew-claws; or\r\nreclaim a hawk, or give him his casting-stones, or direct his diet when\r\nhe is sealed; or\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sum up my insignificance in one word,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cI am profoundly\r\nignorant in all these rural accomplishments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, in the name of Heaven, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone, what _can_ you\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery little to the purpose, Miss Vernon; something, however, I can\r\npretend to--When my groom has dressed my horse I can ride him, and when\r\nmy hawk is in the field, I can fly him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you do this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, putting her horse to a canter.\r\n\r\nThere was a sort of rude overgrown fence crossed the path before us, with\r\na gate composed of pieces of wood rough from the forest; I was about to\r\nmove forward to open it, when Miss Vernon cleared the obstruction at a\r\nflying leap. I was bound in point of honour to follow, and was in a\r\nmoment again at her side. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are hopes of you yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nafraid you had been a very degenerate Osbaldistone. But what on earth\r\nbrings you to Cub-Castle?--for so the neighbours have christened this\r\nhunting-hall of ours. You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you\r\nwould?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt I was by this time on a very intimate footing with my beautiful\r\napparition, and therefore replied, in a confidential under-tone--\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\r\nmy dear Miss Vernon, I might have considered it as a sacrifice to be a\r\ntemporary resident in Osbaldistone Hall, the inmates being such as you\r\ndescribe them; but I am convinced there is one exception that will make\r\namends for all deficiencies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you mean Rashleigh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do not; I was thinking--forgive me--of some person much nearer\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it would be proper not to understand your civility?--But that\r\nis not my way--I don't make a courtesy for it because I am sitting on\r\nhorseback. But, seriously, I deserve your exception, for I am the only\r\nconversable being about the Hall, except the old priest and Rashleigh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is Rashleigh, for Heaven's sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRashleigh is one who would fain have every one like him for his own\r\nsake. He is Sir Hildebrand's youngest son--about your own age, but not\r\nso--not well looking, in short. But nature has given him a mouthful of\r\ncommon sense, and the priest has added a bushelful of learning; he is\r\nwhat we call a very clever man in this country, where clever men are\r\nscarce. Bred to the church, but in no hurry to take orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Catholic Church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Catholic Church? what Church else?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nforgot--they told me you are a heretic. Is that true, Mr. Osbaldistone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not deny the charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you have been abroad, and in Catholic countries?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor nearly four years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen convents?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften; but I have not seen much in them which recommended the Catholic\r\nreligion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre not the inhabitants happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome are unquestionably so, whom either a profound sense of devotion, or\r\nan experience of the persecutions and misfortunes of the world, or a\r\nnatural apathy of temper, has led into retirement. Those who have adopted\r\na life of seclusion from sudden and overstrained enthusiasm, or in hasty\r\nresentment of some disappointment or mortification, are very miserable.\r\nThe quickness of sensation soon returns, and like the wilder animals in a\r\nmenagerie, they are restless under confinement, while others muse or\r\nfatten in cells of no larger dimensions than theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cbecomes of those victims who are\r\ncondemned to a convent by the will of others? what do they resemble?\r\nespecially, what do they resemble, if they are born to enjoy life, and\r\nfeel its blessings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are like imprisoned singing-birds,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9ccondemned to wear\r\nout their lives in confinement, which they try to beguile by the exercise\r\nof accomplishments which would have adorned society had they been left at\r\nlarge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Vernon--\xe2\x80\x9cthat is,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, correcting\r\nherself--\xe2\x80\x9cI should be rather like the wild hawk, who, barred the free\r\nexercise of his soar through heaven, will dash himself to pieces against\r\nthe bars of his cage. But to return to Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a more\r\nlively tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will think him the pleasantest man you ever saw in your\r\nlife, Mr. Osbaldistone,--that is, for a week at least. If he could find\r\nout a blind mistress, never man would be so secure of conquest; but the\r\neye breaks the spell that enchants the ear.--But here we are in the court\r\nof the old hall, which looks as wild and old-fashioned as any of its\r\ninmates. There is no great toilette kept at Osbaldistone Hall, you must\r\nknow; but I must take off these things, they are so unpleasantly\r\nwarm,--and the hat hurts my forehead, too,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the lively girl,\r\ntaking it off, and shaking down a profusion of sable ringlets, which,\r\nhalf laughing, half blushing, she separated with her white slender\r\nfingers, in order to clear them away from her beautiful face and\r\npiercing hazel eyes. If there was any coquetry in the action, it was\r\nwell disguised by the careless indifference of her manner. I could not\r\nhelp saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, judging of the family from what I saw, I should\r\nsuppose the toilette a very unnecessary care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's very politely said--though, perhaps, I ought not to understand in\r\nwhat sense it was meant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Vernon; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you will see a better\r\napology for a little negligence when you meet the Orsons you are to live\r\namongst, whose forms no toilette could improve. But, as I said before,\r\nthe old dinner-bell will clang, or rather clank, in a few minutes--it\r\ncracked of its own accord on the day of the landing of King Willie, and\r\nmy uncle, respecting its prophetic talent, would never permit it to be\r\nmended. So do you hold my palfrey, like a duteous knight, until I send\r\nsome more humble squire to relieve you of the charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw me the rein as if we had been acquainted from our childhood,\r\njumped from her saddle, tripped across the courtyard, and entered at a\r\nside-door, leaving me in admiration of her beauty, and astonished with\r\nthe over-frankness of her manners, which seemed the more extraordinary at\r\na time when the dictates of politeness, flowing from the court of the\r\nGrand Monarque Louis XIV., prescribed to the fair sex an unusual severity\r\nof decorum. I was left awkwardly enough stationed in the centre of the\r\ncourt of the old hall, mounted on one horse, and holding another in my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe building afforded little to interest a stranger, had I been disposed\r\nto consider it attentively; the sides of the quadrangle were of various\r\narchitecture, and with their stone-shafted latticed windows, projecting\r\nturrets, and massive architraves, resembled the inside of a convent, or\r\nof one of the older and less splendid colleges of Oxford. I called for a\r\ndomestic, but was for some time totally unattended to; which was the more\r\nprovoking, as I could perceive I was the object of curiosity to several\r\nservants, both male and female, from different parts of the building, who\r\npopped out their heads and withdrew them, like rabbits in a warren,\r\nbefore I could make a direct appeal to the attention of any individual.\r\nThe return of the huntsmen and hounds relieved me from my embarrassment,\r\nand with some difficulty I got one down to relieve me of the charge of\r\nthe horses, and another stupid boor to guide me to the presence of Sir\r\nHildebrand. This service he performed with much such grace and good-will,\r\nas a peasant who is compelled to act as guide to a hostile patrol; and in\r\nthe same manner I was obliged to guard against his deserting me in the\r\nlabyrinth of low vaulted passages which conducted to \xe2\x80\x9cStun Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d as he\r\ncalled it, where I was to be introduced to the gracious presence of my\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\nWe did, however, at length reach a long vaulted room, floored with stone,\r\nwhere a range of oaken tables, of a weight and size too massive ever to\r\nbe moved aside, were already covered for dinner. This venerable\r\napartment, which had witnessed the feasts of several generations of the\r\nOsbaldistone family, bore also evidence of their success in field sports.\r\nHuge antlers of deer, which might have been trophies of the hunting of\r\nChevy Chace, were ranged around the walls, interspersed with the stuffed\r\nskins of badgers, otters, martins, and other animals of the chase. Amidst\r\nsome remnants of old armour, which had, perhaps, served against the\r\nScotch, hung the more valued weapons of silvan war, cross-bows, guns of\r\nvarious device and construction, nets, fishing-rods, otter-spears,\r\nhunting-poles, with many other singular devices, and engines for taking\r\nor killing game. A few old pictures, dimmed with smoke, and stained with\r\nMarch beer, hung on the walls, representing knights and ladies, honoured,\r\ndoubtless, and renowned in their day; those frowning fearfully from huge\r\nbushes of wig and of beard; and these looking delightfully with all their\r\nmight at the roses which they brandished in their hands.\r\n\r\nI had just time to give a glance at these matters, when about twelve\r\nblue-coated servants burst into the hall with much tumult and talk, each\r\nrather employed in directing his comrades than in discharging his own\r\nduty. Some brought blocks and billets to the fire, which roared, blazed,\r\nand ascended, half in smoke, half in flame, up a huge tunnel, with an\r\nopening wide enough to accommodate a stone seat within its ample vault,\r\nand which was fronted, by way of chimney-piece, with a huge piece of\r\nheavy architecture, where the monsters of heraldry, embodied by the art\r\nof some Northumbrian chisel, grinned and ramped in red free-stone, now\r\njapanned by the smoke of centuries. Others of these old-fashioned\r\nserving-men bore huge smoking dishes, loaded with substantial fare;\r\nothers brought in cups, flagons, bottles, yea barrels of liquor. All\r\ntramped, kicked, plunged, shouldered, and jostled, doing as little\r\nservice with as much tumult as could well be imagined. At length, while\r\nthe dinner was, after various efforts, in the act of being arranged upon\r\nthe board, \xe2\x80\x9cthe clamour much of men and dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d the cracking of whips,\r\ncalculated for the intimidation of the latter, voices loud and high,\r\nsteps which, impressed by the heavy-heeled boots of the period, clattered\r\nlike those in the statue of the _Festin de Pierre,_* announced the\r\narrival of those for whose benefit the preparations were made.\r\n\r\n* Now called Don Juan.\r\n\r\nThe hubbub among the servants rather increased than diminished as this\r\ncrisis approached. Some called to make haste,--others to take\r\ntime,--some exhorted to stand out of the way, and make room for Sir\r\nHildebrand and the young squires,--some to close round the table and be\r\n_in_ the way,--some bawled to open, some to shut, a pair of\r\nfolding-doors which divided the hall from a sort of gallery, as I\r\nafterwards learned, or withdrawing-room, fitted up with black wainscot.\r\nOpened the doors were at length, and in rushed curs and men,--eight\r\ndogs, the domestic chaplain, the village doctor, my six cousins, and my\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                The rude hall rocks--they come, they come,--\r\n                   The din of voices shakes the dome;--\r\n                In stalk the various forms, and, drest\r\n                   In varying morion, varying vest,\r\n       All march with haughty step--all proudly shake the crest.\r\n                                               Penrose.\r\n\r\nIf Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone was in no hurry to greet his nephew, of\r\nwhose arrival he must have been informed for some time, he had important\r\navocations to allege in excuse. \xe2\x80\x9cHad seen thee sooner, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, after a rough shake of the hand, and a hearty welcome to\r\nOsbaldistone Hall, \xe2\x80\x9cbut had to see the hounds kennelled first. Thou art\r\nwelcome to the Hall, lad--here is thy cousin Percie, thy cousin Thornie,\r\nand thy cousin John--your cousin Dick, your cousin Wilfred, and--stay,\r\nwhere's Rashleigh?--ay, here's Rashleigh--take thy long body aside\r\nThornie, and let's see thy brother a bit--your cousin Rashleigh. So, thy\r\nfather has thought on the old Hall, and old Sir Hildebrand at\r\nlast--better late than never--Thou art welcome, lad, and there's enough.\r\nWhere's my little Die?--ay, here she comes--this is my niece Die, my\r\nwife's brother's daughter--the prettiest girl in our dales, be the other\r\nwho she may--and so now let's to the sirloin.\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nTo gain some idea of the person who held this language, you must suppose,\r\nmy dear Tresham, a man aged about sixty, in a hunting suit which had once\r\nbeen richly laced, but whose splendour had been tarnished by many a\r\nNovember and December storm. Sir Hildebrand, notwithstanding the\r\nabruptness of his present manner, had, at one period of his life, known\r\ncourts and camps; had held a commission in the army which encamped on\r\nHounslow Heath previous to the Revolution--and, recommended perhaps by\r\nhis religion, had been knighted about the same period by the unfortunate\r\nand ill-advised James II. But the Knight's dreams of further preferment,\r\nif he ever entertained any, had died away at the crisis which drove his\r\npatron from the throne, and since that period he had spent a sequestered\r\nlife upon his native domains. Notwithstanding his rusticity, however, Sir\r\nHildebrand retained much of the exterior of a gentleman, and appeared\r\namong his sons as the remains of a Corinthian pillar, defaced and\r\novergrown with moss and lichen, might have looked, if contrasted with the\r\nrough unhewn masses of upright stones in Stonhenge, or any other\r\nDruidical temple. The sons were, indeed, heavy unadorned blocks as the\r\neye would desire to look upon. Tall, stout, and comely, all and each of\r\nthe five eldest seemed to want alike the Promethean fire of intellect,\r\nand the exterior grace and manner, which, in the polished world,\r\nsometimes supply mental deficiency. Their most valuable moral quality\r\nseemed to be the good-humour and content which was expressed in their\r\nheavy features, and their only pretence to accomplishment was their\r\ndexterity in field sports, for which alone they lived. The strong Gyas,\r\nand the strong Cloanthus, are not less distinguished by the poet, than\r\nthe strong Percival, the strong Thorncliff, the strong John, Richard, and\r\nWilfred Osbaldistones, were by outward appearance.\r\n\r\nBut, as if to indemnify herself for a uniformity so uncommon in her\r\nproductions, Dame Nature had rendered Rashleigh Osbaldistone a striking\r\ncontrast in person and manner, and, as I afterwards learned, in temper\r\nand talents, not only to his brothers, but to most men whom I had\r\nhitherto met with. When Percie, Thornie, and Co. had respectively nodded,\r\ngrinned, and presented their shoulder rather than their hand, as their\r\nfather named them to their new kinsman, Rashleigh stepped forward, and\r\nwelcomed me to Osbaldistone Hall, with the air and manner of a man of the\r\nworld. His appearance was not in itself prepossessing. He was of low\r\nstature, whereas all his brethren seemed to be descendants of Anak; and\r\nwhile they were handsomely formed, Rashleigh, though strong in person,\r\nwas bull-necked and cross-made, and from some early injury in his youth\r\nhad an imperfection in his gait, so much resembling an absolute halt,\r\nthat many alleged that it formed the obstacle to his taking orders; the\r\nChurch of Rome, as is well known, admitting none to the clerical\r\nprofession who labours under any personal deformity. Others, however,\r\nascribed this unsightly defect to a mere awkward habit, and contended\r\nthat it did not amount to a personal disqualification from holy orders.\r\n\r\nThe features of Rashleigh were such, as, having looked upon, we in vain\r\nwish to banish from our memory, to which they recur as objects of painful\r\ncuriosity, although we dwell upon them with a feeling of dislike, and\r\neven of disgust. It was not the actual plainness of his face, taken\r\nseparately from the meaning, which made this strong impression. His\r\nfeatures were, indeed, irregular, but they were by no means vulgar; and\r\nhis keen dark eyes, and shaggy eyebrows, redeemed his face from the\r\ncharge of commonplace ugliness. But there was in these eyes an expression\r\nof art and design, and, on provocation, a ferocity tempered by caution,\r\nwhich nature had made obvious to the most ordinary physiognomist, perhaps\r\nwith the same intention that she has given the rattle to the poisonous\r\nsnake. As if to compensate him for these disadvantages of exterior,\r\nRashleigh Osbaldistone was possessed of a voice the most soft, mellow,\r\nand rich in its tones that I ever heard, and was at no loss for language\r\nof every sort suited to so fine an organ. His first sentence of welcome\r\nwas hardly ended, ere I internally agreed with Miss Vernon, that my new\r\nkinsman would make an instant conquest of a mistress whose ears alone\r\nwere to judge his cause. He was about to place himself beside me at\r\ndinner, but Miss Vernon, who, as the only female in the family, arranged\r\nall such matters according to her own pleasure, contrived that I should\r\nsit betwixt Thorncliff and herself; and it can scarce be doubted that I\r\nfavoured this more advantageous arrangement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have placed honest Thornie\r\nbetwixt Rashleigh and you on purpose. He will be like--\r\n\r\n                    Feather-bed 'twixt castle wall\r\n                    And heavy brunt of cannon ball,\r\n\r\nwhile I, your earliest acquaintance in this intellectual family, ask of\r\nyou how you like us all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very comprehensive question, Miss Vernon, considering how short while\r\nI have been at Osbaldistone Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the philosophy of our family lies on the surface--there are minute\r\nshades distinguishing the individuals, which require the eye of an\r\nintelligent observer; but the species, as naturalists I believe call it,\r\nmay be distinguished and characterized at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy five elder cousins, then, are I presume of pretty nearly the same\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they form a happy compound of sot, gamekeeper, bully, horse-jockey,\r\nand fool; but as they say there cannot be found two leaves on the same\r\ntree exactly alike, so these happy ingredients, being mingled in somewhat\r\nvarious proportions in each individual, make an agreeable variety for\r\nthose who like to study character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a sketch, if you please, Miss Vernon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have them all in a family-piece, at full length--the favour is\r\ntoo easily granted to be refused. Percie, the son and heir, has more of\r\nthe sot than of the gamekeeper, bully, horse-jockey, or fool--My precious\r\nThornie is more of the bully than the sot, gamekeeper, jockey, or\r\nfool--John, who sleeps whole weeks amongst the hills, has most of the\r\ngamekeeper--The jockey is powerful with Dickon, who rides two hundred\r\nmiles by day and night to be bought and sold at a horse-race--And the\r\nfool predominates so much over Wilfred's other qualities, that he may be\r\ntermed a fool positive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA goodly collection, Miss Vernon, and the individual varieties belong to\r\na most interesting species. But is there no room on the canvas for Sir\r\nHildebrand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love my uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d was her reply: \xe2\x80\x9cI owe him some kindness (such it was\r\nmeant for at least), and I will leave you to draw his picture yourself,\r\nwhen you know him better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad there is some forbearance. After\r\nall, who would have looked for such bitter satire from a creature so\r\nyoung, and so exquisitely beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are thinking of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, bending her dark eyes on me, as if\r\nshe meant to pierce through my very soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly was,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, with some embarrassment at the determined\r\nsuddenness of the question, and then, endeavouring to give a\r\ncomplimentary turn to my frank avowal--\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it possible I should think\r\nof anything else, seated as I have the happiness to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled with such an expression of concentrated haughtiness as she\r\nalone could have thrown into her countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cI must inform you at once,\r\nMr. Osbaldistone, that compliments are entirely lost upon me; do not,\r\ntherefore, throw away your pretty sayings--they serve fine gentlemen who\r\ntravel in the country, instead of the toys, beads, and bracelets, which\r\nnavigators carry to propitiate the savage inhabitants of newly-discovered\r\nlands. Do not exhaust your stock in trade;--you will find natives in\r\nNorthumberland to whom your fine things will recommend you--on me they\r\nwould be utterly thrown away, for I happen to know their real value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was silenced and confounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remind me at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, resuming her lively\r\nand indifferent manner, \xe2\x80\x9cof the fairy tale, where the man finds all the\r\nmoney which he had carried to market suddenly changed into pieces of\r\nslate. I have cried down and ruined your whole stock of complimentary\r\ndiscourse by one unlucky observation. But come, never mind it--You are\r\nbelied, Mr. Osbaldistone, unless you have much better conversation than\r\nthese _fadeurs,_ which every gentleman with a toupet thinks himself\r\nobliged to recite to an unfortunate girl, merely because she is dressed\r\nin silk and gauze, while he wears superfine cloth with embroidery. Your\r\nnatural paces, as any of my five cousins might say, are far preferable to\r\nyour complimentary amble. Endeavour to forget my unlucky sex; call me Tom\r\nVernon, if you have a mind, but speak to me as you would to a friend and\r\ncompanion; you have no idea how much I shall like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a bribe indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Vernon, holding up her finger; \xe2\x80\x9cI told you I would\r\nnot bear the shadow of a compliment. And now, when you have pledged my\r\nuncle, who threatens you with what he calls a brimmer, I will tell you\r\nwhat you think of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bumper being pledged by me, as a dutiful nephew, and some other\r\ngeneral intercourse of the table having taken place, the continued and\r\nbusiness-like clang of knives and forks, and the devotion of cousin\r\nThorncliff on my right hand, and cousin Dickon, who sate on Miss Vernon's\r\nleft, to the huge quantities of meat with which they heaped their plates,\r\nmade them serve as two occasional partitions, separating us from the rest\r\nof the company, and leaving us to our _tete-a-tete._ \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me leave to ask you frankly, Miss Vernon, what you suppose I am\r\nthinking of you!--I could tell you what I really _do_ think, but you have\r\ninterdicted praise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not want your assistance. I am conjuror enough to tell your\r\nthoughts without it. You need not open the casement of your bosom; I see\r\nthrough it. You think me a strange bold girl, half coquette, half romp;\r\ndesirous of attracting attention by the freedom of her manners and\r\nloudness of her conversation, because she is ignorant of what the\r\nSpectator calls the softer graces of the sex; and perhaps you think I\r\nhave some particular plan of storming you into admiration. I should be\r\nsorry to shock your self-opinion, but you were never more mistaken. All\r\nthe confidence I have reposed in you, I would have given as readily to\r\nyour father, if I thought he could have understood me. I am in this happy\r\nfamily as much secluded from intelligent listeners as Sancho in the\r\nSierra Morena, and when opportunity offers, I must speak or die. I assure\r\nyou I would not have told you a word of all this curious intelligence,\r\nhad I cared a pin who knew it or knew it not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very cruel in you, Miss Vernon, to take away all particular marks\r\nof favour from your communications, but I must receive them on your own\r\nterms.--You have not included Mr. Rashleigh Osbaldistone in your domestic\r\nsketches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrunk, I thought, at this remark, and hastily answered, in a much\r\nlower tone, \xe2\x80\x9cNot a word of Rashleigh! His ears are so acute when his\r\nselfishness is interested, that the sounds would reach him even through\r\nthe mass of Thorncliff's person, stuffed as it is with beef,\r\nvenison-pasty, and pudding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut peeping past the living screen which divides us,\r\nbefore I put the question, I perceived that Mr. Rashleigh's chair was\r\nempty--he has left the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not have you be too sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Vernon replied. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my\r\nadvice, and when you speak of Rashleigh, get up to the top of\r\nOtterscope-hill, where you can see for twenty miles round you in every\r\ndirection--stand on the very peak, and speak in whispers; and, after all,\r\ndon't be too sure that the bird of the air will not carry the matter,\r\nRashleigh has been my tutor for four years; we are mutually tired of each\r\nother, and we shall heartily rejoice at our approaching separation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Rashleigh leaves Osbaldistone Hall, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in a few days;--did you not know that?--your father must keep his\r\nresolutions much more secret than Sir Hildebrand. Why, when my uncle was\r\ninformed that you were to be his guest for some time, and that your\r\nfather desired to have one of his hopeful sons to fill up the lucrative\r\nsituation in his counting-house which was vacant by your obstinacy, Mr.\r\nFrancis, the good knight held a _cour ple'nie're_ of all his family,\r\nincluding the butler, housekeeper, and gamekeeper. This reverend assembly\r\nof the peers and household officers of Osbaldistone Hall was not\r\nconvoked, as you may suppose, to elect your substitute, because, as\r\nRashleigh alone possessed more arithmetic than was necessary to calculate\r\nthe odds on a fighting cock, none but he could be supposed qualified for\r\nthe situation. But some solemn sanction was necessary for transforming\r\nRashleigh's destination from starving as a Catholic priest to thriving as\r\na wealthy banker; and it was not without some reluctance that the\r\nacquiescence of the assembly was obtained to such an act of degradation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can conceive the scruples--but how were they got over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the general wish, I believe, to get Rashleigh out of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Miss Vernon. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough youngest of the family, he has somehow or\r\nother got the entire management of all the others; and every one is\r\nsensible of the subjection, though they cannot shake it off. If any one\r\nopposes him, he is sure to rue having done so before the year goes about;\r\nand if you do him a very important service, you may rue it still more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that rate,\xe2\x80\x9d answered I, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI should look about me; for I have\r\nbeen the cause, however unintentionally, of his change of situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and whether he regards it as an advantage or disadvantage, he will\r\nowe you a grudge for it--But here comes cheese, radishes, and a bumper to\r\nchurch and king, the hint for chaplains and ladies to disappear; and I,\r\nthe sole representative of womanhood at Osbaldistone Hall, retreat, as in\r\nduty bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe vanished as she spoke, leaving me in astonishment at the mingled\r\ncharacter of shrewdness, audacity, and frankness, which her conversation\r\ndisplayed. I despair conveying to you the least idea of her manner,\r\nalthough I have, as nearly as I can remember, imitated her language. In\r\nfact, there was a mixture of untaught simplicity, as well as native\r\nshrewdness and haughty boldness, in her manner, and all were modified and\r\nrecommended by the play of the most beautiful features I had ever beheld.\r\nIt is not to be thought that, however strange and uncommon I might think\r\nher liberal and unreserved communications, a young man of two-and-twenty\r\nwas likely to be severely critical on a beautiful girl of eighteen, for\r\nnot observing a proper distance towards him. On the contrary, I was\r\nequally diverted and flattered by Miss Vernon's confidence, and that\r\nnotwithstanding her declaration of its being conferred on me solely\r\nbecause I was the first auditor who occurred, of intelligence enough to\r\ncomprehend it. With the presumption of my age, certainly not diminished\r\nby my residence in France, I imagined that well-formed features, and a\r\nhandsome person, both which I conceived myself to possess, were not\r\nunsuitable qualifications for the confidant of a young beauty. My vanity\r\nthus enlisted in Miss Vernon's behalf, I was far from judging her with\r\nseverity, merely for a frankness which I supposed was in some degree\r\njustified by my own personal merit; and the feelings of partiality, which\r\nher beauty, and the singularity of her situation, were of themselves\r\ncalculated to excite, were enhanced by my opinion of her penetration and\r\njudgment in her choice of a friend.\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Vernon quitted the apartment, the bottle circulated, or rather\r\nflew, around the table in unceasing revolution. My foreign education had\r\ngiven me a distaste to intemperance, then and yet too common a vice among\r\nmy countrymen. The conversation which seasoned such orgies was as little\r\nto my taste, and if anything could render it more disgusting, it was the\r\nrelationship of the company. I therefore seized a lucky opportunity, and\r\nmade my escape through a side door, leading I knew not whither, rather\r\nthan endure any longer the sight of father and sons practising the same\r\ndegrading intemperance, and holding the same coarse and disgusting\r\nconversation. I was pursued, of course, as I had expected, to be\r\nreclaimed by force, as a deserter from the shrine of Bacchus. When I\r\nheard the whoop and hollo, and the tramp of the heavy boots of my\r\npursuers on the winding stair which I was descending, I plainly foresaw I\r\nshould be overtaken unless I could get into the open air. I therefore\r\nthrew open a casement in the staircase, which looked into an\r\nold-fashioned garden, and as the height did not exceed six feet, I jumped\r\nout without hesitation, and soon heard far behind the \xe2\x80\x9chey whoop! stole\r\naway! stole away!\xe2\x80\x9d of my baffled pursuers. I ran down one alley, walked\r\nfast up another; and then, conceiving myself out of all danger of\r\npursuit, I slackened my pace into a quiet stroll, enjoying the cool air\r\nwhich the heat of the wine I had been obliged to swallow, as well as that\r\nof my rapid retreat, rendered doubly grateful.\r\n\r\nAs I sauntered on, I found the gardener hard at his evening employment,\r\nand saluted him, as I paused to look at his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood even, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGude e'en--gude e'en t'ye,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man, without looking up, and in\r\na tone which at once indicated his northern extraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine weather for your work, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's no that muckle to be compleened o',\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man, with that\r\nlimited degree of praise which gardeners and farmers usually bestow on\r\nthe very best weather. Then raising his head, as if to see who spoke to\r\nhim, he touched his Scotch bonnet with an air of respect, as he observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, gude safe us!--it's a sight for sair een, to see a gold-laced\r\njeistiecor in the Ha'garden sae late at e'en.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gold-laced what, my good friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, a jeistiecor*--that's a jacket like your ain, there. They\r\n\r\n* Perhaps from the French _Juste-au-corps._\r\n\r\nhae other things to do wi' them up yonder--unbuttoning them to make room\r\nfor the beef and the bag-puddings, and the claret-wine, nae doubt--that's\r\nthe ordinary for evening lecture on this side the border.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no such plenty of good cheer in your country, my good friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cas to tempt you to sit so late at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, sir, ye ken little about Scotland; it's no for want of gude\r\nvivers--the best of fish, flesh, and fowl hae we, by sybos, ingans,\r\nturneeps, and other garden fruit. But we hae mense and discretion, and\r\nare moderate of our mouths;--but here, frae the kitchen to the ha', it's\r\nfill and fetch mair, frae the tae end of the four-and-twenty till the\r\ntother. Even their fast days--they ca' it fasting when they hae the best\r\no' sea-fish frae Hartlepool and Sunderland by land carriage, forbye\r\ntrouts, grilses, salmon, and a' the lave o't, and so they make their very\r\nfasting a kind of luxury and abomination; and then the awfu' masses and\r\nmatins of the puir deceived souls--But I shouldna speak about them, for\r\nyour honour will be a Roman, I'se warrant, like the lave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, my friend; I was bred an English presbyterian, or dissenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right hand of fellowship to your honour, then,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the gardener,\r\nwith as much alacrity as his hard features were capable of expressing,\r\nand, as if to show that his good-will did not rest on words, he plucked\r\nforth a huge horn snuff-box, or mull, as he called it, and proffered a\r\npinch with a most fraternal grin.\r\n\r\nHaving accepted his courtesy, I asked him if he had been long a domestic\r\nat Osbaldistone Hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been fighting with wild beasts at Ephesus,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking\r\ntowards the building, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the best part of these four-and-twenty years,\r\nas sure as my name's Andrew Fairservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my excellent friend, Andrew Fairservice, if your religion and your\r\ntemperance are so much offended by Roman rituals and southern\r\nhospitality, it seems to me that you must have been putting yourself to\r\nan unnecessary penance all this while, and that you might have found a\r\nservice where they eat less, and are more orthodox in their worship. I\r\ndare say it cannot be want of skill which prevented your being placed\r\nmore to your satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt disna become me to speak to the point of my qualifications,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAndrew, looking round him with great complacency; \xe2\x80\x9cbut nae doubt I should\r\nunderstand my trade of horticulture, seeing I was bred in the parish of\r\nDreepdaily, where they raise lang-kale under glass, and force the early\r\nnettles for their spring kale. And, to speak truth, I hae been flitting\r\nevery term these four-and-twenty years; but when the time comes, there's\r\naye something to saw that I would like to see sawn,--or something to maw\r\nthat I would like to see mawn,--or something to ripe that I would like to\r\nsee ripen,--and sae I e'en daiker on wi' the family frae year's end to\r\nyear's end. And I wad say for certain, that I am gaun to quit at\r\nCannlemas, only I was just as positive on it twenty years syne, and I\r\nfind mysell still turning up the mouls here, for a' that. Forbye that, to\r\ntell your honour the evendown truth, there's nae better place ever\r\noffered to Andrew. But if your honour wad wush me to ony place where I\r\nwad hear pure doctrine, and hae a free cow's grass, and a cot, and a\r\nyard, and mair than ten punds of annual fee, and where there's nae leddy\r\nabout the town to count the apples, I'se hold mysell muckle indebted\r\nt'ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, Andrew! I perceive you'll lose no preferment for want of asking\r\npatronage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna see what for I should,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cit's no a generation to\r\nwait till ane's worth's discovered, I trow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are no friend, I observe, to the ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, by my troth, I keep up the first gardener's quarrel to them. They're\r\nfasheous bargains--aye crying for apricocks, pears, plums, and apples,\r\nsummer and winter, without distinction o' seasons; but we hae nae slices\r\no' the spare rib here, be praised for't! except auld Martha, and she's\r\nweel eneugh pleased wi' the freedom o' the berry-bushes to her sister's\r\nweans, when they come to drink tea in a holiday in the housekeeper's\r\nroom, and wi' a wheen codlings now and then for her ain private supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget your young mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mistress do I forget?--whae's that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour young mistress, Miss Vernon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the lassie Vernon?--She's nae mistress o' mine, man. I wish she\r\nwas her ain mistress; and I wish she mayna be some other body's mistress\r\nor it's lang--She's a wild slip that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, more interested than I cared to own to myself, or to\r\nshow to the fellow--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, Andrew, you know all the secrets of this\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I ken them, I can keep them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cthey winna work in my\r\nwame like harm in a barrel, I'se warrant ye. Miss Die is--but it's\r\nneither beef nor brose o' mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began to dig with a great semblance of assiduity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Miss Vernon, Andrew? I am a friend of the family, and should\r\nlike to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther than a gude ane, I'm fearing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, closing one eye hard,\r\nand shaking his head with a grave and mysterious look--\xe2\x80\x9csomething\r\nglee'd--your honour understands me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cAndrew; but I should like to hear you\r\nexplain yourself;\xe2\x80\x9d and therewithal I slipped a crown-piece into Andrew's\r\nhorn-hard hand. The touch of the silver made him grin a ghastly smile, as\r\nhe nodded slowly, and thrust it into his breeches pocket; and then, like\r\na man who well understood that there was value to be returned, stood up,\r\nand rested his arms on his spade, with his features composed into the\r\nmost important gravity, as for some serious communication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe maun ken, then, young gentleman, since it imports you to know, that\r\nMiss Vernon is\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nHere breaking off, he sucked in both his cheeks, till his lantern jaws\r\nand long chin assumed the appearance of a pair of nut-crackers; winked\r\nhard once more, frowned, shook his head, and seemed to think his\r\nphysiognomy had completed the information which his tongue had not fully\r\ntold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d said I--\xe2\x80\x9cso young, so beautiful, so early lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroth ye may say sae--she's in a manner lost, body and saul; forby being\r\na Papist, I'se uphaud her for\xe2\x80\x9d--and his northern caution prevailed, and\r\nhe was again silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said I sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cI insist on knowing the plain meaning\r\nof all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn, just for the bitterest Jacobite in the haill shire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw! a Jacobite?--is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrew looked at me with some astonishment, at hearing his information\r\ntreated so lightly; and then muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cAweel, it's the warst thing I\r\nken aboot the lassie, howsoe'er,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed his spade, like the king of\r\nthe Vandals, in Marmontel's late novel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n    _Bardolph._--The sheriff, with a monstrous watch, is at the door.\r\n                          Henry IV. _First Part._\r\n\r\nI found out with some difficulty the apartment which was destined for my\r\naccommodation; and having secured myself the necessary good-will and\r\nattention from my uncle's domestics, by using the means they were most\r\ncapable of comprehending, I secluded myself there for the remainder of\r\nthe evening, conjecturing, from the fair way in which I had left my new\r\nrelatives, as well as from the distant noise which continued to echo from\r\nthe stone-hall (as their banqueting-room was called), that they were not\r\nlikely to be fitting company for a sober man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange\r\nfamily?\xe2\x80\x9d was my first and most natural reflection. My uncle, it was\r\nplain, received me as one who was to make some stay with him, and his\r\nrude hospitality rendered him as indifferent as King Hal to the number of\r\nthose who fed at his cost. But it was plain my presence or absence would\r\nbe of as little importance in his eyes as that of one of his blue-coated\r\nserving-men. My cousins were mere cubs, in whose company I might, if I\r\nliked it, unlearn whatever decent manners, or elegant accomplishments, I\r\nhad acquired, but where I could attain no information beyond what\r\nregarded worming dogs, rowelling horses, and following foxes. I could\r\nonly imagine one reason, which was probably the true one. My father\r\nconsidered the life which was led at Osbaldistone Hall as the natural and\r\ninevitable pursuits of all country gentlemen, and he was desirous, by\r\ngiving me an opportunity of seeing that with which he knew I should be\r\ndisgusted, to reconcile me, if possible, to take an active share in his\r\nown business. In the meantime, he would take Rashleigh Osbaldistone into\r\nthe counting-house. But he had an hundred modes of providing for him, and\r\nthat advantageously, whenever he chose to get rid of him. So that,\r\nalthough I did feel a certain qualm of conscience at having been the\r\nmeans of introducing Rashleigh, being such as he was described by Miss\r\nVernon, into my father's business--perhaps into his confidence--I subdued\r\nit by the reflection that my father was complete master of his own\r\naffairs--a man not to be imposed upon, or influenced by any one--and that\r\nall I knew to the young gentleman's prejudice was through the medium of a\r\nsingular and giddy girl, whose communications were made with an\r\ninjudicious frankness, which might warrant me in supposing her\r\nconclusions had been hastily or inaccurately formed. Then my mind\r\nnaturally turned to Miss Vernon herself; her extreme beauty; her very\r\npeculiar situation, relying solely upon her reflections, and her own\r\nspirit, for guidance and protection; and her whole character offering\r\nthat variety and spirit which piques our curiosity, and engages our\r\nattention in spite of ourselves. I had sense enough to consider the\r\nneighbourhood of this singular young lady, and the chance of our being\r\nthrown into very close and frequent intercourse, as adding to the\r\ndangers, while it relieved the dulness, of Osbaldistone Hall; but I could\r\nnot, with the fullest exertion of my prudence, prevail upon myself to\r\nregret excessively this new and particular hazard to which I was to be\r\nexposed. This scruple I also settled as young men settle most\r\ndifficulties of the kind--I would be very cautious, always on my guard,\r\nconsider Miss Vernon rather as a companion than an intimate; and all\r\nwould do well enough. With these reflections I fell asleep, Miss Vernon,\r\nof course, forming the last subject of my contemplation.\r\n\r\nWhether I dreamed of her or not, I cannot satisfy you, for I was tired\r\nand slept soundly. But she was the first person I thought of in the\r\nmorning, when waked at dawn by the cheerful notes of the hunting horn. To\r\nstart up, and direct my horse to be saddled, was my first movement; and\r\nin a few minutes I was in the court-yard, where men, dogs, and horses,\r\nwere in full preparation. My uncle, who, perhaps, was not entitled to\r\nexpect a very alert sportsman in his nephew, bred as he had been in\r\nforeign parts, seemed rather surprised to see me, and I thought his\r\nmorning salutation wanted something of the hearty and hospitable tone\r\nwhich distinguished his first welcome. \xe2\x80\x9cArt there, lad?--ay, youth's aye\r\nrathe--but look to thysell--mind the old song, lad--\r\n\r\n             He that gallops his horse on Blackstone edge\r\n                      May chance to catch a fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI believe there are few young men, and those very sturdy moralists, who\r\nwould not rather be taxed with some moral peccadillo than with want of\r\nknowledge in horsemanship. As I was by no means deficient either in skill\r\nor courage, I resented my uncle's insinuation accordingly, and assured\r\nhim he would find me up with the hounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubtna, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply; \xe2\x80\x9cthou'rt a rank rider, I'se warrant\r\nthee--but take heed. Thy father sent thee here to me to be bitted, and I\r\ndoubt I must ride thee on the curb, or we'll hae some one to ride thee on\r\nthe halter, if I takena the better heed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs this speech was totally unintelligible to me--as, besides, it did not\r\nseem to be delivered for my use, or benefit, but was spoken as it were\r\naside, and as if expressing aloud something which was passing through the\r\nmind of my much-honoured uncle, I concluded it must either refer to my\r\ndesertion of the bottle on the preceding evening, or that my uncle's\r\nmorning hours being a little discomposed by the revels of the night\r\nbefore, his temper had suffered in proportion. I only made the passing\r\nreflection, that if he played the ungracious landlord, I would remain the\r\nshorter while his guest, and then hastened to salute Miss Vernon, who\r\nadvanced cordially to meet me. Some show of greeting also passed between\r\nmy cousins and me; but as I saw them maliciously bent upon criticising my\r\ndress and accoutrements, from the cap to the stirrup-irons, and sneering\r\nat whatever had a new or foreign appearance, I exempted myself from the\r\ntask of paying them much attention; and assuming, in requital of their\r\ngrins and whispers, an air of the utmost indifference and contempt, I\r\nattached myself to Miss Vernon, as the only person in the party whom I\r\ncould regard as a suitable companion. By her side, therefore, we sallied\r\nforth to the destined cover, which was a dingle or copse on the side of\r\nan extensive common. As we rode thither, I observed to Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I did\r\nnot see my cousin Rashleigh in the field;\xe2\x80\x9d to which she replied,--\xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nno--he's a mighty hunter, but it's after the fashion of Nimrod, and his\r\ngame is man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dogs now brushed into the cover, with the appropriate encouragement\r\nfrom the hunters--all was business, bustle, and activity. My cousins were\r\nsoon too much interested in the business of the morning to take any\r\nfurther notice of me, unless that I overheard Dickon the horse-jockey\r\nwhisper to Wilfred the fool--\xe2\x80\x9cLook thou, an our French cousin be nat off\r\na' first burst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Wilfred answered, \xe2\x80\x9cLike enow, for he has a queer outlandish\r\nbinding on's castor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThorncliff, however, who in his rude way seemed not absolutely insensible\r\nto the beauty of his kinswoman, appeared determined to keep us company\r\nmore closely than his brothers,--perhaps to watch what passed betwixt\r\nMiss Vernon and me--perhaps to enjoy my expected mishaps in the chase. In\r\nthe last particular he was disappointed. After beating in vain for the\r\ngreater part of the morning, a fox was at length found, who led us a\r\nchase of two hours, in the course of which, notwithstanding the\r\nill-omened French binding upon my hat, I sustained my character as a\r\nhorseman to the admiration of my uncle and Miss Vernon, and the secret\r\ndisappointment of those who expected me to disgrace it. Reynard, however,\r\nproved too wily for his pursuers, and the hounds were at fault. I could\r\nat this time observe in Miss Vernon's manner an impatience of the close\r\nattendance which we received from Thorncliff Osbaldistone; and, as that\r\nactive-spirited young lady never hesitated at taking the readiest means\r\nto gratify any wish of the moment, she said to him, in a tone of\r\nreproach--\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, Thornie, what keeps you dangling at my horse's\r\ncrupper all this morning, when you know the earths above Woolverton-mill\r\nare not stopt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know no such an thing then, Miss Die, for the miller swore himself as\r\nblack as night, that he stopt them at twelve o'clock midnight that was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO fie upon you, Thornie! would you trust to a miller's word?--and these\r\nearths, too, where we lost the fox three times this season! and you on\r\nyour grey mare, that can gallop there and back in ten minutes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Die, I'se go to Woolverton then, and if the earths are not\r\nstopt, I'se raddle Dick the miller's bones for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo, my dear Thornie; horsewhip the rascal to purpose--via--fly away, and\r\nabout it;\xe2\x80\x9d--Thorncliff went off at the gallop--\xe2\x80\x9cor get horsewhipt\r\nyourself, which will serve my purpose just as well.--I must teach them\r\nall discipline and obedience to the word of command. I am raising a\r\nregiment, you must know. Thornie shall be my sergeant-major, Dickon my\r\nriding-master, and Wilfred, with his deep dub-a-dub tones, that speak but\r\nthree syllables at a time, my kettle-drummer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Rashleigh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRashleigh shall be my scout-master.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you find no employment\r\nfor me, most lovely colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have the choice of being pay-master, or plunder-master, to the\r\ncorps. But see how the dogs puzzle about there. Come, Mr. Frank, the\r\nscent's cold; they won't recover it there this while; follow me, I have a\r\nview to show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, she cantered up to the top of a gentle hill, commanding an\r\nextensive prospect. Casting her eyes around, to see that no one was near\r\nus, she drew up her horse beneath a few birch-trees, which screened us\r\nfrom the rest of the hunting-field--\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see yon peaked, brown, heathy\r\nhill, having something like a whitish speck upon the side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerminating that long ridge of broken moorish uplands?--I see it\r\ndistinctly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat whitish speck is a rock called Hawkesmore-crag, and Hawkesmore-crag\r\nis in Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! I did not think we had been so near Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so, I assure you, and your horse will carry you there in two\r\nhours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall hardly give him the trouble; why, the distance must be eighteen\r\nmiles as the crow flies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may have my mare, if you think her less blown--I say, that in two\r\nhours you may be in Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say, that I have so little desire to be there, that if my horse's\r\nhead were over the Border, I would not give his tail the trouble of\r\nfollowing. What should I do in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvide for your safety, if I must speak plainly. Do you understand me\r\nnow, Mr. Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a whit; you are more and more oracular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, on my word, you either mistrust me most unjustly, and are a better\r\ndissembler than Rashleigh Osbaldistone himself, or you know nothing of\r\nwhat is imputed to you; and then no wonder you stare at me in that grave\r\nmanner, which I can scarce see without laughing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word of honour, Miss Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with an impatient feeling\r\nof her childish disposition to mirth, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not the most distant\r\nconception of what you mean. I am happy to afford you any subject of\r\namusement, but I am quite ignorant in what it consists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, there's no sound jest after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, composing\r\nherself; \xe2\x80\x9conly one looks so very ridiculous when he is fairly perplexed.\r\nBut the matter is serious enough. Do you know one Moray, or Morris, or\r\nsome such name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I can at present recollect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink a moment. Did you not lately travel with somebody of such a name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only man with whom I travelled for any length of time was a fellow\r\nwhose soul seemed to lie in his portmanteau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was like the soul of the licentiate Pedro Garcias, which lay\r\namong the ducats in his leathern purse. That man has been robbed, and he\r\nhas lodged an information against you, as connected with the violence\r\ndone to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jest, Miss Vernon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not, I assure you--the thing is an absolute fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with strong indignation, which I did not attempt to\r\nsuppress, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you suppose me capable of meriting such a charge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would call me out for it, I suppose, had I the advantage of being a\r\nman--You may do so as it is, if you like it--I can shoot flying, as well\r\nas leap a five-barred gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are colonel of a regiment of horse besides,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, reflecting\r\nhow idle it was to be angry with her--\xe2\x80\x9cBut do explain the present jest to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no jest whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are accused of robbing this\r\nman, and my uncle believes it as well as I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour, I am greatly obliged to my friends for their good\r\nopinion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow do not, if you can help it, snort, and stare, and snuff the wind,\r\nand look so exceedingly like a startled horse--There's no such offence as\r\nyou suppose--you are not charged with any petty larceny or vulgar\r\nfelony--by no means. This fellow was carrying money from Government, both\r\nspecie and bills, to pay the troops in the north; and it is said he has\r\nbeen also robbed of some despatches of great consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it is high treason, then, and not simple robbery, of which I am\r\naccused!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly--which, you know, has been in all ages accounted the crime of\r\na gentleman. You will find plenty in this country, and one not far from\r\nyour elbow, who think it a merit to distress the Hanoverian government by\r\nevery means possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither my politics nor my morals, Miss Vernon, are of a description so\r\naccommodating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really begin to believe that you are a Presbyterian and Hanoverian in\r\ngood earnest. But what do you propose to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstantly to refute this atrocious calumny.--Before whom,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nthis extraordinary accusation laid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore old Squire Inglewood, who had sufficient unwillingness to receive\r\nit. He sent tidings to my uncle, I suppose, that he might smuggle you\r\naway into Scotland, out of reach of the warrant. But my uncle is sensible\r\nthat his religion and old predilections render him obnoxious to\r\nGovernment, and that, were he caught playing booty, he would be disarmed,\r\nand probably dismounted (which would be the worse evil of the two), as a\r\nJacobite, papist, and suspected person.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* On occasions of public alarm, in the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the horses of the Catholics were often seized upon, as they were\r\nalways supposed to be on the eve of rising in rebellion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can conceive that, sooner than lose his hunters, he would give up his\r\nnephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis nephew, nieces, sons--daughters, if he had them, and whole\r\ngeneration,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana;--\xe2\x80\x9ctherefore trust not to him, even for a single\r\nmoment, but make the best of your way before they can serve the warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I shall certainly do; but it shall be to the house of this Squire\r\nInglewood--Which way does it lie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout five miles off, in the low ground, behind yonder plantations--you\r\nmay see the tower of the clock-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be there in a few minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, putting my horse in motion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will go with you, and show you the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, putting her\r\npalfrey also to the trot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think of it, Miss Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not--permit me the\r\nfreedom of a friend--it is not proper, scarcely even delicate, in you to\r\ngo with me on such an errand as I am now upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand your meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, a slight blush crossing\r\nher haughty brow;--\xe2\x80\x9cit is plainly spoken;\xe2\x80\x9d and after a moment's pause she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cand I believe kindly meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed, Miss Vernon. Can you think me insensible of the interest\r\nyou show me, or ungrateful for it?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with even more earnestness\r\nthan I could have wished to express. \xe2\x80\x9cYours is meant for true kindness,\r\nshown best at the hour of need. But I must not, for your own sake--for\r\nthe chance of misconstruction--suffer you to pursue the dictates of your\r\ngenerosity; this is so public an occasion--it is almost like venturing\r\ninto an open court of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it were not almost, but altogether entering into an open court of\r\njustice, do you think I would not go there if I thought it right, and\r\nwished to protect a friend? You have no one to stand by you--you are a\r\nstranger; and here, in the outskirts of the kingdom, country justices do\r\nodd things. My uncle has no desire to embroil himself in your affair;\r\nRashleigh is absent, and were he here, there is no knowing which side he\r\nmight take; the rest are all more stupid and brutal one than another. I\r\nwill go with you, and I do not fear being able to serve you. I am no fine\r\nlady, to be terrified to death with law-books, hard words, or big wigs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear Miss Vernon\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear Mr. Francis, be patient and quiet, and let me take my own\r\nway; for when I take the bit between my teeth, there is no bridle will\r\nstop me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlattered with the interest so lovely a creature seemed to take in my\r\nfate, yet vexed at the ridiculous appearance I should make, by carrying a\r\ngirl of eighteen along with me as an advocate, and seriously concerned\r\nfor the misconstruction to which her motives might be exposed, I\r\nendeavoured to combat her resolution to accompany me to Squire\r\nInglewood's. The self-willed girl told me roundly, that my dissuasions\r\nwere absolutely in vain; that she was a true Vernon, whom no\r\nconsideration, not even that of being able to do but little to assist\r\nhim, should induce to abandon a friend in distress; and that all I could\r\nsay on the subject might be very well for pretty, well-educated,\r\nwell-behaved misses from a town boarding-school, but did not apply to\r\nher, who was accustomed to mind nobody's opinion but her own.\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke thus, we were advancing hastily towards Inglewood Place,\r\nwhile, as if to divert me from the task of further remonstrance, she drew\r\na ludicrous picture of the magistrate and his clerk.--Inglewood\r\nwas--according to her description--a white-washed Jacobite; that is, one\r\nwho, having been long a non-juror, like most of the other gentlemen of the\r\ncountry, had lately qualified himself to act as a justice, by taking the\r\noaths to Government. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had done so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cin compliance with the\r\nurgent request of most of his brother squires, who saw, with regret, that\r\nthe palladium of silvan sport, the game-laws, were likely to fall into\r\ndisuse for want of a magistrate who would enforce them; the nearest\r\nacting justice being the Mayor of Newcastle, and he, as being rather\r\ninclined to the consumption of the game when properly dressed, than to\r\nits preservation when alive, was more partial, of course, to the cause of\r\nthe poacher than of the sportsman. Resolving, therefore, that it was\r\nexpedient some one of their number should sacrifice the scruples of\r\nJacobitical loyalty to the good of the community, the Northumbrian\r\ncountry gentlemen imposed the duty on Inglewood, who, being very inert in\r\nmost of his feelings and sentiments, might, they thought, comply with any\r\npolitical creed without much repugnance. Having thus procured the body of\r\njustice, they proceeded,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cto attach to it a\r\nclerk, by way of soul, to direct and animate its movements. Accordingly\r\nthey got a sharp Newcastle attorney, called Jobson, who, to vary my\r\nmetaphor, finds it a good thing enough to retail justice at the sign of\r\nSquire Inglewood, and, as his own emoluments depend on the quantity of\r\nbusiness which he transacts, he hooks in his principal for a great deal\r\nmore employment in the justice line than the honest squire had ever\r\nbargained for; so that no apple-wife within the circuit of ten miles can\r\nsettle her account with a costermonger without an audience of the\r\nreluctant Justice and his alert clerk, Mr. Joseph Jobson. But the most\r\nridiculous scenes occur when affairs come before him, like our business\r\nof to-day, having any colouring of politics. Mr. Joseph Jobson (for\r\nwhich, no doubt, he has his own very sufficient reasons) is a prodigious\r\nzealot for the Protestant religion, and a great friend to the present\r\nestablishment in church and state. Now, his principal, retaining a sort\r\nof instinctive attachment to the opinions which he professed openly until\r\nhe relaxed his political creed with the patriotic view of enforcing the\r\nlaw against unauthorized destroyers of black-game, grouse, partridges,\r\nand hares, is peculiarly embarrassed when the zeal of his assistant\r\ninvolves him in judicial proceedings connected with his earlier faith;\r\nand, instead of seconding his zeal, he seldom fails to oppose to it a\r\ndouble dose of indolence and lack of exertion. And this inactivity does\r\nnot by any means arise from actual stupidity. On the contrary, for one\r\nwhose principal delight is in eating and drinking, he is an alert,\r\njoyous, and lively old soul, which makes his assumed dulness the more\r\ndiverting. So you may see Jobson on such occasions, like a bit of a\r\nbroken down blood-tit condemned to drag an overloaded cart, puffing,\r\nstrutting, and spluttering, to get the Justice put in motion, while,\r\nthough the wheels groan, creak, and revolve slowly, the great and\r\npreponderating weight of the vehicle fairly frustrates the efforts of the\r\nwilling quadruped, and prevents its being brought into a state of actual\r\nprogression. Nay more, the unfortunate pony, I understand, has been heard\r\nto complain that this same car of justice, which he finds it so hard to\r\nput in motion on some occasions, can on others run fast enough down hill\r\nof its own accord, dragging his reluctant self backwards along with it,\r\nwhen anything can be done of service to Squire Inglewood's quondam\r\nfriends. And then Mr. Jobson talks big about reporting his principal to\r\nthe Secretary of State for the Home Department, if it were not for his\r\nparticular regard and friendship for Mr. Inglewood and his family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Miss Vernon concluded this whimsical description, we found ourselves\r\nin front of Inglewood Place, a handsome, though old-fashioned building,\r\nwhich showed the consequence of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the Lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to flatter ye,\r\n                   You have as good and fair a battery\r\n                As heart could wish, and need not shame\r\n                   The proudest man alive to claim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                               Butler.\r\n\r\nOur horses were taken by a servant in Sir Hildebrand's livery, whom we\r\nfound in the court-yard, and we entered the house. In the entrance-hall I\r\nwas somewhat surprised, and my fair companion still more so, when we met\r\nRashleigh Osbaldistone, who could not help showing equal wonder at our\r\nrencontre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, without giving him time to ask any\r\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have heard of Mr. Francis Osbaldistone's affair, and you\r\nhave been talking to the Justice about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, composedly--\xe2\x80\x9cit has been my business here.--\r\nI have been endeavouring,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a bow to me, \xe2\x80\x9cto render my\r\ncousin what service I can. But I am sorry to meet him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a friend and relation, Mr. Osbaldistone, you ought to have been sorry\r\nto have met me anywhere else, at a time when the charge of my reputation\r\nrequired me to be on this spot as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; but judging from what my father said, I should have supposed a\r\nshort retreat into Scotland--just till matters should be smoothed over in\r\na quiet way\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nI answered with warmth, \xe2\x80\x9cThat I had no prudential measures to observe,\r\nand desired to have nothing smoothed over;--on the contrary, I was come\r\nto inquire into a rascally calumny, which I was determined to probe to\r\nthe bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis Osbaldistone is an innocent man, Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nVernon, \xe2\x80\x9cand he demands an investigation of the charge against him, and I\r\nintend to support him in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do, my pretty cousin?--I should think, now, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone\r\nwas likely to be as effectually, and rather more delicately, supported by\r\nmy presence than by yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly; but two heads are better than one, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially such a head as yours, my pretty Die,\xe2\x80\x9d advancing and taking\r\nher hand with a familiar fondness, which made me think him fifty times\r\nuglier than nature had made him. She led him, however, a few steps aside;\r\nthey conversed in an under voice, and she appeared to insist upon some\r\nrequest which he was unwilling or unable to comply with. I never saw so\r\nstrong a contrast betwixt the expression of two faces. Miss Vernon's,\r\nfrom being earnest, became angry; her eyes and cheeks became more\r\nanimated, her colour mounted, she clenched her little hand, and stamping\r\non the ground with her tiny foot, seemed to listen with a mixture of\r\ncontempt and indignation to the apologies, which, from his look of civil\r\ndeference, his composed and respectful smile, his body rather drawing\r\nback than advanced, and other signs of look and person, I concluded him\r\nto be pouring out at her feet. At length she flung away from him, with \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_will_ have it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not in my power--there is no possibility of it.--Would you think\r\nit, Mr. Osbaldistone?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing me--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not mad?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, interrupting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you think it?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, without attending to her hint--\xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nVernon insists, not only that I know your innocence (of which, indeed, it\r\nis impossible for any one to be more convinced), but that I must also be\r\nacquainted with the real perpetrators of the outrage on this fellow--if\r\nindeed such an outrage has been committed. Is this reasonable, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow any appeal to Mr. Osbaldistone, Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung lady; \xe2\x80\x9che does not know, as I do, the incredible extent and\r\naccuracy of your information on all points.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I am a gentleman, you do me more honour than I deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustice, Rashleigh--only justice:--and it is only justice which I expect\r\nat your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a tyrant, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a sort of sigh--\xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ncapricious tyrant, and rule your friends with a rod of iron. Still,\r\nhowever, it shall be as you desire. But you ought not to be here--you\r\nknow you ought not;--you must return with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen turning from Diana, who seemed to stand undecided, he came up to me\r\nin the most friendly manner, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo not doubt my interest in what\r\nregards you, Mr. Osbaldistone. If I leave you just at this moment, it is\r\nonly to act for your advantage. But you must use your influence with your\r\ncousin to return; her presence cannot serve you, and must prejudice\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot be more convinced of this\r\nthan I; I have urged Miss Vernon's return as anxiously as she would\r\npermit me to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will not\r\ngo till I see you safe out of the hands of the Philistines. Cousin\r\nRashleigh, I dare say, means well; but he and I know each other well.\r\nRashleigh, I will not go;--I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a more soothing tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy being here will give you more motive for speed and exertion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay then, rash, obstinate girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know but too well\r\nto whom you trust;\xe2\x80\x9d and hastening out of the hall, we heard his horse's\r\nfeet a minute afterwards in rapid motion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven he is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now let us seek out the\r\nJustice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad we not better call a servant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by no means; I know the way to his den--we must burst on him\r\nsuddenly--follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did follow her accordingly, as she tripped up a few gloomy steps,\r\ntraversed a twilight passage, and entered a sort of ante-room, hung round\r\nwith old maps, architectural elevations, and genealogical trees. A pair\r\nof folding-doors opened from this into Mr. Inglewood's sitting apartment,\r\nfrom which was heard the fag-end of an old ditty, chanted by a voice\r\nwhich had been in its day fit for a jolly bottle-song.\r\n\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x9cO, in Skipton-in-Craven\r\n                           Is never a haven,\r\n                        But many a day foul weather;\r\n                           And he that would say\r\n                           A pretty girl nay,\r\n                        I wish for his cravat a tether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyday!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cthe genial Justice must have dined\r\nalready--I did not think it had been so late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was even so. Mr. Inglewood's appetite having been sharpened by his\r\nofficial investigations, he had antedated his meridian repast, having\r\ndined at twelve instead of one o'clock, then the general dining hour in\r\nEngland. The various occurrences of the morning occasioned our arriving\r\nsome time after this hour, to the Justice the most important of the\r\nfour-and-twenty, and he had not neglected the interval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay you here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the house, and I will call a\r\nservant; your sudden appearance might startle the old gentleman even to\r\nchoking;\xe2\x80\x9d and she escaped from me, leaving me uncertain whether I ought\r\nto advance or retreat. It was impossible for me not to hear some part of\r\nwhat passed within the dinner apartment, and particularly several\r\napologies for declining to sing, expressed in a dejected croaking voice,\r\nthe tones of which, I conceived, were not entirely new to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot sing, sir? by our Lady! but you must--What! you have cracked my\r\nsilver-mounted cocoa-nut of sack, and tell me that you cannot sing!--Sir,\r\nsack will make a cat sing, and speak too; so up with a merry stave, or\r\ntrundle yourself out of my doors!--Do you think you are to take up all my\r\nvaluable time with your d-d declarations, and then tell me you cannot\r\nsing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour worship is perfectly in rule,\xe2\x80\x9d said another voice, which, from its\r\npert conceited accent, might be that of the cleric, \xe2\x80\x9cand the party must\r\nbe conformable; he hath _canet_ written on his face in court hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp with it then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice, \xe2\x80\x9cor by St. Christopher, you shall\r\ncrack the cocoa-nut full of salt-and-water, according to the statute for\r\nsuch effect made and provided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus exhorted and threatened, my quondam fellow-traveller, for I could no\r\nlonger doubt that he was the recusant in question, uplifted, with a voice\r\nsimilar to that of a criminal singing his last psalm on the scaffold, a\r\nmost doleful stave to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cGood people all, I pray give ear,\r\n                    A woeful story you shall hear,\r\n                   'Tis of a robber as stout as ever\r\n                    Bade a true man stand and deliver.\r\n                       With his foodle doo fa loodle loo.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cThis knave, most worthy of a cord,\r\n                    Being armed with pistol and with sword,\r\n                   'Twixt Kensington and Brentford then\r\n                    Did boldly stop six honest men.\r\n                       With his foodle doo, etc.\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cThese honest men did at Brentford dine,\r\n                   Having drank each man his pint of wine,\r\n                   When this bold thief, with many curses,\r\n                   Did say, You dogs, your lives or purses.\r\n                       With his foodle doo,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nI question if the honest men, whose misfortune is commemorated in this\r\npathetic ditty, were more startled at the appearance of the bold thief\r\nthan the songster was at mine; for, tired of waiting for some one to\r\nannounce me, and finding my situation as a listener rather awkward, I\r\npresented myself to the company just as my friend Mr. Morris, for such,\r\nit seems, was his name, was uplifting the fifth stave of his doleful\r\nballad. The high tone with which the tune started died away in a quaver\r\nof consternation on finding himself so near one whose character he\r\nsupposed to be little less suspicious than that of the hero of his\r\nmadrigal, and he remained silent, with a mouth gaping as if I had brought\r\nthe Gorgon's head in my hand.\r\n\r\nThe Justice, whose eyes had closed under the influence of the somniferous\r\nlullaby of the song, started up in his chair as it suddenly ceased, and\r\nstared with wonder at the unexpected addition which the company had\r\nreceived while his organs of sight were in abeyance. The clerk, as I\r\nconjectured him to be from his appearance, was also commoved; for,\r\nsitting opposite to Mr. Morris, that honest gentleman's terror\r\ncommunicated itself to him, though he wotted not why.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frank at Judge Inglewood's--104]\r\n\r\n\r\nI broke the silence of surprise occasioned by my abrupt entrance.--\xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nname, Mr. Inglewood, is Francis Osbaldistone; I understand that some\r\nscoundrel has brought a complaint before you, charging me with being\r\nconcerned in a loss which he says he has sustained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice, somewhat peevishly, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are matters I never\r\nenter upon after dinner;--there is a time for everything, and a justice\r\nof peace must eat as well as other folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goodly person of Mr. Inglewood, by the way, seemed by no means to\r\nhave suffered by any fasts, whether in the service of the law or of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon for an ill-timed visit, sir; but as my reputation is\r\nconcerned, and as the dinner appears to be concluded\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not concluded, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the magistrate; \xe2\x80\x9cman requires\r\ndigestion as well as food, and I protest I cannot have benefit from my\r\nvictuals unless I am allowed two hours of quiet leisure, intermixed with\r\nharmless mirth, and a moderate circulation of the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your honour will forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jobson, who had produced and\r\narranged his writing implements in the brief space that our conversation\r\nafforded; \xe2\x80\x9cas this is a case of felony, and the gentleman seems something\r\nimpatient, the charge is _contra pacem domini regis_\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n _dominie regis!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the impatient Justice--\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it's no\r\ntreason to say so; but it's enough to made one mad to be worried in this\r\nway. Have I a moment of my life quiet for warrants, orders, directions,\r\nacts, bails, bonds, and recognisances?--I pronounce to you, Mr. Jobson,\r\nthat I shall send you and the justiceship to the devil one of these\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honour will consider the dignity of the office one of the quorum\r\nand custos rotulorum, an office of which Sir Edward Coke wisely saith,\r\nThe whole Christian world hath not the like of it, so it be duly\r\nexecuted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice, partly reconciled by this eulogium on the\r\ndignity of his situation, and gulping down the rest of his\r\ndissatisfaction in a huge bumper of claret, \xe2\x80\x9clet us to this gear then,\r\nand get rid of it as fast as we can.--Here you, sir--you, Morris--you,\r\nknight of the sorrowful countenance--is this Mr. Francis Osbaldistone the\r\ngentleman whom you charge with being art and part of felony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Morris, whose scattered wits had hardly yet reassembled\r\nthemselves; \xe2\x80\x9cI charge nothing--I say nothing against the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we dismiss your complaint, sir, that's all, and a good riddance--\r\nPush about the bottle--Mr. Osbaldistone, help yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJobson, however, was determined that Morris should not back out of the\r\nscrape so easily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Mr. Morris?--Here is your own\r\ndeclaration--the ink scarce dried--and you would retract it in this\r\nscandalous manner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the other in a tremulous tone, \xe2\x80\x9chow many\r\nrogues are in the house to back him? I have read of such things in\r\nJohnson's Lives of the Highwaymen. I protest the door opens\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nAnd it did open, and Diana Vernon entered--\xe2\x80\x9cYou keep fine order here,\r\nJustice--not a servant to be seen or heard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice, starting up with an alacrity which showed that he\r\nwas not so engrossed by his devotions to Themis or Comus, as to forget\r\nwhat was due to beauty--\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ha! Die Vernon, the heath-bell of Cheviot,\r\nand the blossom of the Border, come to see how the old bachelor keeps\r\nhouse? Art welcome, girl, as flowers in May.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine, open, hospitable house you do keep, Justice, that must be\r\nallowed--not a soul to answer a visitor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the knaves! they reckoned themselves secure of me for a couple of\r\nhours--But why did you not come earlier?--Your cousin Rashleigh dined\r\nhere, and ran away like a poltroon after the first bottle was out--But\r\nyou have not dined--we'll have something nice and ladylike--sweet and\r\npretty like yourself, tossed up in a trice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may eat a crust in the ante-room before I set out,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miss\r\nVernon--\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a long ride this morning; but I can't stay long,\r\nJustice--I came with my cousin, Frank Osbaldistone, there, and I must\r\nshow him the way back again to the Hall, or he'll lose himself in the\r\nwolds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew! sits the wind in that quarter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Justice--\r\n\r\n           \xe2\x80\x9cShe showed him the way, she showed him the way,\r\n                     She showed him the way to woo.\r\n\r\nWhat! no luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever, Squire Inglewood; but if you will be a good kind Justice,\r\nand despatch young Frank's business, and let us canter home again, I'll\r\nbring my uncle to dine with you next week, and we'll expect merry\r\ndoings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you shall find them, my pearl of the Tyne--Zookers, lass, I never\r\nenvy these young fellows their rides and scampers, unless when you come\r\nacross me. But I must not keep you just now, I suppose?--I am quite\r\nsatisfied with Mr. Francis Osbaldistone's explanation--here has been some\r\nmistake, which can be cleared at greater leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have not heard the nature of the\r\naccusation yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, who, at the appearance of Miss Vernon, had\r\ngiven up the matter in despair, but who picked up courage to press\r\nfarther investigation on finding himself supported from a quarter whence\r\nassuredly he expected no backing--\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, and Dalton saith, That he\r\nwho is apprehended as a felon shall not be discharged upon any man's\r\ndiscretion, but shall be held either to bail or commitment, paying to the\r\nclerk of the peace the usual fees for recognisance or commitment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Justice, thus goaded on, gave me at length a few words of\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nIt seems the tricks which I had played to this man Morris had made a\r\nstrong impression on his imagination; for I found they had been arrayed\r\nagainst me in his evidence, with all the exaggerations which a timorous\r\nand heated imagination could suggest. It appeared also, that on the day\r\nhe parted from me, he had been stopped on a solitary spot and eased of\r\nhis beloved travelling-companion, the portmanteau, by two men, well\r\nmounted and armed, having their faces covered with vizards.\r\n\r\nOne of them, he conceived, had much of my shape and air, and in a\r\nwhispering conversation which took place betwixt the freebooters, he\r\nheard the other apply to him the name of Osbaldistone. The declaration\r\nfarther set forth, that upon inquiring into the principles of the family\r\nso named, he, the said declarant, was informed that they were of the\r\nworst description, the family, in all its members, having been Papists\r\nand Jacobites, as he was given to understand by the dissenting clergyman\r\nat whose house he stopped after his rencontre, since the days of William\r\nthe Conqueror.\r\n\r\nUpon all and each of these weighty reasons, he charged me with being\r\naccessory to the felony committed upon his person; he, the said\r\ndeclarant, then travelling in the special employment of Government, and\r\nhaving charge of certain important papers, and also a large sum in\r\nspecie, to be paid over, according to his instructions, to certain\r\npersons of official trust and importance in Scotland.\r\n\r\nHaving heard this extraordinary accusation, I replied to it, that the\r\ncircumstances on which it was founded were such as could warrant no\r\njustice, or magistrate, in any attempt on my personal liberty. I admitted\r\nthat I had practised a little upon the terrors of Mr. Morris, while we\r\ntravelled together, but in such trifling particulars as could have\r\nexcited apprehension in no one who was one whit less timorous and jealous\r\nthan himself. But I added, that I had never seen him since we parted, and\r\nif that which he feared had really come upon him, I was in nowise\r\naccessory to an action so unworthy of my character and station in life.\r\nThat one of the robbers was called Osbaldistone, or that such a name was\r\nmentioned in the course of the conversation betwixt them, was a trifling\r\ncircumstance, to which no weight was due. And concerning the disaffection\r\nalleged against me, I was willing to prove, to the satisfaction of the\r\nJustice, the clerk, and even the witness himself, that I was of the same\r\npersuasion as his friend the dissenting clergyman; had been educated as a\r\ngood subject in the principles of the Revolution, and as such now\r\ndemanded the personal protection of the laws which had been assured by\r\nthat great event.\r\n\r\nThe Justice fidgeted, took snuff, and seemed considerably embarrassed,\r\nwhile Mr. Attorney Jobson, with all the volubility of his profession, ran\r\nover the statute of the 34 Edward III., by which justices of the peace\r\nare allowed to arrest all those whom they find by indictment or\r\nsuspicion, and to put them into prison. The rogue even turned my own\r\nadmissions against me, alleging, \xe2\x80\x9cthat since I had confessedly, upon my\r\nown showing, assumed the bearing or deportment of a robber or malefactor,\r\nI had voluntarily subjected myself to the suspicions of which I\r\ncomplained, and brought myself within the compass of the act, having\r\nwilfully clothed my conduct with all the colour and livery of guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI combated both his arguments and his jargon with much indignation and\r\nscorn, and observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat I should, if necessary, produce the bail of my\r\nrelations, which I conceived could not be refused, without subjecting the\r\nmagistrate in a misdemeanour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, my good sir--pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the insatiable clerk; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is\r\na case in which neither bail nor mainprize can be received, the felon who\r\nis liable to be committed on heavy grounds of suspicion, not being\r\nreplevisable under the statute of the 3d of King Edward, there being in\r\nthat act an express exception of such as be charged of commandment, or\r\nforce, and aid of felony done;\xe2\x80\x9d and he hinted that his worship would do\r\nwell to remember that such were no way replevisable by common writ, nor\r\nwithout writ.\r\n\r\nAt this period of the conversation a servant entered, and delivered a\r\nletter to Mr. Jobson. He had no sooner run it hastily over, than he\r\nexclaimed, with the air of one who wished to appear much vexed at the\r\ninterruption, and felt the consequence attached to a man of multifarious\r\navocations--\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!--why, at this rate, I shall have neither time to\r\nattend to the public concerns nor my own--no rest--no quiet--I wish to\r\nHeaven another gentleman in our line would settle here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice in a tone of _sotto-voce_ deprecation;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csome of us have enough of one of the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a matter of life and death, if your worship pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn God's name! no more justice business, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the alarmed\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Jobson, very consequentially; \xe2\x80\x9cold Gaffer Rutledge\r\nof Grime's-hill is subpoenaed for the next world; he has sent an express\r\nfor Dr. Kill-down to put in bail--another for me to arrange his worldly\r\naffairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with you, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Inglewood, hastily; \xe2\x80\x9chis may not be a\r\nreplevisable case under the statute, you know, or Mr. Justice Death may\r\nnot like the doctor for a _main pernor,_ or bailsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jobson, lingering as he moved towards the door, \xe2\x80\x9cif my\r\npresence here be necessary--I could make out the warrant for committal in\r\na moment, and the constable is below--And you have heard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nlowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Rashleigh's opinion\xe2\x80\x9d--the rest was lost in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nThe Justice replied aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee no, man, no--we'll do nought till\r\nthou return, man; 'tis but a four-mile ride--Come, push the bottle, Mr.\r\nMorris--Don't be cast down, Mr. Osbaldistone--And you, my rose of the\r\nwilderness--one cup of claret to refresh the bloom of your cheeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana started, as if from a reverie, in which she appeared to have been\r\nplunged while we held this discussion. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Justice--I should be afraid\r\nof transferring the bloom to a part of my face where it would show to\r\nlittle advantage; but I will pledge you in a cooler beverage;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfilling a glass with water, she drank it hastily, while her hurried\r\nmanner belied her assumed gaiety.\r\n\r\nI had not much leisure to make remarks upon her demeanour, however, being\r\nfull of vexation at the interference of fresh obstacles to an instant\r\nexamination of the disgraceful and impertinent charge which was brought\r\nagainst me. But there was no moving the Justice to take the matter up in\r\nabsence of his clerk, an incident which gave him apparently as much\r\npleasure as a holiday to a schoolboy. He persisted in his endeavours to\r\ninspire jollity into a company, the individuals of which, whether\r\nconsidered with reference to each other, or to their respective\r\nsituations, were by no means inclined to mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Master Morris,\r\nyou're not the first man that's been robbed, I trow--grieving ne'er\r\nbrought back loss, man. And you, Mr. Frank Osbaldistone, are not the\r\nfirst bully-boy that has said stand to a true man. There was Jack\r\nWinterfield, in my young days, kept the best company in the land--at\r\nhorse-races and cock-fights who but he--hand and glove was I with Jack.\r\nPush the bottle, Mr. Morris, it's dry talking--Many quart bumpers have I\r\ncracked, and thrown many a merry main with poor Jack--good family--ready\r\nwit--quick eye--as honest a fellow, barring the deed he died for--we'll\r\ndrink to his memory, gentlemen--Poor Jack Winterfield--And since we talk\r\nof him, and of those sort of things, and since that d--d clerk of mine\r\nhas taken his gibberish elsewhere, and since we're snug among ourselves,\r\nMr. Osbaldistone, if you will have my best advice, I would take up this\r\nmatter--the law's hard--very severe--hanged poor Jack Winterfield at\r\nYork, despite family connections and great interest, all for easing a fat\r\nwest-country grazier of the price of a few beasts--Now, here is honest\r\nMr. Morris, has been frightened, and so forth--D--n it, man, let the poor\r\nfellow have back his portmanteau, and end the frolic at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris's eyes brightened up at this suggestion, and he began to hesitate\r\nforth an assurance that he thirsted for no man's blood, when I cut the\r\nproposed accommodation short, by resenting the Justice's suggestion as an\r\ninsult, that went directly to suppose me guilty of the very crime which I\r\nhad come to his house with the express intention of disavowing. We were\r\nin this awkward predicament when a servant, opening the door, announced,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange gentleman to wait upon his honour;\xe2\x80\x9d and the party whom he thus\r\ndescribed entered the room without farther ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Die Vernon at Judge Inglewood's--112]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINTH.\r\n\r\n             One of the thieves come back again! I'll stand close,\r\n             He dares not wrong me now, so near the house,\r\n             And call in vain 'tis, till I see him offer it.\r\n                                          The Widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Justice--\xe2\x80\x9cnot upon business, I trust, for I'll\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nHis protestation was cut short by the answer of the man himself. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nbusiness is of a nature somewhat onerous and particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\nacquaintance, Mr. Campbell--for it was he, the very Scotchman whom I had\r\nseen at Northallerton--\xe2\x80\x9cand I must solicit your honour to give instant\r\nand heedful consideration to it.--I believe, Mr. Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nfixing his eye on that person with a look of peculiar firmness and almost\r\nferocity--\xe2\x80\x9cI believe ye ken brawly what I am--I believe ye cannot have\r\nforgotten what passed at our last meeting on the road?\xe2\x80\x9d Morris's jaw\r\ndropped--his countenance became the colour of tallow--his teeth\r\nchattered, and he gave visible signs of the utmost consternation. \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\nheart of grace, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, \xe2\x80\x9cand dinna sit clattering your jaws\r\nthere like a pair of castanets! I think there can be nae difficulty in\r\nyour telling Mr. Justice, that ye have seen me of yore, and ken me to be\r\na cavalier of fortune, and a man of honour. Ye ken fu' weel ye will be\r\nsome time resident in my vicinity, when I may have the power, as I will\r\npossess the inclination, to do you as good a turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir--sir--I believe you to be a man of honour, and, as you say, a man of\r\nfortune. Yes, Mr. Inglewood,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, clearing his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI really\r\nbelieve this gentleman to be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are this gentleman's commands with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice,\r\nsomewhat peevishly. \xe2\x80\x9cOne man introduces another, like the rhymes in the\r\n'house that Jack built,' and I get company without either peace or\r\nconversation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth shall be yours, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Campbell, \xe2\x80\x9cin a brief period of\r\ntime. I come to release your mind from a piece of troublesome duty, not\r\nto make increment to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody o' me! then you are welcome as ever Scot was to England, and that's\r\nnot saying much. But get on, man--let's hear what you have got to say at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume, this gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the North Briton, \xe2\x80\x9ctold you there\r\nwas a person of the name of Campbell with him, when he had the mischance\r\nto lose his valise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not mentioned such a name, from beginning to end of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the Justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I conceive--I conceive,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Campbell;--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morris was\r\nkindly afeared of committing a stranger into collision wi' the judicial\r\nforms of the country; but as I understand my evidence is necessary to the\r\ncompurgation of one honest gentleman here, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone, wha\r\nhas been most unjustly suspected, I will dispense with the precaution. Ye\r\nwill therefore\xe2\x80\x9d (he added addressing Morris with the same determined look\r\nand accent) \xe2\x80\x9cplease tell Mr. Justice Inglewood, whether we did not travel\r\nseveral miles together on the road, in consequence of your own anxious\r\nrequest and suggestion, reiterated ance and again, baith on the evening\r\nthat we were at Northallerton, and there declined by me, but afterwards\r\naccepted, when I overtook ye on the road near Cloberry Allers, and was\r\nprevailed on by you to resign my ain intentions of proceeding to\r\nRothbury; and, for my misfortune, to accompany you on your proposed\r\nroute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a melancholy truth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Morris, holding down his head, as he\r\ngave this general assent to the long and leading question which Campbell\r\nput to him, and seemed to acquiesce in the statement it contained with\r\nrueful docility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I presume you can also asseverate to his worship, that no man is\r\nbetter qualified than I am to bear testimony in this case, seeing that I\r\nwas by you, and near you, constantly during the whole occurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo man better qualified, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, with a deep and\r\nembarrassed sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why the devil did you not assist him, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince, by Mr. Morris's account, there were but two robbers; so you were\r\ntwo to two, and you are both stout likely men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, if it please your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been all my life\r\na man of peace and quietness, noways given to broils or batteries. Mr.\r\nMorris, who belongs, as I understand, or hath belonged, to his Majesty's\r\narmy, might have used his pleasure in resistance, he travelling, as I\r\nalso understand, with a great charge of treasure; but, for me, who had\r\nbut my own small peculiar to defend, and who am, moreover, a man of a\r\npacific occupation, I was unwilling to commit myself to hazard in the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at Campbell as he muttered these words, and never recollect to\r\nhave seen a more singular contrast than that between the strong daring\r\nsternness expressed in his harsh features, and the air of composed\r\nmeekness and simplicity which his language assumed. There was even a\r\nslight ironical smile lurking about the corners of his mouth, which\r\nseemed, involuntarily as it were, to intimate his disdain of the quiet\r\nand peaceful character which he thought proper to assume, and which led\r\nme to entertain strange suspicions that his concern in the violence done\r\nto Morris had been something very different from that of a\r\nfellow-sufferer, or even of a mere spectator.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some suspicious crossed the Justice's mind at the moment, for he\r\nexclaimed, as if by way of ejaculation, \xe2\x80\x9cBody o' me! but this is a\r\nstrange story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe North Briton seemed to guess at what was passing in his mind; for he\r\nwent on, with a change of manner and tone, dismissing from his\r\ncountenance some part of the hypocritical affectation of humility which\r\nhad made him obnoxious to suspicion, and saying, with a more frank and\r\nunconstrained air, \xe2\x80\x9cTo say the truth, I am just ane o' those canny folks\r\nwha care not to fight but when they hae gotten something to fight for,\r\nwhich did not chance to be my predicament when I fell in wi' these loons.\r\nBut that your worship may know that I am a person of good fame and\r\ncharacter, please to cast your eye over that billet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Inglewood took the paper from his hand, and read, half aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nare to certify, that the bearer, Robert Campbell of--of some place which\r\nI cannot pronounce,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected the Justice--\xe2\x80\x9cis a person of good\r\nlineage, and peaceable demeanour, travelling towards England on his own\r\nproper affairs, &c. &c. &c. Given under our hand, at our Castle of\r\nInver--Invera--rara--Argyle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA slight testimonial, sir, which I thought fit to impetrate from that\r\nworthy nobleman\xe2\x80\x9d (here he raised his hand to his head, as if to touch his\r\nhat), \xe2\x80\x9cMacCallum More.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMacCallum who, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom the Southern call the Duke of Argyle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the Duke of Argyle very well to be a nobleman of great worth and\r\ndistinction, and a true lover of his country. I was one of those that\r\nstood by him in 1714, when he unhorsed the Duke of Marlborough out of his\r\ncommand. I wish we had more noblemen like him. He was an honest Tory in\r\nthose days, and hand and glove with Ormond. And he has acceded to the\r\npresent Government, as I have done myself, for the peace and quiet of his\r\ncountry; for I cannot presume that great man to have been actuated, as\r\nviolent folks pretend, with the fear of losing his places and regiment.\r\nHis testimonial, as you call it, Mr. Campbell, is perfectly satisfactory;\r\nand now, what have you got to say to this matter of the robbery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBriefly this, if it please your worship,--that Mr. Morris might as weel\r\ncharge it against the babe yet to be born, or against myself even, as\r\nagainst this young gentleman, Mr. Osbaldistone; for I am not only free to\r\ndepone that the person whom he took for him was a shorter man, and a\r\nthicker man, but also, for I chanced to obtain a glisk of his visage, as\r\nhis fause-face slipped aside, that he was a man of other features and\r\ncomplexion than those of this young gentleman, Mr. Osbaldistone. And I\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning round with a natural, yet somewhat sterner\r\nair, to Mr. Morris, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the gentleman will allow I had better\r\nopportunity to take cognisance wha were present on that occasion than he,\r\nbeing, I believe, much the cooler o' the twa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree to it, sir--I agree to it perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, shrinking\r\nback as Campbell moved his chair towards him to fortify his appeal--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI incline, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing Mr. Inglewood, \xe2\x80\x9cto retract my\r\ninformation as to Mr. Osbaldistone; and I request, sir, you will permit\r\nhim, sir, to go about his business, and me to go about mine also; your\r\nworship may have business to settle with Mr. Campbell, and I am rather in\r\nhaste to be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, there go the declarations,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice, throwing them into\r\nthe fire--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you are at perfect liberty, Mr Osbaldistone. And you,\r\nMr. Morris, are set quite at your ease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, eyeing Morris as he assented with a rueful grin to\r\nthe Justice's observations, \xe2\x80\x9cmuch like the ease of a tod under a pair of\r\nharrows--But fear nothing, Mr. Morris; you and I maun leave the house\r\nthegither. I will see you safe--I hope you will not doubt my honour, when\r\nI say sae--to the next highway, and then we part company; and if we do\r\nnot meet as friends in Scotland, it will be your ain fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith such a lingering look of terror as the condemned criminal throws,\r\nwhen he is informed that the cart awaits him, Morris arose; but when on\r\nhis legs, appeared to hesitate. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee, man, fear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n reiterated Campbell; \xe2\x80\x9cI will keep my word with you--Why, thou sheep's\r\nheart, how do ye ken but we may can pick up some speerings of your\r\nvalise, if ye will be amenable to gude counsel?--Our horses are ready.\r\nBid the Justice fareweel, man, and show your Southern breeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris, thus exhorted and encouraged, took his leave, under the escort of\r\nMr. Campbell; but, apparently, new scruples and terrors had struck him\r\nbefore they left the house, for I heard Campbell reiterating assurances\r\nof safety and protection as they left the ante-room--\xe2\x80\x9cBy the soul of my\r\nbody, man, thou'rt as safe as in thy father's kailyard--Zounds! that a\r\nchield wi' sic a black beard should hae nae mair heart than a\r\nhen-partridge!--Come on wi' ye, like a frank fallow, anes and for aye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voices died away, and the subsequent trampling of their horses\r\nannounced to us that they had left the mansion of Justice Inglewood.\r\n\r\nThe joy which that worthy magistrate received at this easy conclusion of\r\na matter which threatened him with some trouble in his judicial capacity,\r\nwas somewhat damped by reflection on what his clerk's views of the\r\ntransaction might be at his return. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I shall have Jobson on my\r\nshoulders about these d--d papers--I doubt I should not have destroyed\r\nthem, after all--But hang it! it is only paying his fees, and that will\r\nmake all smooth--And now, Miss Die Vernon, though I have liberated all\r\nthe others, I intend to sign a writ for committing you to the custody of\r\nMother Blakes, my old housekeeper, for the evening, and we will send for\r\nmy neighbour Mrs. Musgrave, and the Miss Dawkins, and your cousins, and\r\nhave old Cobs the fiddler, and be as merry as the maids; and Frank\r\nOsbaldistone and I will have a carouse that will make us fit company for\r\nyou in half-an-hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, most worshipful,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Vernon; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, as matters stand,\r\nwe must return instantly to Osbaldistone Hall, where they do not know\r\nwhat has become of us, and relieve my uncle of his anxiety on my cousin's\r\naccount, which is just the same as if one of his own sons were\r\nconcerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice; \xe2\x80\x9cfor when his eldest son, Archie,\r\ncame to a bad end, in that unlucky affair of Sir John Fenwick's, old\r\nHildebrand used to hollo out his name as readily as any of the remaining\r\nsix, and then complain that he could not recollect which of his sons had\r\nbeen hanged. So, pray hasten home, and relieve his paternal solicitude,\r\nsince go you must. But hark thee hither, heath-blossom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pulling\r\nher towards him by the hand, and in a good-humoured tone of admonition,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9canother time let the law take its course, without putting your pretty\r\nfinger into her old musty pie, all full of fragments of law\r\ngibberish--French and dog-Latin--And, Die, my beauty, let young fellows\r\nshow each other the way through the moors, in case you should lose your\r\nown road, while you are pointing out theirs, my pretty Will o' the\r\nWisp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this admonition, he saluted and dismissed Miss Vernon, and took an\r\nequally kind farewell of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou seems to be a good tight lad, Mr. Frank, and I remember thy father\r\ntoo--he was my playfellow at school. Hark thee, lad,--ride early at\r\nnight, and don't swagger with chance passengers on the king's highway.\r\nWhat, man! all the king's liege subjects are not bound to understand\r\njoking, and it's ill cracking jests on matters of felony. And here's poor\r\nDie Vernon too--in a manner alone and deserted on the face of this wide\r\nearth, and left to ride, and run, and scamper, at her own silly pleasure.\r\nThou must be careful of Die, or, egad, I will turn a young fellow again\r\non purpose, and fight thee myself, although I must own it would be a\r\ngreat deal of trouble. And now, get ye both gone, and leave me to my pipe\r\nof tobacco, and my meditations; for what says the song--\r\n\r\n                  The Indian leaf doth briefly burn;\r\n                  So doth man's strength to weakness turn\r\n                  The fire of youth extinguished quite,\r\n                  Comes age, like embers, dry and white.\r\n                  Think of this as you take tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* [The lines here quoted belong to or were altered from a set of verses\r\nat one time very popular in England, beginning, _Tobacco that is withered\r\nquite._ In Scotland, the celebrated Ralph Erskine, author of the _Gospel\r\nSonnets,_ published what he called \xe2\x80\x9c_Smoking Spiritualized,_ in two\r\nparts. The first part being an Old Meditation upon Smoking Tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nbegins--*\r\n\r\n                  This Indian weed now withered quite,\r\n                  Tho' green at noon, cut down at night,\r\n                            Shows thy decay;\r\n                            All flesh is hay.\r\n                      Thus thank, and smoke tobacco.]\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with the gleams of sense and feeling which escaped\r\nfrom the Justice through the vapours of sloth and self-indulgence,\r\nassured him of my respect to his admonitions, and took a friendly\r\nfarewell of the honest magistrate and his hospitable mansion.\r\n\r\nWe found a repast prepared for us in the ante-room, which we partook of\r\nslightly, and rejoined the same servant of Sir Hildebrand who had taken\r\nour horses at our entrance, and who had been directed, as he informed\r\nMiss Vernon, by Mr. Rashleigh, to wait and attend upon us home. We rode a\r\nlittle way in silence, for, to say truth, my mind was too much bewildered\r\nwith the events of the morning, to permit me to be the first to break it.\r\nAt length Miss Vernon exclaimed, as if giving vent to her own\r\nreflections, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Rashleigh is a man to be feared and wondered at, and\r\nall but loved; he does whatever he pleases, and makes all others his\r\npuppets--has a player ready to perform every part which he imagines, and\r\nan invention and readiness which supply expedients for every emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, answering rather to her meaning, than to the\r\nexpress words she made use of, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this Mr. Campbell, whose appearance\r\nwas so opportune, and who trussed up and carried off my accuser as a\r\nfalcon trusses a partridge, was an agent of Mr. Rashleigh\r\nOsbaldistone's?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do guess as much,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Diana; \xe2\x80\x9cand shrewdly suspect, moreover,\r\nthat he would hardly have appeared so very much in the nick of time, if I\r\nhad not happened to meet Rashleigh in the hall at the Justice's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, my thanks are chiefly due to you, my fair preserver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure they are,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Diana; \xe2\x80\x9cand pray, suppose them paid, and\r\naccepted with a gracious smile, for I do not care to be troubled with\r\nhearing them in good earnest, and am much more likely to yawn than to\r\nbehave becoming. In short, Mr. Frank, I wished to serve you, and I have\r\nfortunately been able to do so, and have only one favour to ask in\r\nreturn, and that is, that you will say no more about it.--But who comes\r\nhere to meet us, 'bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste?' It is the\r\nsubordinate man of law, I think--no less than Mr. Joseph Jobson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Joseph Jobson it proved to be, in great haste, and, as it\r\nspeedily appeared, in most extreme bad humour. He came up to us, and\r\nstopped his horse, as we were about to pass with a slight salutation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, sir--so, Miss Vernon--ay, I see well enough how it is--bail put in\r\nduring my absence, I suppose--I should like to know who drew the\r\nrecognisance, that's all. If his worship uses this form of procedure\r\noften, I advise him to get another clerk, that's all, for I shall\r\ncertainly demit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr suppose he get this present clerk stitched to his sleeve, Mr.\r\nJobson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana; \xe2\x80\x9cwould not that do as well? And pray, how does\r\nFarmer Rutledge, Mr. Jobson? I hope you found him able to sign, seal, and\r\ndeliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question seemed greatly to increase the wrath of the man of law. He\r\nlooked at Miss Vernon with such an air of spite and resentment, as laid\r\nme under a strong temptation to knock him off his horse with the butt-end\r\nof my whip, which I only suppressed in consideration of his\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Rutledge, ma'am?\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, as soon as his indignation\r\npermitted him to articulate, \xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Rutledge is in as handsome enjoyment\r\nof his health as you are--it's all a bam, ma'am--all a bamboozle and a\r\nbite, that affair of his illness; and if you did not know as much before,\r\nyou know it now, ma'am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa you there now!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Vernon, with an affectation of extreme\r\nand simple wonder, \xe2\x80\x9csure you don't say so, Mr. Jobson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I _do_ say so, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the incensed scribe; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nmoreover I say, that the old miserly clod-breaker called me\r\npettifogger--pettifogger, ma'am--and said I came to hunt for a job,\r\nma'am--which I have no more right to have said to me than any other\r\ngentleman of my profession, ma'am--especially as I am clerk to the\r\npeace, having and holding said office under _Trigesimo Septimo Henrici\r\nOctavi_ and _Primo Gulielmi,_ the first of King William, ma'am, of\r\nglorious and immortal memory--our immortal deliverer from papists and\r\npretenders, and wooden shoes and warming pans, Miss Vernon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSad things, these wooden shoes and warming pans,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the young\r\nlady, who seemed to take pleasure in augmenting his wrath;--\xe2\x80\x9cand it is a\r\ncomfort you don't seem to want a warming pan at present, Mr. Jobson. I am\r\nafraid Gaffer Rutledge has not confined his incivility to language--Are\r\nyou sure he did not give you a beating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeating, ma'am!--no\xe2\x80\x9d--(very shortly)--\xe2\x80\x9cno man alive shall beat me, I\r\npromise you, ma'am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is according as you happen to merit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I: \xe2\x80\x9cfor your mode\r\nof speaking to this young lady is so unbecoming, that, if you do not\r\nchange your tone, I shall think it worth while to chastise you myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChastise, sir? and--me, sir?--Do you know whom you speak to, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cyou say yourself you are clerk of peace to the\r\ncounty; and Gaffer Rutledge says you are a pettifogger; and in neither\r\ncapacity are you entitled to be impertinent to a young lady of fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon laid her hand on my arm, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone, I will have no assaults and battery on Mr. Jobson; I am\r\nnot in sufficient charity with him to permit a single touch of your\r\nwhip--why, he would live on it for a term at least. Besides, you have\r\nalready hurt his feelings sufficiently--you have called him\r\nimpertinent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't value his language, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, somewhat crestfallen:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbesides, impertinent is not an actionable word; but pettifogger is\r\nslander in the highest degree, and that I will make Gaffer Rutledge know\r\nto his cost, and all who maliciously repeat the same, to the breach of\r\nthe public peace, and the taking away of my private good name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that, Mr. Jobson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know, where there\r\nis nothing, your own law allows that the king himself must lose his\r\nrights; and for the taking away of your good name, I pity the poor fellow\r\nwho gets it, and wish you joy of losing it with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, ma'am--good evening, ma'am--I have no more to say--only there\r\nare laws against papists, which it would be well for the land were they\r\nbetter executed. There's third and fourth Edward VI., of antiphoners,\r\nmissals, grailes, professionals, manuals, legends, pies, portuasses, and\r\nthose that have such trinkets in their possession, Miss Vernon--and\r\nthere's summoning of papists to take the oaths--and there are popish\r\nrecusant convicts under the first of his present Majesty--ay, and there\r\nare penalties for hearing mass--See twenty-third of Queen Elizabeth, and\r\nthird James First, chapter twenty-fifth. And there are estates to be\r\nregistered, and deeds and wills to be enrolled, and double taxes to be\r\nmade, according to the acts in that case made and provided\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee the new edition of the Statutes at Large, published under the\r\ncareful revision of Joseph Jobson, Gent., Clerk of the Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, and above all,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Jobson,--\xe2\x80\x9cfor I speak to your\r\nwarning--you, Diana Vernon, spinstress, not being a _femme couverte,_\r\nand being a convict popish recusant, are bound to repair to your own\r\ndwelling, and that by the nearest way, under penalty of being held felon\r\nto the king--and diligently to seek for passage at common ferries, and\r\nto tarry there but one ebb and flood; and unless you can have it in such\r\nplaces, to walk every day into the water up to the knees, assaying to\r\npass over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sort of Protestant penance for my Catholic errors, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Vernon, laughing.--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thank you for the information, Mr.\r\nJobson, and will hie me home as fast as I can, and be a better\r\nhousekeeper in time coming. Good-night, my dear Mr. Jobson, thou mirror\r\nof clerical courtesy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, ma'am, and remember the law is not to be trifled with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd we rode on our separate ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes for a troublesome mischief-making tool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon,\r\nas she gave a glance after him; \xe2\x80\x9cit is hard that persons of birth and rank\r\nand estate should be subjected to the official impertinence of such a\r\npaltry pickthank as that, merely for believing as the whole world\r\nbelieved not much above a hundred years ago--for certainly our Catholic\r\nFaith has the advantage of antiquity at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was much tempted to have broken the rascal's head,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have acted very like a hasty young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand yet, had my own hand been an ounce heavier than it is, I think I\r\nshould have laid its weight upon him. Well, it does not signify\r\ncomplaining, but there are three things for which I am much to be pitied,\r\nif any one thought it worth while to waste any compassion upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are these three things, Miss Vernon, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you promise me your deepest sympathy, if I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly;--can you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, closing my horse nearer to\r\nhers as I spoke, with an expression of interest which I did not attempt\r\nto disguise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is very seducing to be pitied, after all; so here are my three\r\ngrievances: In the first place, I am a girl, and not a young fellow, and\r\nwould be shut up in a mad-house if I did half the things that I have a\r\nmind to;--and that, if I had your happy prerogative of acting as you\r\nlist, would make all the world mad with imitating and applauding me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't quite afford you the sympathy you expect upon this score,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nreplied; \xe2\x80\x9cthe misfortune is so general, that it belongs to one half of\r\nthe species; and the other half\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre so much better cared for, that they are jealous of their\r\nprerogatives,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Miss Vernon--\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot you were a party\r\ninterested. Nay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as I was going to speak, \xe2\x80\x9cthat soft smile is\r\nintended to be the preface of a very pretty compliment respecting the\r\npeculiar advantages which Die Vernon's friends and kinsmen enjoy, by her\r\nbeing born one of their Helots; but spare me the utterance, my good\r\nfriend, and let us try whether we shall agree better on the second count\r\nof my indictment against fortune, as that quill-driving puppy would call\r\nit. I belong to an oppressed sect and antiquated religion, and, instead\r\nof getting credit for my devotion, as is due to all good girls beside, my\r\nkind friend, Justice Inglewood, may send me to the house of correction,\r\nmerely for worshipping God in the way of my ancestors, and say, as old\r\nPembroke did to the Abbess of Wilton,* when he usurped her convent and\r\nestablishment, 'Go spin, you jade,--Go spin.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Note F. The Abbess of Wilton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a cureless evil,\xe2\x80\x9d said I gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cConsult some of our\r\nlearned divines, or consult your own excellent understanding, Miss\r\nVernon; and surely the particulars in which our religious creed differs\r\nfrom that in which you have been educated\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, placing her fore-finger on her mouth,--\xe2\x80\x9cHush! no more\r\nof that. Forsake the faith of my gallant fathers! I would as soon, were I\r\na man, forsake their banner when the tide of battle pressed hardest\r\nagainst it, and turn, like a hireling recreant, to join the victorious\r\nenemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI honour your spirit, Miss Vernon; and as to the inconveniences to which\r\nit exposes you, I can only say, that wounds sustained for the sake of\r\nconscience carry their own balsam with the blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; but they are fretful and irritating, for all that. But I see, hard\r\nof heart as you are, my chance of beating hemp, or drawing out flax into\r\nmarvellous coarse thread, affects you as little as my condemnation to\r\ncoif and pinners, instead of beaver and cockade; so I will spare myself\r\nthe fruitless pains of telling my third cause of vexation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my dear Miss Vernon, do not withdraw your confidence, and I will\r\npromise you, that the threefold sympathy due to your very unusual causes\r\nof distress shall be all duly and truly paid to account of the third,\r\nproviding you assure me, that it is one which you neither share with all\r\nwomankind, nor even with every Catholic in England, who, God bless you,\r\nare still a sect more numerous than we Protestants, in our zeal for\r\nchurch and state, would desire them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, with a manner greatly altered, and more\r\nserious than I had yet seen her assume, \xe2\x80\x9ca misfortune that well merits\r\ncompassion. I am by nature, as you may easily observe, of a frank and\r\nunreserved disposition--a plain true-hearted girl, who would willingly\r\nact openly and honestly by the whole world, and yet fate has involved me\r\nin such a series of nets and toils, and entanglements, that I dare hardly\r\nspeak a word for fear of consequences--not to myself, but to others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is indeed a misfortune, Miss Vernon, which I do most sincerely\r\ncompassionate, but which I should hardly have anticipated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr. Osbaldistone, if you but knew--if any one knew, what difficulty I\r\nsometimes find in hiding an aching heart with a smooth brow, you would\r\nindeed pity me. I do wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you even thus far on\r\nmy own situation; but you are a young man of sense and penetration--you\r\ncannot but long to ask me a hundred questions on the events of this\r\nday--on the share which Rashleigh has in your deliverance from this petty\r\nscrape--upon many other points which cannot but excite your attention;\r\nand I cannot bring myself to answer with the necessary falsehood and\r\nfinesse--I should do it awkwardly, and lose your good opinion, if I have\r\nany share of it, as well as my own. It is best to say at once, Ask me no\r\nquestions,--I have it not in my power to reply to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon spoke these words with a tone of feeling which could not but\r\nmake a corresponding impression upon me. I assured her she had neither to\r\nfear my urging her with impertinent questions, nor my misconstruing her\r\ndeclining to answer those which might in themselves be reasonable, or at\r\nleast natural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was too much obliged,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cby the interest she had taken in my\r\naffairs, to misuse the opportunity her goodness had afforded me of prying\r\ninto hers--I only trusted and entreated, that if my services could at any\r\ntime be useful, she would command them without doubt or hesitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you--thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cyour voice does not ring the cuckoo\r\nchime of compliment, but speaks like that of one who knows to what he\r\npledges himself. If--but it is impossible--but yet, if an opportunity\r\nshould occur, I will ask you if you remember this promise; and I assure\r\nyou, I shall not be angry if I find you have forgotten it, for it is\r\nenough that you are sincere in your intentions just now--much may occur\r\nto alter them ere I call upon you, should that moment ever come, to\r\nassist Die Vernon, as if you were Die Vernon's brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I were Die Vernon's brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthere could not be less\r\nchance that I should refuse my assistance--And now I am afraid I must not\r\nask whether Rashleigh was willingly accessory to my deliverance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of me; but you may ask it of himself, and depend upon it, he will\r\nsay _yes;_ for rather than any good action should walk through the world\r\nlike an unappropriated adjective in an ill-arranged sentence, he is\r\nalways willing to stand noun substantive to it himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must not ask whether this Campbell be himself the party who eased\r\nMr. Morris of his portmanteau,--or whether the letter, which our friend\r\nthe attorney received, was not a finesse to withdraw him from the scene\r\nof action, lest he should have marred the happy event of my deliverance?\r\nAnd I must not ask\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must ask nothing of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon; \xe2\x80\x9cso it is quite in vain\r\nto go on putting cases. You are to think just as well of me as if I had\r\nanswered all these queries, and twenty others besides, as glibly as\r\nRashleigh could have done; and observe, whenever I touch my chin just so,\r\nit is a sign that I cannot speak upon the topic which happens to occupy\r\nyour attention. I must settle signals of correspondence with you, because\r\nyou are to be my confidant and my counsellor, only you are to know\r\nnothing whatever of my affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can be more reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cand the extent of\r\nyour confidence will, you may rely upon it, only be equalled by the\r\nsagacity of my counsels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sort of conversation brought us, in the highest good-humour with\r\neach other, to Osbaldistone Hall, where we found the family far advanced\r\nin the revels of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet some dinner for Mr. Osbaldistone and me in the library,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nVernon to a servant.--\xe2\x80\x9cI must have some compassion upon you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nturning to me, \xe2\x80\x9cand provide against your starving in this mansion of\r\nbrutal abundance; otherwise I am not sure that I should show you my\r\nprivate haunts. This same library is my den--the only corner of the\r\nHall-house where I am safe from the Ourang-Outangs, my cousins. They\r\nnever venture there, I suppose for fear the folios should fall down and\r\ncrack their skulls; for they will never affect their heads in any other\r\nway--So follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I followed through hall and bower, vaulted passage and winding stair,\r\nuntil we reached the room where she had ordered our refreshments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                In the wide pile, by others heeded not,\r\n                    Hers was one sacred solitary spot,\r\n                Whose gloomy aisles and bending shelves contain\r\n                For moral hunger food, and cures for moral pain.\r\n                                            Anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe library at Osbaldistone Hall was a gloomy room, whose antique oaken\r\nshelves bent beneath the weight of the ponderous folios so dear to the\r\nseventeenth century, from which, under favour be it spoken, we have\r\ndistilled matter for our quartos and octavos, and which, once more\r\nsubjected to the alembic, may, should our sons be yet more frivolous than\r\nourselves, be still farther reduced into duodecimos and pamphlets. The\r\ncollection was chiefly of the classics, as well foreign as ancient\r\nhistory, and, above all, divinity. It was in wretched order. The priests,\r\nwho in succession had acted as chaplains at the Hall, were, for many\r\nyears, the only persons who entered its precincts, until Rashleigh's\r\nthirst for reading had led him to disturb the venerable spiders, who had\r\nmuffled the fronts of the presses with their tapestry. His destination\r\nfor the church rendered his conduct less absurd in his father's eyes,\r\nthan if any of his other descendants had betrayed so strange a\r\npropensity, and Sir Hildebrand acquiesced in the library receiving some\r\nrepairs, so as to fit it for a sitting-room. Still an air of\r\ndilapidation, as obvious as it was uncomfortable, pervaded the large\r\napartment, and announced the neglect from which the knowledge which its\r\nwalls contained had not been able to exempt it. The tattered tapestry,\r\nthe worm-eaten shelves, the huge and clumsy, yet tottering, tables,\r\ndesks, and chairs, the rusty grate, seldom gladdened by either sea-coal\r\nor faggots, intimated the contempt of the lords of Osbaldistone Hall for\r\nlearning, and for the volumes which record its treasures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think this place somewhat disconsolate, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, as I\r\nglanced my eye round the forlorn apartment; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to me it seems like a\r\nlittle paradise, for I call it my own, and fear no intrusion. Rashleigh\r\nwas joint proprietor with me, while we were friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you no longer so?\xe2\x80\x9d was my natural question. Her fore-finger\r\nimmediately touched her dimpled chin, with an arch look of prohibition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are still _allies,_\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbound, like other confederate\r\npowers, by circumstances of mutual interest; but I am afraid, as will\r\nhappen in other cases, the treaty of alliance has survived the amicable\r\ndispositions in which it had its origin. At any rate, we live less\r\ntogether; and when he comes through that door there, I vanish through\r\nthis door here; and so, having made the discovery that we two were one\r\ntoo many for this apartment, as large as it seems, Rashleigh, whose\r\noccasions frequently call him elsewhere, has generously made a cession of\r\nhis rights in my favour; so that I now endeavour to prosecute alone the\r\nstudies in which he used formerly to be my guide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are those studies, if I may presume to ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you may, without the least fear of seeing my fore-finger raised\r\nto my chin. Science and history are my principal favourites; but I also\r\nstudy poetry and the classics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the classics? Do you read them in the original?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnquestionably. Rashleigh, who is no contemptible scholar, taught me\r\nGreek and Latin, as well as most of the languages of modern Europe. I\r\nassure you there has been some pains taken in my education, although I\r\ncan neither sew a tucker, nor work cross-stitch, nor make a pudding,\r\nnor--as the vicar's fat wife, with as much truth as elegance, good-will,\r\nand politeness, was pleased to say in my behalf--do any other useful\r\nthing in the varsal world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was this selection of studies Rashleigh's choice, or your own, Miss\r\nVernon?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as if hesitating to answer my question,--\xe2\x80\x9cIt's not worth\r\nwhile lifting my finger about, after all. Why, partly his and partly\r\nmine. As I learned out of doors to ride a horse, and bridle and saddle\r\nhim in cue of necessity, and to clear a five-barred gate, and fire a gun\r\nwithout winking, and all other of those masculine accomplishments that my\r\nbrute cousins run mad after, I wanted, like my rational cousin, to read\r\nGreek and Latin within doors, and make my complete approach to the tree\r\nof knowledge, which you men-scholars would engross to yourselves, in\r\nrevenge, I suppose, for our common mother's share in the great original\r\ntransgression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Rashleigh indulged your propensity to learning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he wished to have me for his scholar, and he could but teach me\r\nthat which he knew himself--he was not likely to instruct me in the\r\nmysteries of washing lace-ruffles, or hemming cambric handkerchiefs, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit the temptation of getting such a scholar, and have no doubt that\r\nit made a weighty consideration on the tutor's part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you begin to investigate Rashleigh's motives, my finger touches\r\nmy chin once more. I can only be frank where my own are inquired into.\r\nBut to resume--he has resigned the library in my favour, and never enters\r\nwithout leave had and obtained; and so I have taken the liberty to make\r\nit the place of deposit for some of my own goods and chattels, as you may\r\nsee by looking round you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon, Miss Vernon, but I really see nothing around these walls\r\nwhich I can distinguish as likely to claim you as mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, I suppose, because you neither see a shepherd or shepherdess\r\nwrought in worsted, and handsomely framed in black ebony, or a stuffed\r\nparrot,--or a breeding-cage, full of canary birds,--or a housewife-case,\r\nbroidered with tarnished silver,--or a toilet-table with a nest of\r\njapanned boxes, with as many angles as Christmas minced-pies,--or a\r\nbroken-backed spinet,--or a lute with three strings,--or rock-work,--or\r\nshell-work,--or needle-work, or work of any kind,--or a lap-dog with a\r\nlitter of blind puppies--None of these treasures do I possess,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, after a pause, in order to recover the breath she had lost in\r\nenumerating them--\xe2\x80\x9cBut there stands the sword of my ancestor Sir Richard\r\nVernon, slain at Shrewsbury, and sorely slandered by a sad fellow called\r\nWill Shakspeare, whose Lancastrian partialities, and a certain knack at\r\nembodying them, has turned history upside down, or rather inside\r\nout;--and by that redoubted weapon hangs the mail of the still older\r\nVernon, squire to the Black Prince, whose fate is the reverse of his\r\ndescendant's, since he is more indebted to the bard who took the trouble\r\nto celebrate him, for good-will than for talents,--\r\n\r\n                 Amiddes the route you may discern one\r\n          Brave knight, with pipes on shield, ycleped Vernon\r\n                 Like a borne fiend along the plain he thundered,\r\n          Prest to be carving throtes, while others plundered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is a model of a new martingale, which I invented myself--a\r\ngreat improvement on the Duke of Newcastle's; and there are the hood and\r\nbells of my falcon Cheviot, who spitted himself on a heron's bill at\r\nHorsely-moss--poor Cheviot, there is not a bird on the perches below, but\r\nare kites and riflers compared to him; and there is my own light\r\nfowling-piece, with an improved firelock; with twenty other treasures,\r\neach more valuable than another--And there, that speaks for itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the carved oak frame of a full-length portrait by Vandyke,\r\non which were inscribed, in Gothic letters, the words _Vernon semper\r\nviret._ I looked at her for explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\nwith some surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cour motto--the Vernon motto, where,\r\n\r\n                    Like the solemn vice iniquity,\r\n                    We moralise two meanings in one word\r\n\r\nAnd do you not know our cognisance, the pipes?\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to the armorial\r\nbearings sculptured on the oaken scutcheon, around which the legend was\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPipes!--they look more like penny-whistles--But, pray, do not be angry\r\nwith my ignorance,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, observing the colour mount to her\r\ncheeks, \xe2\x80\x9cI can mean no affront to your armorial bearings, for I do not\r\neven know my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou an Osbaldistone, and confess so much!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Percie,\r\nThornie, John, Dickon--Wilfred himself, might be your instructor. Even\r\nignorance itself is a plummet over you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith shame I confess it, my dear Miss Vernon, the mysteries couched\r\nunder the grim hieroglyphics of heraldry are to me as unintelligible as\r\nthose of the pyramids of Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is it possible?--Why, even my uncle reads Gwillym sometimes of a\r\nwinter night--Not know the figures of heraldry!--of what could your\r\nfather be thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the figures of arithmetic,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthe most insignificant unit\r\nof which he holds more highly than all the blazonry of chivalry. But,\r\nthough I am ignorant to this inexpressible degree, I have knowledge and\r\ntaste enough to admire that splendid picture, in which I think I can\r\ndiscover a family likeness to you. What ease and dignity in the\r\nattitude!--what richness of colouring--what breadth and depth of shade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really a fine painting?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen many works of the renowned artist,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut never\r\nbeheld one more to my liking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know as little of pictures as you do of heraldry,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss\r\nVernon; \xe2\x80\x9cyet I have the advantage of you, because I have always admired\r\nthe painting without understanding its value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I have neglected pipes and tabors, and all the whimsical\r\ncombinations of chivalry, still I am informed that they floated in the\r\nfields of ancient fame. But you will allow their exterior appearance is\r\nnot so peculiarly interesting to the uninformed spectator as that of a\r\nfine painting.--Who is the person here represented?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy grandfather. He shared the misfortunes of Charles I., and, I am sorry\r\nto add, the excesses of his son. Our patrimonial estate was greatly\r\nimpaired by his prodigality, and was altogether lost by his successor, my\r\nunfortunate father. But peace be with them who have got it!--it was lost\r\nin the cause of loyalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father, I presume, suffered in the political dissensions of the\r\nperiod?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did indeed;--he lost his all. And hence is his child a dependent\r\norphan--eating the bread of others--subjected to their caprices, and\r\ncompelled to study their inclinations; yet prouder of having had such a\r\nfather, than if, playing a more prudent but less upright part, he had\r\nleft me possessor of all the rich and fair baronies which his family once\r\npossessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she thus spoke, the entrance of the servants with dinner cut off all\r\nconversation but that of a general nature.\r\n\r\nWhen our hasty meal was concluded, and the wine placed on the table, the\r\ndomestic informed us, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Rashleigh had desired to be told when our\r\ndinner was removed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be happy to see him if he will\r\nstep this way--place another wineglass and chair, and leave the room.--\r\nYou must retire with him when he goes away,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, addressing\r\nherself to me; \xe2\x80\x9ceven _my_ liberality cannot spare a gentleman above eight\r\nhours out of the twenty-four; and I think we have been together for at\r\nleast that length of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old scythe-man has moved so rapidly,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I could not\r\ncount his strides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9chere comes Rashleigh;\xe2\x80\x9d and she drew off her\r\nchair, to which I had approached mine rather closely, so as to place a\r\ngreater distance between us. A modest tap at the door,--a gentle manner\r\nof opening when invited to enter,--a studied softness and humility of\r\nstep and deportment, announced that the education of Rashleigh\r\nOsbaldistone at the College of St. Omers accorded well with the ideas I\r\nentertained of the manners of an accomplished Jesuit. I need not add,\r\nthat, as a sound Protestant, these ideas were not the most favourable.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you use the ceremony of knocking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nyou knew that I was not alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was spoken with a burst of impatience, as if she had felt that\r\nRashleigh's air of caution and reserve covered some insinuation of\r\nimpertinent suspicion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have taught me the form of knocking at this\r\ndoor so perfectly, my fair cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rashleigh, without change of\r\nvoice or manner, \xe2\x80\x9cthat habit has become a second nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prize sincerity more than courtesy, sir, and you know I do,\xe2\x80\x9d was Miss\r\nVernon's reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourtesy is a gallant gay, a courtier by name and by profession,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Rashleigh, \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore most fit for a lady's bower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Sincerity is the true knight,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore\r\nmuch more welcome, cousin. But to end a debate not over amusing to your\r\nstranger kinsman, sit down, Rashleigh, and give Mr. Francis Osbaldistone\r\nyour countenance to his glass of wine. I have done the honours of the\r\ndinner, for the credit of Osbaldistone Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh sate down, and filled his glass, glancing his eye from Diana to\r\nme, with an embarrassment which his utmost efforts could not entirely\r\ndisguise. I thought he appeared to be uncertain concerning the extent of\r\nconfidence she might have reposed in me, and hastened to lead the\r\nconversation into a channel which should sweep away his suspicion that\r\nDiana might have betrayed any secrets which rested between them. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nVernon,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Rashleigh, has recommended me to return my thanks\r\nto you for my speedy disengagement from the ridiculous accusation of\r\nMorris; and, unjustly fearing my gratitude might not be warm enough to\r\nremind me of this duty, she has put my curiosity on its side, by\r\nreferring me to you for an account, or rather explanation, of the events\r\nof the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rashleigh; \xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought\xe2\x80\x9d (looking keenly at\r\nMiss Vernon) \xe2\x80\x9cthat the lady herself might have stood interpreter;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhis eye, reverting from her face, sought mine, as if to search, from the\r\nexpression of my features, whether Diana's communication had been as\r\nnarrowly limited as my words had intimated. Miss Vernon retorted his\r\ninquisitorial glance with one of decided scorn; while I, uncertain\r\nwhether to deprecate or resent his obvious suspicion, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is\r\nyour pleasure, Mr. Rashleigh, as it has been Miss Vernon's, to leave me\r\nin ignorance, I must necessarily submit; but, pray, do not withhold your\r\ninformation from me on the ground of imagining that I have already\r\nobtained any on the subject. For I tell you, as a man of honour, I am as\r\nignorant as that picture of anything relating to the events I have\r\nwitnessed to-day, excepting that I understand from Miss Vernon, that you\r\nhave been kindly active in my favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vernon has overrated my humble efforts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I\r\nclaim full credit for my zeal. The truth is, that as I galloped back to\r\nget some one of our family to join me in becoming your bail, which was\r\nthe most obvious, or, indeed, I may say, the only way of serving you\r\nwhich occurred to my stupidity, I met the man Cawmil--Colville--Campbell,\r\nor whatsoever they call him. I had understood from Morris that he was\r\npresent when the robbery took place, and had the good fortune to prevail\r\non him (with some difficulty, I confess) to tender his evidence in your\r\nexculpation--which I presume was the means of your being released from an\r\nunpleasant situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?--I am much your debtor for procuring such a seasonable evidence\r\nin my behalf. But I cannot see why (having been, as he said, a\r\nfellow-sufferer with Morris) it should have required much trouble to\r\npersuade him to step forth and bear evidence, whether to convict the\r\nactual robber, or free an innocent person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know the genius of that man's country, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nRashleigh;--\xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion, prudence, and foresight, are their leading\r\nqualities; these are only modified by a narrow-spirited, but yet ardent\r\npatriotism, which forms as it were the outmost of the concentric bulwarks\r\nwith which a Scotchman fortifies himself against all the attacks of a\r\ngenerous philanthropical principle. Surmount this mound, you find an\r\ninner and still dearer barrier--the love of his province, his village,\r\nor, most probably, his clan; storm this second obstacle, you have a\r\nthird--his attachment to his own family--his father, mother, sons,\r\ndaughters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, to the ninth generation. It is\r\nwithin these limits that a Scotchman's social affection expands itself,\r\nnever reaching those which are outermost, till all means of discharging\r\nitself in the interior circles have been exhausted. It is within these\r\ncircles that his heart throbs, each pulsation being fainter and fainter,\r\ntill, beyond the widest boundary, it is almost unfelt. And what is worst\r\nof all, could you surmount all these concentric outworks, you have an\r\ninner citadel, deeper, higher, and more efficient than them all--a\r\nScotchman's love for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this is extremely eloquent and metaphorical, Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nVernon, who listened with unrepressed impatience; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are only two\r\nobjections to it: first, it is _not_ true; secondly, if true, it is\r\nnothing to the purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ true, my fairest Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rashleigh; \xe2\x80\x9cand moreover, it\r\nis most instantly to the purpose. It is true, because you cannot deny\r\nthat I know the country and people intimately, and the character is drawn\r\nfrom deep and accurate consideration--and it is to the purpose, because\r\nit answers Mr. Francis Osbaldistone's question, and shows why this same\r\nwary Scotchman, considering our kinsman to be neither his countryman, nor\r\na Campbell, nor his cousin in any of the inextricable combinations by\r\nwhich they extend their pedigree; and, above all, seeing no prospect of\r\npersonal advantage, but, on the contrary, much hazard of loss of time and\r\ndelay of business\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith other inconveniences, perhaps, of a nature yet more formidable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n interrupted Miss Vernon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf which, doubtless, there might be many,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, continuing in\r\nthe same tone--\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, my theory shows why this man, hoping for no\r\nadvantage, and afraid of some inconvenience, might require a degree of\r\npersuasion ere he could be prevailed on to give his testimony in favour\r\nof Mr. Osbaldistone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems surprising to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat during the glance I cast\r\nover the declaration, or whatever it is termed, of Mr. Morris, he should\r\nnever have mentioned that Campbell was in his company when he met the\r\nmarauders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understood from Campbell, that he had taken his solemn promise not to\r\nmention that circumstance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rashleigh: \xe2\x80\x9chis reason for exacting\r\nsuch an engagement you may guess from what I have hinted--he wished to\r\nget back to his own country, undelayed and unembarrassed by any of the\r\njudicial inquiries which he would have been under the necessity of\r\nattending, had the fact of his being present at the robbery taken air\r\nwhile he was on this side of the Border. But let him once be as distant\r\nas the Forth, Morris will, I warrant you, come forth with all he knows\r\nabout him, and, it may be, a good deal more. Besides, Campbell is a very\r\nextensive dealer in cattle, and has often occasion to send great droves\r\ninto Northumberland; and, when driving such a trade, he would be a great\r\nfool to embroil himself with our Northumbrian thieves, than whom no men\r\nwho live are more vindictive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare be sworn of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, with a tone which implied\r\nsomething more than a simple acquiescence in the proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, resuming the subject, \xe2\x80\x9callowing the force of the reasons\r\nwhich Campbell might have for desiring that Morris should be silent with\r\nregard to his promise when the robbery was committed, I cannot yet see\r\nhow he could attain such an influence over the man, as to make him\r\nsuppress his evidence in that particular, at the manifest risk of\r\nsubjecting his story to discredit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh agreed with me, that it was very extraordinary, and seemed to\r\nregret that he had not questioned the Scotchman more closely on that\r\nsubject, which he allowed looked extremely mysterious. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nimmediately after this acquiescence, \xe2\x80\x9care you very sure the circumstance\r\nof Morris's being accompanied by Campbell is really not alluded to in his\r\nexamination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read the paper over hastily,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is my strong impression\r\nthat no such circumstance is mentioned;--at least, it must have been\r\ntouched on very slightly, since it failed to catch my attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rashleigh, forming his own inference while he\r\nadopted my words; \xe2\x80\x9cI incline to think with you, that the circumstance\r\nmust in reality have been mentioned, but so slightly that it failed to\r\nattract your attention. And then, as to Campbell's interest with Morris,\r\nI incline to suppose that it must have been gained by playing upon his\r\nfears. This chicken-hearted fellow, Morris, is bound, I understand, for\r\nScotland, destined for some little employment under Government; and,\r\npossessing the courage of the wrathful dove, or most magnanimous mouse,\r\nhe may have been afraid to encounter the ill-will of such a kill-cow as\r\nCampbell, whose very appearance would be enough to fright him out of his\r\nlittle wits. You observed that Mr. Campbell has at times a keen and\r\nanimated manner--something of a martial cast in his tone and bearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his expression struck me as being occasionally\r\nfierce and sinister, and little adapted to his peaceable professions. Has\r\nhe served in the army?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--no--not, strictly speaking, _served;_ but he has been, I believe,\r\nlike most of his countrymen, trained to arms. Indeed, among the hills,\r\nthey carry them from boyhood to the grave. So, if you know anything of\r\nyour fellow-traveller, you will easily judge, that, going to such a\r\ncountry, he will take cue to avoid a quarrel, if he can help it, with any\r\nof the natives. But, come, I see you decline your wine--and I too am a\r\ndegenerate Osbaldistone, so far as respects the circulation of the\r\nbottle. If you will go to my room, I will hold you a hand at piquet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe rose to take leave of Miss Vernon, who had from time to time\r\nsuppressed, apparently with difficulty, a strong temptation to break in\r\nupon Rashleigh's details. As we were about to leave the room, the\r\nsmothered fire broke forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour own observation will enable you to\r\nverify the justice, or injustice, of Rashleigh's suggestions concerning\r\nsuch individuals as Mr. Campbell and Mr. Morris. But, in slandering\r\nScotland, he has borne false witness against a whole country; and I\r\nrequest you will allow no weight to his evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI may find it somewhat difficult to obey your\r\ninjunction, Miss Vernon; for I must own I was bred up with no very\r\nfavourable idea of our northern neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDistrust that part of your education, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand let the\r\ndaughter of a Scotchwoman pray you to respect the land which gave her\r\nparent birth, until your own observation has proved them to be unworthy\r\nof your good opinion. Preserve your hatred and contempt for\r\ndissimulation, baseness, and falsehood, wheresoever they are to be met\r\nwith. You will find enough of all without leaving England.--Adieu,\r\ngentlemen, I wish you good evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she signed to the door, with the manner of a princess dismissing her\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nWe retired to Rashleigh's apartment, where a servant brought us coffee\r\nand cards. I had formed my resolution to press Rashleigh no farther on\r\nthe events of the day. A mystery, and, as I thought, not of a favourable\r\ncomplexion, appeared to hang over his conduct; but to ascertain if my\r\nsuspicions were just, it was necessary to throw him off his guard. We cut\r\nfor the deal, and were soon earnestly engaged in our play. I thought I\r\nperceived in this trifling for amusement (for the stake which Rashleigh\r\nproposed was a mere trifle) something of a fierce and ambitious temper.\r\nHe seemed perfectly to understand the beautiful game at which he played,\r\nbut preferred, as it were on principle, the risking bold and precarious\r\nstrokes to the ordinary rules of play; and neglecting the minor and\r\nbetter-balanced chances of the game, he hazarded everything for the\r\nchance of piqueing, repiqueing, or capoting his adversary. So soon as the\r\nintervention of a game or two at piquet, like the music between the acts\r\nof a drama, had completely interrupted our previous course of\r\nconversation, Rashleigh appeared to tire of the game, and the cards were\r\nsuperseded by discourse, in which he assumed the lead.\r\n\r\nMore learned than soundly wise--better acquainted with men's minds than\r\nwith the moral principles that ought to regulate them, he had still\r\npowers of conversation which I have rarely seen equalled, never excelled.\r\nOf this his manner implied some consciousness; at least, it appeared to\r\nme that he had studied hard to improve his natural advantages of a\r\nmelodious voice, fluent and happy expression, apt language, and fervid\r\nimagination. He was never loud, never overbearing, never so much occupied\r\nwith his own thoughts as to outrun either the patience or the\r\ncomprehension of those he conversed with. His ideas succeeded each other\r\nwith the gentle but unintermitting flow of a plentiful and bounteous\r\nspring; while I have heard those of others, who aimed at distinction in\r\nconversation, rush along like the turbid gush from the sluice of a\r\nmill-pond, as hurried, and as easily exhausted. It was late at night ere\r\nI could part from a companion so fascinating; and, when I gained my own\r\napartment, it cost me no small effort to recall to my mind the character\r\nof Rashleigh, such as I had pictured him previous to this\r\n_tete-a-tete._\r\n\r\nSo effectual, my dear Tresham, does the sense of being pleased and amused\r\nblunt our faculties of perception and discrimination of character, that I\r\ncan only compare it to the taste of certain fruits, at once luscious and\r\npoignant, which renders our palate totally unfit for relishing or\r\ndistinguishing the viands which are subsequently subjected to its\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVENTH.\r\n\r\n                  What gars ye gaunt, my merrymen a'?\r\n                      What gars ye look sae dreary?\r\n                  What gars ye hing your head sae sair\r\n                      In the castle of Balwearie?\r\n                                      Old Scotch Ballad.\r\n\r\nThe next morning chanced to be Sunday, a day peculiarly hard to be got\r\nrid of at Osbaldistone Hall; for after the formal religious service of\r\nthe morning had been performed, at which all the family regularly\r\nattended, it was hard to say upon which individual, Rashleigh and Miss\r\nVernon excepted, the fiend of ennui descended with the most abundant\r\noutpouring of his spirit. To speak of my yesterday's embarrassment amused\r\nSir Hildebrand for several minutes, and he congratulated me on my\r\ndeliverance from Morpeth or Hexham jail, as he would have done if I had\r\nfallen in attempting to clear a five-barred gate, and got up without\r\nhurting myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast had a lucky turn, lad; but do na be over venturous again. What,\r\nman! the king's road is free to all men, be they Whigs, be they Tories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word, sir, I am innocent of interrupting it; and it is the most\r\nprovoking thing on earth, that every person will take it for granted that\r\nI am accessory to a crime which I despise and detest, and which would,\r\nmoreover, deservedly forfeit my life to the laws of my country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, lad; even so be it; I ask no questions--no man bound to tell\r\non himsell--that's fair play, or the devil's in't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh here came to my assistance; but I could not help thinking that\r\nhis arguments were calculated rather as hints to his father to put on a\r\nshow of acquiescence in my declaration of innocence, than fully to\r\nestablish it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your own house, my dear sir--and your own nephew--you will not surely\r\npersist in hurting his feelings by seeming to discredit what he is so\r\nstrongly interested in affirming. No doubt, you are fully deserving of\r\nall his confidence, and I am sure, were there anything you could do to\r\nassist him in this strange affair, he would have recourse to your\r\ngoodness. But my cousin Frank has been dismissed as an innocent man, and\r\nno one is entitled to suppose him otherwise. For my part, I have not the\r\nleast doubt of his innocence; and our family honour, I conceive, requires\r\nthat we should maintain it with tongue and sword against the whole\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, looking fixedly at him, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art a sly\r\nloon--thou hast ever been too cunning for me, and too cunning for most\r\nfolks. Have a care thou provena too cunning for thysell--two faces under\r\none hood is no true heraldry. And since we talk of heraldry, I'll go and\r\nread Gwillym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis resolution he intimated with a yawn, resistless as that of the\r\nGoddess in the Dunciad, which was responsively echoed by his giant sons,\r\nas they dispersed in quest of the pastimes to which their minds severally\r\ninclined them--Percie to discuss a pot of March beer with the steward in\r\nthe buttery,--Thorncliff to cut a pair of cudgels, and fix them in their\r\nwicker hilts,--John to dress May-flies,--Dickon to play at pitch and toss\r\nby himself, his right hand against his left,--and Wilfred to bite his\r\nthumbs and hum himself into a slumber which should last till dinner-time,\r\nif possible. Miss Vernon had retired to the library.\r\n\r\nRashleigh and I were left alone in the old hall, from which the servants,\r\nwith their usual bustle and awkwardness, had at length contrived to hurry\r\nthe remains of our substantial breakfast. I took the opportunity to\r\nupbraid him with the manner in which he had spoken of my affair to his\r\nfather, which I frankly stated was highly offensive to me, as it seemed\r\nrather to exhort Sir Hildebrand to conceal his suspicions, than to root\r\nthem out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what can I do, my dear friend?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rashleigh \xe2\x80\x9cmy father's\r\ndisposition is so tenacious of suspicions of all kinds, when once they\r\ntake root (which, to do him justice, does not easily happen), that I have\r\nalways found it the best way to silence him upon such subjects, instead\r\nof arguing with him. Thus I get the better of the weeds which I cannot\r\neradicate, by cutting them over as often as they appear, until at length\r\nthey die away of themselves. There is neither wisdom nor profit in\r\ndisputing with such a mind as Sir Hildebrand's, which hardens itself\r\nagainst conviction, and believes in its own inspirations as firmly as we\r\ngood Catholics do in those of the Holy Father of Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very hard, though, that I should live in the house of a man, and\r\nhe a near relation too, who will persist in believing me guilty of a\r\nhighway robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father's foolish opinion, if one may give that epithet to any opinion\r\nof a father's, does not affect your real innocence; and as to the\r\ndisgrace of the fact, depend on it, that, considered in all its bearings,\r\npolitical as well as moral, Sir Hildebrand regards it as a meritorious\r\naction--a weakening of the enemy--a spoiling of the Amalekites; and you\r\nwill stand the higher in his regard for your supposed accession to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire no man's regard, Mr. Rashleigh, on such terms as must sink me\r\nin my own; and I think these injurious suspicions will afford a very good\r\nreason for quitting Osbaldistone Hall, which I shall do whenever I can\r\ncommunicate on the subject with my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dark countenance of Rashleigh, though little accustomed to betray its\r\nmaster's feelings, exhibited a suppressed smile, which he instantly\r\nchastened by a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a happy man, Frank--you go and come, as the\r\nwind bloweth where it listeth. With your address, taste, and talents, you\r\nwill soon find circles where they will be more valued, than amid the dull\r\ninmates of this mansion; while I--\xe2\x80\x9d he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is there in your lot that can make you or any one envy\r\nmine,--an outcast, as I may almost term myself, from my father's house\r\nand favour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rashleigh, \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the gratified sense of\r\nindependence which you must have attained by a very temporary\r\nsacrifice,--for such I am sure yours will prove to be; consider the\r\npower of acting as a free agent, of cultivating your own talents in the\r\nway to which your taste determines you, and in which you are well\r\nqualified to distinguish yourself. Fame and freedom are cheaply\r\npurchased by a few weeks' residence in the North, even though your place\r\nof exile be Osbaldistone Hall. A second Ovid in Thrace, you have not his\r\nreasons for writing Tristia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, blushing as became a young scribbler, \xe2\x80\x9chow you\r\nshould be so well acquainted with my truant studies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was an emissary of your father's here some time since, a young\r\ncoxcomb, one Twineall, who informed me concerning your secret sacrifices\r\nto the muses, and added, that some of your verses had been greatly\r\nadmired by the best judges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTresham, I believe you are guiltless of having ever essayed to build the\r\nlofty rhyme; but you must have known in your day many an apprentice and\r\nfellow-craft, if not some of the master-masons, in the temple of Apollo.\r\nVanity is their universal foible, from him who decorated the shades of\r\nTwickenham, to the veriest scribbler whom he has lashed in his Dunciad. I\r\nhad my own share of this common failing, and without considering how\r\nlittle likely this young fellow Twineall was, by taste and habits, either\r\nto be acquainted with one or two little pieces of poetry, which I had at\r\ntimes insinuated into Button's coffee-house, or to report the opinion of\r\nthe critics who frequented that resort of wit and literature, I almost\r\ninstantly gorged the bait; which Rashleigh perceiving, improved his\r\nopportunity by a diffident, yet apparently very anxious request to be\r\npermitted to see some of my manuscript productions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall give me an evening in my own apartment,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\nmust soon lose the charms of literary society for the drudgery of\r\ncommerce, and the coarse every-day avocations of the world. I repeat it,\r\nthat my compliance with my father's wishes for the advantage of my\r\nfamily, is indeed a sacrifice, especially considering the calm and\r\npeaceful profession to which my education destined me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was vain, but not a fool, and this hypocrisy was too strong for me to\r\nswallow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would not persuade me,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you really regret\r\nto exchange the situation of an obscure Catholic priest, with all its\r\nprivations, for wealth and society, and the pleasures of the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh saw that he had coloured his affectation of moderation too\r\nhighly, and, after a second's pause, during which, I suppose, he\r\ncalculated the degree of candour which it was necessary to use with me\r\n(that being a quality of which he was never needlessly profuse), he\r\nanswered, with a smile--\xe2\x80\x9cAt my age, to be condemned, as you say, to\r\nwealth and the world, does not, indeed, sound so alarming as perhaps it\r\nought to do. But, with pardon be it spoken, you have mistaken my\r\ndestination--a Catholic priest, if you will, but not an obscure one. No,\r\nsir,--Rashleigh Osbaldistone will be more obscure, should he rise to be\r\nthe richest citizen in London, than he might have been as a member of a\r\nchurch, whose ministers, as some one says, 'set their sandall'd feet on\r\nprinces.' My family interest at a certain exiled court is high, and the\r\nweight which that court ought to possess, and does possess, at Rome is\r\nyet higher--my talents not altogether inferior to the education I have\r\nreceived. In sober judgment, I might have looked forward to high eminence\r\nin the church--in the dream of fancy, to the very highest. Why might\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x9d--(he added, laughing, for it was part of his manner to keep much of\r\nhis discourse apparently betwixt jest and earnest)--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy might not\r\nCardinal Osbaldistone have swayed the fortunes of empires, well-born and\r\nwell-connected, as well as the low-born Mazarin, or Alberoni, the son of\r\nan Italian gardener?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I can give you no reason to the contrary; but in your place I\r\nshould not much regret losing the chance of such precarious and invidious\r\nelevation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither would I,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwere I sure that my present establishment\r\nwas more certain; but that must depend upon circumstances which I can\r\nonly learn by experience--the disposition of your father, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfess the truth without finesse, Rashleigh; you would willingly know\r\nsomething of him from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince, like Die Vernon, you make a point of following the banner of the\r\ngood knight Sincerity, I reply--certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you will find in my father a man who has followed the paths\r\nof thriving more for the exercise they afforded to his talents, than for\r\nthe love of the gold with which they are strewed. His active mind would\r\nhave been happy in any situation which gave it scope for exertion, though\r\nthat exertion had been its sole reward. But his wealth has accumulated,\r\nbecause, moderate and frugal in his habits, no new sources of expense\r\nhave occurred to dispose of his increasing income. He is a man who hates\r\ndissimulation in others; never practises it himself; and is peculiarly\r\nalert in discovering motives through the colouring of language. Himself\r\nsilent by habit, he is readily disgusted by great talkers; the rather,\r\nthat the circumstances by which he is most interested, afford no great\r\nscope for conversation. He is severely strict in the duties of religion;\r\nbut you have no reason to fear his interference with yours, for he\r\nregards toleration as a sacred principle of political economy. But if you\r\nhave any Jacobitical partialities, as is naturally to be supposed, you\r\nwill do well to suppress them in his presence, as well as the least\r\ntendency to the highflying or Tory principles; for he holds both in utter\r\ndetestation. For the rest, his word is his own bond, and must be the law\r\nof all who act under him. He will fail in his duty to no one, and will\r\npermit no one to fail towards him; to cultivate his favour, you must\r\nexecute his commands, instead of echoing his sentiments. His greatest\r\nfailings arise out of prejudices connected with his own profession, or\r\nrather his exclusive devotion to it, which makes him see little worthy of\r\npraise or attention, unless it be in some measure connected with\r\ncommerce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO rare-painted portrait!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rashleigh, when I was\r\nsilent--\xe2\x80\x9cVandyke was a dauber to you, Frank. I see thy sire before me in\r\nall his strength and weakness; loving and honouring the King as a sort\r\nof lord mayor of the empire, or chief of the board of trade--venerating\r\nthe Commons, for the acts regulating the export trade--and respecting\r\nthe Peers, because the Lord Chancellor sits on a woolsack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine was a likeness, Rashleigh; yours is a caricature. But in return for\r\nthe _carte du pays_ which I have unfolded to you, give me some lights on\r\nthe geography of the unknown lands\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn which you are wrecked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth while; it is\r\nno Isle of Calypso, umbrageous with shade and intricate with silvan\r\nlabyrinth--but a bare ragged Northumbrian moor, with as little to\r\ninterest curiosity as to delight the eye; you may descry it in all its\r\nnakedness in half an hour's survey, as well as if I were to lay it down\r\nbefore you by line and compass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but something there is, worthy a more attentive survey--What say you\r\nto Miss Vernon? Does not she form an interesting object in the landscape,\r\nwere all round as rude as Iceland's coast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could plainly perceive that Rashleigh disliked the topic now presented\r\nto him; but my frank communication had given me the advantageous title to\r\nmake inquiries in my turn. Rashleigh felt this, and found himself obliged\r\nto follow my lead, however difficult he might find it to play his cards\r\nsuccessfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI have known less of Miss Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor some\r\ntime, than I was wont to do formerly. In early age I was her tutor; but\r\nas she advanced towards womanhood, my various avocations,--the gravity of\r\nthe profession to which I was destined,--the peculiar nature of her\r\nengagements,--our mutual situation, in short, rendered a close and\r\nconstant intimacy dangerous and improper. I believe Miss Vernon might\r\nconsider my reserve as unkindness, but it was my duty; I felt as much as\r\nshe seemed to do, when compelled to give way to prudence. But where was\r\nthe safety in cultivating an intimacy with a beautiful and susceptible\r\ngirl, whose heart, you are aware, must be given either to the cloister or\r\nto a betrothed husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cloister or a betrothed husband?\xe2\x80\x9d I echoed--\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the alternative\r\ndestined for Miss Vernon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI need not, I suppose,\r\ncaution you against the danger of cultivating too closely the friendship\r\nof Miss Vernon;--you are a man of the world, and know how far you can\r\nindulge yourself in her society with safety to yourself, and justice to\r\nher. But I warn you, that, considering her ardent temper, you must let\r\nyour experience keep guard over her as well as yourself, for the specimen\r\nof yesterday may serve to show her extreme thoughtlessness and neglect of\r\ndecorum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something, I was sensible, of truth, as well as good sense, in\r\nall this; it seemed to be given as a friendly warning, and I had no right\r\nto take it amiss; yet I felt I could with pleasure have run Rashleigh\r\nOsbaldistone through the body all the time he was speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce take his insolence!\xe2\x80\x9d was my internal meditation. \xe2\x80\x9cWould he\r\nwish me to infer that Miss Vernon had fallen in love with that\r\nhatchet-face of his, and become degraded so low as to require his shyness\r\nto cure her of an imprudent passion? I will have his meaning from him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was my resolution, \xe2\x80\x9cif I should drag it out with cart-ropes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, I placed my temper under as accurate a guard as I\r\ncould, and observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat, for a lady of her good sense and acquired\r\naccomplishments, it was to be regretted that Miss Vernon's manners were\r\nrather blunt and rustic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrank and unreserved, at least, to the extreme,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rashleigh:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyet, trust me, she has an excellent heart. To tell you the truth, should\r\nshe continue her extreme aversion to the cloister, and to her destined\r\nhusband, and should my own labours in the mine of Plutus promise to\r\nsecure me a decent independence, I shall think of reviewing our\r\nacquaintance and sharing it with Miss Vernon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all his fine voice, and well-turned periods,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cthis same\r\nRashleigh Osbaldistone is the ugliest and most conceited coxcomb I ever\r\nmet with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rashleigh, as if thinking aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI should not like to\r\nsupplant Thorncliff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupplant Thorncliff!--Is your brother Thorncliff,\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired, with\r\ngreat surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cthe destined husband of Diana Vernon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ay, her father's commands, and a certain family-contract, destined\r\nher to marry one of Sir Hildebrand's sons. A dispensation has been\r\nobtained from Rome to Diana Vernon to marry _Blank_ Osbaldistone, Esq.,\r\nson of Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, of Osbaldistone Hall, Bart., and so\r\nforth; and it only remains to pitch upon the happy man whose name shall\r\nfill the gap in the manuscript. Now, as Percie is seldom sober, my father\r\npitched on Thorncliff, as the second prop of the family, and therefore\r\nmost proper to carry on the line of the Osbaldistones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, forcing myself to assume an air of pleasantry,\r\nwhich, I believe, became me extremely ill, \xe2\x80\x9cwould perhaps have been\r\ninclined to look a little lower on the family-tree, for the branch to\r\nwhich she was desirous of clinging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is room for little choice in our\r\nfamily; Dick is a gambler, John a boor, and Wilfred an ass. I believe my\r\nfather really made the best selection for poor Die, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe present company,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing always excepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my destination to the church placed me out of the question;\r\notherwise I will not affect to say, that, qualified by my education both\r\nto instruct and guide Miss Vernon, I might not have been a more\r\ncreditable choice than any of my elders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so thought the young lady, doubtless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rashleigh, with an affectation of\r\ndenial which was contrived to convey the strongest affirmation the case\r\nadmitted of: \xe2\x80\x9cfriendship--only friendship--formed the tie betwixt us, and\r\nthe tender affection of an opening mind to its only instructor--Love came\r\nnot near us--I told you I was wise in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt little inclination to pursue this conversation any farther, and\r\nshaking myself clear of Rashleigh, withdrew to my own apartment, which I\r\nrecollect I traversed with much vehemence of agitation, repeating aloud\r\nthe expressions which had most offended me.--\xe2\x80\x9cSusceptible--ardent--tender\r\naffection--Love--Diana Vernon, the most beautiful creature I ever beheld,\r\nin love with him, the bandy-legged, bull-necked, limping scoundrel!\r\nRichard the Third in all but his hump-back!--And yet the opportunities he\r\nmust have had during his cursed course of lectures; and the fellow's\r\nflowing and easy strain of sentiment; and her extreme seclusion from\r\nevery one who spoke and acted with common sense; ay, and her obvious\r\npique at him, mixed with admiration of his talents, which looked as like\r\nthe result of neglected attachment as anything else--Well, and what is it\r\nto me, that I should storm and rage at it? Is Diana Vernon the first\r\npretty girl that has loved and married an ugly fellow? And if she were\r\nfree of every Osbaldistone of them, what concern is it of mine?--a\r\nCatholic--a Jacobite--a termagant into the boot--for me to look that way\r\nwere utter madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy throwing such reflections on the flame of my displeasure, I subdued it\r\ninto a sort of smouldering heart-burning, and appeared at the\r\ndinner-table in as sulky a humour as could well be imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELFTH.\r\n\r\n          Drunk?--and speak parrot?--and squabble?--swagger?--\r\n          Swear?--and discourse fustian with one's own shadow?\r\n                                           Othello.\r\n\r\nI have already told you, my dear Tresham, what probably was no news to\r\nyou, that my principal fault was an unconquerable pitch of pride, which\r\nexposed me to frequent mortification. I had not even whispered to myself\r\nthat I loved Diana Vernon; yet no sooner did I hear Rashleigh talk of her\r\nas a prize which he might stoop to carry off, or neglect, at his\r\npleasure, than every step which the poor girl had taken, in the innocence\r\nand openness of her heart, to form a sort of friendship with me, seemed\r\nin my eyes the most insulting coquetry.--\xe2\x80\x9cSoh! she would secure me as a\r\n_pis aller,_ I suppose, in case Mr. Rashleigh Osbaldistone should not\r\ntake compassion upon her! But I will satisfy her that I am not a person\r\nto be trepanned in that manner--I will make her sensible that I see\r\nthrough her arts, and that I scorn them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not reflect for a moment, that all this indignation, which I had no\r\nright whatever to entertain, proved that I was anything but indifferent\r\nto Miss Vernon's charms; and I sate down to table in high ill-humour with\r\nher and all the daughters of Eve.\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon heard me, with surprise, return ungracious answers to one or\r\ntwo playful strokes of satire which she threw out with her usual freedom\r\nof speech; but, having no suspicion that offence was meant, she only\r\nreplied to my rude repartees with jests somewhat similar, but polished by\r\nher good temper, though pointed by her wit. At length she perceived I was\r\nreally out of humour, and answered one of my rude speeches thus:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say, Mr. Frank, that one may gather sense from fools--I heard\r\ncousin Wilfred refuse to play any longer at cudgels the other day with\r\ncousin Thornie, because cousin Thornie got angry, and struck harder than\r\nthe rules of amicable combat, it seems, permitted. 'Were I to break your\r\nhead in good earnest,' quoth honest Wilfred, 'I care not how angry you\r\nare, for I should do it so much the more easily but it's hard I should\r\nget raps over the costard, and only pay you back in make-believes'--Do\r\nyou understand the moral of this, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never felt myself under the necessity, madam, of studying how to\r\nextract the slender portion of sense with which this family season their\r\nconversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNecessity! and madam!--You surprise me, Mr. Osbaldistone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am unfortunate in doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to suppose that this capricious tone is serious? or is it only\r\nassumed, to make your good-humour more valuable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a right to the attention of so many gentlemen in this family,\r\nMiss Vernon, that it cannot be worth your while to inquire into the cause\r\nof my stupidity and bad spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cam I to understand, then, that you have deserted my\r\nfaction, and gone over to the enemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, looking across the table, and observing that Rashleigh, who was\r\nseated opposite, was watching us with a singular expression of interest\r\non his harsh features, she continued--\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x9cHorrible thought!--Ay, now I see 'tis true,\r\n              For the grim-visaged Rashleigh smiles on me,\r\n                     And points at thee for his!--\r\n\r\nWell, thank Heaven, and the unprotected state which has taught me\r\nendurance, I do not take offence easily; and that I may not be forced to\r\nquarrel, whether I like it or no, I have the honour, earlier than usual,\r\nto wish you a happy digestion of your dinner and your bad humour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she left the table accordingly.\r\n\r\nUpon Miss Vernon's departure, I found myself very little satisfied with\r\nmy own conduct. I had hurled back offered kindness, of which\r\ncircumstances had but lately pointed out the honest sincerity, and I had\r\nbut just stopped short of insulting the beautiful, and, as she had said\r\nwith some emphasis, the unprotected being by whom it was proffered. My\r\nconduct seemed brutal in my own eyes. To combat or drown these painful\r\nreflections, I applied myself more frequently than usual to the wine\r\nwhich circulated on the table.\r\n\r\nThe agitated state of my feelings combined with my habits of temperance\r\nto give rapid effect to the beverage. Habitual topers, I believe, acquire\r\nthe power of soaking themselves with a quantity of liquor that does\r\nlittle more than muddy those intellects which in their sober state are\r\nnone of the clearest; but men who are strangers to the vice of\r\ndrunkenness as a habit, are more powerfully acted upon by intoxicating\r\nliquors. My spirits, once aroused, became extravagant; I talked a great\r\ndeal, argued upon what I knew nothing of, told stories of which I forgot\r\nthe point, then laughed immoderately at my own forgetfulness; I accepted\r\nseveral bets without having the least judgment; I challenged the giant\r\nJohn to wrestle with me, although he had kept the ring at Hexham for a\r\nyear, and I never tried so much as a single fall.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had the goodness to interpose and prevent this consummation of\r\ndrunken folly, which, I suppose, would have otherwise ended in my neck\r\nbeing broken.\r\n\r\nIt has even been reported by maligners, that I sung a song while under\r\nthis vinous influence; but, as I remember nothing of it, and never\r\nattempted to turn a tune in all my life before or since, I would\r\nwillingly hope there is no actual foundation for the calumny. I was\r\nabsurd enough without this exaggeration. Without positively losing my\r\nsenses, I speedily lost all command of my temper, and my impetuous\r\npassions whirled me onward at their pleasure. I had sate down sulky and\r\ndiscontented, and disposed to be silent--the wine rendered me loquacious,\r\ndisputatious, and quarrelsome. I contradicted whatever was asserted, and\r\nattacked, without any respect to my uncle's table, both his politics and\r\nhis religion. The affected moderation of Rashleigh, which he well knew\r\nhow to qualify with irritating ingredients, was even more provoking to me\r\nthan the noisy and bullying language of his obstreperous brothers. My\r\nuncle, to do him justice, endeavoured to bring us to order; but his\r\nauthority was lost amidst the tumult of wine and passion. At length,\r\nfrantic at some real or supposed injurious insinuation, I actually struck\r\nRashleigh with my fist. No Stoic philosopher, superior to his own passion\r\nand that of others, could have received an insult with a higher degree of\r\nscorn. What he himself did not think it apparently worth while to resent,\r\nThorncliff resented for him. Swords were drawn, and we exchanged one or\r\ntwo passes, when the other brothers separated us by main force; and I\r\nshall never forget the diabolical sneer which writhed Rashleigh's wayward\r\nfeatures, as I was forced from the apartment by the main strength of two\r\nof these youthful Titans. They secured me in my apartment by locking the\r\ndoor, and I heard them, to my inexpressible rage, laugh heartily as they\r\ndescended the stairs. I essayed in my fury to break out; but the\r\nwindow-grates, and the strength of a door clenched with iron, resisted my\r\nefforts. At length I threw myself on my bed, and fell asleep amidst vows\r\nof dire revenge to be taken in the ensuing day.\r\n\r\nBut with the morning cool repentance came. I felt, in the keenest manner,\r\nthe violence and absurdity of my conduct, and was obliged to confess that\r\nwine and passion had lowered my intellects even below those of Wilfred\r\nOsbaldistone, whom I held in so much contempt. My uncomfortable\r\nreflections were by no means soothed by meditating the necessity of an\r\napology for my improper behaviour, and recollecting that Miss Vernon must\r\nbe a witness of my submission. The impropriety and unkindness of my\r\nconduct to her personally, added not a little to these galling\r\nconsiderations, and for this I could not even plead the miserable excuse\r\nof intoxication.\r\n\r\nUnder all these aggravating feelings of shame and degradation, I\r\ndescended to the breakfast hall, like a criminal to receive sentence. It\r\nchanced that a hard frost had rendered it impossible to take out the\r\nhounds, so that I had the additional mortification to meet the family,\r\nexcepting only Rashleigh and Miss Vernon, in full divan, surrounding the\r\ncold venison pasty and chine of beef. They were in high glee as I\r\nentered, and I could easily imagine that the jests were furnished at my\r\nexpense. In fact, what I was disposed to consider with serious pain, was\r\nregarded as an excellent good joke by my uncle, and the greater part of\r\nmy cousins. Sir Hildebrand, while he rallied me on the exploits of the\r\npreceding evening, swore he thought a young fellow had better be thrice\r\ndrunk in one day, than sneak sober to bed like a Presbyterian, and leave\r\na batch of honest fellows, and a double quart of claret. And to back this\r\nconsolatory speech, he poured out a large bumper of brandy, exhorting me\r\nto swallow \xe2\x80\x9ca hair of the dog that had bit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind these lads laughing, nevoy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cthey would have\r\nbeen all as great milksops as yourself, had I not nursed them, as one may\r\nsay, on the toast and tankard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIll-nature was not the fault of my cousins in general; they saw I was\r\nvexed and hurt at the recollections of the preceding evening, and\r\nendeavoured, with clumsy kindness, to remove the painful impression they\r\nhad made on me. Thorncliff alone looked sullen and unreconciled. This\r\nyoung man had never liked me from the beginning; and in the marks of\r\nattention occasionally shown me by his brothers, awkward as they were, he\r\nalone had never joined. If it was true, of which, however, I began to\r\nhave my doubts, that he was considered by the family, or regarded\r\nhimself, as the destined husband of Miss Vernon, a sentiment of jealousy\r\nmight have sprung up in his mind from the marked predilection which it\r\nwas that young lady's pleasure to show for one whom Thorncliff might,\r\nperhaps, think likely to become a dangerous rival.\r\n\r\nRashleigh at last entered, his visage as dark as mourning weed--brooding,\r\nI could not but doubt, over the unjustifiable and disgraceful insult I\r\nhad offered to him. I had already settled in my own mind how I was to\r\nbehave on the occasion, and had schooled myself to believe, that true\r\nhonour consisted not in defending, but in apologising for, an injury so\r\nmuch disproportioned to any provocation I might have to allege.\r\n\r\nI therefore hastened to meet Rashleigh, and to express myself in the\r\nhighest degree sorry for the violence with which I had acted on the\r\npreceding evening. \xe2\x80\x9cNo circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9ccould have wrung from me\r\na single word of apology, save my own consciousness of the impropriety of\r\nmy behaviour. I hoped my cousin would accept of my regrets so sincerely\r\noffered, and consider how much of my misconduct was owing to the\r\nexcessive hospitality of Osbaldistone Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall be friends with thee, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the honest knight, in the\r\nfull effusion of his heart; \xe2\x80\x9cor d--n me, if I call him son more!--Why,\r\nRashie, dost stand there like a log? _Sorry for it_ is all a gentleman\r\ncan say, if he happens to do anything awry, especially over his claret. I\r\nserved in Hounslow, and should know something, I think, of affairs of\r\nhonour. Let me hear no more of this, and we'll go in a body and rummage\r\nout the badger in Birkenwood-bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh's face resembled, as I have already noticed, no other\r\ncountenance that I ever saw. But this singularity lay not only in the\r\nfeatures, but in the mode of changing their expression. Other\r\ncountenances, in altering from grief to joy, or from anger to\r\nsatisfaction, pass through some brief interval, ere the expression of the\r\npredominant passion supersedes entirely that of its predecessor. There is\r\na sort of twilight, like that between the clearing up of the darkness and\r\nthe rising of the sun, while the swollen muscles subside, the dark eye\r\nclears, the forehead relaxes and expands itself, and the whole\r\ncountenance loses its sterner shades, and becomes serene and placid.\r\nRashleigh's face exhibited none of these gradations, but changed almost\r\ninstantaneously from the expression of one passion to that of the\r\ncontrary. I can compare it to nothing but the sudden shifting of a scene\r\nin the theatre, where, at the whistle of the prompter, a cavern\r\ndisappears, and a grove arises.\r\n\r\nMy attention was strongly arrested by this peculiarity on the present\r\noccasion. At Rashleigh's first entrance, \xe2\x80\x9cblack he stood as night!\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthe same inflexible countenance he heard my excuse and his father's\r\nexhortation; and it was not until Sir Hildebrand had done speaking, that\r\nthe cloud cleared away at once, and he expressed, in the kindest and most\r\ncivil terms, his perfect satisfaction with the very handsome apology I\r\nhad offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have so poor a brain myself, when I impose on it\r\nthe least burden beyond my usual three glasses, that I have only, like\r\nhonest Cassio, a very vague recollection of the confusion of last\r\nnight--remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly--a quarrel, but\r\nnothing wherefore--So, my dear Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, shaking me kindly\r\nby the hand, \xe2\x80\x9cconceive how much I am relieved by finding that I have to\r\nreceive an apology, instead of having to make one--I will not have a\r\nword said upon the subject more; I should be very foolish to institute\r\nany scrutiny into an account, when the balance, which I expected to be\r\nagainst me, has been so unexpectedly and agreeably struck in my favour.\r\nYou see, Mr. Osbaldistone, I am practising the language of Lombard\r\nStreet, and qualifying myself for my new calling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I was about to answer, and raised my eyes for the purpose, they\r\nencountered those of Miss Vernon, who, having entered the room unobserved\r\nduring the conversation, had given it her close attention. Abashed and\r\nconfounded, I fixed my eyes on the ground, and made my escape to the\r\nbreakfast-table, where I herded among my busy cousins.\r\n\r\nMy uncle, that the events of the preceding day might not pass out of our\r\nmemory without a practical moral lesson, took occasion to give Rashleigh\r\nand me his serious advice to correct our milksop habits, as he termed\r\nthem, and gradually to inure our brains to bear a gentlemanlike quantity\r\nof liquor, without brawls or breaking of heads. He recommended that we\r\nshould begin piddling with a regular quart of claret per day, which, with\r\nthe aid of March beer and brandy, made a handsome competence for a\r\nbeginner in the art of toping. And for our encouragement, he assured us\r\nthat he had known many a man who had lived to our years without having\r\ndrunk a pint of wine at a sitting, who yet, by falling into honest\r\ncompany, and following hearty example, had afterwards been numbered among\r\nthe best good fellows of the time, and could carry off their six bottles\r\nunder their belt quietly and comfortably, without brawling or babbling,\r\nand be neither sick nor sorry the next morning.\r\n\r\nSage as this advice was, and comfortable as was the prospect it held out\r\nto me, I profited but little by the exhortation--partly, perhaps,\r\nbecause, as often as I raised my eyes from the table, I observed Miss\r\nVernon's looks fixed on me, in which I thought I could read grave\r\ncompassion blended with regret and displeasure. I began to consider how I\r\nshould seek a scene of explanation and apology with her also, when she\r\ngave me to understand she was determined to save me the trouble of\r\nsoliciting an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cCousin Francis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing me by the\r\nsame title she used to give to the other Osbaldistones, although I had,\r\nproperly speaking, no title to be called her kinsman, \xe2\x80\x9cI have encountered\r\nthis morning a difficult passage in the Divina Comme'dia of Dante; will\r\nyou have the goodness to step to the library and give me your assistance?\r\nand when you have unearthed for me the meaning of the obscure Florentine,\r\nwe will join the rest at Birkenwood-bank, and see their luck at\r\nunearthing the badger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified, of course, my readiness to wait upon her. Rashleigh made an\r\noffer to accompany us. \xe2\x80\x9cI am something better skilled,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\ntracking the sense of Dante through the metaphors and elisions of his\r\nwild and gloomy poem, than at hunting the poor inoffensive hermit yonder\r\nout of his cave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cbut as you are to occupy Mr.\r\nFrancis's place in the counting-house, you must surrender to him the\r\ncharge of your pupil's education at Osbaldistone Hall. We shall call you\r\nin, however, if there is any occasion; so pray do not look so grave upon\r\nit. Besides, it is a shame to you not to understand field-sports--What\r\nwill you do should our uncle in Crane-Alley ask you the signs by which\r\nyou track a badger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, true, Die,--true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Hildebrand, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI misdoubt\r\nRashleigh will be found short at the leap when he is put to the trial. An\r\nhe would ha' learned useful knowledge like his brothers, he was bred up\r\nwhere it grew, I wuss; but French antics, and book-learning, with the new\r\nturnips, and the rats, and the Hanoverians, ha' changed the world that I\r\nha' known in Old England--But come along with us, Rashie, and carry my\r\nhunting-staff, man; thy cousin lacks none of thy company as now, and I\r\nwonna ha' Die crossed--It's ne'er be said there was but one woman in\r\nOsbaldistone Hall, and she died for lack of her will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh followed his father, as he commanded, not, however, ere he had\r\nwhispered to Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must in discretion bring the courtier,\r\nCeremony, in my company, and knock when I approach the door of the\r\nlibrary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon; \xe2\x80\x9cdismiss from your company the\r\nfalse archimage Dissimulation, and it will better ensure your free access\r\nto our classical consultations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she led the way to the library, and I followed--like a\r\ncriminal, I was going to say, to execution; but, as I bethink me, I have\r\nused the simile once, if not twice before. Without any simile at all,\r\nthen, I followed, with a sense of awkward and conscious embarrassment,\r\nwhich I would have given a great deal to shake off. I thought it a\r\ndegrading and unworthy feeling to attend one on such an occasion, having\r\nbreathed the air of the Continent long enough to have imbibed the notion\r\nthat lightness, gallantry, and something approaching to well-bred\r\nself-assurance, should distinguish the gentleman whom a fair lady selects\r\nfor her companion in a _tete-a-tete._\r\n\r\nMy English feelings, however, were too many for my French education, and\r\nI made, I believe, a very pitiful figure, when Miss Vernon, seating\r\nherself majestically in a huge elbow-chair in the library, like a judge\r\nabout to hear a cause of importance, signed to me to take a chair\r\nopposite to her (which I did, much like the poor fellow who is going to\r\nbe tried), and entered upon conversation in a tone of bitter irony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Dire was his thought, who first in poison steeped\r\n              The weapon formed for slaughter--direr his,\r\n                  And worthier of damnation, who instilled\r\n                  The mortal venom in the social cup,\r\n              To fill the veins with death instead of life.\r\n                                                 Anonymous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my Word, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, with the air\r\nof one who thought herself fully entitled to assume the privilege of\r\nironical reproach, which she was pleased to exert, \xe2\x80\x9cyour character\r\nimproves upon us, sir--I could not have thought that it was in you.\r\nYesterday might be considered as your assay-piece, to prove yourself\r\nentitled to be free of the corporation of Osbaldistone Hall. But it was a\r\nmasterpiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite sensible of my ill-breeding, Miss Vernon, and I can only say\r\nfor myself that I had received some communications by which my spirits\r\nwere unusually agitated. I am conscious I was impertinent and absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do yourself great injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the merciless monitor--\xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\ncontrived, by what I saw and have since heard, to exhibit in the course\r\nof one evening a happy display of all the various masterly qualifications\r\nwhich distinguish your several cousins;--the gentle and generous temper\r\nof the benevolent Rashleigh,--the temperance of Percie,--the cool courage\r\nof Thorncliff,--John's skill in dog-breaking,--Dickon's aptitude to\r\nbetting,--all exhibited by the single individual, Mr. Francis, and that\r\nwith a selection of time, place, and circumstance, worthy the taste and\r\nsagacity of the sapient Wilfred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a little mercy, Miss Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; for I confess I thought the\r\nschooling as severe as the case merited, especially considering from what\r\nquarter it came, \xe2\x80\x9cand forgive me if I suggest, as an excuse for follies I\r\nam not usually guilty of, the custom of this house and country. I am far\r\nfrom approving of it; but we have Shakspeare's authority for saying, that\r\ngood wine is a good familiar creature, and that any man living may be\r\novertaken at some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Mr. Francis, but he places the panegyric and the apology in the\r\nmouth of the greatest villain his pencil has drawn. I will not, however,\r\nabuse the advantage your quotation has given me, by overwhelming you with\r\nthe refutation with which the victim Cassio replies to the tempter Iago.\r\nI only wish you to know, that there is one person at least sorry to see a\r\nyouth of talents and expectations sink into the slough in which the\r\ninhabitants of this house are nightly wallowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have but wet my shoe, I assure you, Miss Vernon, and am too sensible\r\nof the filth of the puddle to step farther in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf such be your resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a wise one. But I was\r\nso much vexed at what I heard, that your concerns have pressed before my\r\nown,--You behaved to me yesterday, during dinner, as if something had\r\nbeen told you which lessened or lowered me in your opinion--I beg leave\r\nto ask you what it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was stupified. The direct bluntness of the demand was much in the style\r\none gentleman uses to another, when requesting explanation of any part of\r\nhis conduct in a good-humoured yet determined manner, and was totally\r\ndevoid of the circumlocutions, shadings, softenings, and periphrasis,\r\nwhich usually accompany explanations betwixt persons of different sexes\r\nin the higher orders of society.\r\n\r\nI remained completely embarrassed; for it pressed on my recollection,\r\nthat Rashleigh's communications, supposing them to be correct, ought to\r\nhave rendered Miss Vernon rather an object of my compassion than of my\r\npettish resentment; and had they furnished the best apology possible for\r\nmy own conduct, still I must have had the utmost difficulty in detailing\r\nwhat inferred such necessary and natural offence to Miss Vernon's\r\nfeelings. She observed my hesitation, and proceeded, in a tone somewhat\r\nmore peremptory, but still temperate and civil--\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mr. Osbaldistone\r\ndoes not dispute my title to request this explanation. I have no relative\r\nwho can protect me; it is, therefore, just that I be permitted to protect\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI endeavoured with hesitation to throw the blame of my rude behaviour\r\nupon indisposition--upon disagreeable letters from London. She suffered\r\nme to exhaust my apologies, and fairly to run myself aground, listening\r\nall the while with a smile of absolute incredulity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Mr. Francis, having gone through your prologue of excuses, with\r\nthe same bad grace with which all prologues are delivered, please to draw\r\nthe curtain, and show me that which I desire to see. In a word, let me\r\nknow what Rashleigh says of me; for he is the grand engineer and first\r\nmover of all the machinery of Osbaldistone Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, supposing there was anything to tell, Miss Vernon, what does he\r\ndeserve that betrays the secrets of one ally to another?--Rashleigh, you\r\nyourself told me, remained your ally, though no longer your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have neither patience for evasion, nor inclination for jesting, on the\r\npresent subject. Rashleigh cannot--ought not--dare not, hold any language\r\nrespecting me, Diana Vernon, but what I may demand to hear repeated. That\r\nthere are subjects of secrecy and confidence between us, is most certain;\r\nbut to such, his communications to you could have no relation; and with\r\nsuch, I, as an individual, have no concern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had by this time recovered my presence of mind, and hastily determined\r\nto avoid making any disclosure of what Rashleigh had told me in a sort of\r\nconfidence. There was something unworthy in retailing private\r\nconversation; it could, I thought, do no good, and must necessarily give\r\nMiss Vernon great pain. I therefore replied, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat nothing but\r\nfrivolous talk had passed between Mr. Rashleigh Osbaldistone and me on\r\nthe state of the family at the Hall; and I protested, that nothing had\r\nbeen said which left a serious impression to her disadvantage. As a\r\ngentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could not be more explicit in reporting private\r\nconversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started up with the animation of a Camilla about to advance into\r\nbattle. \xe2\x80\x9cThis shall not serve your turn, sir,--I must have another answer\r\nfrom you.\xe2\x80\x9d Her features kindled--her brow became flushed--her eye glanced\r\nwild-fire as she proceeded--\xe2\x80\x9cI demand such an explanation, as a woman\r\nbasely slandered has a right to demand from every man who calls himself a\r\ngentleman--as a creature, motherless, friendless, alone in the world,\r\nleft to her own guidance and protection, has a right to require from\r\nevery being having a happier lot, in the name of that God who sent _them_\r\ninto the world to enjoy, and _her_ to suffer. You shall not deny me--or,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added, looking solemnly upwards, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will rue your denial, if there\r\nis justice for wrong either on earth or in heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was utterly astonished at her vehemence, but felt, thus conjured, that\r\nit became my duty to lay aside scrupulous delicacy, and gave her briefly,\r\nbut distinctly, the heads of the information which Rashleigh had conveyed\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nShe sate down and resumed her composure, as soon as I entered upon the\r\nsubject, and when I stopped to seek for the most delicate turn of\r\nexpression, she repeatedly interrupted me with \xe2\x80\x9cGo on--pray, go on; the\r\nfirst word which occurs to you is the plainest, and must be the best. Do\r\nnot think of my feelings, but speak as you would to an unconcerned third\r\nparty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus urged and encouraged, I stammered through all the account which\r\nRashleigh had given of her early contract to marry an Osbaldistone, and\r\nof the uncertainty and difficulty of her choice; and there I would\r\nwillingly have paused. But her penetration discovered that there was\r\nstill something behind, and even guessed to what it related.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was ill-natured of Rashleigh to tell this tale on me. I am like\r\nthe poor girl in the fairy tale, who was betrothed in her cradle to the\r\nBlack Bear of Norway, but complained chiefly of being called Bruin's\r\nbride by her companions at school. But besides all this, Rashleigh said\r\nsomething of himself with relation to me--Did he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly hinted, that were it not for the idea of supplanting his\r\nbrother, he would now, in consequence of his change of profession, be\r\ndesirous that the word Rashleigh should fill up the blank in the\r\ndispensation, instead of the word Thorncliff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy? indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied--\xe2\x80\x9cwas he so very condescending?--Too much\r\nhonour for his humble handmaid, Diana Vernon--And she, I suppose, was to\r\nbe enraptured with joy could such a substitute be effected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo confess the truth, he intimated as much, and even farther\r\ninsinuated\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?--Let me hear it all!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he had broken off your mutual intimacy, lest it should have given\r\nrise to an affection by which his destination to the church would not\r\npermit him to profit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to him for his consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Vernon, every\r\nfeature of her fine countenance taxed to express the most supreme degree\r\nof scorn and contempt. She paused a moment, and then said, with her usual\r\ncomposure, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is but little I have heard from you which I did not\r\nexpect to hear, and which I ought not to have expected; because, bating\r\none circumstance, it is all very true. But as there are some poisons so\r\nactive, that a few drops, it is said, will infect a whole fountain, so\r\nthere is one falsehood in Rashleigh's communication, powerful enough to\r\ncorrupt the whole well in which Truth herself is said to have dwelt. It\r\nis the leading and foul falsehood, that, knowing Rashleigh as I have\r\nreason too well to know him, any circumstance on earth could make me\r\nthink of sharing my lot with him. No,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued with a sort of\r\ninward shuddering that seemed to express involuntary horror, \xe2\x80\x9cany lot\r\nrather than that--the sot, the gambler, the bully, the jockey, the\r\ninsensate fool, were a thousand times preferable to Rashleigh:--the\r\nconvent--the jail--the grave, shall be welcome before them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sad and melancholy cadence in her voice, corresponding with\r\nthe strange and interesting romance of her situation. So young, so\r\nbeautiful, so untaught, so much abandoned to herself, and deprived of all\r\nthe support which her sex derives from the countenance and protection of\r\nfemale friends, and even of that degree of defence which arises from the\r\nforms with which the sex are approached in civilised life,--it is scarce\r\nmetaphorical to say, that my heart bled for her. Yet there was an\r\nexpression of dignity in her contempt of ceremony--of upright feeling in\r\nher disdain of falsehood--of firm resolution in the manner in which she\r\ncontemplated the dangers by which she was surrounded, which blended my\r\npity with the warmest admiration. She seemed a princess deserted by her\r\nsubjects, and deprived of her power, yet still scorning those formal\r\nregulations of society which are created for persons of an inferior rank;\r\nand, amid her difficulties, relying boldly and confidently on the justice\r\nof Heaven, and the unshaken constancy of her own mind.\r\n\r\nI offered to express the mingled feelings of sympathy and admiration with\r\nwhich her unfortunate situation and her high spirit combined to impress\r\nme, but she imposed silence on me at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you in jest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I disliked compliments--I now tell\r\nyou in earnest, that I do not ask sympathy, and that I despise\r\nconsolation. What I have borne, I have borne--What I am to bear I will\r\nsustain as I may; no word of commiseration can make a burden feel one\r\nfeather's weight lighter to the slave who must carry it. There is only\r\none human being who could have assisted me, and that is he who has rather\r\nchosen to add to my embarrassment--Rashleigh Osbaldistone.--Yes! the time\r\nonce was that I might have learned to love that man--But, great God! the\r\npurpose for which he insinuated himself into the confidence of one\r\nalready so forlorn--the undeviating and continued assiduity with which he\r\npursued that purpose from year to year, without one single momentary\r\npause of remorse or compassion--the purpose for which he would have\r\nconverted into poison the food he administered to my mind--Gracious\r\nProvidence! what should I have been in this world, and the next, in body\r\nand soul, had I fallen under the arts of this accomplished villain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so much struck with the scene of perfidious treachery which these\r\nwords disclosed, that I rose from my chair hardly knowing what I did,\r\nlaid my hand on the hilt of my sword, and was about to leave the\r\napartment in search of him on whom I might discharge my just indignation.\r\nAlmost breathless, and with eyes and looks in which scorn and indignation\r\nhad given way to the most lively alarm, Miss Vernon threw herself between\r\nme and the door of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d she said--\xe2\x80\x9cstay!--however just your resentment, you do not know\r\nhalf the secrets of this fearful prison-house.\xe2\x80\x9d She then glanced her eyes\r\nanxiously round the room, and sunk her voice almost to a whisper--\xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nbears a charmed life; you cannot assail him without endangering other\r\nlives, and wider destruction. Had it been otherwise, in some hour of\r\njustice he had hardly been safe, even from this weak hand. I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, motioning me back to my seat, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I needed no comforter. I\r\nnow tell you I need no avenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI resumed my seat mechanically, musing on what she said, and recollecting\r\nalso, what had escaped me in my first glow of resentment, that I had no\r\ntitle whatever to constitute myself Miss Vernon's champion. She paused to\r\nlet her own emotions and mine subside, and then addressed me with more\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already said that there is a mystery connected with Rashleigh, of\r\na dangerous and fatal nature. Villain as he is, and as he knows he stands\r\nconvicted in my eyes, I cannot--dare not, openly break with or defy him.\r\nYou also, Mr. Osbaldistone, must bear with him with patience, foil his\r\nartifices by opposing to them prudence, not violence; and, above all, you\r\nmust avoid such scenes as that of last night, which cannot but give him\r\nperilous advantages over you. This caution I designed to give you, and it\r\nwas the object with which I desired this interview; but I have extended\r\nmy confidence farther than I proposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured her it was not misplaced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe that it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have that in your face\r\nand manners which authorises trust. Let us continue to be friends. You\r\nneed not fear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing, while she blushed a little, yet\r\nspeaking with a free and unembarrassed voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat friendship with us\r\nshould prove only a specious name, as the poet says, for another feeling.\r\nI belong, in habits of thinking and acting, rather to your sex, with\r\nwhich I have always been brought up, than to my own. Besides, the fatal\r\nveil was wrapt round me in my cradle; for you may easily believe I have\r\nnever thought of the detestable condition under which I may remove it.\r\nThe time,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cfor expressing my final determination is not\r\narrived, and I would fain have the freedom of wild heath and open air\r\nwith the other commoners of nature, as long as I can be permitted to\r\nenjoy them. And now that the passage in Dante is made so clear, pray go\r\nand see what has become of the badger-baiters. My head aches so much that\r\nI cannot join the party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left the library, but not to join the hunters. I felt that a solitary\r\nwalk was necessary to compose my spirits before I again trusted myself in\r\nRashleigh's company, whose depth of calculating villany had been so\r\nstrikingly exposed to me. In Dubourg's family (as he was of the reformed\r\npersuasion) I had heard many a tale of Romish priests who gratified, at\r\nthe expense of friendship, hospitality, and the most sacred ties of\r\nsocial life, those passions, the blameless indulgence of which is denied\r\nby the rules of their order. But the deliberate system of undertaking the\r\neducation of a deserted orphan of noble birth, and so intimately allied\r\nto his own family, with the perfidious purpose of ultimately seducing\r\nher, detailed as it was by the intended victim with all the glow of\r\nvirtuous resentment, seemed more atrocious to me than the worst of the\r\ntales I had heard at Bourdeaux, and I felt it would be extremely\r\ndifficult for me to meet Rashleigh, and yet to suppress the abhorrence\r\nwith which he impressed me. Yet this was absolutely necessary, not only\r\non account of the mysterious charge which Diana had given me, but because\r\nI had, in reality, no ostensible ground for quarrelling with him.\r\n\r\nI therefore resolved, as far as possible, to meet Rashleigh's\r\ndissimulation with equal caution on my part during our residence in the\r\nsame family; and when he should depart for London, I resolved to give\r\nOwen at least such a hint of his character as might keep him on his guard\r\nover my father's interests. Avarice or ambition, I thought, might have as\r\ngreat, or greater charms, for a mind constituted like Rashleigh's, than\r\nunlawful pleasure; the energy of his character, and his power of assuming\r\nall seeming good qualities, were likely to procure him a high degree of\r\nconfidence, and it was not to be hoped that either good faith or\r\ngratitude would prevent him from abusing it. The task was somewhat\r\ndifficult, especially in my circumstances, since the caution which I\r\nthrew out might be imputed to jealousy of my rival, or rather my\r\nsuccessor, in my father's favour. Yet I thought it absolutely necessary\r\nto frame such a letter, leaving it to Owen, who, in his own line, was\r\nwary, prudent, and circumspect, to make the necessary use of his\r\nknowledge of Rashleigh's true character. Such a letter, therefore, I\r\nindited, and despatched to the post-house by the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nAt my meeting with Rashleigh, he, as well as I, appeared to have taken up\r\ndistant ground, and to be disposed to avoid all pretext for collision. He\r\nwas probably conscious that Miss Vernon's communications had been\r\nunfavourable to him, though he could not know that they extended to\r\ndiscovering his meditated villany towards her. Our intercourse,\r\ntherefore, was reserved on both sides, and turned on subjects of little\r\ninterest. Indeed, his stay at Osbaldistone Hall did not exceed a few days\r\nafter this period, during which I only remarked two circumstances\r\nrespecting him. The first was the rapid and almost intuitive manner in\r\nwhich his powerful and active mind seized upon and arranged the\r\nelementary principles necessary to his new profession, which he now\r\nstudied hard, and occasionally made parade of his progress, as if to show\r\nme how light it was for him to lift the burden which I had flung down\r\nfrom very weariness and inability to carry it. The other remarkable\r\ncircumstance was, that, notwithstanding the injuries with which Miss\r\nVernon charged Rashleigh, they had several private interviews together of\r\nconsiderable length, although their bearing towards each other in public\r\ndid not seem more cordial than usual.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of Rashleigh's departure arrived, his father bade him\r\nfarewell with indifference; his brothers with the ill-concealed glee of\r\nschool-boys who see their task-master depart for a season, and feel a joy\r\nwhich they dare not express; and I myself with cold politeness. When he\r\napproached Miss Vernon, and would have saluted her she drew back with a\r\nlook of haughty disdain; but said, as she extended her hand to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, Rashleigh; God reward you for the good you have done, and\r\nforgive you for the evil you have meditated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen, my fair cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with an air of sanctity, which\r\nbelonged, I thought, to the seminary of Saint Omers; \xe2\x80\x9chappy is he whose\r\ngood intentions have borne fruit in deeds, and whose evil thoughts have\r\nperished in the blossom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were his parting words. \xe2\x80\x9cAccomplished hypocrite!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon\r\nto me, as the door closed behind him--\xe2\x80\x9chow nearly can what we most\r\ndespise and hate, approach in outward manner to that which we most\r\nvenerate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had written to my father by Rashleigh, and also a few lines to Owen,\r\nbesides the confidential letter which I have already mentioned, and which\r\nI thought it more proper and prudent to despatch by another conveyance.\r\nIn these epistles, it would have been natural for me to have pointed out\r\nto my father and my friend, that I was at present in a situation where I\r\ncould improve myself in no respect, unless in the mysteries of hunting\r\nand hawking; and where I was not unlikely to forget, in the company of\r\nrude grooms and horse-boys, any useful knowledge or elegant\r\naccomplishments which I had hitherto acquired. It would also have been\r\nnatural that I should have expressed the disgust and tedium which I was\r\nlikely to feel among beings whose whole souls were centred in\r\nfield-sports or more degrading pastimes--that I should have complained of\r\nthe habitual intemperance of the family in which I was a guest, and the\r\ndifficulty and almost resentment with which my uncle, Sir Hildebrand,\r\nreceived any apology for deserting the bottle. This last, indeed, was a\r\ntopic on which my father, himself a man of severe temperance, was likely\r\nto be easily alarmed, and to have touched upon this spring would to a\r\ncertainty have opened the doors of my prison-house, and would either have\r\nbeen the means of abridging my exile, or at least would have procured me\r\na change of residence during my rustication.\r\n\r\nI say, my dear Tresham, that, considering how very unpleasant a prolonged\r\nresidence at Osbaldistone Hall must have been to a young man of my age,\r\nand with my habits, it might have seemed very natural that I should have\r\npointed out all these disadvantages to my father, in order to obtain his\r\nconsent for leaving my uncle's mansion. Nothing, however, is more\r\ncertain, than that I did not say a single word to this purpose in my\r\nletters to my father and Owen. If Osbaldistone Hall had been Athens in\r\nall its pristine glory of learning, and inhabited by sages, heroes, and\r\npoets, I could not have expressed less inclination to leave it.\r\n\r\nIf thou hast any of the salt of youth left in thee, Tresham, thou wilt be\r\nat no loss to account for my silence on a topic seemingly so obvious.\r\nMiss Vernon's extreme beauty, of which she herself seemed so little\r\nconscious--her romantic and mysterious situation--the evils to which she\r\nwas exposed--the courage with which she seemed to face them--her manners,\r\nmore frank than belonged to her sex, yet, as it seemed to me,\r\nexceeding in frankness only from the dauntless consciousness of her\r\ninnocence,--above all, the obvious and flattering distinction which she\r\nmade in my favour over all other persons, were at once calculated to\r\ninterest my best feelings, to excite my curiosity, awaken my\r\nimagination, and gratify my vanity. I dared not, indeed, confess to\r\nmyself the depth of the interest with which Miss Vernon inspired me, or\r\nthe large share which she occupied in my thoughts. We read together,\r\nwalked together, rode together, and sate together. The studies which she\r\nhad broken off upon her quarrel with Rashleigh, she now resumed, under\r\nthe auspices of a tutor whose views were more sincere, though his\r\ncapacity was far more limited.\r\n\r\nIn truth, I was by no means qualified to assist her in the prosecution of\r\nseveral profound studies which she had commenced with Rashleigh, and\r\nwhich appeared to me more fitted for a churchman than for a beautiful\r\nfemale. Neither can I conceive with what view he should have engaged\r\nDiana in the gloomy maze of casuistry which schoolmen called philosophy,\r\nor in the equally abstruse though more certain sciences of mathematics\r\nand astronomy; unless it were to break down and confound in her mind the\r\ndifference and distinction between the sexes, and to habituate her to\r\ntrains of subtle reasoning, by which he might at his own time invest that\r\nwhich is wrong with the colour of that which is right. It was in the same\r\nspirit, though in the latter case the evil purpose was more obvious, that\r\nthe lessons of Rashleigh had encouraged Miss Vernon in setting at nought\r\nand despising the forms and ceremonial limits which are drawn round\r\nfemales in modern society. It is true, she was sequestrated from all\r\nfemale company, and could not learn the usual rules of decorum, either\r\nfrom example or precept; yet such was her innate modesty, and accurate\r\nsense of what was right and wrong, that she would not of herself have\r\nadopted the bold uncompromising manner which struck me with so much\r\nsurprise on our first acquaintance, had she not been led to conceive that\r\na contempt of ceremony indicated at once superiority of understanding and\r\nthe confidence of conscious innocence. Her wily instructor had, no doubt,\r\nhis own views in levelling those outworks which reserve and caution erect\r\naround virtue. But for these, and for his other crimes, he has long since\r\nanswered at a higher tribunal.\r\n\r\nBesides the progress which Miss Vernon, whose powerful mind readily\r\nadopted every means of information offered to it, had made in more\r\nabstract science, I found her no contemptible linguist, and well\r\nacquainted both with ancient and modern literature. Were it not that\r\nstrong talents will often go farthest when they seem to have least\r\nassistance, it would be almost incredible to tell the rapidity of Miss\r\nVernon's progress in knowledge; and it was still more extraordinary, when\r\nher stock of mental acquisitions from books was compared with her total\r\nignorance of actual life. It seemed as if she saw and knew everything,\r\nexcept what passed in the world around her;--and I believe it was this\r\nvery ignorance and simplicity of thinking upon ordinary subjects, so\r\nstrikingly contrasted with her fund of general knowledge and information,\r\nwhich rendered her conversation so irresistibly fascinating, and rivetted\r\nthe attention to whatever she said or did; since it was absolutely\r\nimpossible to anticipate whether her next word or action was to display\r\nthe most acute perception, or the most profound simplicity. The degree of\r\ndanger which necessarily attended a youth of my age and keen feelings\r\nfrom remaining in close and constant intimacy with an object so amiable,\r\nand so peculiarly interesting, all who remember their own sentiments at\r\nmy age may easily estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Yon lamp its line of quivering light\r\n                      Shoots from my lady's bower;\r\n                 But why should Beauty's lamp be bright\r\n                      At midnight's lonely hour?\r\n                                          OLD BALLAD.\r\n\r\nThe mode of life at Osbaldistone Hall was too uniform to admit of\r\ndescription. Diana Vernon and I enjoyed much of our time in our mutual\r\nstudies; the rest of the family killed theirs in such sports and pastimes\r\nas suited the seasons, in which we also took a share. My uncle was a man\r\nof habits, and by habit became so much accustomed to my presence and mode\r\nof life, that, upon the whole, he was rather fond of me than otherwise. I\r\nmight probably have risen yet higher in his good graces, had I employed\r\nthe same arts for that purpose which were used by Rashleigh, who,\r\navailing himself of his father's disinclination to business, had\r\ngradually insinuated himself into the management of his property. But\r\nalthough I readily gave my uncle the advantage of my pen and my\r\narithmetic so often as he desired to correspond with a neighbour, or\r\nsettle with a tenant, and was, in so far, a more useful inmate in his\r\nfamily than any of his sons, yet I was not willing to oblige Sir\r\nHildebrand by relieving him entirely from the management of his own\r\naffairs; so that, while the good knight admitted that nevoy Frank was a\r\nsteady, handy lad, he seldom failed to remark in the same breath, that he\r\ndid not think he should ha' missed Rashleigh so much as he was like to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nAs it is particularly unpleasant to reside in a family where we are at\r\nvariance with any part of it, I made some efforts to overcome the\r\nill-will which my cousins entertained against me. I exchanged my laced\r\nhat for a jockey-cap, and made some progress in their opinion; I broke a\r\nyoung colt in a manner which carried me further into their good graces. A\r\nbet or two opportunely lost to Dickon, and an extra health pledged with\r\nPercie, placed me on an easy and familiar footing with all the young\r\nsquires, except Thorncliff.\r\n\r\nI have already noticed the dislike entertained against me by this young\r\nfellow, who, as he had rather more sense, had also a much worse temper,\r\nthan any of his brethren. Sullen, dogged, and quarrelsome, he regarded my\r\nresidence at Osbaldistone Hall as an intrusion, and viewed with envious\r\nand jealous eyes my intimacy with Diana Vernon, whom the effect proposed\r\nto be given to a certain family-compact assigned to him as an intended\r\nspouse. That he loved her, could scarcely be said, at least without much\r\nmisapplication of the word; but he regarded her as something appropriated\r\nto himself, and resented internally the interference which he knew not\r\nhow to prevent or interrupt. I attempted a tone of conciliation towards\r\nThorncliff on several occasions; but he rejected my advances with a\r\nmanner about as gracious as that of a growling mastiff, when the animal\r\nshuns and resents a stranger's attempts to caress him. I therefore\r\nabandoned him to his ill-humour, and gave myself no further trouble about\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nSuch was the footing upon which I stood with the family at Osbaldistone\r\nHall; but I ought to mention another of its inmates with whom I\r\noccasionally held some discourse. This was Andrew Fairservice, the\r\ngardener who (since he had discovered that I was a Protestant) rarely\r\nsuffered me to pass him without proffering his Scotch mull for a social\r\npinch. There were several advantages attending this courtesy. In the\r\nfirst place, it was made at no expense, for I never took snuff; and\r\nsecondly, it afforded an excellent apology to Andrew (who was not\r\nparticularly fond of hard labour) for laying aside his spade for several\r\nminutes. But, above all, these brief interviews gave Andrew an\r\nopportunity of venting the news he had collected, or the satirical\r\nremarks which his shrewd northern humour suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am saying, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me one evening, with a face obviously\r\ncharged with intelligence, \xe2\x80\x9cI hae been down at the Trinlay-knowe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Andrew, and I suppose you heard some news at the alehouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, sir; I never gang to the yillhouse--that is unless ony neighbour was\r\nto gie me a pint, or the like o' that; but to gang there on ane's ain\r\ncoat-tail, is a waste o' precious time and hard-won siller.--But I was\r\ndoun at the Trinlay-knowe, as I was saying, about a wee bit business o'\r\nmy ain wi' Mattie Simpson, that wants a forpit or twa o' peers that will\r\nnever be missed in the Ha'-house--and when we were at the thrangest o'\r\nour bargain, wha suld come in but Pate Macready the travelling merchant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPedlar, I suppose you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cE'en as your honour likes to ca' him; but it's a creditable calling and\r\na gainfu', and has been lang in use wi' our folk. Pate's a far-awa cousin\r\no' mine, and we were blythe to meet wi' ane anither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you went and had a jug of ale together, I suppose, Andrew?--For\r\nHeaven's sake, cut short your story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBide a wee--bide a wee; you southrons are aye in sic a hurry, and\r\nthis is something concerns yourself, an ye wad tak patience to\r\nhear't--Yill?--deil a drap o' yill did Pate offer me; but Mattie gae us\r\nbaith a drap skimmed milk, and ane o' her thick ait jannocks, that was\r\nas wat and raw as a divot. O for the bonnie girdle cakes o' the\r\nnorth!--and sae we sat doun and took out our clavers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would take them out just now. Pray, tell me the news, if you\r\nhave got any worth telling, for I can't stop here all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThan, if ye maun hae't, the folk in Lunnun are a' clean wud about this\r\nbit job in the north here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClean wood! what's that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, just real daft--neither to haud nor to bind--a' hirdy-girdy--clean\r\nthrough ither--the deil's ower Jock Wabster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frank and Andrew Fairservice--194]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does all this mean? or what business have I with the devil or\r\nJack Webster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph!\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, looking extremely knowing, \xe2\x80\x9cit's just because--just\r\nthat the dirdum's a' about yon man's pokmanty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose portmanteau? or what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, just the man Morris's, that he said he lost yonder: but if it's no\r\nyour honour's affair, as little is it mine; and I mauna lose this\r\ngracious evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, as if suddenly seized with a violent fit of industry, Andrew began\r\nto labour most diligently.\r\n\r\nMy attention, as the crafty knave had foreseen, was now arrested, and\r\nunwilling, at the same time, to acknowledge any particular interest in\r\nthat affair, by asking direct questions, I stood waiting till the spirit\r\nof voluntary communication should again prompt him to resume his story.\r\nAndrew dug on manfully, and spoke at intervals, but nothing to the\r\npurpose of Mr. Macready's news; and I stood and listened, cursing him in\r\nmy heart, and desirous at the same time to see how long his humour of\r\ncontradiction would prevail over his desire of speaking upon the subject\r\nwhich was obviously uppermost in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm trenching up the sparry-grass, and am gaun to saw some Misegun beans;\r\nthey winna want them to their swine's flesh, I'se warrant--muckle gude\r\nmay it do them. And siclike dung as the grieve has gien me!--it should be\r\nwheat-strae, or aiten at the warst o't, and it's pease dirt, as\r\nfizzenless as chuckie-stanes. But the huntsman guides a' as he likes\r\nabout the stable-yard, and he's selled the best o' the litter, I'se\r\nwarrant. But, howsoever, we mauna lose a turn o' this Saturday at e'en,\r\nfor the wather's sair broken, and if there's a fair day in seven,\r\nSunday's sure to come and lick it up--Howsomever, I'm no denying that it\r\nmay settle, if it be Heaven's will, till Monday morning,--and what's the\r\nuse o' my breaking my back at this rate?--I think, I'll e'en awa' hame,\r\nfor yon's the curfew, as they ca' their jowing-in bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, applying both his hands to his spade, he pitched it upright\r\nin the trench which he had been digging and, looking at me with the air\r\nof superiority of one who knows himself possessed of important\r\ninformation, which he may communicate or refuse at his pleasure, pulled\r\ndown the sleeves of his shirt, and walked slowly towards his coat, which\r\nlay carefully folded up upon a neighbouring garden-seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must pay the penalty of having interrupted the tiresome rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought I to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cand even gratify Mr. Fairservice by taking his\r\ncommunication on his own terms.\xe2\x80\x9d Then raising my voice, I addressed\r\nhim,--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after all, Andrew, what are these London news you had from your\r\nkinsman, the travelling merchant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pedlar, your honour means?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Andrew--\xe2\x80\x9cbut ca' him what ye\r\nwull, they're a great convenience in a country-side that's scant o'\r\nborough-towns like this Northumberland--That's no the case, now, in\r\nScotland;--there's the kingdom of Fife, frae Culross to the East Nuik,\r\nit's just like a great combined city--sae mony royal boroughs yoked on\r\nend to end, like ropes of ingans, with their hie-streets and their\r\nbooths, nae doubt, and their kraemes, and houses of stane and lime and\r\nfore-stairs--Kirkcaldy, the sell o't, is langer than ony town in\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay it is all very splendid and very fine--but you were talking of\r\nthe London news a little while ago, Andrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I dinna think your honour cared to hear about\r\nthem--Howsoever\xe2\x80\x9d (he continued, grinning a ghastly smile), \xe2\x80\x9cPate Macready\r\ndoes say, that they are sair mistrysted yonder in their Parliament House\r\nabout this rubbery o' Mr. Morris, or whatever they ca' the chiel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the House of Parliament, Andrew!--how came they to mention it there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, that's just what I said to Pate; if it like your honour, I'll tell\r\nyou the very words; it's no worth making a lie for the matter--'Pate,'\r\nsaid I, 'what ado had the lords and lairds and gentles at Lunnun wi' the\r\ncarle and his walise?--When we had a Scotch Parliament, Pate,' says I\r\n(and deil rax their thrapples that reft us o't!) 'they sate dousely down\r\nand made laws for a haill country and kinrick, and never fashed their\r\nbeards about things that were competent to the judge ordinar o' the\r\nbounds; but I think,' said I, 'that if ae kailwife pou'd aff her\r\nneighbour's mutch they wad hae the twasome o' them into the Parliament\r\nHouse o' Lunnun. It's just,' said I, 'amaist as silly as our auld daft\r\nlaird here and his gomerils o' sons, wi' his huntsmen and his hounds, and\r\nhis hunting cattle and horns, riding haill days after a bit beast that\r\nwinna weigh sax punds when they hae catched it.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou argued most admirably, Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, willing to encourage him to\r\nget into the marrow of his intelligence; \xe2\x80\x9cand what said Pate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat better could be expected of a wheen pock-pudding\r\nEnglish folk?--But as to the robbery, it's like that when they're a' at\r\nthe thrang o' their Whig and Tory wark, and ca'ing ane anither, like\r\nunhanged blackguards--up gets ae lang-tongued chield, and he says, that\r\na' the north of England were rank Jacobites (and, quietly, he wasna far\r\nwrang maybe), and that they had levied amaist open war, and a king's\r\nmessenger had been stoppit and rubbit on the highway, and that the best\r\nbluid o' Northumberland had been at the doing o't--and mickle gowd ta'en\r\naff him, and mony valuable papers; and that there was nae redress to be\r\ngotten by remeed of law for the first justice o' the peace that the\r\nrubbit man gaed to, he had fund the twa loons that did the deed birling\r\nand drinking wi' him, wha but they; and the justice took the word o' the\r\ntane for the compearance o' the tither; and that they e'en gae him\r\nleg-bail, and the honest man that had lost his siller was fain to leave\r\nthe country for fear that waur had come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan this be really true?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPate swears it's as true as that his ellwand is a yard lang--(and so it\r\nis, just bating an inch, that it may meet the English measure)--And when\r\nthe chield had said his warst, there was a terrible cry for names, and\r\nout comes he wi' this man Morris's name, and your uncle's, and Squire\r\nInglewood's, and other folk's beside\xe2\x80\x9d (looking sly at me)--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\r\nanother dragon o' a chield got up on the other side, and said, wad they\r\naccuse the best gentleman in the land on the oath of a broken\r\ncoward?--for it's like that Morris had been drummed out o' the army for\r\nrinning awa in Flanders; and he said, it was like the story had been\r\nmade up between the minister and him or ever he had left Lunnun; and\r\nthat, if there was to be a search-warrant granted, he thought the siller\r\nwad be fund some gate near to St. James's Palace. Aweel, they trailed up\r\nMorris to their bar, as they ca't, to see what he could say to the job;\r\nbut the folk that were again him, gae him sic an awfu' throughgaun about\r\nhis rinnin' awa, and about a' the ill he had ever dune or said for a'\r\nthe forepart o' his life, that Patie says he looked mair like ane dead\r\nthan living; and they cou'dna get a word o' sense out o' him, for\r\ndownright fright at their growling and routing. He maun be a saft sap,\r\nwi' a head nae better than a fozy frosted turnip--it wad hae ta'en a\r\nhantle o' them to scaur Andrew Fairservice out o' his tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did it all end, Andrew? did your friend happen to learn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, ay; for as his walk is in this country, Pate put aff his journey for\r\nthe space of a week or thereby, because it wad be acceptable to his\r\ncustomers to bring down the news. It's just a' gaed aft like moonshine in\r\nwater. The fallow that began it drew in his horns, and said, that though\r\nhe believed the man had been rubbit, yet he acknowledged he might hae\r\nbeen mista'en about the particulars. And then the other chield got up,\r\nand said, he caredna whether Morris was rubbed or no, provided it wasna\r\nto become a stain on ony gentleman's honour and reputation, especially in\r\nthe north of England; for, said he before them, I come frae the north\r\nmysell, and I carena a boddle wha kens it. And this is what they ca'\r\nexplaining--the tane gies up a bit, and the tither gies up a bit, and a'\r\nfriends again. Aweel, after the Commons' Parliament had tuggit, and\r\nrived, and rugged at Morris and his rubbery till they were tired o't, the\r\nLords' Parliament they behoved to hae their spell o't. In puir auld\r\nScotland's Parliament they a' sate thegither, cheek by choul, and than\r\nthey didna need to hae the same blethers twice ower again. But till't\r\ntheir lordships went wi' as muckle teeth and gude-will, as if the matter\r\nhad been a' speck and span new. Forbye, there was something said about\r\nane Campbell, that suld hae been concerned in the rubbery, mair or less,\r\nand that he suld hae had a warrant frae the Duke of Argyle, as a\r\ntestimonial o' his character. And this put MacCallum More's beard in a\r\nbleize, as gude reason there was; and he gat up wi' an unco bang, and\r\ngarr'd them a' look about them, and wad ram it even doun their throats,\r\nthere was never ane o' the Campbells but was as wight, wise, warlike, and\r\nworthy trust, as auld Sir John the Graeme. Now, if your honour's sure ye\r\narena a drap's bluid a-kin to a Campbell, as I am nane mysell, sae far as\r\nI can count my kin, or hae had it counted to me, I'll gie ye my mind on\r\nthat matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be assured I have no connection whatever with any gentleman of\r\nthe name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, than we may speak it quietly amang oursells. There's baith gude and\r\nbad o' the Campbells, like other names, But this MacCallum More has an\r\nunco sway and say baith, amang the grit folk at Lunnun even now; for he\r\ncanna preceesely be said to belang to ony o' the twa sides o' them, sae\r\ndeil any o' them likes to quarrel wi' him; sae they e'en voted Morris's\r\ntale a fause calumnious libel, as they ca't, and if he hadna gien them\r\nleg-bail, he was likely to hae ta'en the air on the pillory for\r\nleasing-making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo speaking, honest Andrew collected his dibbles, spades, and hoes, and\r\nthrew them into a wheel-barrow,--leisurely, however, and allowing me full\r\ntime to put any further questions which might occur to me before he\r\ntrundled them off to the tool-house, there to repose during the ensuing\r\nday. I thought it best to speak out at once, lest this meddling fellow\r\nshould suppose there were more weighty reasons for my silence than\r\nactually existed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see this countryman of yours, Andrew and to hear his\r\nnews from himself directly. You have probably heard that I had some\r\ntrouble from the impertinent folly of this man Morris\xe2\x80\x9d (Andrew grinned a\r\nmost significant grin), \xe2\x80\x9cand I should wish to see your cousin the\r\nmerchant, to ask him the particulars of what he heard in London, if it\r\ncould be done without much trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaething mair easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Andrew observed; \xe2\x80\x9che had but to hint to his cousin\r\nthat I wanted a pair or twa o' hose, and he wad be wi' me as fast as he\r\ncould lay leg to the grund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, assure him I shall be a customer; and as the night is, as you\r\nsay, settled and fair, I shall walk in the garden until he comes; the\r\nmoon will soon rise over the fells. You may bring him to the little\r\nback-gate; and I shall have pleasure, in the meanwhile, in looking on the\r\nbushes and evergreens by the bright frosty moonlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVara right, vara right--that's what I hae aften said; a kail-blade, or a\r\ncolliflour, glances sae glegly by moonlight, it's like a leddy in her\r\ndiamonds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, off went Andrew Fairservice with great glee. He had to walk\r\nabout two miles, a labour he undertook with the greatest pleasure, in\r\norder to secure to his kinsman the sale of some articles of his trade,\r\nthough it is probable he would not have given him sixpence to treat him\r\nto a quart of ale. \xe2\x80\x9cThe good will of an Englishman would have displayed\r\nitself in a manner exactly the reverse of Andrew's,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, as I\r\npaced along the smooth-cut velvet walks, which, embowered with high,\r\nhedges of yew and of holly, intersected the ancient garden of\r\nOsbaldistone Hall.\r\n\r\nAs I turned to retrace my steps, it was natural that I should lift up my\r\neyes to the windows of the old library; which, small in size, but several\r\nin number, stretched along the second story of that side of the house\r\nwhich now faced me. Light glanced from their casements. I was not\r\nsurprised at this, for I knew Miss Vernon often sat there of an evening,\r\nthough from motives of delicacy I put a strong restraint upon myself, and\r\nnever sought to join her at a time when I knew, all the rest of the\r\nfamily being engaged for the evening, our interviews must necessarily\r\nhave been strictly _tete-a'-tete._ In the mornings we usually read\r\ntogether in the same room; but then it often happened that one or other\r\nof our cousins entered to seek some parchment duodecimo that could be\r\nconverted into a fishing-book, despite its gildings and illumination, or\r\nto tell us of some \xe2\x80\x9csport toward,\xe2\x80\x9d or from mere want of knowing where\r\nelse to dispose of themselves. In short, in the mornings the library was\r\na sort of public room, where man and woman might meet as on neutral\r\nground. In the evening it was very different and bred in a country where\r\nmuch attention is paid, or was at least then paid, to _biense'ance,_ I\r\nwas desirous to think for Miss Vernon concerning those points of\r\npropriety where her experience did not afford her the means of thinking\r\nfor herself. I made her therefore comprehend, as delicately as I could,\r\nthat when we had evening lessons, the presence of a third party was\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon first laughed, then blushed, and was disposed to be\r\ndispleased; and then, suddenly checking herself, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are\r\nvery right; and when I feel inclined to be a very busy scholar, I will\r\nbribe old Martha with a cup of tea to sit by me and be my screen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha, the old housekeeper, partook of the taste of the family at the\r\nHall. A toast and tankard would have pleased her better than all the tea\r\nin China. However, as the use of this beverage was then confined to the\r\nhigher ranks, Martha felt some vanity in being asked to partake of it;\r\nand by dint of a great deal of sugar, many words scarce less sweet, and\r\nabundance of toast and butter, she was sometimes prevailed upon to give\r\nus her countenance. On other occasions, the servants almost unanimously\r\nshunned the library after nightfall, because it was their foolish\r\npleasure to believe that it lay on the haunted side of the house. The\r\nmore timorous had seen sights and heard sounds there when all the rest of\r\nthe house was quiet; and even the young squires were far from having any\r\nwish to enter these formidable precincts after nightfall without\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nThat the library had at one time been a favourite resource of\r\nRashleigh--that a private door out of one side of it communicated with\r\nthe sequestered and remote apartment which he chose for himself, rather\r\nincreased than disarmed the terrors which the household had for the\r\ndreaded library of Osbaldistone Hall. His extensive information as to\r\nwhat passed in the world--his profound knowledge of science of every\r\nkind--a few physical experiments which he occasionally showed off, were,\r\nin a house of so much ignorance and bigotry, esteemed good reasons for\r\nsupposing him endowed with powers over the spiritual world. He understood\r\nGreek, Latin, and Hebrew; and, therefore, according to the apprehension,\r\nand in the phrase of his brother Wilfred, needed not to care \xe2\x80\x9cfor ghaist\r\nor bar-ghaist, devil or dobbie.\xe2\x80\x9d Yea, the servants persisted that they\r\nhad heard him hold conversations in the library, when every varsal soul\r\nin the family were gone to bed; and that he spent the night in watching\r\nfor bogles, and the morning in sleeping in his bed, when he should have\r\nbeen heading the hounds like a true Osbaldistone.\r\n\r\nAll these absurd rumours I had heard in broken hints and imperfect\r\nsentences, from which I was left to draw the inference; and, as easily\r\nmay be supposed, I laughed them to scorn. But the extreme solitude to\r\nwhich this chamber of evil fame was committed every night after curfew\r\ntime, was an additional reason why I should not intrude on Miss Vernon\r\nwhen she chose to sit there in the evening.\r\n\r\nTo resume what I was saying,--I was not surprised to see a glimmering of\r\nlight from the library windows: but I was a little struck when I\r\ndistinctly perceived the shadows of two persons pass along and intercept\r\nthe light from the first of the windows, throwing the casement for a\r\nmoment into shade. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be old Martha,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom Diana has\r\nengaged to be her companion for the evening; or I must have been\r\nmistaken, and taken Diana's shadow for a second person. No, by Heaven! it\r\nappears on the second window,--two figures distinctly traced; and now it\r\nis lost again--it is seen on the third--on the fourth--the darkened forms\r\nof two persons distinctly seen in each window as they pass along the\r\nroom, betwixt the windows and the lights. Whom can Diana have got for a\r\ncompanion?\xe2\x80\x9d--The passage of the shadows between the lights and the\r\ncasements was twice repeated, as if to satisfy me that my observation\r\nserved me truly; after which the lights were extinguished, and the\r\nshades, of course, were seen no more.\r\n\r\nTrifling as this circumstance was, it occupied my mind for a considerable\r\ntime. I did not allow myself to suppose that my friendship for Miss\r\nVernon had any directly selfish view; yet it is incredible the\r\ndispleasure I felt at the idea of her admitting any one to private\r\ninterviews, at a time, and in a place, where, for her own sake, I had\r\nbeen at some trouble to show her that it was improper for me to meet with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilly, romping, incorrigible girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said I to myself, \xe2\x80\x9con whom all good\r\nadvice and delicacy are thrown away! I have been cheated by the\r\nsimplicity of her manner, which I suppose she can assume just as she\r\ncould a straw bonnet, were it the fashion, for the mere sake of\r\ncelebrity. I suppose, notwithstanding the excellence of her\r\nunderstanding, the society of half a dozen of clowns to play at whisk and\r\nswabbers would give her more pleasure than if Ariosto himself were to\r\nawake from the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reflection came the more powerfully across my mind, because, having\r\nmustered up courage to show to Diana my version of the first books of\r\nAriosto, I had requested her to invite Martha to a tea-party in the\r\nlibrary that evening, to which arrangement Miss Vernon had refused her\r\nconsent, alleging some apology which I thought frivolous at the time. I\r\nhad not long speculated on this disagreeable subject, when the\r\nback garden-door opened, and the figures of Andrew and his\r\ncountry-man--bending under his pack--crossed the moonlight alley,\r\nand called my attention elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI found Mr. Macready, as I expected, a tough, sagacious, long-headed\r\nScotchman, and a collector of news both from choice and profession. He\r\nwas able to give me a distinct account of what had passed in the House of\r\nCommons and House of Lords on the affair of Morris, which, it appears,\r\nhad been made by both parties a touchstone to ascertain the temper of the\r\nParliament. It appeared also, that, as I had learned from Andrew, by\r\nsecond hand, the ministry had proved too weak to support a story\r\ninvolving the character of men of rank and importance, and resting upon\r\nthe credit of a person of such indifferent fame as Morris, who was,\r\nmoreover, confused and contradictory in his mode of telling the story.\r\nMacready was even able to supply me with a copy of a printed journal, or\r\nNews-Letter, seldom extending beyond the capital, in which the substance\r\nof the debate was mentioned; and with a copy of the Duke of Argyle's\r\nspeech, printed upon a broadside, of which he had purchased several from\r\nthe hawkers, because, he said, it would be a saleable article on the\r\nnorth of the Tweed. The first was a meagre statement, full of blanks and\r\nasterisks, and which added little or nothing to the information I had\r\nfrom the Scotchman; and the Duke's speech, though spirited and eloquent,\r\ncontained chiefly a panegyric on his country, his family, and his clan,\r\nwith a few compliments, equally sincere, perhaps, though less glowing,\r\nwhich he took so favourable an opportunity of paying to himself. I could\r\nnot learn whether my own reputation had been directly implicated,\r\nalthough I perceived that the honour of my uncle's family had been\r\nimpeached, and that this person Campbell, stated by Morris to have been\r\nthe most active robber of the two by whom he was assailed, was said by\r\nhim to have appeared in the behalf of a Mr. Osbaldistone, and by the\r\nconnivance of the Justice procured his liberation. In this particular,\r\nMorris's story jumped with my own suspicions, which had attached to\r\nCampbell from the moment I saw him appear at Justice Inglewood's. Vexed\r\nupon the whole, as well as perplexed, with this extraordinary story, I\r\ndismissed the two Scotchmen, after making some purchases from Macready,\r\nand a small compliment to Fairservice, and retired to my own apartment to\r\nconsider what I ought to do in defence of my character thus publicly\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEENTH.\r\n\r\n                       Whence, and what art you?\r\n                                       Milton.\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting a sleepless night in meditating on the intelligence I\r\nhad received, I was at first inclined to think that I ought, as speedily\r\nas possible, to return to London, and by my open appearance repel the\r\ncalumny which had been spread against me. But I hesitated to take this\r\ncourse on recollection of my father's disposition, singularly absolute in\r\nhis decisions as to all that concerned his family. He was most able,\r\ncertainly, from experience, to direct what I ought to do, and from his\r\nacquaintance with the most distinguished Whigs then in power, had\r\ninfluence enough to obtain a hearing for my cause. So, upon the whole, I\r\njudged it most safe to state my whole story in the shape of a narrative,\r\naddressed to my father; and as the ordinary opportunities of intercourse\r\nbetween the Hall and the post-town recurred rarely, I determined to ride\r\nto the town, which was about ten miles' distance, and deposit my letter\r\nin the post-office with my own hands.\r\n\r\nIndeed I began to think it strange that though several weeks had elapsed\r\nsince my departure from home, I had received no letter, either from my\r\nfather or Owen, although Rashleigh had written to Sir Hildebrand of his\r\nsafe arrival in London, and of the kind reception he had met with from\r\nhis uncle. Admitting that I might have been to blame, I did not deserve,\r\nin my own opinion at least, to be so totally forgotten by my father; and\r\nI thought my present excursion might have the effect of bringing a letter\r\nfrom him to hand more early than it would otherwise have reached me. But\r\nbefore concluding my letter concerning the affair of Morris, I failed not\r\nto express my earnest hope and wish that my father would honour me with a\r\nfew lines, were it but to express his advice and commands in an affair of\r\nsome difficulty, and where my knowledge of life could not be supposed\r\nadequate to my own guidance. I found it impossible to prevail on myself\r\nto urge my actual return to London as a place of residence, and I\r\ndisguised my unwillingness to do so under apparent submission to my\r\nfather's will, which, as I imposed it on myself as a sufficient reason\r\nfor not urging my final departure from Osbaldistone Hall, would, I\r\ndoubted not, be received as such by my parent. But I begged permission to\r\ncome to London, for a short time at least, to meet and refute the\r\ninfamous calumnies which had been circulated concerning me in so public a\r\nmanner. Having made up my packet, in which my earnest desire to vindicate\r\nmy character was strangely blended with reluctance to quit my present\r\nplace of residence, I rode over to the post-town, and deposited my letter\r\nin the office. By doing so, I obtained possession, somewhat earlier than\r\nI should otherwise have done, of the following letter from my friend Mr.\r\nOwen:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Francis,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours received per favour of Mr. R. Osbaldistone, and note the contents.\r\nShall do Mr. R. O. such civilities as are in my power, and have taken him\r\nto see the Bank and Custom-house. He seems a sober, steady young\r\ngentleman, and takes to business; so will be of service to the firm.\r\nCould have wished another person had turned his mind that way; but God's\r\nwill be done. As cash may be scarce in those parts, have to trust you\r\nwill excuse my enclosing a goldsmith's bill at six days' sight, on\r\nMessrs. Hooper and Girder of Newcastle, for L100, which I doubt not will\r\nbe duly honoured.--I remain, as in duty bound, dear Mr. Frank, your very\r\nrespectful and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoseph Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Postscriptum._--Hope you will advise the above coming safe to hand. Am\r\nsorry we have so few of yours. Your father says he is as usual, but looks\r\npoorly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this epistle, written in old Owen's formal style, I was rather\r\nsurprised to observe that he made no acknowledgment of that private\r\nletter which I had written to him, with a view to possess him of\r\nRashleigh's real character, although, from the course of post, it seemed\r\ncertain that he ought to have received it. Yet I had sent it by the usual\r\nconveyance from the Hall, and had no reason to suspect that it could\r\nmiscarry upon the road. As it comprised matters of great importance both\r\nto my father and to myself, I sat down in the post-office and again wrote\r\nto Owen, recapitulating the heads of my former letter, and requesting to\r\nknow, in course of post, if it had reached him in safety. I also\r\nacknowledged the receipt of the bill, and promised to make use of the\r\ncontents if I should have any occasion for money. I thought, indeed, it\r\nwas odd that my father should leave the care of supplying my necessities\r\nto his clerk; but I concluded it was a matter arranged between them. At\r\nany rate, Owen was a bachelor, rich in his way, and passionately attached\r\nto me, so that I had no hesitation in being obliged to him for a small\r\nsum, which I resolved to consider as a loan, to be returned with my\r\nearliest ability, in case it was not previously repaid by my father; and\r\nI expressed myself to this purpose to Mr. Owen. A shopkeeper in a little\r\ntown, to whom the post-master directed me, readily gave me in gold the\r\namount of my bill on Messrs. Hooper and Girder, so that I returned to\r\nOsbaldistone Hall a good deal richer than I had set forth. This recruit\r\nto my finances was not a matter of indifference to me, as I was\r\nnecessarily involved in some expenses at Osbaldistone Hall; and I had\r\nseen, with some uneasy impatience, that the sum which my travelling\r\nexpenses had left unexhausted at my arrival there was imperceptibly\r\ndiminishing. This source of anxiety was for the present removed. On my\r\narrival at the Hall I found that Sir Hildebrand and all his offspring had\r\ngone down to the little hamlet, called Trinlay-knowes, \xe2\x80\x9cto see,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nAndrew Fairservice expressed it, \xe2\x80\x9ca wheen midden cocks pike ilk ither's\r\nbarns out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed a brutal amusement, Andrew; I suppose you have none such in\r\nScotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Andrew boldly; then shaded away his negative with,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunless it be on Fastern's-e'en, or the like o' that--But indeed it's no\r\nmuckle matter what the folk do to the midden pootry, for they had siccan\r\na skarting and scraping in the yard, that there's nae getting a bean or\r\npea keepit for them.--But I am wondering what it is that leaves that\r\nturret-door open;--now that Mr. Rashleigh's away, it canna be him, I\r\ntrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe turret-door to which he alluded opened to the garden at the bottom of\r\na winding stair, leading down from Mr. Rashleigh's apartment. This, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, was situated in a sequestered part of the house,\r\ncommunicating with the library by a private entrance, and by another\r\nintricate and dark vaulted passage with the rest of the house. A long\r\nnarrow turf walk led, between two high holly hedges, from the turret-door\r\nto a little postern in the wall of the garden. By means of these\r\ncommunications Rashleigh, whose movements were very independent of those\r\nof the rest of his family, could leave the Hall or return to it at\r\npleasure, without his absence or presence attracting any observation. But\r\nduring his absence the stair and the turret-door were entirely disused,\r\nand this made Andrew's observation somewhat remarkable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you often observed that door open?\xe2\x80\x9d was my question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo just that often neither; but I hae noticed it ance or twice. I'm\r\nthinking it maun hae been the priest, Father Vaughan, as they ca' him.\r\nYe'll no catch ane o' the servants gauging up that stair, puir frightened\r\nheathens that they are, for fear of bogles and brownies, and lang-nebbit\r\nthings frae the neist warld. But Father Vaughan thinks himself a\r\nprivileged person--set him up and lay him down!--I'se be caution the\r\nwarst stibbler that ever stickit a sermon out ower the Tweed yonder, wad\r\nlay a ghaist twice as fast as him, wi' his holy water and his idolatrous\r\ntrinkets. I dinna believe he speaks gude Latin neither; at least he disna\r\ntake me up when I tell him the learned names o' the plants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf Father Vaughan, who divided his time and his ghostly care between\r\nOsbaldistone Hall and about half a dozen mansions of Catholic gentlemen\r\nin the neighbourhood, I have as yet said nothing, for I had seen but\r\nlittle. He was aged about sixty--of a good family, as I was given to\r\nunderstand, in the north--of a striking and imposing presence, grave in\r\nhis exterior, and much respected among the Catholics of Northumberland as\r\na worthy and upright man. Yet Father Vaughan did not altogether lack\r\nthose peculiarities which distinguish his order. There hung about him an\r\nair of mystery, which, in Protestant eyes, savoured of priestcraft. The\r\nnatives (such they might be well termed) of Osbaldistone Hall looked up\r\nto him with much more fear, or at least more awe, than affection. His\r\ncondemnation of their revels was evident, from their being discontinued\r\nin some measure when the priest was a resident at the Hall. Even Sir\r\nHildebrand himself put some restraint upon his conduct at such times,\r\nwhich, perhaps, rendered Father Vaughan's presence rather irksome than\r\notherwise. He had the well-bred, insinuating, and almost flattering\r\naddress peculiar to the clergy of his persuasion, especially in England,\r\nwhere the lay Catholic, hemmed in by penal laws, and by the restrictions\r\nof his sect and recommendation of his pastor, often exhibits a reserved,\r\nand almost a timid manner in the society of Protestants; while the\r\npriest, privileged by his order to mingle with persons of all creeds, is\r\nopen, alert, and liberal in his intercourse with them, desirous of\r\npopularity, and usually skilful in the mode of obtaining it.\r\n\r\nFather Vaughan was a particular acquaintance of Rashleigh's, otherwise,\r\nin all probability, he would scarce have been able to maintain his\r\nfooting at Osbaldistone Hall. This gave me no desire to cultivate his\r\nintimacy, nor did he seem to make any advances towards mine; so our\r\noccasional intercourse was confined to the exchange of mere civility. I\r\nconsidered it as extremely probable that Mr. Vaughan might occupy\r\nRashleigh's apartment during his occasional residence at the Hall; and\r\nhis profession rendered it likely that he should occasionally be a tenant\r\nof the library. Nothing was more probable than that it might have been\r\nhis candle which had excited my attention on a preceding evening. This\r\nled me involuntarily to recollect that the intercourse between Miss\r\nVernon and the priest was marked with something like the same mystery\r\nwhich characterised her communications with Rashleigh. I had never heard\r\nher mention Vaughan's name, or even allude to him, excepting on the\r\noccasion of our first meeting, when she mentioned the old priest and\r\nRashleigh as the only conversable beings, besides herself, in\r\nOsbaldistone Hall. Yet although silent with respect to Father Vaughan,\r\nhis arrival at the Hall never failed to impress Miss Vernon with an\r\nanxious and fluttering tremor, which lasted until they had exchanged one\r\nor two significant glances.\r\n\r\nWhatever the mystery might be which overclouded the destinies of this\r\nbeautiful and interesting female, it was clear that Father Vaughan was\r\nimplicated in it; unless, indeed, I could suppose that he was the agent\r\nemployed to procure her settlement in the cloister, in the event of her\r\nrejecting a union with either of my cousins,--an office which would\r\nsufficiently account for her obvious emotion at his appearance. As to the\r\nrest, they did not seem to converse much together, or even to seek each\r\nother's society. Their league, if any subsisted between them, was of a\r\ntacit and understood nature, operating on their actions without any\r\nnecessity of speech. I recollected, however, on reflection, that I had\r\nonce or twice discovered signs pass betwixt them, which I had at the time\r\nsupposed to bear reference to some hint concerning Miss Vernon's\r\nreligious observances, knowing how artfully the Catholic clergy maintain,\r\nat all times and seasons, their influence over the minds of their\r\nfollowers. But now I was disposed to assign to these communications a\r\ndeeper and more mysterious import. Did he hold private meetings with Miss\r\nVernon in the library? was a question which occupied my thoughts; and if\r\nso, for what purpose? And why should she have admitted an intimate of the\r\ndeceitful Rashleigh to such close confidence?\r\n\r\nThese questions and difficulties pressed on my mind with an interest\r\nwhich was greatly increased by the impossibility of resolving them. I had\r\nalready begun to suspect that my friendship for Diana Vernon was not\r\naltogether so disinterested as in wisdom it ought to have been. I had\r\nalready felt myself becoming jealous of the contemptible lout Thorncliff,\r\nand taking more notice, than in prudence or dignity of feeling I ought to\r\nhave done, of his silly attempts to provoke me. And now I was\r\nscrutinising the conduct of Miss Vernon with the most close and eager\r\nobservation, which I in vain endeavoured to palm on myself as the\r\noffspring of idle curiosity. All these, like Benedick's brushing his hat\r\nof a morning, were signs that the sweet youth was in love; and while my\r\njudgment still denied that I had been guilty of forming an attachment so\r\nimprudent, she resembled those ignorant guides, who, when they have led\r\nthe traveller and themselves into irretrievable error, persist in\r\nobstinately affirming it to be impossible that they can have missed the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEENTH.\r\n\r\n     It happened one day about noon, going to my boat, I was exceedingly\r\n     surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which\r\n     was very plain to be seen on the sand.\r\n                                            Robinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nWith the blended feelings of interest and jealousy which were engendered\r\nby Miss Vernon's singular situation, my observations of her looks and\r\nactions became acutely sharpened, and that to a degree which,\r\nnotwithstanding my efforts to conceal it, could not escape her\r\npenetration. The sense that she was observed, or, more properly speaking,\r\nthat she was watched by my looks, seemed to give Diana a mixture of\r\nembarrassment, pain, and pettishness. At times it seemed that she sought\r\nan opportunity of resenting a conduct which she could not but feel as\r\noffensive, considering the frankness with which she had mentioned the\r\ndifficulties that surrounded her. At other times she seemed prepared to\r\nexpostulate upon the subject. But either her courage failed, or some\r\nother sentiment impeded her seeking an _e'claircissement._ Her\r\ndispleasure evaporated in repartee, and her expostulations died on her\r\nlips. We stood in a singular relation to each other,--spending, and by\r\nmutual choice, much of our time in close society with each other, yet\r\ndisguising our mutual sentiments, and jealous of, or offended by, each\r\nother's actions. There was betwixt us intimacy without confidence;--on\r\none side, love without hope or purpose, and curiosity without any\r\nrational or justifiable motive; and on the other, embarrassment and\r\ndoubt, occasionally mingled with displeasure. Yet I believe that this\r\nagitation of the passions (such is the nature of the human bosom), as it\r\ncontinued by a thousand irritating and interesting, though petty\r\ncircumstances, to render Miss Vernon and me the constant objects of each\r\nother's thoughts, tended, upon the whole, to increase the attachment with\r\nwhich we were naturally disposed to regard each other. But although my\r\nvanity early discovered that my presence at Osbaldistone Hall had given\r\nDiana some additional reason for disliking the cloister, I could by no\r\nmeans confide in an affection which seemed completely subordinate to the\r\nmysteries of her singular situation. Miss Vernon was of a character far\r\ntoo formed and determined, to permit her love for me to overpower either\r\nher sense of duty or of prudence, and she gave me a proof of this in a\r\nconversation which we had together about this period.\r\n\r\nWe were sitting together in the library. Miss Vernon, in turning over a\r\ncopy of the Orlando Furioso, which belonged to me, shook a piece of\r\nwriting paper from between the leaves. I hastened to lift it, but she\r\nprevented me.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt is verse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, on glancing at the paper; and\r\nthen unfolding it, but as if to wait my answer before proceeding--\xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\ntake the liberty?--Nay, nay, if you blush and stammer, I must do violence\r\nto your modesty, and suppose that permission is granted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worthy your perusal--a scrap of a translation--My dear Miss\r\nVernon, it would be too severe a trial, that you, who understand the\r\noriginal so well, should sit in judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine honest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not, if you will be guided by my\r\nadvice, bait your hook with too much humility; for, ten to one, it will\r\nnot catch a single compliment. You know I belong to the unpopular family\r\nof Tell-truths, and would not flatter Apollo for his lyre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe proceeded to read the first stanza, which was nearly to the following\r\npurpose:--\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cLadies, and knights, and arms, and love's fair flame,\r\n                 Deeds of emprize and courtesy, I sing;\r\n             What time the Moors from sultry Africk came,\r\n                Led on by Agramant, their youthful king--\r\n                He whom revenge and hasty ire did bring\r\n             O'er the broad wave, in France to waste and war;\r\n             Such ills from old Trojano's death did spring,\r\n                Which to avenge he came from realms afar,\r\n             And menaced Christian Charles, the Roman Emperor.\r\n             Of dauntless Roland, too, my strain shall sound,\r\n                In import never known in prose or rhyme,\r\n             How He, the chief, of judgment deemed profound,\r\n                For luckless love was crazed upon a time\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, glancing along the paper, and\r\ninterrupting the sweetest sounds which mortal ears can drink in,--those\r\nof a youthful poet's verses, namely, read by the lips which are dearest\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch more than ought to engage your attention, Miss Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied,\r\nsomething mortified; and I took the verses from her unreluctant hand--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cshut up as I am in this retired situation, I\r\nhave felt sometimes I could not amuse myself better than by carrying\r\non--merely for my own amusement, you will of course understand--the\r\nversion of this fascinating author, which I began some months since when\r\nI was on the banks of the Garonne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question would only be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you could not\r\nspend your time to better purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean in original composition?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, greatly flattered--\xe2\x80\x9cBut, to\r\nsay truth, my genius rather lies in finding words and rhymes than ideas;\r\nand therefore I am happy to use those which Ariosto has prepared to my\r\nhand. However, Miss Vernon, with the encouragement you give\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Frank--it is encouragement not of my giving, but of your\r\ntaking. I meant neither original composition nor translation, since I\r\nthink you might employ your time to far better purpose than in either.\r\nYou are mortified,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am sorry to be the cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot mortified,--certainly not mortified,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with the best grace I\r\ncould muster, and it was but indifferently assumed; \xe2\x80\x9cI am too much\r\nobliged by the interest you take in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the relentless Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is both mortification\r\nand a little grain of anger in that constrained tone of voice; do not be\r\nangry if I probe your feelings to the bottom--perhaps what I am about to\r\nsay will affect them still more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt the childishness of my own conduct, and the superior manliness of\r\nMiss Vernon's, and assured her, that she need not fear my wincing under\r\ncriticism which I knew to be kindly meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was honestly meant and said,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI knew full well that\r\nthe fiend of poetical irritability flew away with the little preluding\r\ncough which ushered in the declaration. And now I must be serious--Have\r\nyou heard from your father lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9che has not honoured me with a single line\r\nduring the several months of my residence here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is strange!--you are a singular race, you bold Osbaldistones. Then\r\nyou are not aware that he has gone to Holland, to arrange some pressing\r\naffairs which required his own immediate presence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard a word of it until this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd farther, it must be news to you, and I presume scarcely the most\r\nagreeable, that he has left Rashleigh in the almost uncontrolled\r\nmanagement of his affairs until his return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI started, and could not suppress my surprise and apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have reason for alarm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, very gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cand were I\r\nyou, I would endeavour to meet and obviate the dangers which arise from\r\nso undesirable an arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is it possible for me to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is possible for him who possesses courage and activity,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, with a look resembling one of those heroines of the age of\r\nchivalry, whose encouragement was wont to give champions double valour at\r\nthe hour of need; \xe2\x80\x9cand to the timid and hesitating, everything is\r\nimpossible, because it seems so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would you advise, Miss Vernon?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, wishing, yet\r\ndreading, to hear her answer.\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, then answered firmly--\xe2\x80\x9cThat you instantly leave\r\nOsbaldistone Hall, and return to London. You have perhaps already,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, in a softer tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbeen here too long; that fault was not\r\nyours. Every succeeding moment you waste here will be a crime. Yes, a\r\ncrime: for I tell you plainly, that if Rashleigh long manages your\r\nfather's affairs, you may consider his ruin as consummated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is this possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk no questions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut believe me, Rashleigh's views extend\r\nfar beyond the possession or increase of commercial wealth: he will only\r\nmake the command of Mr. Osbaldistone's revenues and property the means of\r\nputting in motion his own ambitious and extensive schemes. While your\r\nfather was in Britain this was impossible; during his absence, Rashleigh\r\nwill possess many opportunities, and he will not neglect to use them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I, in disgrace with my father, and divested of all control\r\nover his affairs, prevent this danger by my mere presence in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat presence alone will do much. Your claim to interfere is a part of\r\nyour birthright, and it is inalienable. You will have the countenance,\r\ndoubtless, of your father's head-clerk, and confidential friends and\r\npartners. Above all, Rashleigh's schemes are of a nature that\xe2\x80\x9d--(she\r\nstopped abruptly, as if fearful of saying too much)--\xe2\x80\x9care, in short,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nresumed, \xe2\x80\x9cof the nature of all selfish and unconscientious plans, which\r\nare speedily abandoned as soon as those who frame them perceive their\r\narts are discovered and watched. Therefore, in the language of your\r\nfavourite poet--\r\n\r\n           To horse! to horse! Urge doubts to those that fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA feeling, irresistible in its impulse, induced me to reply--\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Diana,\r\ncan _you_ give me advice to leave Osbaldistone Hall?--then indeed I have\r\nalready been a resident here too long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon coloured, but proceeded with great firmness--\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I do\r\ngive you this advice--not only to quit Osbaldistone Hall, but never to\r\nreturn to it more. You have only one friend to regret here,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, forcing a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cand she has been long accustomed to\r\nsacrifice her friendships and her comforts to the welfare of others.\r\nIn the world you will meet a hundred whose friendship will be\r\nas disinterested--more useful--less encumbered by untoward\r\ncircumstances--less influenced by evil tongues and evil times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cnever!--the world can afford me nothing to repay\r\nwhat I must leave behind me.\xe2\x80\x9d Here I took her hand, and pressed it to my\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is folly!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed--\xe2\x80\x9cthis is madness!\xe2\x80\x9d and she struggled to\r\nwithdraw her hand from my grasp, but not so stubbornly as actually to\r\nsucceed until I had held it for nearly a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cHear me, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand curb this unmanly burst of passion. I am, by a solemn\r\ncontract, the bride of Heaven, unless I could prefer being wedded to\r\nvillany in the person of Rashleigh Osbaldistone, or brutality in that of\r\nhis brother. I am, therefore, the bride of Heaven,--betrothed to the\r\nconvent from the cradle. To me, therefore, these raptures are\r\nmisapplied--they only serve to prove a farther necessity for your\r\ndeparture, and that without delay.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words she broke suddenly\r\noff, and said, but in a suppressed tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me\r\ninstantly--we will meet here again, but it must be for the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eyes followed the direction of hers as she spoke, and I thought I saw\r\nthe tapestry shake, which covered the door of the secret passage from\r\nRashleigh's room to the library. I conceived we were observed, and turned\r\nan inquiring glance on Miss Vernon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, faintly; \xe2\x80\x9ca rat behind the arras.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead for a ducat,\xe2\x80\x9d would have been my reply, had I dared to give way to\r\nthe feelings which rose indignant at the idea of being subjected to an\r\neaves-dropper on such an occasion. Prudence, and the necessity of\r\nsuppressing my passion, and obeying Diana's reiterated command of \xe2\x80\x9cLeave\r\nme! leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d came in time to prevent my rash action. I left the\r\napartment in a wild whirl and giddiness of mind, which I in vain\r\nattempted to compose when I returned to my own.\r\n\r\nA chaos of thoughts intruded themselves on me at once, passing hastily\r\nthrough my brain, intercepting and overshadowing each other, and\r\nresembling those fogs which in mountainous countries are wont to descend\r\nin obscure volumes, and disfigure or obliterate the usual marks by which\r\nthe traveller steers his course through the wilds. The dark and undefined\r\nidea of danger arising to my father from the machinations of such a man\r\nas Rashleigh Osbaldistone--the half declaration of love that I had\r\noffered to Miss Vernon's acceptance--the acknowledged difficulties of her\r\nsituation, bound by a previous contract to sacrifice herself to a\r\ncloister or to an ill-assorted marriage,--all pressed themselves at once\r\nupon my recollection, while my judgment was unable deliberately to\r\nconsider any of them in their just light and bearings. But chiefly and\r\nabove all the rest, I was perplexed by the manner in which Miss Vernon\r\nhad received my tender of affection, and by her manner, which,\r\nfluctuating betwixt sympathy and firmness, seemed to intimate that I\r\npossessed an interest in her bosom, but not of force sufficient to\r\ncounterbalance the obstacles to her avowing a mutual affection. The\r\nglance of fear, rather than surprise, with which she had watched the\r\nmotion of the tapestry over the concealed door, implied an apprehension\r\nof danger which I could not but suppose well grounded; for Diana Vernon\r\nwas little subject to the nervous emotions of her sex, and totally unapt\r\nto fear without actual and rational cause. Of what nature could those\r\nmysteries be, with which she was surrounded as with an enchanter's spell,\r\nand which seemed continually to exert an active influence over her\r\nthoughts and actions, though their agents were never visible? On this\r\nsubject of doubt my mind finally rested, as if glad to shake itself free\r\nfrom investigating the propriety or prudence of my own conduct, by\r\ntransferring the inquiry to what concerned Miss Vernon. I will be\r\nresolved, I concluded, ere I leave Osbaldistone Hall, concerning the\r\nlight in which I must in future regard this fascinating being, over whose\r\nlife frankness and mystery seem to have divided their reign,--the former\r\ninspiring her words and sentiments--the latter spreading in misty\r\ninfluence over all her actions.\r\n\r\nJoined to the obvious interests which arose from curiosity and anxious\r\npassion, there mingled in my feelings a strong, though unavowed and\r\nundefined, infusion of jealousy. This sentiment, which springs up with\r\nlove as naturally as the tares with the wheat, was excited by the degree\r\nof influence which Diana appeared to concede to those unseen beings by\r\nwhom her actions were limited. The more I reflected upon her character,\r\nthe more I was internally though unwillingly convinced, that she was\r\nformed to set at defiance all control, excepting that which arose from\r\naffection; and I felt a strong, bitter, and gnawing suspicion, that such\r\nwas the foundation of that influence by which she was overawed.\r\n\r\nThese tormenting doubts strengthened my desire to penetrate into the\r\nsecret of Miss Vernon's conduct, and in the prosecution of this sage\r\nadventure, I formed a resolution, of which, if you are not weary of these\r\ndetails, you will find the result in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     I hear a voice you cannot hear,\r\n                     Which says, I must not stay;\r\n                     I see a hand you cannot see,\r\n                           Which beckons me awry.\r\n                                            Tickell.\r\n\r\nI have already told you, Tresham, if you deign to bear it in remembrance,\r\nthat my evening visits to the library had seldom been made except by\r\nappointment, and under the sanction of old Dame Martha's presence. This,\r\nhowever, was entirely a tacit conventional arrangement of my own\r\ninstituting. Of late, as the embarrassments of our relative situation had\r\nincreased, Miss Vernon and I had never met in the evening at all. She had\r\ntherefore no reason to suppose that I was likely to seek a renewal of\r\nthese interviews, and especially without some previous notice or\r\nappointment betwixt us, that Martha might, as usual, be placed upon duty;\r\nbut, on the other hand, this cautionary provision was a matter of\r\nunderstanding, not of express enactment. The library was open to me, as\r\nto the other members of the family, at all hours of the day and night,\r\nand I could not be accused of intrusion, however suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly I might made my appearance in it. My belief was strong, that\r\nin this apartment Miss Vernon occasionally received Vaughan, or some\r\nother person, by whose opinion she was accustomed to regulate her\r\nconduct, and that at the times when she could do so with least chance of\r\ninterruption. The lights which gleamed in the library at unusual\r\nhours--the passing shadows which I had myself remarked--the footsteps\r\nwhich might be traced in the morning-dew from the turret-door to the\r\npostern-gate in the garden--sounds and sights which some of the servants,\r\nand Andrew Fairservice in particular, had observed, and accounted for in\r\ntheir own way,--all tended to show that the place was visited by some one\r\ndifferent from the ordinary inmates of the hall. Connected as this\r\nvisitant probably must be with the fates of Diana Vernon, I did not\r\nhesitate to form a plan of discovering who or what he was,--how far his\r\ninfluence was likely to produce good or evil consequences to her on whom\r\nhe acted;--above all, though I endeavoured to persuade myself that this\r\nwas a mere subordinate consideration, I desired to know by what means\r\nthis person had acquired or maintained his influence over Diana, and\r\nwhether he ruled over her by fear or by affection. The proof that this\r\njealous curiosity was uppermost in my mind, arose from my imagination\r\nalways ascribing Miss Vernon's conduct to the influence of some one\r\nindividual agent, although, for aught I knew about the matter, her\r\nadvisers might be as numerous am Legion. I remarked this over and over to\r\nmyself; but I found that my mind still settled back in my original\r\nconviction, that one single individual, of the masculine sex, and in all\r\nprobability young and handsome, was at the bottom of Miss Vernon's\r\nconduct; and it was with a burning desire of discovering, or rather of\r\ndetecting, such a rival, that I stationed myself in the garden to watch\r\nthe moment when the lights should appear in the library windows.\r\n\r\nSo eager, however, was my impatience, that I commenced my watch for a\r\nphenomenon, which could not appear until darkness, a full hour before the\r\ndaylight disappeared, on a July evening. It was Sabbath, and all the\r\nwalks were still and solitary. I walked up and down for some time,\r\nenjoying the refreshing coolness of a summer evening, and meditating on\r\nthe probable consequences of my enterprise. The fresh and balmy air of\r\nthe garden, impregnated with fragrance, produced its usual sedative\r\neffects on my over-heated and feverish blood. As these took place, the\r\nturmoil of my mind began proportionally to abate, and I was led to\r\nquestion the right I had to interfere with Miss Vernon's secrets, or with\r\nthose of my uncle's family. What was it to me whom my uncle might choose\r\nto conceal in his house, where I was myself a guest only by tolerance?\r\nAnd what title had I to pry into the affairs of Miss Vernon, fraught, as\r\nshe had avowed them to be, with mystery, into which she desired no\r\nscrutiny?\r\n\r\nPassion and self-will were ready with their answers to these questions.\r\nIn detecting this secret, I was in all probability about to do service to\r\nSir Hildebrand, who was probably ignorant of the intrigues carried on in\r\nhis family--and a still more important service to Miss Vernon, whose\r\nfrank simplicity of character exposed her to so many risks in maintaining\r\na private correspondence, perhaps with a person of doubtful or dangerous\r\ncharacter. If I seemed to intrude myself on her confidence, it was with\r\nthe generous and disinterested (yes, I even ventured to call it the\r\n_disinterested_) intention of guiding, defending, and protecting her\r\nagainst craft--against malice,--above all, against the secret counsellor\r\nwhom she had chosen for her confidant. Such were the arguments which my\r\nwill boldly preferred to my conscience, as coin which ought to be\r\ncurrent, and which conscience, like a grumbling shopkeeper, was contented\r\nto accept, rather than come to an open breach with a customer, though\r\nmore than doubting that the tender was spurious.\r\n\r\nWhile I paced the green alleys, debating these things _pro_ and _con,_ I\r\nsuddenly alighted upon Andrew Fairservice, perched up like a statue by a\r\nrange of bee-hives, in an attitude of devout contemplation--one eye,\r\nhowever, watching the motions of the little irritable citizens, who were\r\nsettling in their straw-thatched mansion for the evening, and the other\r\nfixed on a book of devotion, which much attrition had deprived of its\r\ncorners, and worn into an oval shape; a circumstance which, with the\r\nclose print and dingy colour of the volume in question, gave it an air of\r\nmost respectable antiquity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was e'en taking a spell o' worthy Mess John Quackleben's Flower of a\r\nSweet Savour sawn on the Middenstead of this World,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, closing\r\nhis book at my appearance, and putting his horn spectacles, by way of\r\nmark, at the place where he had been reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the bees, I observe, were dividing your attention, Andrew, with the\r\nlearned author?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a contumacious generation,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gardener; \xe2\x80\x9cthey hae sax\r\ndays in the week to hive on, and yet it's a common observe that they will\r\naye swarm on the Sabbath-day, and keep folk at hame frae hearing the\r\nword--But there's nae preaching at Graneagain chapel the e'en--that's aye\r\nae mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have gone to the parish church as I did, Andrew, and heard an\r\nexcellent discourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClauts o' cauld parritch--clauts o' cauld parritch,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew,\r\nwith a most supercilious sneer,--\xe2\x80\x9cgude aneueh for dogs, begging your\r\nhonour's pardon--Ay! I might nae doubt hae heard the curate linking awa\r\nat it in his white sark yonder, and the musicians playing on whistles,\r\nmair like a penny-wedding than a sermon--and to the boot of that, I might\r\nhae gaen to even-song, and heard Daddie Docharty mumbling his\r\nmass--muckle the better I wad hae been o' that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDocharty!\xe2\x80\x9d said I (this was the name of an old priest, an Irishman, I\r\nthink, who sometimes officiated at Osbaldistone Hall)--\xe2\x80\x9cI thought Father\r\nVaughan had been at the Hall. He was here yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he left it yestreen, to gang to Greystock, or\r\nsome o' thae west-country haulds. There's an unco stir among them a'\r\ne'enow. They are as busy as my bees are--God sain them! that I suld even\r\nthe puir things to the like o' papists. Ye see this is the second swarm,\r\nand whiles they will swarm off in the afternoon. The first swarm set off\r\nsune in the morning.--But I am thinking they are settled in their skeps\r\nfor the night; sae I wuss your honour good-night, and grace, and muckle\r\no't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, Andrew retreated, but often cast a parting glance upon the\r\n_skeps,_ as he called the bee-hives.\r\n\r\nI had indirectly gained from him an important piece of information, that\r\nFather Vaughan, namely, was not supposed to be at the Hall. If,\r\ntherefore, there appeared light in the windows of the library this\r\nevening, it either could not be his, or he was observing a very secret\r\nand suspicious line of conduct. I waited with impatience the time of\r\nsunset and of twilight. It had hardly arrived, ere a gleam from the\r\nwindows of the library was seen, dimly distinguishable amidst the still\r\nenduring light of the evening. I marked its first glimpse, however, as\r\nspeedily as the benighted sailor descries the first distant twinkle of\r\nthe lighthouse which marks his course. The feelings of doubt and\r\npropriety, which had hitherto contended with my curiosity and jealousy,\r\nvanished when an opportunity of gratifying the former was presented to\r\nme. I re-entered the house, and avoiding the more frequented apartments\r\nwith the consciousness of one who wishes to keep his purpose secret, I\r\nreached the door of the library--hesitated for a moment as my hand was\r\nupon the latch--heard a suppressed step within--opened the door--and\r\nfound Miss Vernon alone.\r\n\r\nDiana appeared surprised,--whether at my sudden entrance, or from some\r\nother cause, I could not guess; but there was in her appearance a degree\r\nof flutter, which I had never before remarked, and which I knew could\r\nonly be produced by unusual emotion. Yet she was calm in a moment; and\r\nsuch is the force of conscience, that I, who studied to surprise her,\r\nseemed myself the surprised, and was certainly the embarrassed person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon--\xe2\x80\x9chas any one arrived at the\r\nHall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one that I know of,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, in some confusion; \xe2\x80\x9cI only sought\r\nthe Orlando.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt lies there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, pointing to the table. In removing one\r\nor two books to get at that which I pretended to seek, I was, in truth,\r\nmeditating to make a handsome retreat from an investigation to which I\r\nfelt my assurance inadequate, when I perceived a man's glove lying upon\r\nthe table. My eyes encountered those of Miss Vernon, who blushed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is one of my relics,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with hesitation, replying not to my\r\nwords but to my looks; \xe2\x80\x9cit is one of the gloves of my grandfather, the\r\noriginal of the superb Vandyke which you admire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if she thought something more than her bare assertion was necessary to\r\nprove her statement true, she opened a drawer of the large oaken table,\r\nand taking out another glove, threw it towards me.--When a temper\r\nnaturally ingenuous stoops to equivocate, or to dissemble, the anxious\r\npain with which the unwonted task is laboured, often induces the hearer\r\nto doubt the authenticity of the tale. I cast a hasty glance on both\r\ngloves, and then replied gravely--\xe2\x80\x9cThe gloves resemble each other,\r\ndoubtless, in form and embroidery; but they cannot form a pair, since\r\nthey both belong to the right hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip with anger, and again coloured deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do right to expose me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with bitterness: \xe2\x80\x9csome friends\r\nwould have only judged from what I said, that I chose to give no\r\nparticular explanation of a circumstance which calls for none--at least\r\nto a stranger. You have judged better, and have made me feel, not only\r\nthe meanness of duplicity, but my own inadequacy to sustain the task of a\r\ndissembler. I now tell you distinctly, that that glove is not the fellow,\r\nas you have acutely discerned, to the one which I just now produced;--it\r\nbelongs to a friend yet dearer to me than the original of Vandyke's\r\npicture--a friend by whose counsels I have been, and will be,\r\nguided--whom I honour--whom I\xe2\x80\x9d--she paused.\r\n\r\nI was irritated at her manner, and filled up the blank in my own way--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom she _loves_, Miss Vernon would say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I do say so,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cby whom shall my affection\r\nbe called to account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Die Vernon and Frank in Library--234]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by me, Miss Vernon, assuredly--I entreat you to hold me acquitted of\r\nsuch presumption.--_But,_\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, with some emphasis, for I was now\r\npiqued in return, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope Miss Vernon will pardon a friend, from whom she\r\nseems disposed to withdraw the title, for observing\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve nothing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted with some vehemence, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that\r\nI will neither be doubted nor questioned. There does not exist one by\r\nwhom I will be either interrogated or judged; and if you sought this\r\nunusual time of presenting yourself in order to spy upon my privacy, the\r\nfriendship or interest with which you pretend to regard me, is a poor\r\nexcuse for your uncivil curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI relieve you of my presence,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with pride equal to her own; for\r\nmy temper has ever been a stranger to stooping, even in cases where my\r\nfeelings were most deeply interested--\xe2\x80\x9cI relieve you of my presence. I\r\nawake from a pleasant, but a most delusive dream; and--but we understand\r\neach other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had reached the door of the apartment, when Miss Vernon, whose\r\nmovements were sometimes so rapid as to seem almost instinctive, overtook\r\nme, and, catching hold of my arm, stopped me with that air of authority\r\nwhich she could so whimsically assume, and which, from the _naivete_ and\r\nsimplicity of her manner, had an effect so peculiarly interesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Mr. Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not to leave me in that way\r\nneither; I am not so amply provided with friends, that I can afford to\r\nthrow away even the ungrateful and the selfish. Mark what I say, Mr.\r\nFrancis Osbaldistone. You shall know nothing of this mysterious glove,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and she held it up as she spoke--\xe2\x80\x9cnothing--no, not a single iota more\r\nthan you know already; and yet I will not permit it to be a gauntlet of\r\nstrife and defiance betwixt us. My time here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sinking into a\r\ntone somewhat softer, \xe2\x80\x9cmust necessarily be very short; yours must be\r\nstill shorter: we are soon to part never to meet again; do not let us\r\nquarrel, or make any mysterious miseries the pretext for farther\r\nembittering the few hours we shall ever pass together on this side of\r\neternity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know, Tresham, by what witchery this fascinating creature\r\nobtained such complete management over a temper which I cannot at all\r\ntimes manage myself. I had determined on entering the library, to seek a\r\ncomplete explanation with Miss Vernon. I had found that she refused it\r\nwith indignant defiance, and avowed to my face the preference of a rival;\r\nfor what other construction could I put on her declared preference of her\r\nmysterious confidant? And yet, while I was on the point of leaving the\r\napartment, and breaking with her for ever, it cost her but a change of\r\nlook and tone, from that of real and haughty resentment to that of kind\r\nand playful despotism, again shaded off into melancholy and serious\r\nfeeling, to lead me back to my seat, her willing subject, on her own hard\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this avail?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as I sate down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can this avail,\r\nMiss Vernon? Why should I witness embarrassments which I cannot relieve,\r\nand mysteries which I offend you even by attempting to penetrate?\r\nInexperienced as you are in the world, you must still be aware that a\r\nbeautiful young woman can have but one male friend. Even in a male friend\r\nI will be jealous of a confidence shared with a third party unknown and\r\nconcealed; but with _you,_ Miss Vernon\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are, of course, jealous, in all the tenses and moods of that amiable\r\npassion? But, my good friend, you have all this time spoke nothing but\r\nthe paltry gossip which simpletons repeat from play-books and romances,\r\ntill they give mere cant a real and powerful influence over their minds.\r\nBoys and girls prate themselves into love; and when their love is like to\r\nfall asleep, they prate and tease themselves into jealousy. But you and\r\nI, Frank, are rational beings, and neither silly nor idle enough to talk\r\nourselves into any other relation than that of plain honest disinterested\r\nfriendship. Any other union is as far out of our reach as if I were man,\r\nor you woman--To speak truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a moment's hesitation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceven though I am so complaisant to the decorum of my sex as to blush a\r\nlittle at my own plain dealing, we cannot marry if we would; and we ought\r\nnot if we could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd certainly, Tresham, she did blush most angelically, as she made this\r\ncruel declaration. I was about to attack both her positions, entirely\r\nforgetting those very suspicions which had been confirmed in the course\r\nof the evening, but she proceeded with a cold firmness which approached\r\nto severity--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I say is sober and indisputable truth, on which I will\r\nneither hear question nor explanation. We are therefore friends, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone--are we not?\xe2\x80\x9d She held out her hand, and taking mine,\r\nadded--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nothing to each other now, or henceforward, except as\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let go my hand. I sunk it and my head at once, fairly _overcrowed,_\r\nas Spenser would have termed it, by the mingled kindness and firmness of\r\nher manner. She hastened to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdirected for you, Mr. Osbaldistone, very\r\nduly and distinctly; but which, notwithstanding the caution of the person\r\nwho wrote and addressed it, might perhaps never have reached your hands,\r\nhad it not fallen into the possession of a certain Pacolet, or enchanted\r\ndwarf of mine, whom, like all distressed damsels of romance, I retain in\r\nmy secret service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened the letter and glanced over the contents. The unfolded sheet of\r\npaper dropped from my hands, with the involuntary exclamation of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious Heaven! my folly and disobedience have ruined my father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon rose with looks of real and affectionate alarm--\xe2\x80\x9cYou grow\r\npale--you are ill--shall I bring you a glass of water? Be a man, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone, and a firm one. Is your father--is he no more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthank God! but to what distress and difficulty\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that be all, despair not. May I read this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nI assented, hardly knowing what I said. She read it with great attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Mr. Tresham, who signs the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father's partner\xe2\x80\x9d--(your own good father, Will)--\xe2\x80\x9cbut he is little in\r\nthe habit of acting personally in the business of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe writes here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon, \xe2\x80\x9cof various letters sent to you\r\npreviously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have received none of them,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it appears,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Rashleigh, who has taken the full\r\nmanagement of affairs during your father's absence in Holland, has some\r\ntime since left London for Scotland, with effects and remittances to take\r\nup large bills granted by your father to persons in that country, and\r\nthat he has not since been heard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is but too true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here has been,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking at the letter, \xe2\x80\x9ca head-clerk, or\r\nsome such person,--Owenson--Owen--despatched to Glasgow, to find out\r\nRashleigh, if possible, and you are entreated to repair to the same\r\nplace, and assist him in his researches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is even so, and I must depart instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay but one moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vernon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that the worst\r\nwhich can come of this matter, will be the loss of a certain sum of\r\nmoney;--and can that bring tears into your eyes? For shame, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do me injustice, Miss Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI grieve not for the\r\nloss of the money, but for the effect which I know it will produce on the\r\nspirits and health of my father, to whom mercantile credit is as honour;\r\nand who, if declared insolvent, would sink into the grave, oppressed by a\r\nsense of grief, remorse, and despair, like that of a soldier convicted of\r\ncowardice or a man of honour who had lost his rank and character in\r\nsociety. All this I might have prevented by a trifling sacrifice of the\r\nfoolish pride and indolence which recoiled from sharing the labours of\r\nhis honourable and useful profession. Good Heaven! how shall I redeem the\r\nconsequences of my error?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy instantly repairing to Glasgow, as you are conjured to do by the\r\nfriend who writes this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chas really formed this base and\r\nunconscientious scheme of plundering his benefactor, what prospect is\r\nthere that I can find means of frustrating a plan so deeply laid?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prospect,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cindeed, may be uncertain; but, on the other\r\nhand, there is no possibility of your doing any service to your father by\r\nremaining here. Remember, had you been on the post destined for you, this\r\ndisaster could not have happened: hasten to that which is now pointed\r\nout, and it may possibly be retrieved.--Yet stay--do not leave this room\r\nuntil I return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left me in confusion and amazement; amid which, however, I could\r\nfind a lucid interval to admire the firmness, composure, and presence of\r\nmind which Miss Vernon seemed to possess on every crisis, however sudden.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she returned with a sheet of paper in her hand, folded\r\nand sealed like a letter, but without address. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith this proof of my friendship, because I have the most perfect\r\nconfidence in your honour. If I understand the nature of your distress\r\nrightly, the funds in Rashleigh's possession must be recovered by a\r\ncertain day--the 12th of September, I think is named--in order that they\r\nmay be applied to pay the bills in question; and, consequently, that if\r\nadequate funds be provided before that period, your father's credit is\r\nsafe from the apprehended calamity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly--I so understand Mr. Tresham\xe2\x80\x9d--I looked at your father's\r\nletter again, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cThere cannot be a doubt of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cin that case my little Pacolet may be of use to you.\r\nYou have heard of a spell contained in a letter. Take this packet; do not\r\nopen it until other and ordinary means have failed. If you succeed by\r\nyour own exertions, I trust to your honour for destroying it without\r\nopening or suffering it to be opened;--but if not, you may break the seal\r\nwithin ten days of the fated day, and you will find directions which may\r\npossibly be of service to you. Adieu, Frank; we never meet more--but\r\nsometimes think of your friend Die Vernon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand, but I clasped her to my bosom. She sighed as she\r\nextricated herself from the embrace which she permitted--escaped to the\r\ndoor which led to her own apartment--and I saw her no more.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME ONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROB ROY\r\n\r\nBy Sir Walter Scott\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Helen MacGregor--Frontispiece]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIRST\r\n\r\n                   And hurry, hurry, off they rode,\r\n                       As fast as fast might be;\r\n                   Hurra, hurra, the dead can ride,\r\n                       Dost fear to ride with me?\r\n                                            Burger.\r\n\r\nThere is one advantage in an accumulation of evils, differing in cause\r\nand character, that the distraction which they afford by their\r\ncontradictory operation prevents the patient from being overwhelmed under\r\neither. I was deeply grieved at my separation from Miss Vernon, yet not\r\nso much so as I should have been, had not my father's apprehended\r\ndistresses forced themselves on my attention; and I was distressed by the\r\nnews of Mr. Tresham, yet less so than if they had fully occupied my mind.\r\nI was neither a false lover nor an unfeeling son; but man can give but a\r\ncertain portion of distressful emotions to the causes which demand them;\r\nand if two operate at once, our sympathy, like the funds of a compounding\r\nbankrupt, can only be divided between them. Such were my reflections when\r\nI gained my apartment--it seems, from the illustration, they already\r\nbegan to have a twang of commerce in them.\r\n\r\nI set myself seriously to consider your father's letter. It was not very\r\ndistinct, and referred for several particulars to Owen, whom I was\r\nentreated to meet with as soon as possible at a Scotch town called\r\nGlasgow; being informed, moreover, that my old friend was to be heard of\r\nat Messrs. MacVittie, MacFin, and Company, merchants in the Gallowgate of\r\nthe said town. It likewise alluded to several letters,--which, as it\r\nappeared to me, must have miscarried or have been intercepted, and\r\ncomplained of my obdurate silence, in terms which would have, been highly\r\nunjust, had my letters reached their purposed destination. I was amazed\r\nas I read. That the spirit of Rashleigh walked around me, and conjured up\r\nthese doubts and difficulties by which I was surrounded, I could not\r\ndoubt for one instant; yet it was frightful to conceive the extent of\r\ncombined villany and power which he must have employed in the\r\nperpetration of his designs. Let me do myself justice in one respect. The\r\nevil of parting from Miss Vernon, however distressing it might in other\r\nrespects and at another time have appeared to me, sunk into a subordinate\r\nconsideration when I thought of the dangers impending over my father. I\r\ndid not myself set a high estimation on wealth, and had the affectation\r\nof most young men of lively imagination, who suppose that they can better\r\ndispense with the possession of money, than resign their time and\r\nfaculties to the labour necessary to acquire it. But in my father's case,\r\nI knew that bankruptcy would be considered as an utter and irretrievable\r\ndisgrace, to which life would afford no comfort, and death the speediest\r\nand sole relief.\r\n\r\nMy mind, therefore, was bent on averting this catastrophe, with an\r\nintensity which the interest could not have produced had it referred to\r\nmy own fortunes; and the result of my deliberation was a firm resolution\r\nto depart from Osbaldistone Hall the next day and wend my way without\r\nloss of time to meet Owen at Glasgow. I did not hold it expedient to\r\nintimate my departure to my uncle, otherwise than by leaving a letter of\r\nthanks for his hospitality, assuring him that sudden and important\r\nbusiness prevented my offering them in person. I knew the blunt old\r\nknight would readily excuse ceremony; and I had such a belief in the\r\nextent and decided character of Rashleigh's machinations, that I had some\r\napprehension of his having provided means to intercept a journey which\r\nwas undertaken with a view to disconcert them, if my departure were\r\npublicly announced at Osbaldistone Hall.\r\n\r\nI therefore determined to set off on my journey with daylight on the\r\nensuing morning, and to gain the neighbouring kingdom of Scotland before\r\nany idea of my departure was entertained at the Hall. But one impediment\r\nof consequence was likely to prevent that speed which was the soul of my\r\nexpedition. I did not know the shortest, nor indeed any road to Glasgow;\r\nand as, in the circumstances in which I stood, despatch was of the\r\ngreatest consequence, I determined to consult Andrew Fairservice on the\r\nsubject, as the nearest and most authentic authority within my reach.\r\nLate as it was, I set off with the intention of ascertaining this\r\nimportant point, and after a few minutes' walk reached the dwelling of\r\nthe gardener.\r\n\r\nAndrew's dwelling was situated at no great distance from the exterior\r\nwall of the garden--a snug comfortable Northumbrian cottage, built of\r\nstones roughly dressed with the hammer, and having the windows and doors\r\ndecorated with huge heavy architraves, or lintels, as they are called, of\r\nhewn stone, and its roof covered with broad grey flags, instead of\r\nslates, thatch, or tiles. A jargonelle pear-tree at one end of the\r\ncottage, a rivulet and flower-plot of a rood in extent in front, and a\r\nkitchen-garden behind; a paddock for a cow, and a small field, cultivated\r\nwith several crops of grain, rather for the benefit of the cottager than\r\nfor sale, announced the warm and cordial comforts which Old England, even\r\nat her most northern extremity, extends to her meanest inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAs I approached the mansion of the sapient Andrew, I heard a noise,\r\nwhich, being of a nature peculiarly solemn, nasal, and prolonged, led me\r\nto think that Andrew, according to the decent and meritorious custom of\r\nhis countrymen, had assembled some of his neighbours to join in family\r\nexercise, as he called evening devotion. Andrew had indeed neither wife,\r\nchild, nor female inmate in his family. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first of his trade,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9chad had eneugh o'thae cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d But, notwithstanding, he sometimes\r\ncontrived to form an audience for himself out of the neighbouring Papists\r\nand Church-of-Englandmen--brands, as he expressed it, snatched out of the\r\nburning, on whom he used to exercise his spiritual gifts, in defiance\r\nalike of Father Vaughan, Father Docharty, Rashleigh, and all the world of\r\nCatholics around him, who deemed his interference on such occasions an\r\nact of heretical interloping. I conceived it likely, therefore, that the\r\nwell-disposed neighbours might have assembled to hold some chapel of ease\r\nof this nature. The noise, however, when I listened to it more\r\naccurately, seemed to proceed entirely from the lungs of the said Andrew;\r\nand when I interrupted it by entering the house, I found Fairservice\r\nalone, combating as he best could, with long words and hard names, and\r\nreading aloud, for the purpose of his own edification, a volume of\r\ncontroversial divinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just taking a spell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laying aside the huge folio volume\r\nas I entered, \xe2\x80\x9cof the worthy Doctor Lightfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLightfoot!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, looking at the ponderous volume with some\r\nsurprise; \xe2\x80\x9csurely your author was unhappily named.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLightfoot was his name, sir; a divine he was, and another kind of a\r\ndivine than they hae now-adays. Always, I crave your pardon for keeping\r\nye standing at the door, but having been mistrysted (gude preserve us!)\r\nwith ae bogle the night already, I was dubious o' opening the yett till I\r\nhad gaen through the e'ening worship; and I had just finished the fifth\r\nchapter of Nehemiah--if that winna gar them keep their distance, I wotna\r\nwhat will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrysted with a bogle!\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you mean by that, Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said mistrysted,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is as muckle as to say, fley'd\r\nwi' a ghaist--Gude preserve us, I say again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlay'd by a ghost, Andrew! how am I to understand that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say flay'd,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cbut _fley'd,_--that is, I got a\r\nfleg, and was ready to jump out o' my skin, though naebody offered to\r\nwhirl it aff my body as a man wad bark a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg a truce to your terrors in the present case, Andrew, and I wish to\r\nknow whether you can direct me the nearest way to a town in your country\r\nof Scotland, called Glasgow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA town ca'd Glasgow!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Andrew Fairservice. \xe2\x80\x9cGlasgow's a ceety,\r\nman.--And is't the way to Glasgow ye were speering if I ken'd?--What suld\r\nail me to ken it?--it's no that dooms far frae my ain parish of\r\nDreepdaily, that lies a bittock farther to the west. But what may your\r\nhonour be gaun to Glasgow for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticular business,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's as muckle as to say, Speer nae questions, and I'll tell ye nae\r\nlees.--To Glasgow?\xe2\x80\x9d--he made a short pause--\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking ye wad be the\r\nbetter o' some ane to show you the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if I could meet with any person going that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your honour, doubtless, wad consider the time and trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnquestionably--my business is pressing, and if you can find any guide\r\nto accompany me, I'll pay him handsomely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no a day to speak o' carnal matters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, casting his\r\neyes upwards; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if it werena Sabbath at e'en, I wad speer what ye wad\r\nbe content to gie to ane that wad bear ye pleasant company on the road,\r\nand tell ye the names of the gentlemen's and noblemen's seats and\r\ncastles, and count their kin to ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, all I want to know is the road I must travel; I will pay the\r\nfellow to his satisfaction--I will give him anything in reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnything,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cis naething; and this lad that I am speaking\r\no' kens a' the short cuts and queer by-paths through the hills, and\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no time to talk about it, Andrew; do you make the bargain for me\r\nyour own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! that's speaking to the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Andrew.--\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking,\r\nsince sae be that sae it is, I'll be the lad that will guide you mysell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Andrew?--how will you get away from your employment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell'd your honour a while syne, that it was lang that I hae been\r\nthinking o' flitting, maybe as lang as frae the first year I came to\r\nOsbaldistone Hall; and now I am o' the mind to gang in gude\r\nearnest--better soon as syne--better a finger aff as aye wagging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave your service, then?--but will you not lose your wages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae doubt there will be a certain loss; but then I hae siller o' the\r\nlaird's in my hands that I took for the apples in the auld orchyard--and\r\na sair bargain the folk had that bought them--a wheen green trash--and\r\nyet Sir Hildebrand's as keen to hae the siller (that is, the steward is\r\nas pressing about it) as if they had been a' gowden pippins--and then\r\nthere's the siller for the seeds--I'm thinking the wage will be in a\r\nmanner decently made up.--But doubtless your honour will consider my risk\r\nof loss when we win to Glasgow--and ye'll be for setting out forthwith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy day-break in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's something o' the suddenest--whare am I to find a naig?--Stay--I\r\nken just the beast that will answer me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt five in the morning, then, Andrew, you will meet me at the head of\r\nthe avenue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil a fear o' me (that I suld say sae) missing my tryste,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nAndrew, very briskly; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I might advise, we wad be aff twa hours\r\nearlier. I ken the way, dark or light, as weel as blind Ralph Ronaldson,\r\nthat's travelled ower every moor in the country-side, and disna ken the\r\ncolour of a heather-cowe when a's dune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI highly approved of Andrew's amendment on my original proposal, and we\r\nagreed to meet at the place appointed at three in the morning. At once,\r\nhowever, a reflection came across the mind of my intended travelling\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bogle! the bogle! what if it should come out upon us?--I downa\r\nforgather wi' thae things twice in the four-and-twenty hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, breaking away from him, \xe2\x80\x9cfear nothing from the\r\nnext world--the earth contains living fiends, who can act for themselves\r\nwithout assistance, were the whole host that fell with Lucifer to return\r\nto aid and abet them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the import of which was suggested by my own situation,\r\nI left Andrew's habitation, and returned to the Hall.\r\n\r\nI made the few preparations which were necessary for my proposed journey,\r\nexamined and loaded my pistols, and then threw myself on my bed, to\r\nobtain, if possible, a brief sleep before the fatigue of a long and\r\nanxious journey. Nature, exhausted by the tumultuous agitations of the\r\nday, was kinder to me than I expected, and I sank into a deep and\r\nprofound slumber, from which, however, I started as the old clock struck\r\ntwo from a turret adjoining to my bedchamber. I instantly arose, struck a\r\nlight, wrote the letter I proposed to leave for my uncle, and leaving\r\nbehind me such articles of dress as were cumbrous in carriage, I\r\ndeposited the rest of my wardrobe in my valise, glided down stairs, and\r\ngained the stable without impediment. Without being quite such a groom as\r\nany of my cousins, I had learned at Osbaldistone Hall to dress and saddle\r\nmy own horse, and in a few minutes I was mounted and ready for my sally.\r\n\r\nAs I paced up the old avenue, on which the waning moon threw its light\r\nwith a pale and whitish tinge, I looked back with a deep and boding sigh\r\ntowards the walls which contained Diana Vernon, under the despondent\r\nimpression that we had probably parted to meet no more. It was\r\nimpossible, among the long and irregular lines of Gothic casements, which\r\nnow looked ghastly white in the moonlight, to distinguish that of the\r\napartment which she inhabited. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is lost to me already,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, as\r\nmy eye wandered over the dim and indistinguishable intricacies of\r\narchitecture offered by the moonlight view of Osbaldistone Hall--\xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nlost to me already, ere I have left the place which she inhabits! What\r\nhope is there of my maintaining any correspondence with her, when leagues\r\nshall lie between?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile I paused in a reverie of no very pleasing nature, the \xe2\x80\x9ciron tongue\r\nof time told three upon the drowsy ear of night,\xe2\x80\x9d and reminded me of the\r\nnecessity of keeping my appointment with a person of a less interesting\r\ndescription and appearance--Andrew Fairservice.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the avenue I found a horseman stationed in the shadow of\r\nthe wall, but it was not until I had coughed twice, and then called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew,\xe2\x80\x9d that the horticulturist replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI'se warrant it's Andrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLead the way, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand be silent if you can, till we are past\r\nthe hamlet in the valley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrew led the way accordingly, and at a much brisker pace than I would\r\nhave recommended.--and so well did he obey my injunctions of keeping\r\nsilence, that he would return no answer to my repeated inquiries into the\r\ncause of such unnecessary haste. Extricating ourselves by short cuts,\r\nknown to Andrew, from the numerous stony lanes and by-paths which\r\nintersected each other in the vicinity of the Hall, we reached the open\r\nheath and riding swiftly across it, took our course among the barren\r\nhills which divide England from Scotland on what are called the Middle\r\nMarches. The way, or rather the broken track which we occupied, was a\r\nhappy interchange of bog and shingles; nevertheless, Andrew relented\r\nnothing of his speed, but trotted manfully forward at the rate of eight\r\nor ten miles an hour. I was both surprised and provoked at the fellow's\r\nobstinate persistence, for we made abrupt ascents and descents over\r\nground of a very break-neck character, and traversed the edge of\r\nprecipices, where a slip of the horse's feet would have consigned the\r\nrider to certain death. The moon, at best, afforded a dubious and\r\nimperfect light; but in some places we were so much under the shade of\r\nthe mountain as to be in total darkness, and then I could only trace\r\nAndrew by the clatter of his horse's feet, and the fire which they struck\r\nfrom the flints. At first, this rapid motion, and the attention which,\r\nfor the sake of personal safety, I was compelled to give to the conduct\r\nof my horse, was of service, by forcibly diverting my thoughts from the\r\nvarious painful reflections which must otherwise have pressed on my mind.\r\nBut at length, after hallooing repeatedly to Andrew to ride slower, I\r\nbecame seriously incensed at his impudent perseverance in refusing either\r\nto obey or to reply to me. My anger was, however, quite impotent. I\r\nattempted once or twice to get up alongside of my self-willed guide, with\r\nthe purpose of knocking him off his horse with the butt-end of my whip;\r\nbut Andrew was better mounted than I, and either the spirit of the animal\r\nwhich he bestrode, or more probably some presentiment of my kind\r\nintentions towards him, induced him to quicken his pace whenever I\r\nattempted to make up to him. On the other hand, I was compelled to exert\r\nmy spurs to keep him in sight, for without his guidance I was too well\r\naware that I should never find my way through the howling wilderness\r\nwhich we now traversed at such an unwonted pace. I was so angry at\r\nlength, that I threatened to have recourse to my pistols, and send a\r\nbullet after the Hotspur Andrew, which should stop his fiery-footed\r\ncareer, if he did not abate it of his own accord. Apparently this threat\r\nmade some impression on the tympanum of his ear, however deaf to all my\r\nmilder entreaties; for he relaxed his pace upon hearing it, and,\r\nsuffering me to close up to him, observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere wasna muckle sense in\r\nriding at sic a daft-like gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you mean by doing so at all, you self-willed scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied I; for I was in a towering passion,--to which, by the way,\r\nnothing contributes more than the having recently undergone a spice of\r\npersonal fear, which, like a few drops of water flung on a glowing fire,\r\nis sure to inflame the ardour which it is insufficient to quench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's your honour's wull?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew, with impenetrable gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy will, you rascal?--I have been roaring to you this hour to ride\r\nslower, and you have never so much as answered me--Are you drunk or mad\r\nto behave so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn it like your honour, I am something dull o' hearing; and I'll no deny\r\nbut I might have maybe taen a stirrup-cup at parting frae the auld\r\nbigging whare I hae dwelt sae lang; and having naebody to pledge, nae\r\ndoubt I was obliged to do mysell reason, or else leave the end o' the\r\nbrandy stoup to thae papists--and that wad be a waste, as your honour\r\nkens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis might be all very true,--and my circumstances required that I should\r\nbe on good terms with my guide; I therefore satisfied myself with\r\nrequiring of him to take his directions from me in future concerning the\r\nrate of travelling.\r\n\r\nAndrew, emboldened by the mildness of my tone, elevated his own into the\r\npedantic, conceited octave, which was familiar to him on most occasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honour winna persuade me, and naebody shall persuade me, that it's\r\neither halesome or prudent to tak the night air on thae moors without a\r\ncordial o' clow-gilliflower water, or a tass of brandy or aquavitae, or\r\nsic-like creature-comfort. I hae taen the bent ower the Otterscrape-rigg\r\na hundred times, day and night, and never could find the way unless I had\r\ntaen my morning; mair by token that I had whiles twa bits o' ankers o'\r\nbrandy on ilk side o' me.\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were a smuggler--how does a man of\r\nyour strict principles reconcile yourself to cheat the revenue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a mere spoiling o' the Egyptians,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cpuir auld\r\nScotland suffers eneugh by thae blackguard loons o' excisemen and\r\ngaugers, that hae come down on her like locusts since the sad and\r\nsorrowfu' Union; it's the part of a kind son to bring her a soup o'\r\nsomething that will keep up her auld heart,--and that will they nill\r\nthey, the ill-fa'ard thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon more particular inquiry, I found Andrew had frequently travelled\r\nthese mountain-paths as a smuggler, both before and after his\r\nestablishment at Osbaldistone Hall--a circumstance which was so far of\r\nimportance to me, as it proved his capacity as a guide, notwithstanding\r\nthe escapade of which he had been guilty at his outset. Even now, though\r\ntravelling at a more moderate pace, the stirrup-cup, or whatever else had\r\nsuch an effect in stimulating Andrew's motions, seemed not totally to\r\nhave lost its influence. He often cast a nervous and startled look behind\r\nhim; and whenever the road seemed at all practicable, showed symptoms of\r\na desire to accelerate his pace, as if he feared some pursuit from the\r\nrear. These appearances of alarm gradually diminished as we reached the\r\ntop of a high bleak ridge, which ran nearly east and west for about a\r\nmile, with a very steep descent on either side. The pale beams of the\r\nmorning were now enlightening the horizon, when Andrew cast a look behind\r\nhim, and not seeing the appearance of a living being on the moors which\r\nhe had travelled, his hard features gradually unbent, as he first\r\nwhistled, then sung, with much glee and little melody, the end of one of\r\nhis native songs--\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cJenny, lass! I think I hae her\r\n                     Ower the muir amang the heather,\r\n                     All their clan shall never get her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe patted at the same time the neck of the horse which had carried him so\r\ngallantly; and my attention being directed by that action to the animal,\r\nI instantly recognised a favourite mare of Thorncliff Osbaldistone. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nis this, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said I sternly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is Mr. Thorncliff's mare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll no say but she may aiblins hae been his honour's Squire\r\nThorncliff's in her day--but she's mine now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have stolen her, you rascal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na, sir--nae man can wyte me wi' theft. The thing stands this gate,\r\nye see. Squire Thorncliff borrowed ten punds o' me to gang to York\r\nRaces--deil a boddle wad he pay me back again, and spake o' raddling my\r\nbanes, as he ca'd it, when I asked him but for my ain back again;--now I\r\nthink it will riddle him or he gets his horse ower the Border\r\nagain--unless he pays me plack and bawbee, he sall never see a hair o'\r\nher tail. I ken a canny chield at Loughmaben, a bit writer lad, that\r\nwill put me in the way to sort him. Steal the mear! na, na, far be the\r\nsin o' theft frae Andrew Fairservice--I have just arrested her\r\n_jurisdictionis fandandy causey._ Thae are bonny writer words--amaist\r\nlike the language o' huz gardeners and other learned men--it's a pity\r\nthey're sae dear;--thae three words were a' that Andrew got for a lang\r\nlaw-plea and four ankers o' as gude brandy as was e'er coupit ower\r\ncraig--Hech, sirs! but law's a dear thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are likely to find it much dearer than you suppose, Andrew, if you\r\nproceed in this mode of paying yourself, without legal authority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout tout, we're in Scotland now (be praised for't!) and I can find\r\nbaith friends and lawyers, and judges too, as weel as ony Osbaldistone o'\r\nthem a'. My mither's mither's third cousin was cousin to the Provost o'\r\nDumfries, and he winna see a drap o' her blude wranged. Hout awa! the\r\nlaws are indifferently administered here to a' men alike; it's no like on\r\nyon side, when a chield may be whuppit awa' wi' ane o' Clerk Jobson's\r\nwarrants, afore he kens where he is. But they will hae little enough law\r\namang them by and by, and that is ae grand reason that I hae gi'en them\r\ngude-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was highly provoked at the achievement of Andrew, and considered it as\r\na hard fate, which a second time threw me into collision with a person of\r\nsuch irregular practices. I determined, however, to buy the mare of him,\r\nwhen he should reach the end of our journey, and send her back to my\r\ncousin at Osbaldistone Hall; and with this purpose of reparation I\r\nresolved to make my uncle acquainted from the next post-town. It was\r\nneedless, I thought, to quarrel with Andrew in the meantime, who had,\r\nafter all, acted not very unnaturally for a person in his circumstances.\r\nI therefore smothered my resentment, and asked him what he meant by his\r\nlast expressions, that there would be little law in Northumberland by and\r\nby?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw!\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9chout, ay--there will be club-law eneugh. The priests\r\nand the Irish officers, and thae papist cattle that hae been sodgering\r\nabroad, because they durstna bide at hame, are a' fleeing thick in\r\nNorthumberland e'enow; and thae corbies dinna gather without they smell\r\ncarrion. As sure as ye live, his honour Sir Hildebrand is gaun to stick\r\nhis horn in the bog--there's naething but gun and pistol, sword and\r\ndagger, amang them--and they'll be laying on, I'se warrant; for they're\r\nfearless fules the young Osbaldistone squires, aye craving your honour's\r\npardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech recalled to my memory some suspicions that I myself had\r\nentertained, that the Jacobites were on the eve of some desperate\r\nenterprise. But, conscious it did not become me to be a spy on my uncle's\r\nwords and actions, I had rather avoided than availed myself of any\r\nopportunity which occurred of remarking upon the signs of the times.--\r\nAndrew Fairservice felt no such restraint, and doubtless spoke very truly\r\nin stating his conviction that some desperate plots were in agitation, as\r\na reason which determined his resolution to leave the Hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants,\xe2\x80\x9d he stated, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the tenantry and others, had been all\r\nregularly enrolled and mustered, and they wanted me to take arms also.\r\nBut I'll ride in nae siccan troop--they little ken'd Andrew that asked\r\nhim. I'll fight when I like mysell, but it sall neither be for the hure\r\no' Babylon, nor any hure in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Where longs to fall yon rifted spire,\r\n                     As weary of the insulting air,--\r\n                 The poet's thoughts, the warrior's fire,\r\n                     The lover's sighs, are sleeping there.\r\n                                             Langhorne.\r\n\r\nAt the first Scotch town which we reached, my guide sought out his friend\r\nand counsellor, to consult upon the proper and legal means of converting\r\ninto his own lawful property the \xe2\x80\x9cbonny creature,\xe2\x80\x9d which was at present\r\nhis own only by one of those sleight-of-hand arrangements which still\r\nsometimes took place in that once lawless district. I was somewhat\r\ndiverted with the dejection of his looks on his return. He had, it seems,\r\nbeen rather too communicative to his confidential friend, the attorney;\r\nand learned with great dismay, in return for his unsuspecting frankness,\r\nthat Mr. Touthope had, during his absence, been appointed clerk to the\r\npeace of the county, and was bound to communicate to justice all such\r\nachievements as that of his friend Mr. Andrew Fairservice. There was a\r\nnecessity, this alert member of the police stated, for arresting the\r\nhorse, and placing him in Bailie Trumbull's stable, therein to remain at\r\nlivery, at the rate of twelve shillings (Scotch) per diem, until the\r\nquestion of property was duly tried and debated. He even talked as if, in\r\nstrict and rigorous execution of his duty, he ought to detain honest\r\nAndrew himself; but on my guide's most piteously entreating his\r\nforbearance, he not only desisted from this proposal, but made a present\r\nto Andrew of a broken-winded and spavined pony, in order to enable him to\r\npursue his journey. It is true, he qualified this act of generosity by\r\nexacting from poor Andrew an absolute cession of his right and interest\r\nin the gallant palfrey of Thorncliff Osbaldistone--a transference which\r\nMr. Touthope represented as of very little consequence, since his\r\nunfortunate friend, as he facetiously observed, was likely to get nothing\r\nof the mare excepting the halter.\r\n\r\nAndrew seemed woeful and disconcerted, as I screwed out of him these\r\nparticulars; for his northern pride was cruelly pinched by being\r\ncompelled to admit that attorneys were attorneys on both sides of the\r\nTweed; and that Mr. Clerk Touthope was not a farthing more sterling coin\r\nthan Mr. Clerk Jobson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wadna hae vexed him half sae muckle to hae been cheated out o' what\r\nmight amaist be said to be won with the peril o' his craig, had it\r\nhappened amang the Inglishers; but it was an unco thing to see hawks pike\r\nout hawks' e'en, or ae kindly Scot cheat anither. But nae doubt things\r\nwere strangely changed in his country sin' the sad and sorrowfu' Union;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n an event to which Andrew referred every symptom of depravity or\r\ndegeneracy which he remarked among his countrymen, more especially the\r\ninflammation of reckonings, the diminished size of pint-stoups, and other\r\ngrievances, which he pointed out to me during our journey.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I held myself, as things had turned out, acquitted of\r\nall charge of the mare, and wrote to my uncle the circumstances under\r\nwhich she was carried into Scotland, concluding with informing him that\r\nshe was in the hands of justice, and her worthy representatives, Bailie\r\nTrumbull and Mr. Clerk Touthope, to whom I referred him for farther\r\nparticulars. Whether the property returned to the Northumbrian\r\nfox-hunter, or continued to bear the person of the Scottish attorney, it\r\nis unnecessary for me at present to say.\r\n\r\nWe now pursued our journey to the north-westward, at a rate much slower\r\nthan that at which we had achieved our nocturnal retreat from England.\r\nOne chain of barren and uninteresting hills succeeded another, until the\r\nmore fertile vale of Clyde opened upon us; and, with such despatch as we\r\nmight, we gained the town, or, as my guide pertinaciously termed it, the\r\ncity, of Glasgow. Of late years, I understand, it has fully deserved the\r\nname, which, by a sort of political second sight, my guide assigned to\r\nit. An extensive and increasing trade with the West Indies and American\r\ncolonies, has, if I am rightly informed, laid the foundation of wealth\r\nand prosperity, which, if carefully strengthened and built upon, may one\r\nday support an immense fabric of commercial prosperity; but in the\r\nearlier time of which I speak, the dawn of this splendour had not arisen.\r\nThe Union had, indeed, opened to Scotland the trade of the English\r\ncolonies; but, betwixt want of capital, and the national jealousy of the\r\nEnglish, the merchants of Scotland were as yet excluded, in a great\r\nmeasure, from the exercise of the privileges which that memorable treaty\r\nconferred on them. Glasgow lay on the wrong side of the island for\r\nparticipating in the east country or continental trade, by which the\r\ntrifling commerce as yet possessed by Scotland chiefly supported itself.\r\nYet, though she then gave small promise of the commercial eminence to\r\nwhich, I am informed, she seems now likely one day to attain, Glasgow, as\r\nthe principal central town of the western district of Scotland, was a\r\nplace of considerable rank and importance. The broad and brimming Clyde,\r\nwhich flows so near its walls, gave the means of an inland navigation of\r\nsome importance. Not only the fertile plains in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, but the districts of Ayr and Dumfries regarded Glasgow as\r\ntheir capital, to which they transmitted their produce, and received in\r\nreturn such necessaries and luxuries as their consumption required.\r\n\r\nThe dusky mountains of the western Highlands often sent forth wilder\r\ntribes to frequent the marts of St. Mungo's favourite city. Hordes of\r\nwild shaggy, dwarfish cattle and ponies, conducted by Highlanders, as\r\nwild, as shaggy, and sometimes as dwarfish, as the animals they had in\r\ncharge, often traversed the streets of Glasgow. Strangers gazed with\r\nsurprise on the antique and fantastic dress, and listened to the unknown\r\nand dissonant sounds of their language, while the mountaineers, armed,\r\neven while engaged in this peaceful occupation, with musket and pistol,\r\nsword, dagger, and target, stared with astonishment on the articles of\r\nluxury of which they knew not the use, and with an avidity which seemed\r\nsomewhat alarming on the articles which they knew and valued. It is\r\nalways with unwillingness that the Highlander quits his deserts, and at\r\nthis early period it was like tearing a pine from its rock, to plant him\r\nelsewhere. Yet even then the mountain glens were over-peopled, although\r\nthinned occasionally by famine or by the sword, and many of their\r\ninhabitants strayed down to Glasgow--there formed settlements--there\r\nsought and found employment, although different, indeed, from that of\r\ntheir native hills. This supply of a hardy and useful population was of\r\nconsequence to the prosperity of the place, furnished the means of\r\ncarrying on the few manufactures which the town already boasted, and laid\r\nthe foundation of its future prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the city corresponded with these promising circumstances.\r\nThe principal street was broad and important, decorated with public\r\nbuildings, of an architecture rather striking than correct in point of\r\ntaste, and running between rows of tall houses, built of stone, the\r\nfronts of which were occasionally richly ornamented with mason-work--a\r\ncircumstance which gave the street an imposing air of dignity and\r\ngrandeur, of which most English towns are in some measure deprived, by\r\nthe slight, insubstantial, and perishable quality and appearance of the\r\nbricks with which they are constructed.\r\n\r\nIn the western metropolis of Scotland, my guide and I arrived on a\r\nSaturday evening, too late to entertain thoughts of business of any kind.\r\nWe alighted at the door of a jolly hostler-wife, as Andrew called\r\nher,--the Ostelere of old father Chaucer,--by whom we were civilly\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the bells pealed from every steeple, announcing\r\nthe sanctity of the day. Notwithstanding, however, what I had heard of\r\nthe severity with which the Sabbath is observed in Scotland, my first\r\nimpulse, not unnaturally, was to seek out Owen; but on inquiry I found\r\nthat my attempt would be in vain, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil kirk time was ower.\xe2\x80\x9d Not only\r\ndid my landlady and guide jointly assure me that \xe2\x80\x9cthere wadna be a living\r\nsoul either in the counting-house or dwelling-house of Messrs. MacVittie,\r\nMacFin, and Company,\xe2\x80\x9d to which Owen's letter referred me, but, moreover,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfar less would I find any of the partners there. They were serious men,\r\nand wad be where a' gude Christians ought to be at sic a time, and that\r\nwas in the Barony Laigh Kirk.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* [The Laigh Kirk or Crypt of the Cathedral of Glasgow served for more *\r\nthan two centuries as the church of the Barony Parish, and, for a time,\r\nwas * converted into a burial-place. In the restorations of this grand\r\nbuilding * the crypt was cleared out, and is now admired as one of the\r\nrichest specimens * of Early English architecture existing in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Fairservice, whose disgust at the law of his country had\r\nfortunately not extended itself to the other learned professions of his\r\nnative land, now sung forth the praises of the preacher who was to\r\nperform the duty, to which my hostess replied with many loud amens. The\r\nresult was, that I determined to go to this popular place of worship, as\r\nmuch with the purpose of learning, if possible, whether Owen had arrived\r\nin Glasgow, as with any great expectation of edification. My hopes were\r\nexalted by the assurance, that if Mr. Ephraim MacVittie (worthy man) were\r\nin the land of life, he would surely honour the Barony Kirk that day with\r\nhis presence; and if he chanced to have a stranger within his gates,\r\ndoubtless he would bring him to the duty along with him. This probability\r\ndetermined my motions, and under the escort of my faithful Andrew, I set\r\nforth for the Barony Kirk.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, however, I had little need of his guidance; for the\r\ncrowd, which forced its way up a steep and rough-paved street, to hear\r\nthe most popular preacher in the west of Scotland, would of itself have\r\nswept me along with it. On attaining the summit of the hill, we turned to\r\nthe left, and a large pair of folding doors admitted us, amongst others,\r\ninto the open and extensive burying-place which surrounds the Minster or\r\nCathedral Church of Glasgow. The pile is of a gloomy and massive, rather\r\nthan of an elegant, style of Gothic architecture; but its peculiar\r\ncharacter is so strongly preserved, and so well suited with the\r\naccompaniments that surround it, that the impression of the first view\r\nwas awful and solemn in the extreme. I was indeed so much struck, that I\r\nresisted for a few minutes all Andrew's efforts to drag me into the\r\ninterior of the building, so deeply was I engaged in surveying its\r\noutward character.\r\n\r\nSituated in a populous and considerable town, this ancient and massive\r\npile has the appearance of the most sequestered solitude. High walls\r\ndivide it from the buildings of the city on one side; on the other it is\r\nbounded by a ravine, at the bottom of which, and invisible to the eye,\r\nmurmurs a wandering rivulet, adding, by its gentle noise, to the imposing\r\nsolemnity of the scene. On the opposite side of the ravine rises a steep\r\nbank, covered with fir-trees closely planted, whose dusky shade extends\r\nitself over the cemetery with an appropriate and gloomy effect. The\r\nchurchyard itself had a peculiar character; for though in reality\r\nextensive, it is small in proportion to the number of respectable\r\ninhabitants who are interred within it, and whose graves are almost all\r\ncovered with tombstones. There is therefore no room for the long rank\r\ngrass, which, in most cases, partially clothes the surface of those\r\nretreats where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at\r\nrest. The broad flat monumental stones are placed so close to each other,\r\nthat the precincts appear to be flagged with them, and, though roofed\r\nonly by the heavens, resemble the floor of one of our old English\r\nchurches, where the pavement is covered with sepulchral inscriptions. The\r\ncontents of these sad records of mortality, the vain sorrows which they\r\npreserve, the stern lesson which they teach of the nothingness of\r\nhumanity, the extent of ground which they so closely cover, and their\r\nuniform and melancholy tenor, reminded me of the roll of the prophet,\r\nwhich was \xe2\x80\x9cwritten within and without, and there was written therein\r\nlamentations and mourning and woe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral itself corresponds in impressive majesty with these\r\naccompaniments. We feel that its appearance is heavy, yet that the effect\r\nproduced would be destroyed were it lighter or more ornamental. It is the\r\nonly metropolitan church in Scotland, excepting, as I am informed, the\r\nCathedral of Kirkwall, in the Orkneys, which remained uninjured at the\r\nReformation; and Andrew Fairservice, who saw with great pride the effect\r\nwhich it produced upon my mind, thus accounted for its preservation--\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nit's a brave kirk--nane o' yere whig-maleeries and curliewurlies and\r\nopensteek hems about it--a' solid, weel-jointed mason-wark, that will\r\nstand as lang as the warld, keep hands and gunpowther aff it. It had\r\namaist a douncome lang syne at the Reformation, when they pu'd doun the\r\nkirks of St. Andrews and Perth, and thereawa', to cleanse them o' Papery,\r\nand idolatry, and image worship, and surplices, and sic like rags o' the\r\nmuckle hure that sitteth on seven hills, as if ane wasna braid eneugh for\r\nher auld hinder end. Sae the commons o' Renfrew, and o' the Barony, and\r\nthe Gorbals and a' about, they behoved to come into Glasgow no fair\r\nmorning, to try their hand on purging the High Kirk o' Popish\r\nnick-nackets. But the townsmen o' Glasgow, they were feared their auld\r\nedifice might slip the girths in gaun through siccan rough physic, sae\r\nthey rang the common bell, and assembled the train-bands wi' took o'\r\ndrum. By good luck, the worthy James Rabat was Dean o' Guild that\r\nyear--(and a gude mason he was himself, made him the keener to keep up\r\nthe auld bigging)--and the trades assembled, and offered downright\r\nbattle to the commons, rather than their kirk should coup the crans as\r\nothers had done elsewhere. It wasna for luve o' Paperie--na, na!--nane\r\ncould ever say that o' the trades o' Glasgow--Sae they sune came to an\r\nagreement to take a' the idolatrous statues of sants (sorrow be on them)\r\nout o' their neuks--and sae the bits o' stane idols were broken in\r\npieces by Scripture warrant, and flung into the Molendinar burn, and the\r\nauld kirk stood as crouse as a cat when the flaes are kaimed aff her,\r\nand a' body was alike pleased. And I hae heard wise folk say, that if\r\nthe same had been done in ilka kirk in Scotland, the Reform wad just hae\r\nbeen as pure as it is e'en now, and we wad hae mair Christian-like\r\nkirks; for I hae been sae lang in England, that naething will drived out\r\no' my head, that the dog-kennel at Osbaldistone Hall is better than mony\r\na house o' God in Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, Andrew led the way into the place of worship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRD.\r\n\r\n                          --It strikes an awe\r\n               And terror on my aching sight; the tombs\r\n               And monumental caves of death look cold,\r\n               And shoot a chillness to the trembling heart.\r\n                                           Mourning Bride.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the impatience of my conductor, I could not forbear to\r\npause and gaze for some minutes on the exterior of the building, rendered\r\nmore impressively dignified by the solitude which ensued when its\r\nhitherto open gates were closed, after having, as it were, devoured the\r\nmultitude which had lately crowded the churchyard, but now, enclosed\r\nwithin the building, were engaged, as the choral swell of voices from\r\nwithin announced to us, in the solemn exercises of devotion. The sound of\r\nso many voices united by the distance into one harmony, and freed from\r\nthose harsh discordances which jar the ear when heard more near,\r\ncombining with the murmuring brook, and the wind which sung among the old\r\nfirs, affected me with a sense of sublimity. All nature, as invoked by\r\nthe Psalmist whose verses they chanted, seemed united in offering that\r\nsolemn praise in which trembling is mixed with joy as she addressed her\r\nMaker. I had heard the service of high mass in France, celebrated with\r\nall the _e'clat_ which the choicest music, the richest dresses, the most\r\nimposing ceremonies, could confer on it; yet it fell short in effect of\r\nthe simplicity of the Presbyterian worship. The devotion in which every\r\none took a share seemed so superior to that which was recited by\r\nmusicians as a lesson which they had learned by rote, that it gave the\r\nScottish worship all the advantage of reality over acting.\r\n\r\nAs I lingered to catch more of the solemn sound, Andrew, whose impatience\r\nbecame ungovernable, pulled me by the sleeve--\xe2\x80\x9cCome awa', sir--come awa';\r\nwe maunna be late o' gaun in to disturb the worship; if we bide here the\r\nsearchers will be on us, and carry us to the guard-house for being idlers\r\nin kirk-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus admonished, I followed my guide, but not, as I had supposed, into\r\nthe body of the cathedral. \xe2\x80\x9cThis gate--this gate, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed,\r\ndragging me off as I made towards the main entrance of the\r\nbuilding--\xe2\x80\x9cThere's but cauldrife law-work gaun on yonder--carnal\r\nmorality, as dow'd and as fusionless as rue leaves at Yule--Here's the\r\nreal savour of doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, we entered a small low-arched door, secured by a wicket, which\r\na grave-looking person seemed on the point of closing, and descended\r\nseveral steps as if into the funeral vaults beneath the church. It was\r\neven so; for in these subterranean precincts,--why chosen for such a\r\npurpose I knew not,--was established a very singular place of worship.\r\n\r\nConceive, Tresham, an extensive range of low-browed, dark, and twilight\r\nvaults, such as are used for sepulchres in other countries, and had long\r\nbeen dedicated to the same purpose in this, a portion of which was seated\r\nwith pews, and used as a church. The part of the vaults thus occupied,\r\nthough capable of containing a congregation of many hundreds, bore a\r\nsmall proportion to the darker and more extensive caverns which yawned\r\naround what may be termed the inhabited space. In those waste regions of\r\noblivion, dusky banners and tattered escutcheons indicated the graves of\r\nthose who were once, doubtless, \xe2\x80\x9cprinces in Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d Inscriptions, which\r\ncould only be read by the painful antiquary, in language as obsolete as\r\nthe act of devotional charity which they employed, invited the passengers\r\nto pray for the souls of those whose bodies rested beneath. Surrounded by\r\nthese receptacles of the last remains of mortality, I found a numerous\r\ncongregation engaged in the act of prayer. The Scotch perform this duty\r\nin a standing instead of a kneeling posture--more, perhaps, to take as\r\nbroad a distinction as possible from the ritual of Rome than for any\r\nbetter reason; since I have observed, that in their family worship, as\r\ndoubtless in their private devotions, they adopt, in their immediate\r\naddress to the Deity, that posture which other Christians use as the\r\nhumblest and most reverential. Standing, therefore, the men being\r\nuncovered, a crowd of several hundreds of both sexes, and all ages,\r\nlistened with great reverence and attention to the extempore, at least\r\nthe unwritten, prayer of an aged clergyman,* who was very popular in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n* I have in vain laboured to discover this gentleman's name, and the\r\nperiod of his incumbency. I do not, however, despair to see these points,\r\nwith some others which may elude my sagacity, satisfactorily elucidated\r\nby one or other of the periodical publications which have devoted their\r\npages to explanatory commentaries on my former volumes; and whose\r\nresearch and ingenuity claim my peculiar gratitude, for having discovered\r\nmany persons and circumstances connected with my narratives, of which I\r\nmyself never so much as dreamed.\r\n\r\nEducated in the same religious persuasion, I seriously bent my mind to\r\njoin in the devotion of the day; and it was not till the congregation\r\nresumed their seats, that my attention was diverted to the consideration\r\nof the appearance of all around me.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the prayer, most of the men put on their hats or\r\nbonnets, and all who had the happiness to have seats sate down. Andrew\r\nand I were not of this number, having been too late of entering the\r\nchurch to secure such accommodation. We stood among a number of other\r\npersons in the same situation, forming a sort of ring around the seated\r\npart of the congregation. Behind and around us were the vaults I have\r\nalready described; before us the devout audience, dimly shown by the\r\nlight which streamed on their faces through one or two low Gothic\r\nwindows, such as give air and light to charnel-houses. By this were seen\r\nthe usual variety of countenances which are generally turned towards a\r\nScotch pastor on such occasions, almost all composed to attention, unless\r\nwhere a father or mother here and there recalls the wandering eyes of a\r\nlively child, or disturbs the slumbers of a dull one. The high-boned and\r\nharsh countenance of the nation, with the expression of intelligence and\r\nshrewdness which it frequently exhibits, is seen to more advantage in the\r\nact of devotion, or in the ranks of war, than on lighter and more\r\ncheerful occasions of assemblage. The discourse of the preacher was well\r\nqualified to call forth the various feelings and faculties of his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nAge and infirmities had impaired the powers of a voice originally strong\r\nand sonorous. He read his text with a pronunciation somewhat\r\ninarticulate; but when he closed the Bible, and commenced his sermon, his\r\ntones gradually strengthened, as he entered with vehemence into the\r\narguments which he maintained. They related chiefly to the abstract\r\npoints of the Christian faith,--subjects grave, deep, and fathomless by\r\nmere human reason, but for which, with equal ingenuity and propriety, he\r\nsought a key in liberal quotations from the inspired writings. My mind\r\nwas unprepared to coincide in all his reasoning, nor was I sure that in\r\nsome instances I rightly comprehended his positions. But nothing could be\r\nmore impressive than the eager enthusiastic manner of the good old man,\r\nand nothing more ingenious than his mode of reasoning. The Scotch, it is\r\nwell known, are more remarkable for the exercise of their intellectual\r\npowers, than for the keenness of their feelings; they are, therefore,\r\nmore moved by logic than by rhetoric, and more attracted by acute and\r\nargumentative reasoning on doctrinal points, than influenced by the\r\nenthusiastic appeals to the heart and to the passions, by which popular\r\npreachers in other countries win the favour of their hearers.\r\n\r\nAmong the attentive group which I now saw, might be distinguished various\r\nexpressions similar to those of the audience in the famous cartoon of\r\nPaul preaching at Athens. Here sat a zealous and intelligent Calvinist,\r\nwith brows bent just as much as to indicate profound attention; lips\r\nslightly compressed; eyes fixed on the minister with an expression of\r\ndecent pride, as if sharing the triumph of his argument; the forefinger\r\nof the right hand touching successively those of the left, as the\r\npreacher, from argument to argument, ascended towards his conclusion.\r\nAnother, with fiercer and sterner look, intimated at once his contempt of\r\nall who doubted the creed of his pastor, and his joy at the appropriate\r\npunishment denounced against them. A third, perhaps belonging to a\r\ndifferent congregation, and present only by accident or curiosity, had\r\nthe appearance of internally impeaching some link of the reasoning; and\r\nyou might plainly read, in the slight motion of his head, his doubts as\r\nto the soundness of the preacher's argument. The greater part listened\r\nwith a calm, satisfied countenance, expressive of a conscious merit in\r\nbeing present, and in listening to such an ingenious discourse, although\r\nperhaps unable entirely to comprehend it. The women in general belonged\r\nto this last division of the audience; the old, however, seeming more\r\ngrimly intent upon the abstract doctrines laid before them; while the\r\nyounger females permitted their eyes occasionally to make a modest\r\ncircuit around the congregation; and some of them, Tresham (if my vanity\r\ndid not greatly deceive me), contrived to distinguish your friend and\r\nservant, as a handsome young stranger and an Englishman. As to the rest\r\nof the congregation, the stupid gaped, yawned, or slept, till awakened by\r\nthe application of their more zealous neighbours' heels to their shins;\r\nand the idle indicated their inattention by the wandering of their eyes,\r\nbut dared give no more decided token of weariness. Amid the Lowland\r\ncostume of coat and cloak, I could here and there discern a Highland\r\nplaid, the wearer of which, resting on his basket-hilt, sent his eyes\r\namong the audience with the unrestrained curiosity of savage wonder; and\r\nwho, in all probability, was inattentive to the sermon for a very\r\npardonable reason--because he did not understand the language in which it\r\nwas delivered. The martial and wild look, however, of these stragglers,\r\nadded a kind of character which the congregation could not have exhibited\r\nwithout them. They were more numerous, Andrew afterwards observed, owing\r\nto some cattle-fair in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSuch was the group of countenances, rising tier on tier, discovered to my\r\ncritical inspection by such sunbeams as forced their way through the\r\nnarrow Gothic lattices of the Laigh Kirk of Glasgow; and, having\r\nilluminated the attentive congregation, lost themselves in the vacuity of\r\nthe vaults behind, giving to the nearer part of their labyrinth a sort of\r\nimperfect twilight, and leaving their recesses in an utter darkness,\r\nwhich gave them the appearance of being interminable.\r\n\r\nI have already said that I stood with others in the exterior circle, with\r\nmy face to the preacher, and my back to those vaults which I have so\r\noften mentioned. My position rendered me particularly obnoxious to any\r\ninterruption which arose from any slight noise occurring amongst these\r\nretiring arches, where the least sound was multiplied by a thousand\r\nechoes. The occasional sound of rain-drops, which, admitted through some\r\ncranny in the ruined roof, fell successively, and splashed upon the\r\npavement beneath, caused me to turn my head more than once to the place\r\nfrom whence it seemed to proceed, and when my eyes took that direction, I\r\nfound it difficult to withdraw them; such is the pleasure our imagination\r\nreceives from the attempt to penetrate as far as possible into an\r\nintricate labyrinth, imperfectly lighted, and exhibiting objects which\r\nirritate our curiosity, only because they acquire a mysterious interest\r\nfrom being undefined and dubious. My eyes became habituated to the gloomy\r\natmosphere to which I directed them, and insensibly my mind became more\r\ninterested in their discoveries than in the metaphysical subtleties which\r\nthe preacher was enforcing.\r\n\r\nMy father had often checked me for this wandering mood of mind, arising\r\nperhaps from an excitability of imagination to which he was a stranger;\r\nand the finding myself at present solicited by these temptations to\r\ninattention, recalled the time when I used to walk, led by his hand, to\r\nMr. Shower's chapel, and the earnest injunctions which he then laid on me\r\nto redeem the time, because the days were evil. At present, the picture\r\nwhich my thoughts suggested, far from fixing my attention, destroyed the\r\nportion I had yet left, by conjuring up to my recollection the peril in\r\nwhich his affairs now stood. I endeavoured, in the lowest whisper I could\r\nframe, to request Andrew to obtain information, whether any of the\r\ngentlemen of the firm of MacVittie & Co. were at present in the\r\ncongregation. But Andrew, wrapped in profound attention to the sermon,\r\nonly replied to my suggestion by hard punches with his elbow, as signals\r\nto me to remain silent. I next strained my eyes, with equally bad\r\nsuccess, to see if, among the sea of up-turned faces which bent their\r\neyes on the pulpit as a common centre, I could discover the sober and\r\nbusiness-like physiognomy of Owen. But not among the broad beavers of the\r\nGlasgow citizens, or the yet broader brimmed Lowland bonnets of the\r\npeasants of Lanarkshire, could I see anything resembling the decent\r\nperiwig, starched ruffles, or the uniform suit of light-brown garments\r\nappertaining to the head-clerk of the establishment of Osbaldistone and\r\nTresham. My anxiety now returned on me with such violence as to overpower\r\nnot only the novelty of the scene around me, by which it had hitherto\r\nbeen diverted, but moreover my sense of decorum. I pulled Andrew hard by\r\nthe sleeve, and intimated my wish to leave the church, and pursue my\r\ninvestigation as I could. Andrew, obdurate in the Laigh Kirk of Glasgow\r\nas on the mountains of Cheviot, for some time deigned me no answer; and\r\nit was only when he found I could not otherwise be kept quiet, that he\r\ncondescended to inform me, that, being once in the church, we could not\r\nleave it till service was over, because the doors were locked so soon as\r\nthe prayers began. Having thus spoken in a brief and peevish whisper,\r\nAndrew again assumed the air of intelligent and critical importance, and\r\nattention to the preacher's discourse.\r\n\r\nWhile I endeavoured to make a virtue of necessity, and recall my\r\nattention to the sermon, I was again disturbed by a singular\r\ninterruption. A voice from behind whispered distinctly in my ear, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare in danger in this city.\xe2\x80\x9d--I turned round, as if mechanically.\r\n\r\nOne or two starched and ordinary-looking mechanics stood beside and\r\nbehind me,--stragglers, who, like ourselves, had been too late in\r\nobtaining entrance. But a glance at their faces satisfied me, though I\r\ncould hardly say why, that none of these was the person who had spoken to\r\nme. Their countenances seemed all composed to attention to the sermon,\r\nand not one of them returned any glance of intelligence to the\r\ninquisitive and startled look with which I surveyed them. A massive round\r\npillar, which was close behind us, might have concealed the speaker the\r\ninstant he uttered his mysterious caution; but wherefore it was given in\r\nsuch a place, or to what species of danger it directed my attention, or\r\nby whom the warning was uttered, were points on which my imagination lost\r\nitself in conjecture. It would, however, I concluded, be repeated, and I\r\nresolved to keep my countenance turned towards the clergyman, that the\r\nwhisperer might be tempted to renew his communication under the idea that\r\nthe first had passed unobserved.\r\n\r\nMy plan succeeded. I had not resumed the appearance of attention to the\r\npreacher for five minutes, when the same voice whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cListen, but do\r\nnot look back.\xe2\x80\x9d I kept my face in the same direction. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are in danger\r\nin this place,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice proceeded; \xe2\x80\x9cso am I--meet me to-night on the\r\nBrigg, at twelve preceesely--keep at home till the gloaming, and avoid\r\nobservation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the voice ceased, and I instantly turned my head. But the speaker\r\nhad, with still greater promptitude, glided behind the pillar, and\r\nescaped my observation. I was determined to catch a sight of him, if\r\npossible, and extricating myself from the outer circle of hearers, I also\r\nstepped behind the column. All there was empty; and I could only see a\r\nfigure wrapped in a mantle, whether a Lowland cloak, or Highland plaid, I\r\ncould not distinguish, which traversed, like a phantom, the dreary\r\nvacuity of vaults which I have described.\r\n\r\nI made a mechanical attempt to pursue the mysterious form, which glided\r\naway and vanished in the vaulted cemetery, like the spectre of one of the\r\nnumerous dead who rested within its precincts. I had little chance of\r\narresting the course of one obviously determined not to be spoken with;\r\nbut that little chance was lost by my stumbling and falling before I had\r\nmade three steps from the column. The obscurity which occasioned my\r\nmisfortune, covered my disgrace; which I accounted rather lucky, for the\r\npreacher, with that stern authority which the Scottish ministers assume\r\nfor the purpose of keeping order in their congregations, interrupted his\r\ndiscourse, to desire the \xe2\x80\x9cproper officer\xe2\x80\x9d to take into custody the causer\r\nof this disturbance in the place of worship. As the noise, however, was\r\nnot repeated, the beadle, or whatever else he was called, did not think\r\nit necessary to be rigorous in searching out the offender, so that I was\r\nenabled, without attracting farther observation, to place myself by\r\nAndrew's side in my original position. The service proceeded, and closed\r\nwithout the occurrence of anything else worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nAs the congregation departed and dispersed, my friend Andrew exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, yonder is worthy Mr. MacVittie, and Mrs. MacVittie, and Miss Alison\r\nMacVittie, and Mr. Thamas MacFin, that they say is to marry Miss Alison,\r\nif a' bowls row right--she'll hae a hantle siller, if she's no that\r\nbonny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eyes took the direction he pointed out. Mr. MacVittie was a tall,\r\nthin, elderly man, with hard features, thick grey eyebrows, light eyes,\r\nand, as I imagined, a sinister expression of countenance, from which my\r\nheart recoiled. I remembered the warning I had received in the church,\r\nand hesitated to address this person, though I could not allege to myself\r\nany rational ground of dislike or suspicion.\r\n\r\nI was yet in suspense, when Andrew, who mistook my hesitation for\r\nbashfulness, proceeded to exhort me to lay it aside. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak till\r\nhim--speak till him, Mr. Francis--he's no provost yet, though they say\r\nhe'll be my lord neist year. Speak till him, then--he'll gie ye a decent\r\nanswer for as rich as he is, unless ye were wanting siller frae\r\nhim--they say he's dour to draw his purse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt immediately occurred to me, that if this merchant were really of the\r\nchurlish and avaricious disposition which Andrew intimated, there might\r\nbe some caution necessary in making myself known, as I could not tell how\r\naccounts might stand between my father and him. This consideration came\r\nin aid of the mysterious hint which I had received, and the dislike which\r\nI had conceived at the man's countenance. Instead of addressing myself\r\ndirectly to him, as I had designed to have done, I contented myself with\r\ndesiring Andrew to inquire at Mr. MacVittie's house the address of Mr.\r\nOwen, an English gentleman; and I charged him not to mention the person\r\nfrom whom he received the commission, but to bring me the result to the\r\nsmall inn where we lodged. This Andrew promised to do. He said something\r\nof the duty of my attending the evening service; but added with a\r\ncausticity natural to him, that \xe2\x80\x9cin troth, if folk couldna keep their\r\nlegs still, but wad needs be couping the creels ower through-stanes, as\r\nif they wad raise the very dead folk wi' the clatter, a kirk wi' a\r\nchimley in't was fittest for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTH.\r\n\r\n                 On the Rialto, every night at twelve,\r\n                 I take my evening's walk of meditation:\r\n                         There we two will meet.\r\n                                        Venice Preserved.\r\n\r\nFull of sinister augury, for which, however, I could assign no\r\nsatisfactory cause, I shut myself up in my apartment at the inn, and\r\nhaving dismissed Andrew, after resisting his importunity to accompany him\r\nto St. Enoch's Kirk,* where, he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca soul-searching divine was to haud\r\nforth,\xe2\x80\x9d I set myself seriously to consider what were best to be done.\r\n\r\n* This I believe to be an anachronism, as Saint Enoch's Church was not\r\nbuilt at the date of the story. [It was founded in 1780, and has since\r\nbeen rebuilt.]\r\n\r\nI never was what is properly called superstitious; but I suppose that all\r\nmen, in situations of peculiar doubt and difficulty, when they have\r\nexercised their reason to little purpose, are apt, in a sort of despair,\r\nto abandon the reins to their imagination, and be guided altogether by\r\nchance, or by those whimsical impressions which take possession of the\r\nmind, and to which we give way as if to involuntary impulses. There was\r\nsomething so singularly repulsive in the hard features of the Scotch\r\ntrader, that I could not resolve to put myself into his hands without\r\ntransgressing every caution which could be derived from the rules of\r\nphysiognomy; while, at the same time, the warning voice, the form which\r\nflitted away like a vanishing shadow through those vaults, which might be\r\ntermed \xe2\x80\x9cthe valley of the shadow of death,\xe2\x80\x9d had something captivating for\r\nthe imagination of a young man, who, you will farther please to remember,\r\nwas also a young poet.\r\n\r\nIf danger was around me, as the mysterious communication intimated, how\r\ncould I learn its nature, or the means of averting it, but by meeting my\r\nunknown counsellor, to whom I could see no reason for imputing any other\r\nthan kind intentions. Rashleigh and his machinations occurred more than\r\nonce to my remembrance;--but so rapid had my journey been, that I could\r\nnot suppose him apprised of my arrival in Glasgow, much less prepared to\r\nplay off any stratagem against my person. In my temper also I was bold\r\nand confident, strong and active in person, and in some measure\r\naccustomed to the use of arms, in which the French youth of all kinds\r\nwere then initiated. I did not fear any single opponent; assassination\r\nwas neither the vice of the age nor of the country; the place selected\r\nfor our meeting was too public to admit any suspicion of meditated\r\nviolence. In a word, I resolved to meet my mysterious counsellor on the\r\nbridge, as he had requested, and to be afterwards guided by\r\ncircumstances. Let me not conceal from you, Tresham, what at the time I\r\nendeavoured to conceal from myself--the subdued, yet secretly-cherished\r\nhope, that Diana Vernon might--by what chance I knew not--through what\r\nmeans I could not guess--have some connection with this strange and\r\ndubious intimation conveyed at a time and place, and in a manner so\r\nsurprising. She alone--whispered this insidious thought--she alone knew\r\nof my journey; from her own account, she possessed friends and influence\r\nin Scotland; she had furnished me with a talisman, whose power I was to\r\ninvoke when all other aid failed me; who then but Diana Vernon possessed\r\neither means, knowledge, or inclination, for averting the dangers, by\r\nwhich, as it seemed, my steps were surrounded? This flattering view of my\r\nvery doubtful case pressed itself upon me again and again. It insinuated\r\nitself into my thoughts, though very bashfully, before the hour of\r\ndinner; it displayed its attractions more boldly during the course of my\r\nfrugal meal, and became so courageously intrusive during the succeeding\r\nhalf-hour (aided perhaps by the flavour of a few glasses of most\r\nexcellent claret), that, with a sort of desperate attempt to escape from\r\na delusive seduction, to which I felt the danger of yielding, I pushed my\r\nglass from me, threw aside my dinner, seized my hat, and rushed into the\r\nopen air with the feeling of one who would fly from his own thoughts. Yet\r\nperhaps I yielded to the very feelings from which I seemed to fly, since\r\nmy steps insensibly led me to the bridge over the Clyde, the place\r\nassigned for the rendezvous by my mysterious monitor.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had not partaken of my repast until the hours of evening\r\nchurch-service were over,--in which, by the way, I complied with the\r\nreligious scruples of my landlady, who hesitated to dress a hot dinner\r\nbetween sermons, and also with the admonition of my unknown friend, to\r\nkeep my apartment till twilight,--several hours had still to pass away\r\nbetwixt the time of my appointment and that at which I reached the\r\nassigned place of meeting. The interval, as you will readily credit, was\r\nwearisome enough; and I can hardly explain to you how it passed away.\r\nVarious groups of persons, all of whom, young and old, seemed impressed\r\nwith a reverential feeling of the sanctity of the day, passed along the\r\nlarge open meadow which lies on the northern bank of the Clyde, and\r\nserves at once as a bleaching-field and pleasure-walk for the\r\ninhabitants, or paced with slow steps the long bridge which communicates\r\nwith the southern district of the county. All that I remember of them was\r\nthe general, yet not unpleasing, intimation of a devotional character\r\nimpressed on each little party--formally assumed perhaps by some, but\r\nsincerely characterising the greater number--which hushed the petulant\r\ngaiety of the young into a tone of more quiet, yet more interesting,\r\ninterchange of sentiments, and suppressed the vehement argument and\r\nprotracted disputes of those of more advanced age. Notwithstanding the\r\nnumbers who passed me, no general sound of the human voice was heard; few\r\nturned again to take some minutes' voluntary exercise, to which the\r\nleisure of the evening, and the beauty of the surrounding scenery, seemed\r\nto invite them: all hurried to their homes and resting-places. To one\r\naccustomed to the mode of spending Sunday evenings abroad, even among the\r\nFrench Calvinists, there seemed something Judaical, yet, at the same time\r\nstriking and affecting, in this mode of keeping the Sabbath holy.\r\nInsensibly I felt my mode of sauntering by the side of the river, and\r\ncrossing successively the various persons who were passing homeward, and\r\nwithout tarrying or delay, must expose me to observation at least, if not\r\nto censure; and I slunk out of the frequented path, and found a trivial\r\noccupation for my mind in marshalling my revolving walk in such a manner\r\nas should least render me obnoxious to observation. The different alleys\r\nlined out through this extensive meadow, and which are planted with\r\ntrees, like the Park of St. James's in London, gave me facilities for\r\ncarrying into effect these childish manoeuvres.\r\n\r\nAs I walked down one of these avenues, I heard, to my surprise, the sharp\r\nand conceited voice of Andrew Fairservice, raised by a sense of\r\nself-consequence to a pitch somewhat higher than others seemed to think\r\nconsistent with the solemnity of the day. To slip behind the row of trees\r\nunder which I walked was perhaps no very dignified proceeding; but it was\r\nthe easiest mode of escaping his observation, and perhaps his impertinent\r\nassiduity, and still more intrusive curiosity. As he passed, I heard him\r\ncommunicate to a grave-looking man, in a black coat, a slouched hat, and\r\nGeneva cloak, the following sketch of a character, which my self-love,\r\nwhile revolting against it as a caricature, could not, nevertheless,\r\nrefuse to recognise as a likeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Mr. Hammorgaw, it's e'en as I tell ye. He's no a'thegither sae\r\nvoid o' sense neither; he has a gloaming sight o' what's reasonable--that\r\nis anes and awa'--a glisk and nae mair; but he's crack-brained and\r\ncockle-headed about his nipperty-tipperty poetry nonsense--He'll glowr at\r\nan auld-warld barkit aik-snag as if it were a queezmaddam in full\r\nbearing; and a naked craig, wi' a bum jawing ower't, is unto him as a\r\ngarden garnisht with flowering knots and choice pot-herbs. Then he wad\r\nrather claver wi' a daft quean they ca' Diana Vernon (weel I wet they\r\nmight ca' her Diana of the Ephesians, for she's little better than a\r\nheathen--better? she's waur--a Roman, a mere Roman)--he'll claver wi'\r\nher, or any ither idle slut, rather than hear what might do him gude a'\r\nthe days of his life, frae you or me, Mr. Hammorgaw, or ony ither sober\r\nand sponsible person. Reason, sir, is what he canna endure--he's a' for\r\nyour vanities and volubilities; and he ance tell'd me (puir blinded\r\ncreature!) that the Psalms of David were excellent poetry! as if the holy\r\nPsalmist thought o' rattling rhymes in a blether, like his ain silly\r\nclinkum-clankum things that he ca's verse. Gude help him!--twa lines o'\r\nDavie Lindsay would ding a' he ever clerkit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile listening to this perverted account of my temper and studies, you\r\nwill not be surprised if I meditated for Mr. Fairservice the unpleasant\r\nsurprise of a broken pate on the first decent opportunity. His friend\r\nonly intimated his attention by \xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIs't e'en sae?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsuchlike expressions of interest, at the proper breaks in Mr.\r\nFairservice's harangue, until at length, in answer to some observation of\r\ngreater length, the import of which I only collected from my trusty\r\nguide's reply, honest Andrew answered, \xe2\x80\x9cTell him a bit o'my mind, quoth\r\nye? Wha wad be fule then but Andrew? He's a red-wad deevil, man--He's\r\nlike Giles Heathertap's auld boar;--ye need but shake a clout at him to\r\nmake him turn and gore. Bide wi' him, say ye?--Troth, I kenna what for I\r\nbide wi' him mysell. But the lad's no a bad lad after a'; and he needs\r\nsome carefu' body to look after him. He hasna the right grip o' his\r\nhand--the gowd slips through't like water, man; and it's no that ill a\r\nthing to be near him when his purse is in his hand, and it's seldom out\r\no't. And then he's come o' guid kith and kin--My heart warms to the poor\r\nthoughtless callant, Mr. Hammorgaw--and then the penny fee\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of this instructive communication, Mr. Fairservice\r\nlowered his voice to a tone better beseeming the conversation in a place\r\nof public resort on a Sabbath evening, and his companion and he were soon\r\nbeyond my hearing. My feelings of hasty resentment soon subsided, under\r\nthe conviction that, as Andrew himself might have said, \xe2\x80\x9cA harkener\r\nalways hears a bad tale of himself,\xe2\x80\x9d and that whoever should happen to\r\noverhear their character discussed in their own servants'-hall, must\r\nprepare to undergo the scalpel of some such anatomist as Mr. Fairservice.\r\nThe incident was so far useful, as, including the feelings to which it\r\ngave rise, it sped away a part of the time which hung so heavily on my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nEvening had now closed, and the growing darkness gave to the broad,\r\nstill, and deep expanse of the brimful river, first a hue sombre and\r\nuniform--then a dismal and turbid appearance, partially lighted by a\r\nwaning and pallid moon. The massive and ancient bridge which stretches\r\nacross the Clyde was now but dimly visible, and resembled that which\r\nMirza, in his unequalled vision, has described as traversing the valley\r\nof Bagdad. The low-browed arches, seen as imperfectly as the dusky\r\ncurrent which they bestrode, seemed rather caverns which swallowed up the\r\ngloomy waters of the river, than apertures contrived for their passage.\r\nWith the advancing night the stillness of the scene increased. There was\r\nyet a twinkling light occasionally seen to glide along by the stream,\r\nwhich conducted home one or two of the small parties, who, after the\r\nabstinence and religious duties of the day, had partaken of a social\r\nsupper--the only meal at which the rigid Presbyterians made some advance\r\nto sociality on the Sabbath. Occasionally, also, the hoofs of a horse\r\nwere heard, whose rider, after spending the Sunday in Glasgow, was\r\ndirecting his steps towards his residence in the country. These sounds\r\nand sights became gradually of more rare occurrence; at length they\r\naltogether ceased, and I was left to enjoy my solitary walk on the shores\r\nof the Clyde in solemn silence, broken only by the tolling of the\r\nsuccessive hours from the steeples of the churches.\r\n\r\nBut as the night advanced my impatience at the uncertainty of the\r\nsituation in which I was placed increased every moment, and became nearly\r\nungovernable. I began to question whether I had been imposed upon by the\r\ntrick of a fool, the raving of a madman, or the studied machinations of a\r\nvillain, and paced the little quay or pier adjoining the entrance to the\r\nbridge, in a state of incredible anxiety and vexation. At length the hour\r\nof twelve o'clock swung its summons over the city from the belfry of the\r\nmetropolitan church of St. Mungo, and was answered and vouched by all the\r\nothers like dutiful diocesans. The echoes had scarcely ceased to repeat\r\nthe last sound, when a human form--the first I had seen for two\r\nhours--appeared passing along the bridge from the southern shore of the\r\nriver. I advanced to meet him with a feeling as if my fate depended on\r\nthe result of the interview, so much had my anxiety been wound up by\r\nprotracted expectation. All that I could remark of the passenger as we\r\nadvanced towards each other, was that his frame was rather beneath than\r\nabove the middle size, but apparently strong, thick-set, and muscular;\r\nhis dress a horseman's wrapping coat. I slackened my pace, and almost\r\npaused as I advanced in expectation that he would address me. But to my\r\ninexpressible disappointment he passed without speaking, and I had no\r\npretence for being the first to address one who, notwithstanding his\r\nappearance at the very hour of appointment, might nevertheless be an\r\nabsolute stranger. I stopped when he had passed me, and looked after\r\nhim, uncertain whether I ought not to follow him. The stranger walked on\r\ntill near the northern end of the bridge, then paused, looked back, and\r\nturning round, again advanced towards me. I resolved that this time he\r\nshould not have the apology for silence proper to apparitions, who, it\r\nis vulgarly supposed, cannot speak until they are spoken to. \xe2\x80\x9cYou walk\r\nlate, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as we met a second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bide tryste,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; \xe2\x80\x9cand so I think do you, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are then the person who requested to meet me here at this unusual\r\nhour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me, and you shall know my reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore following you, I must know your name and purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a man,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; \xe2\x80\x9cand my purpose is friendly to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated;--\xe2\x80\x9cthat is a very brief description.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will serve for one who has no other to give,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nthat is without name, without friends, without coin, without country, is\r\nstill at least a man; and he that has all these is no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet this is still too general an account of yourself, to say the least\r\nof it, to establish your credit with a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all I mean to give, howsoe'er; you may choose to follow me, or to\r\nremain without the information I desire to afford you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you not give me that information here?\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must receive it from your eyes, not from my tongue--you must follow\r\nme, or remain in ignorance of the information which I have to give you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something short, determined, and even stern, in the man's\r\nmanner, not certainly well calculated to conciliate undoubting\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you fear?\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cTo whom, think ye, is your\r\nlife of such consequence, that they should seek to bereave ye of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied firmly, though somewhat hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cWalk on--I\r\nattend you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe proceeded, contrary to my expectation, to re-enter the town, and\r\nglided like mute spectres, side by side, up its empty and silent streets.\r\nThe high and gloomy stone fronts, with the variegated ornaments and\r\npediments of the windows, looked yet taller and more sable by the\r\nimperfect moonshine. Our walk was for some minutes in perfect silence. At\r\nlength my conductor spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI retort your own words,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cwherefore should I fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are with a stranger--perhaps an enemy, in a place where you\r\nhave no friends and many enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI neither fear you nor them; I am young, active, and armed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not armed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my conductor: \xe2\x80\x9cbut no matter, a willing hand\r\nnever lacked weapon. You say you fear nothing; but if you knew who was by\r\nyour side, perhaps you might underlie a tremor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d replied I. \xe2\x80\x9cI again repeat, I fear nought that you\r\ncan do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNought that I can do?--Be it so. But do you not fear the consequences of\r\nbeing found with one whose very name whispered in this lonely street\r\nwould make the stones themselves rise up to apprehend him--on whose head\r\nhalf the men in Glasgow would build their fortune as on a found treasure,\r\nhad they the luck to grip him by the collar--the sound of whose\r\napprehension were as welcome at the Cross of Edinburgh as ever the news\r\nof a field stricken and won in Flanders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who then are you, whose name should create so deep a feeling of\r\nterror?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo enemy of yours, since I am conveying you to a place, where, were I\r\nmyself recognised and identified, iron to the heels and hemp to the craig\r\nwould be my brief dooming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI paused and stood still on the pavement, drawing back so as to have the\r\nmost perfect view of my companion which the light afforded me, and which\r\nwas sufficient to guard against any sudden motion of assault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have said,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9ceither too much or too little--too much to\r\ninduce me to confide in you as a mere stranger, since you avow yourself a\r\nperson amenable to the laws of the country in which we are--and too\r\nlittle, unless you could show that you are unjustly subjected to their\r\nrigour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I ceased to speak, he made a step towards me. I drew back\r\ninstinctively, and laid my hand on the hilt of my sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said he--\xe2\x80\x9con an unarmed man, and your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am yet ignorant if you are either the one or the other,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand to say the truth, your language and manner might well entitle me to\r\ndoubt both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is manfully spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my conductor; \xe2\x80\x9cand I respect him whose\r\nhand can keep his head.--I will be frank and free with you--I am\r\nconveying you to prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo prison!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed--\xe2\x80\x9cby what warrant or for what offence?--You\r\nshall have my life sooner than my liberty--I defy you, and I will not\r\nfollow you a step farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ccarry you there as a prisoner; I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\ndrawing himself haughtily up, \xe2\x80\x9cneither a messenger nor sheriff's officer.\r\nI carry you to see a prisoner from whose lips you will learn the risk in\r\nwhich you presently stand. Your liberty is little risked by the visit;\r\nmine is in some peril; but that I readily encounter on your account, for\r\nI care not for risk, and I love a free young blood, that kens no\r\nprotector but the cross o' the sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke thus, we had reached the principal street, and were\r\npausing before a large building of hewn stone, garnished, as I thought I\r\ncould perceive, with gratings of iron before the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuckle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, whose language became more broadly national\r\nas he assumed a tone of colloquial freedom--\xe2\x80\x9cMuckle wad the provost and\r\nbailies o' Glasgow gie to hae him sitting with iron garters to his hose\r\nwithin their tolbooth that now stands wi' his legs as free as the\r\nred-deer's on the outside on't. And little wad it avail them; for an if\r\nthey had me there wi' a stane's weight o' iron at every ankle, I would\r\nshow them a toom room and a lost lodger before to-morrow--But come on,\r\nwhat stint ye for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke thus, he tapped at a low wicket, and was answered by a sharp\r\nvoice, as of one awakened from a dream or reverie,--\xe2\x80\x9cFa's tat?--Wha's\r\nthat, I wad say?--and fat a deil want ye at this hour at e'en?--Clean\r\nagain rules--clean again rules, as they ca' them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe protracted tone in which the last words were uttered, betokened that\r\nthe speaker was again composing himself to slumber. But my guide spoke in\r\na loud whisper--\xe2\x80\x9cDougal, man! hae ye forgotten Ha nun Gregarach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil a bit, deil a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d was the ready and lively response, and I heard\r\nthe internal guardian of the prison-gate bustle up with great alacrity. A\r\nfew words were exchanged between my conductor and the turnkey in a\r\nlanguage to which I was an absolute stranger. The bolts revolved, but\r\nwith a caution which marked the apprehension that the noise might be\r\noverheard, and we stood within the vestibule of the prison of Glasgow,--a\r\nsmall, but strong guard-room, from which a narrow staircase led upwards,\r\nand one or two low entrances conducted to apartments on the same level\r\nwith the outward gate, all secured with the jealous strength of wickets,\r\nbolts, and bars. The walls, otherwise naked, were not unsuitably\r\ngarnished with iron fetters, and other uncouth implements, which might be\r\ndesigned for purposes still more inhuman, interspersed with partisans,\r\nguns, pistols of antique manufacture, and other weapons of defence and\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nAt finding myself so unexpectedly, fortuitously, and, as it were, by\r\nstealth, introduced within one of the legal fortresses of Scotland, I\r\ncould not help recollecting my adventure in Northumberland, and fretting\r\nat the strange incidents which again, without any demerits of my own,\r\nthreatened to place me in a dangerous and disagreeable collision with the\r\nlaws of a country which I visited only in the capacity of a stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Look round thee, young Astolpho: Here's the place\r\n            Which men (for being poor) are sent to starve in;\r\n                Rude remedy, I trow, for sore disease.\r\n            Within these walls, stifled by damp and stench,\r\n            Doth Hope's fair torch expire; and at the snuff,\r\n            Ere yet 'tis quite extinct, rude, wild, and way-ward,\r\n                The desperate revelries of wild despair,\r\n            Kindling their hell-born cressets, light to deeds\r\n            That the poor captive would have died ere practised,\r\n                Till bondage sunk his soul to his condition.\r\n                                  The Prison, _Scene III. Act I._\r\n\r\nAt my first entrance I turned an eager glance towards my conductor; but\r\nthe lamp in the vestibule was too low in flame to give my curiosity any\r\nsatisfaction by affording a distinct perusal of his features. As the\r\nturnkey held the light in his hand, the beams fell more full on his own\r\nscarce less interesting figure. He was a wild shock-headed looking\r\nanimal, whose profusion of red hair covered and obscured his features,\r\nwhich were otherwise only characterised by the extravagant joy that\r\naffected him at the sight of my guide. In my experience I have met\r\nnothing so absolutely resembling my idea of a very uncouth, wild, and\r\nugly savage, adoring the idol of his tribe. He grinned, he shivered, he\r\nlaughed, he was near crying, if he did not actually cry. He had a \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nshall I go?--What can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d expression of face; the complete,\r\nsurrendered, and anxious subservience and devotion of which it is\r\ndifficult to describe, otherwise than by the awkward combination which I\r\nhave attempted. The fellow's voice seemed choking in his ecstasy, and\r\nonly could express itself in such interjections as \xe2\x80\x9cOigh! oigh!--Ay!\r\nay!--it's lang since she's seen ye!\xe2\x80\x9d and other exclamations equally brief,\r\nexpressed in the same unknown tongue in which he had communicated with my\r\nconductor while we were on the outside of the jail door. My guide\r\nreceived all this excess of joyful gratulation much like a prince too\r\nearly accustomed to the homage of those around him to be much moved by\r\nit, yet willing to requite it by the usual forms of royal courtesy. He\r\nextended his hand graciously towards the turnkey, with a civil inquiry of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow's a' wi' you, Dougal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOigh! oigh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Dougal, softening the sharp exclamations of his\r\nsurprise as he looked around with an eye of watchful alarm--\xe2\x80\x9cOigh! to see\r\nyou here--to see you here!--Oigh!--what will come o' ye gin the bailies\r\nsuld come to get witting--ta filthy, gutty hallions, tat they are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy guide placed his finger on his lip, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing, Dougal;\r\nyour hands shall never draw a bolt on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTat sall they no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dougal; \xe2\x80\x9cshe suld--she wad--that is, she wishes\r\nthem hacked aff by the elbows first--But when are ye gaun yonder again?\r\nand ye'll no forget to let her ken--she's your puir cousin, God kens,\r\nonly seven times removed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will let you ken, Dougal, as soon as my plans are settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by her sooth, when you do, an it were twal o' the Sunday at e'en,\r\nshe'll fling her keys at the provost's head or she gie them anither turn,\r\nand that or ever Monday morning begins--see if she winna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mysterious stranger cut his acquaintance's ecstasies short by again\r\naddressing him, in what I afterwards understood to be the Irish, Earse,\r\nor Gaelic, explaining, probably, the services which he required at his\r\nhand. The answer, \xe2\x80\x9cWi' a' her heart--wi' a' her soul,\xe2\x80\x9d with a good deal\r\nof indistinct muttering in a similar tone, intimated the turnkey's\r\nacquiescence in what he proposed. The fellow trimmed his dying lamp, and\r\nmade a sign to me to follow him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not go with us?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, looking to my conductor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cmy company may be inconvenient for you,\r\nand I had better remain to secure our retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not suppose you mean to betray me to danger,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo none but what I partake in doubly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the stranger, with a\r\nvoice of assurance which it was impossible to mistrust.\r\n\r\nI followed the turnkey, who, leaving the inner wicket unlocked behind\r\nhim, led me up a _turnpike_ (so the Scotch call a winding stair), then\r\nalong a narrow gallery--then opening one of several doors which led into\r\nthe passage, he ushered me into a small apartment, and casting his eye on\r\nthe pallet-bed which occupied one corner, said with an under voice, as he\r\nplaced the lamp on a little deal table, \xe2\x80\x9cShe's sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe!--who?--can it be Diana Vernon in this abode of misery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned my eye to the bed, and it was with a mixture of disappointment\r\noddly mingled with pleasure, that I saw my first suspicion had deceived\r\nme. I saw a head neither young nor beautiful, garnished with a grey beard\r\nof two days' growth, and accommodated with a red nightcap. The first\r\nglance put me at ease on the score of Diana Vernon; the second, as the\r\nslumberer awoke from a heavy sleep, yawned, and rubbed his eyes,\r\npresented me with features very different indeed--even those of my poor\r\nfriend Owen. I drew back out of view an instant, that he might have time\r\nto recover himself; fortunately recollecting that I was but an intruder\r\non these cells of sorrow, and that any alarm might be attended with\r\nunhappy consequences.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the unfortunate formalist, raising himself from the pallet-bed\r\nwith the assistance of one hand, and scratching his cap with the other,\r\nexclaimed in a voice in which as much peevishness as he was capable of\r\nfeeling, contended with drowsiness, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell you what, Mr. Dug-well, or\r\nwhatever your name may be, the sum-total of the matter is, that if my\r\nnatural rest is to be broken in this manner, I must complain to the lord\r\nmayor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShentlemans to speak wi' her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dougal, resuming the true dogged\r\nsullen tone of a turnkey, in exchange for the shrill clang of Highland\r\ncongratulation with which he had welcomed my mysterious guide; and,\r\nturning on his heel, he left the apartment.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I could prevail upon the unfortunate sleeper\r\nawakening to recognise me; and when he did so, the distress of the worthy\r\ncreature was extreme, at supposing, which he naturally did, that I had\r\nbeen sent thither as a partner of his captivity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr. Frank, what have you brought yourself and the house to?--I think\r\nnothing of myself, that am a mere cipher, so to speak; but you, that was\r\nyour father's sum-total--his omnium,--you that might have been the first\r\nman in the first house in the first city, to be shut up in a nasty Scotch\r\njail, where one cannot even get the dirt brushed off their clothes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rubbed, with an air of peevish irritation, the once stainless brown\r\ncoat, which had now shared some of the impurities of the floor of his\r\nprison-house,--his habits of extreme punctilious neatness acting\r\nmechanically to increase his distress.--\xe2\x80\x9cO Heaven be gracious to us!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat news this will be on 'Change! There has not the like\r\ncome there since the battle of Almanza, where the total of the British\r\nloss was summed up to five thousand men killed and wounded, besides a\r\nfloating balance of missing--but what will that be to the news that\r\nOsbaldistone and Tresham have stopped!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI broke in on his lamentations to acquaint him that I was no prisoner,\r\nthough scarce able to account for my being in that place at such an hour.\r\nI could only silence his inquiries by persisting in those which his own\r\nsituation suggested; and at length obtained from him such information as\r\nhe was able to give me. It was none of the most distinct; for, however\r\nclear-headed in his own routine of commercial business, Owen, you are\r\nwell aware, was not very acute in comprehending what lay beyond that\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nThe sum of his information was, that of two correspondents of my father's\r\nfirm at Glasgow, where, owing to engagements in Scotland formerly alluded\r\nto, he transacted a great deal of business, both my father and Owen had\r\nfound the house of MacVittie, MacFin, and Company, the most obliging and\r\naccommodating. They had deferred to the great English house on every\r\npossible occasion; and in their bargains and transactions acted, without\r\nrepining, the part of the jackall, who only claims what the lion is\r\npleased to leave him. However small the share of profit allotted to them,\r\nit was always, as they expressed it, \xe2\x80\x9cenough for the like of them;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n however large the portion of trouble, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were sensible they could not\r\ndo too much to deserve the continued patronage and good opinion of their\r\nhonoured friends in Crane Alley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dictates of my father were to MacVittie and MacFin the laws of the\r\nMedes and Persians, not to be altered, innovated, or even discussed; and\r\nthe punctilios exacted by Owen in their business transactions, for he was\r\na great lover of form, more especially when he could dictate it _ex\r\ncathedra,_ seemed scarce less sanctimonious in their eyes. This tone of\r\ndeep and respectful observance went all currently down with Owen; but my\r\nfather looked a little closer into men's bosoms, and whether suspicious\r\nof this excess of deference, or, as a lover of brevity and simplicity in\r\nbusiness, tired with these gentlemen's long-winded professions of regard,\r\nhe had uniformly resisted their desire to become his sole agents in\r\nScotland. On the contrary, he transacted many affairs through a\r\ncorrespondent of a character perfectly different--a man whose good\r\nopinion of himself amounted to self-conceit, and who, disliking the\r\nEnglish in general as much as my father did the Scotch, would hold no\r\ncommunication but on a footing of absolute equality; jealous, moreover;\r\ncaptious occasionally; as tenacious of his own opinions in point of form\r\nas Owen could be of his; and totally indifferent though the authority of\r\nall Lombard Street had stood against his own private opinion.\r\n\r\nAs these peculiarities of temper rendered it difficult to transact\r\nbusiness with Mr. Nicol Jarvie,--as they occasioned at times disputes and\r\ncoldness between the English house and their correspondent, which were\r\nonly got over by a sense of mutual interest,--as, moreover, Owen's\r\npersonal vanity sometimes suffered a little in the discussions to which\r\nthey gave rise, you cannot be surprised, Tresham, that our old friend\r\nthrew at all times the weight of his influence in favour of the civil,\r\ndiscreet, accommodating concern of MacVittie and MacFin, and spoke of\r\nJarvie as a petulant, conceited Scotch pedlar, with whom there was no\r\ndealing.\r\n\r\nIt was also not surprising, that in these circumstances, which I only\r\nlearned in detail some time afterwards, Owen, in the difficulties to\r\nwhich the house was reduced by the absence of my father, and the\r\ndisappearance of Rashleigh, should, on his arrival in Scotland, which\r\ntook place two days before mine, have recourse to the friendship of those\r\ncorrespondents, who had always professed themselves obliged, gratified,\r\nand devoted to the service of his principal. He was received at Messrs.\r\nMacVittie and MacFin's counting-house in the Gallowgate, with something\r\nlike the devotion a Catholic would pay to his tutelar saint. But, alas!\r\nthis sunshine was soon overclouded, when, encouraged by the fair hopes\r\nwhich it inspired, he opened the difficulties of the house to his\r\nfriendly correspondents, and requested their counsel and assistance.\r\nMacVittie was almost stunned by the communication; and MacFin, ere it was\r\ncompleted, was already at the ledger of their firm, and deeply engaged in\r\nthe very bowels of the multitudinous accounts between their house and\r\nthat of Osbaldistone and Tresham, for the purpose of discovering on which\r\nside the balance lay. Alas! the scale depressed considerably against the\r\nEnglish firm; and the faces of MacVittie and MacFin, hitherto only blank\r\nand doubtful, became now ominous, grim, and lowering. They met Mr. Owen's\r\nrequest of countenance and assistance with a counter-demand of instant\r\nsecurity against imminent hazard of eventual loss; and at length,\r\nspeaking more plainly, required that a deposit of assets, destined for\r\nother purposes, should be placed in their hands for that purpose. Owen\r\nrepelled this demand with great indignation, as dishonourable to his\r\nconstituents, unjust to the other creditors of Osbaldistone and Tresham,\r\nand very ungrateful on the part of those by whom it was made.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch partners gained, in the course of this controversy, what is\r\nvery convenient to persons who are in the wrong, an opportunity and\r\npretext for putting themselves in a violent passion, and for taking,\r\nunder the pretext of the provocation they had received, measures to which\r\nsome sense of decency, if not of conscience, might otherwise have\r\ndeterred them from resorting.\r\n\r\nOwen had a small share, as I believe is usual, in the house to which he\r\nacted as head-clerk, and was therefore personally liable for all its\r\nobligations. This was known to Messrs. MacVittie and MacFin; and, with a\r\nview of making him feel their power, or rather in order to force him, at\r\nthis emergency, into those measures in their favour, to which he had\r\nexpressed himself so repugnant, they had recourse to a summary process of\r\narrest and imprisonment,--which it seems the law of Scotland (therein\r\nsurely liable to much abuse) allows to a creditor, who finds his\r\nconscience at liberty to make oath that the debtor meditates departing\r\nfrom the realm. Under such a warrant had poor Owen been confined to\r\ndurance on the day preceding that when I was so strangely guided to his\r\nprison-house.\r\n\r\nThus possessed of the alarming outline of facts, the question remained,\r\nwhat was to be done and it was not of easy determination. I plainly\r\nperceived the perils with which we were surrounded, but it was more\r\ndifficult to suggest any remedy. The warning which I had already received\r\nseemed to intimate, that my own personal liberty might be endangered by\r\nan open appearance in Owen's behalf. Owen entertained the same\r\napprehension, and, in the exaggeration of his terror, assured me that a\r\nScotchman, rather than run the risk of losing a farthing by an\r\nEnglishman, would find law for arresting his wife, children, man-servant,\r\nmaidservant, and stranger within his household. The laws concerning debt,\r\nin most countries, are so unmercifully severe, that I could not\r\naltogether disbelieve his statement; and my arrest, in the present\r\ncircumstances, would have been a _coup-de-grace_ to my father's affairs.\r\nIn this dilemma, I asked Owen if he had not thought of having recourse to\r\nmy father's other correspondent in Glasgow, Mr. Nicol Jarvie?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had sent him a letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat morning; but if the\r\nsmooth-tongued and civil house in the Gallowgate* had used him thus, what\r\nwas to be expected from the cross-grained crab-stock in the Salt-Market?\r\n\r\n* [A street in the old town of Glasgow.]\r\n\r\nYou might as well ask a broker to give up his percentage, as expect a\r\nfavour from him without the _per contra._ He had not even,\xe2\x80\x9d Owen said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9canswered his letter though it was put into his hand that morning as he\r\nwent to church.\xe2\x80\x9d And here the despairing man-of-figures threw himself\r\ndown on his pallet, exclaiming,--\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear master! My poor dear\r\nmaster! O Mr. Frank, Mr. Frank, this is all your obstinacy!--But God\r\nforgive me for saying so to you in your distress! It's God's disposing,\r\nand man must submit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy philosophy, Tresham, could not prevent my sharing in the honest\r\ncreature's distress, and we mingled our tears,--the more bitter on my\r\npart, as the perverse opposition to my father's will, with which the\r\nkind-hearted Owen forbore to upbraid me, rose up to my conscience as the\r\ncause of all this affliction.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of our mingled sorrow, we were disturbed and surprised by a\r\nloud knocking at the outward door of the prison. I ran to the top of the\r\nstaircase to listen, but could only hear the voice of the turnkey,\r\nalternately in a high tone, answering to some person without, and in a\r\nwhisper, addressed to the person who had guided me hither--\xe2\x80\x9cShe's\r\ncoming--she's coming,\xe2\x80\x9d aloud; then in a low key, \xe2\x80\x9cO hon-a-ri! O hon-a-ri!\r\nwhat'll she do now?--Gang up ta stair, and hide yourself ahint ta\r\nSassenach shentleman's ped.--She's coming as fast as she can.--Ahellanay!\r\nit's my lord provosts, and ta pailies, and ta guard--and ta captain's\r\ncoming toon stairs too--Got press her! gang up or he meets her.--She's\r\ncoming--she's coming--ta lock's sair roosted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Dougal, unwillingly, and with as much delay as possible, undid the\r\nvarious fastenings to give admittance to those without, whose impatience\r\nbecame clamorous, my guide ascended the winding stair, and sprang into\r\nOwen's apartment, into which I followed him. He cast his eyes hastily\r\nround, as if looking for a place of concealment; then said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cLend\r\nme your pistols--yet it's no matter, I can do without them--Whatever you\r\nsee, take no heed, and do not mix your hand in another man's feud--This\r\ngear's mine, and I must manage it as I dow; but I have been as hard\r\nbested, and worse, than I am even now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the stranger spoke these words, he stripped from his person the\r\ncumbrous upper coat in which he was wrapt, confronted the door of the\r\napartment, on which he fixed a keen and determined glance, drawing his\r\nperson a little back to concentrate his force, like a fine horse brought\r\nup to the leaping-bar. I had not a moment's doubt that he meant to\r\nextricate himself from his embarrassment, whatever might be the cause of\r\nit, by springing full upon those who should appear when the doors opened,\r\nand forcing his way through all opposition into the street;--and such was\r\nthe appearance of strength and agility displayed in his frame, and of\r\ndetermination in his look and manner, that I did not doubt a moment but\r\nthat he might get clear through his opponents, unless they employed fatal\r\nmeans to stop his purpose. It was a period of awful suspense betwixt the\r\nopening of the outward gate and that of the door of the apartment, when\r\nthere appeared--no guard with bayonets fixed, or watch with clubs, bills,\r\nor partisans, but a good-looking young woman, with grogram petticoats,\r\ntucked up for trudging through the streets, and holding a lantern in her\r\nhand. This female ushered in a more important personage, in form, stout,\r\nshort, and somewhat corpulent; and by dignity, as it soon appeared, a\r\nmagistrate, bob-wigged, bustling, and breathless with peevish impatience.\r\nMy conductor, at his appearance, drew back as if to escape observation;\r\nbut he could not elude the penetrating twinkle with which this dignitary\r\nreconnoitered the whole apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bonny thing it is, and a beseeming, that I should be kept at the door\r\nhalf an hour, Captain Stanchells,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing the principal\r\njailor, who now showed himself at the door as if in attendance on the\r\ngreat man, \xe2\x80\x9cknocking as hard to get into the tolbooth as onybody else wad\r\nto get out of it, could that avail them, poor fallen creatures!--And\r\nhow's this?--how's this?--strangers in the jail after lock-up hours, and\r\non the Sabbath evening!--I shall look after this, Stanchells, you may\r\ndepend on't--Keep the door locked, and I'll speak to these gentlemen in a\r\ngliffing--But first I maun hae a crack wi' an auld acquaintance here.--\r\nMr. Owen, Mr. Owen, how's a' wi' ye, man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well in body, I thank you, Mr. Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled out poor Owen,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut sore afflicted in spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae doubt, nae doubt--ay, ay--it's an awfu' whummle--and for ane that\r\nheld his head sae high too--human nature, human nature--Ay ay, we're a'\r\nsubject to a downcome. Mr. Osbaldistone is a gude honest gentleman; but I\r\naye said he was ane o' them wad make a spune or spoil a horn, as my\r\nfather the worthy deacon used to say. The deacon used to say to me,\r\n'Nick--young Nick' (his name was Nicol as weel as mine; sae folk ca'd us\r\nin their daffin', young Nick and auld Nick)--'Nick,' said he, 'never put\r\nout your arm farther than ye can draw it easily back again.' I hae said\r\nsae to Mr. Osbaldistone, and he didna seem to take it a'thegither sae\r\nkind as I wished--but it was weel meant--weel meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis discourse, delivered with prodigious volubility, and a great\r\nappearance of self-complacency, as he recollected his own advice and\r\npredictions, gave little promise of assistance at the hands of Mr.\r\nJarvie. Yet it soon appeared rather to proceed from a total want of\r\ndelicacy than any deficiency of real kindness; for when Owen expressed\r\nhimself somewhat hurt that these things should be recalled to memory in\r\nhis present situation, the Glaswegian took him by the hand, and bade him\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up a gliff! D'ye think I wad hae comed out at twal o'clock at\r\nnight, and amaist broken the Lord's day, just to tell a fa'en man o' his\r\nbackslidings? Na, na, that's no Bailie Jarvie's gate, nor was't his\r\nworthy father's the deacon afore him. Why, man! it's my rule never to\r\nthink on warldly business on the Sabbath, and though I did a' I could to\r\nkeep your note that I gat this morning out o' my head, yet I thought mair\r\non it a' day, than on the preaching--And it's my rule to gang to my bed\r\nwi' the yellow curtains preceesely at ten o'clock--unless I were eating a\r\nhaddock wi' a neighbour, or a neighbour wi' me--ask the lass-quean there,\r\nif it isna a fundamental rule in my household; and here hae I sitten up\r\nreading gude books, and gaping as if I wad swallow St. Enox Kirk, till it\r\nchappit twal, whilk was a lawfu' hour to gie a look at my ledger, just to\r\nsee how things stood between us; and then, as time and tide wait for no\r\nman, I made the lass get the lantern, and came slipping my ways here to\r\nsee what can be dune anent your affairs. Bailie Jarvie can command\r\nentrance into the tolbooth at ony hour, day or night;--sae could my\r\nfather the deacon in his time, honest man, praise to his memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough Owen groaned at the mention of the ledger, leading me grievously\r\nto fear that here also the balance stood in the wrong column; and\r\nalthough the worthy magistrate's speech expressed much self-complacency,\r\nand some ominous triumph in his own superior judgment, yet it was blended\r\nwith a sort of frank and blunt good-nature, from which I could not help\r\nderiving some hopes. He requested to see some papers he mentioned,\r\nsnatched them hastily from Owen's hand, and sitting on the bed, to \xe2\x80\x9crest\r\nhis shanks,\xe2\x80\x9d as he was pleased to express the accommodation which that\r\nposture afforded him, his servant girl held up the lantern to him, while,\r\npshawing, muttering, and sputtering, now at the imperfect light, now at\r\nthe contents of the packet, he ran over the writings it contained.\r\n\r\nSeeing him fairly engaged in this course of study, the guide who had\r\nbrought me hither seemed disposed to take an unceremonious leave. He made\r\na sign to me to say nothing, and intimated, by his change of posture, an\r\nintention to glide towards the door in such a manner as to attract the\r\nleast possible observation. But the alert magistrate (very different from\r\nmy old acquaintance, Mr. Justice Inglewood) instantly detected and\r\ninterrupted his purposes. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, look to the door, Stanchells--shut and\r\nlock it, and keep watch on the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger's brow darkened, and he seemed for an instant again to\r\nmeditate the effecting his retreat by violence; but ere he had\r\ndetermined, the door closed, and the ponderous bolt revolved. He muttered\r\nan exclamation in Gaelic, strode across the floor, and then, with an air\r\nof dogged resolution, as if fixed and prepared to see the scene to an\r\nend, sate himself down on the oak table, and whistled a strathspey.\r\n\r\nMr. Jarvie, who seemed very alert and expeditious in going through\r\nbusiness, soon showed himself master of that which he had been\r\nconsidering, and addressed himself to Mr. Owen in the following strain:--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, Mr. Owen, weel--your house are awin' certain sums to Messrs.\r\nMacVittie and MacFin (shame fa' their souple snouts! they made that and\r\nmair out o' a bargain about the aik-woods at Glen-Cailziechat, that they\r\ntook out atween my teeth--wi' help o' your gude word, I maun needs say,\r\nMr. Owen--but that makes nae odds now)--Weel, sir, your house awes them\r\nthis siller; and for this, and relief of other engagements they stand in\r\nfor you, they hae putten a double turn o' Stanchells' muckle key on ye.--\r\nWeel, sir, ye awe this siller--and maybe ye awe some mair to some other\r\nbody too--maybe ye awe some to myself, Bailie Nicol Jarvie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot deny, sir, but the balance may of this date be brought out\r\nagainst us, Mr. Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Owen; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you'll please to consider\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hae nae time to consider e'enow, Mr. Owen--Sae near Sabbath at e'en,\r\nand out o' ane's warm bed at this time o' night, and a sort o' drow in\r\nthe air besides--there's nae time for considering--But, sir, as I was\r\nsaying, ye awe me money--it winna deny--ye awe me money, less or mair,\r\nI'll stand by it. But then, Mr. Owen, I canna see how you, an active man\r\nthat understands business, can redd out the business ye're come down\r\nabout, and clear us a' aff--as I have gritt hope ye will--if ye're keepit\r\nlying here in the tolbooth of Glasgow. Now, sir, if you can find caution\r\n_judicio sisti,_--that is, that ye winna flee the country, but appear and\r\nrelieve your caution when ca'd for in our legal courts, ye may be set at\r\nliberty this very morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Owen, \xe2\x80\x9cif any friend would become surety for me to\r\nthat effect, my liberty might be usefully employed, doubtless, both for\r\nthe house and all connected with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Jarvie, \xe2\x80\x9cand doubtless such a friend wad expect\r\nye to appear when ca'd on, and relieve him o' his engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should do so as certainly, bating sickness or death, as that two\r\nand two make four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, Mr. Owen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the citizen of Glasgow, \xe2\x80\x9cI dinna misdoubt ye,\r\nand I'll prove it, sir--I'll prove it. I am a carefu' man, as is weel\r\nken'd, and industrious, as the hale town can testify; and I can win my\r\ncrowns, and keep my crowns, and count my crowns, wi' onybody in the Saut\r\nMarket, or it may be in the Gallowgate. And I'm a prudent man, as my\r\nfather the deacon was before me;--but rather than an honest civil\r\ngentleman, that understands business, and is willing to do justice to all\r\nmen, should lie by the heels this gate, unable to help himsell or onybody\r\nelse--why, conscience, man! I'll be your bail myself--But ye'll mind it's\r\na bail _judicio sisti,_ as our town-clerk says, not _judicatum solvi;_\r\nye'll mind that, for there's muckle difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Owen assured him, that as matters then stood, he could not expect any\r\none to become surety for the actual payment of the debt, but that there\r\nwas not the most distant cause for apprehending loss from his failing to\r\npresent himself when lawfully called upon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe ye--I believe ye. Eneugh said--eneugh said. We'se hae your\r\nlegs loose by breakfast-time.--And now let's hear what thir chamber\r\nchiels o' yours hae to say for themselves, or how, in the name of unrule,\r\nthey got here at this time o' night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rob Roy in Prison--68]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTH.\r\n\r\n                        Hame came our gudeman at e'en,\r\n                           And hame came he,\r\n                        And there he saw a man\r\n                           Where a man suldna be.\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x9cHow's this now, kimmer?\r\n                           How's this?\xe2\x80\x9d quo he,--\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x9cHow came this carle here\r\n                           Without the leave o' me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                            Old Song.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate took the light out of the servant-maid's hand, and\r\nadvanced to his scrutiny, like Diogenes in the street of Athens,\r\nlantern-in-hand, and probably with as little expectation as that of the\r\ncynic, that he was likely to encounter any especial treasure in the\r\ncourse of his researches. The first whom he approached was my mysterious\r\nguide, who, seated on a table as I have already described him, with his\r\neyes firmly fixed on the wall, his features arranged into the utmost\r\ninflexibility of expression, his hands folded on his breast with an air\r\nbetwixt carelessness and defiance, his heel patting against the foot of\r\nthe table, to keep time with the tune which he continued to whistle,\r\nsubmitted to Mr. Jarvie's investigation with an air of absolute\r\nconfidence and assurance which, for a moment, placed at fault the memory\r\nand sagacity of the acute investigator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!--Eh!--Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Bailie. \xe2\x80\x9cMy conscience!--it's\r\nimpossible!--and yet--no!--Conscience!--it canna be!--and yet\r\nagain--Deil hae me, that I suld say sae!--Ye robber--ye cateran--ye born\r\ndeevil that ye are, to a' bad ends and nae gude ane!--can this be you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cE'en as ye see, Bailie,\xe2\x80\x9d was the laconic answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConscience! if I am na clean bumbaized--_you_, ye cheat-the-wuddy\r\nrogue--_you_ here on your venture in the tolbooth o' Glasgow?--What d'ye\r\nthink's the value o' your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph!--why, fairly weighed, and Dutch weight, it might weigh down one\r\nprovost's, four bailies', a town-clerk's, six deacons', besides\r\nstent-masters'\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ye reiving villain!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr. Jarvie. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tell ower your\r\nsins, and prepare ye, for if I say the word\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, Bailie,\xe2\x80\x9d said he who was thus addressed, folding his hands behind\r\nhim with the utmost _nonchalance,_ \xe2\x80\x9cbut ye will never say that word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why suld I not, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the magistrate--\xe2\x80\x9cWhy suld I not?\r\nAnswer me that--why suld I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor three sufficient reasons, Bailie Jarvie.--First, for auld langsyne;\r\nsecond, for the sake of the auld wife ayont the fire at Stuckavrallachan,\r\nthat made some mixture of our bluids, to my own proper shame be it\r\nspoken! that has a cousin wi' accounts, and yarn winnles, and looms and\r\nshuttles, like a mere mechanical person; and lastly, Bailie, because if I\r\nsaw a sign o' your betraying me, I would plaster that wa' with your harns\r\nere the hand of man could rescue you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe're a bauld desperate villain, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the undaunted Bailie;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand ye ken that I ken ye to be sae, and that I wadna stand a moment for\r\nmy ain risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken weel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cye hae gentle bluid in your veins, and I\r\nwad be laith to hurt my ain kinsman. But I'll gang out here as free as I\r\ncame in, or the very wa's o' Glasgow tolbooth shall tell o't these ten\r\nyears to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie, \xe2\x80\x9cbluid's thicker than water; and it liesna\r\nin kith, kin, and ally, to see motes in ilka other's een if other een see\r\nthem no. It wad be sair news to the auld wife below the Ben of\r\nStuckavrallachan, that you, ye Hieland limmer, had knockit out my harns,\r\nor that I had kilted you up in a tow. But ye'll own, ye dour deevil, that\r\nwere it no your very sell, I wad hae grippit the best man in the\r\nHielands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe wad hae tried, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my guide, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I wot weel; but I\r\ndoubt ye wad hae come aff wi' the short measure; for we gang-there-out\r\nHieland bodies are an unchancy generation when you speak to us o'\r\nbondage. We downa bide the coercion of gude braid-claith about our\r\nhinderlans, let a be breeks o' free-stone, and garters o' iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe'll find the stane breeks and the airn garters--ay, and the hemp\r\ncravat, for a' that, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae man in a civilised country ever played the pliskies ye hae done--but\r\ne'en pickle in your ain pock-neuk--I hae gi'en ye wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cye'll wear black at my burial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil a black cloak will be there, Robin, but the corbies and the\r\nhoodie-craws, I'se gie ye my hand on that. But whar's the gude thousand\r\npund Scots that I lent ye, man, and when am I to see it again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my guide, after the affectation of considering for\r\na moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot justly tell--probably where last year's snaw is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that's on the tap of Schehallion, ye Hieland dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I look for payment frae you where ye stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Highlander, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I keep neither snaw nor dollars in my\r\nsporran. And as to when you'll see it--why, just when the king enjoys his\r\nain again, as the auld sang says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarst of a', Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the Glaswegian,--\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, ye disloyal\r\ntraitor--Warst of a'!--Wad ye bring popery in on us, and arbitrary power,\r\nand a foist and a warming-pan, and the set forms, and the curates, and\r\nthe auld enormities o' surplices and cerements? Ye had better stick\r\nto your auld trade o' theft-boot, black-mail, spreaghs, and\r\ngillravaging--better stealing nowte than ruining nations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, man--whisht wi' your whiggery,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Celt; \xe2\x80\x9cwe hae ken'd\r\nane anither mony a lang day. I'se take care your counting-room is no\r\ncleaned out when the Gillon-a-naillie* come to redd up the Glasgow\r\nbuiths, and clear them o' their auld shop-wares.\r\n\r\n* The lads with the kilts or petticoats.\r\n\r\nAnd, unless it just fa' in the preceese way o' your duty, ye maunna see\r\nme oftener, Nicol, than I am disposed to be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are a dauring villain, Rob,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cand ye will be\r\nhanged, that will be seen and heard tell o'; but I'se ne'er be the ill\r\nbird and foul my nest, set apart strong necessity and the skreigh of\r\nduty, which no man should hear and be inobedient. And wha the deevil's\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, turning to me--\xe2\x80\x9cSome gillravager that ye hae listed,\r\nI daur say. He looks as if he had a bauld heart to the highway, and a\r\nlang craig for the gibbet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, good Mr. Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Owen, who, like myself, had been struck\r\ndumb during this strange recognition, and no less strange dialogue, which\r\ntook place betwixt these extraordinary kinsmen--\xe2\x80\x9cThis, good Mr. Jarvie,\r\nis young Mr. Frank Osbaldistone, only child of the head of our house, who\r\nshould have been taken into our firm at the time Mr. Rashleigh\r\nOsbaldistone, his cousin, had the luck to be taken into it\xe2\x80\x9d--(Here Owen\r\ncould not suppress a groan)--\xe2\x80\x9cBut howsoever\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have heard of that smaik,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scotch merchant, interrupting\r\nhim; \xe2\x80\x9cit is he whom your principal, like an obstinate auld fule, wad make\r\na merchant o', wad he or wad he no,--and the lad turned a strolling\r\nstage-player, in pure dislike to the labour an honest man should live by.\r\nWeel, sir, what say you to your handiwork? Will Hamlet the Dane, or\r\nHamlet's ghost, be good security for Mr. Owen, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't deserve your taunt,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I respect your motive,\r\nand am too grateful for the assistance you have afforded Mr. Owen, to\r\nresent it. My only business here was to do what I could (it is perhaps\r\nvery little) to aid Mr. Owen in the management of my father's affairs. My\r\ndislike of the commercial profession is a feeling of which I am the best\r\nand sole judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI protest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Highlander, \xe2\x80\x9cI had some respect for this callant\r\neven before I ken'd what was in him; but now I honour him for his\r\ncontempt of weavers and spinners, and sic-like mechanical persons and\r\ntheir pursuits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe're mad, Rob,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie--\xe2\x80\x9cmad as a March hare--though wherefore\r\na hare suld be mad at March mair than at Martinmas, is mair than I can\r\nweel say. Weavers! Deil shake ye out o' the web the weaver craft made.\r\nSpinners! ye'll spin and wind yourself a bonny pirn. And this young\r\nbirkie here, that ye're hoying and hounding on the shortest road to the\r\ngallows and the deevil, will his stage-plays and his poetries help him\r\nhere, dye think, ony mair than your deep oaths and drawn dirks, ye\r\nreprobate that ye are?--Will _Tityre tu patulae,_ as they ca' it, tell\r\nhim where Rashleigh Osbaldistone is? or Macbeth, and all his kernes and\r\ngalla-glasses, and your awn to boot, Rob, procure him five thousand\r\npounds to answer the bills which fall due ten days hence, were they a'\r\nrouped at the Cross,--basket-hilts, Andra-Ferraras, leather targets,\r\nbrogues, brochan, and sporrans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen days,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, and instinctively drew out Diana Vernon's packet;\r\nand the time being elapsed during which I was to keep the seal sacred, I\r\nhastily broke it open. A sealed letter fell from a blank enclosure, owing\r\nto the trepidation with which I opened the parcel. A slight current of\r\nwind, which found its way through a broken pane of the window, wafted the\r\nletter to Mr. Jarvie's feet, who lifted it, examined the address with\r\nunceremonious curiosity, and, to my astonishment, handed it to his\r\nHighland kinsman, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere's a wind has blown a letter to its right\r\nowner, though there were ten thousand chances against its coming to\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Highlander, having examined the address, broke the letter open\r\nwithout the least ceremony. I endeavoured to interrupt his proceeding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must satisfy me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the letter is intended for you\r\nbefore I can permit you to peruse it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake yourself quite easy, Mr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the mountaineer\r\nwith great composure.--\xe2\x80\x9cremember Justice Inglewood, Clerk Jobson, Mr.\r\nMorris--above all, remember your vera humble servant, Robert Cawmil, and\r\nthe beautiful Diana Vernon. Remember all this, and doubt no longer that\r\nthe letter is for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remained astonished at my own stupidity.--Through the whole night, the\r\nvoice, and even the features of this man, though imperfectly seen,\r\nhaunted me with recollections to which I could assign no exact local or\r\npersonal associations. But now the light dawned on me at once; this man\r\nwas Campbell himself. His whole peculiarities flashed on me at once,--the\r\ndeep strong voice--the inflexible, stern, yet considerate cast of\r\nfeatures--the Scottish brogue, with its corresponding dialect and\r\nimagery, which, although he possessed the power at times of laying them\r\naside, recurred at every moment of emotion, and gave pith to his sarcasm,\r\nor vehemence to his expostulation. Rather beneath the middle size than\r\nabove it, his limbs were formed upon the very strongest model that is\r\nconsistent with agility, while from the remarkable ease and freedom of\r\nhis movements, you could not doubt his possessing the latter quality in a\r\nhigh degree of perfection. Two points in his person interfered with the\r\nrules of symmetry; his shoulders were so broad in proportion to his\r\nheight, as, notwithstanding the lean and lathy appearance of his frame,\r\ngave him something the air of being too square in respect to his stature;\r\nand his arms, though round, sinewy, and strong, were so very long as to\r\nbe rather a deformity. I afterwards heard that this length of arm was a\r\ncircumstance on which he prided himself; that when he wore his native\r\nHighland garb, he could tie the garters of his hose without stooping; and\r\nthat it gave him great advantage in the use of the broad-sword, at which\r\nhe was very dexterous. But certainly this want of symmetry destroyed the\r\nclaim he might otherwise have set up, to be accounted a very handsome\r\nman; it gave something wild, irregular, and, as it were, unearthly, to\r\nhis appearance, and reminded me involuntarily of the tales which Mabel\r\nused to tell of the old Picts who ravaged Northumberland in ancient\r\ntimes, who, according to her tradition, were a sort of half-goblin\r\nhalf-human beings, distinguished, like this man, for courage, cunning,\r\nferocity, the length of their arms, and the squareness of their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, I recollected the circumstances in which we formerly met,\r\nI could not doubt that the billet was most probably designed for him. He\r\nhad made a marked figure among those mysterious personages over whom\r\nDiana seemed to exercise an influence, and from whom she experienced an\r\ninfluence in her turn. It was painful to think that the fate of a being\r\nso amiable was involved in that of desperadoes of this man's\r\ndescription;--yet it seemed impossible to doubt it. Of what use, however,\r\ncould this person be to my father's affairs?--I could think only of one.\r\nRashleigh Osbaldistone had, at the instigation of Miss Vernon, certainly\r\nfound means to produce Mr. Campbell when his presence was necessary to\r\nexculpate me from Morris's accusation--Was it not possible that her\r\ninfluence, in like manner, might prevail on Campbell to produce\r\nRashleigh? Speaking on this supposition, I requested to know where my\r\ndangerous kinsman was, and when Mr. Campbell had seen him. The answer was\r\nindirect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a kittle cast she has gien me to play; but yet it's fair play, and\r\nI winna baulk her. Mr. Osbaldistone, I dwell not very far from hence--my\r\nkinsman can show you the way--Leave Mr. Owen to do the best he can in\r\nGlasgow--do you come and see me in the glens, and it's like I may\r\npleasure you, and stead your father in his extremity. I am but a poor\r\nman; but wit's better than wealth--and, cousin\xe2\x80\x9d (turning from me to\r\naddress Mr. Jarvie), \xe2\x80\x9cif ye daur venture sae muckle as to eat a dish of\r\nScotch collops, and a leg o' red-deer venison wi' me, come ye wi' this\r\nSassenach gentleman as far as Drymen or Bucklivie,--or the Clachan of\r\nAberfoil will be better than ony o' them,--and I'll hae somebody waiting\r\nto weise ye the gate to the place where I may be for the time--What say\r\nye, man? There's my thumb, I'll ne'er beguile thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na, Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cautious burgher, \xe2\x80\x9cI seldom like to leave the\r\nGorbals;* I have nae freedom to gang among your wild hills, Robin, and\r\nyour kilted red-shanks--it disna become my place, man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* [The _Gorbals_ or \xe2\x80\x9csuburbs\xe2\x80\x9d are situate on the south side of the\r\nRiver.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil damn your place and you baith!\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Campbell. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only\r\ndrap o' gentle bluid that's in your body was our great-grand-uncle's that\r\nwas justified* at Dumbarton, and you set yourself up to say ye wad\r\nderogate frae your place to visit me!\r\n\r\n* [Executed for treason.]\r\n\r\nHark thee, man--I owe thee a day in harst--I'll pay up your thousan pund\r\nScots, plack and bawbee, gin ye'll be an honest fallow for anes, and just\r\ndaiker up the gate wi' this Sassenach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout awa' wi' your gentility,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9ccarry your gentle\r\nbluid to the Cross, and see what ye'll buy wi't. But, if I _were_ to\r\ncome, wad ye really and soothfastly pay me the siller?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Highlander, \xe2\x80\x9cupon the halidome of him that\r\nsleeps beneath the grey stane at Inch-Cailleach.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* Inch-Cailleach is an island in Lochlomond, where the clan of MacGregor\r\nwere wont to be interred, and where their sepulchres may still be seen.\r\nIt formerly contained a nunnery: hence the name of Inch-Cailleach, or the\r\nisland of Old Women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay nae mair, Robin--say nae mair--We'll see what may be dune. But ye\r\nmaunna expect me to gang ower the Highland line--I'll gae beyond the line\r\nat no rate. Ye maun meet me about Bucklivie or the Clachan of\r\nAberfoil,--and dinna forget the needful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae fear--nae fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell; \xe2\x80\x9cI'll be as true as the steel blade\r\nthat never failed its master. But I must be budging, cousin, for the air\r\no' Glasgow tolbooth is no that ower salutary to a Highlander's\r\nconstitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the merchant, \xe2\x80\x9cand if my duty were to be dune, ye\r\ncouldna change your atmosphere, as the minister ca's it, this ae wee\r\nwhile.--Ochon, that I sud ever be concerned in aiding and abetting an\r\nescape frae justice! it will be a shame and disgrace to me and mine, and\r\nmy very father's memory, for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout tout, man! let that flee stick in the wa',\xe2\x80\x9d answered his kinsman;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen the dirt's dry it will rub out--Your father, honest man, could look\r\nower a friend's fault as weel as anither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may be right, Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie, after a moment's\r\nreflection; \xe2\x80\x9che was a considerate man the deacon; he ken'd we had a' our\r\nfrailties, and he lo'ed his friends--Ye'll no hae forgotten him, Robin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n This question he put in a softened tone, conveying as much at least of\r\nthe ludicrous as the pathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgotten him!\xe2\x80\x9d replied his kinsman--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat suld ail me to forget him?--a\r\nwapping weaver he was, and wrought my first pair o' hose.--But come awa',\r\nkinsman,\r\n\r\n              Come fill up my cap, come fill up my cann,\r\n              Come saddle my horses, and call up my man;\r\n              Come open your gates, and let me gae free,\r\n                   I daurna stay langer in bonny Dundee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhisht, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, in an authoritative tone--\xe2\x80\x9clilting\r\nand singing sae near the latter end o' the Sabbath! This house may hear\r\nye sing anither tune yet--Aweel, we hae a' backslidings to answer\r\nfor--Stanchells, open the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jailor obeyed, and we all sallied forth. Stanchells looked with some\r\nsurprise at the two strangers, wondering, doubtless, how they came into\r\nthese premises without his knowledge; but Mr. Jarvie's \xe2\x80\x9cFriends o' mine,\r\nStanchells--friends o' mine,\xe2\x80\x9d silenced all disposition to inquiries. We\r\nnow descended into the lower vestibule, and hallooed more than once for\r\nDougal, to which summons no answer was returned; when Campbell observed\r\nwith a sardonic smile, \xe2\x80\x9cThat if Dougal was the lad he kent him, he would\r\nscarce wait to get thanks for his ain share of the night's wark, but was\r\nin all probability on the full trot to the pass of Ballamaha\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd left us--and, abune a', me, mysell, locked up in the tolbooth a'\r\nnight!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Bailie, in ire and perturbation. \xe2\x80\x9cCa' for\r\nforehammers, sledge-hammers, pinches, and coulters; send for Deacon\r\nYettlin, the smith, an let him ken that Bailie Jarvie's shut up in the\r\ntolbooth by a Highland blackguard, whom he'll hang up as high as Haman\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen ye catch him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cbut stay--the door is\r\nsurely not locked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed, on examination, we found that the door was not only left open,\r\nbut that Dougal in his retreat had, by carrying off the keys along with\r\nhim, taken care that no one should exercise his office of porter in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has glimmerings o' common sense now, that creature Dougal,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCampbell.--\xe2\x80\x9che ken'd an open door might hae served me at a pinch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were by this time in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cin my puir mind, if ye live\r\nthe life ye do, ye suld hae ane o' your gillies door-keeper in every jail\r\nin Scotland, in case o' the warst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAne o' my kinsmen a bailie in ilka burgh will just do as weel, cousin\r\nNicol--So, gude-night or gude-morning to ye; and forget not the Clachan\r\nof Aberfoil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for an answer, he sprung to the other side of the\r\nstreet, and was lost in darkness. Immediately on his disappearance, we\r\nheard him give a low whistle of peculiar modulation, which was instantly\r\nreplied to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear to the Hieland deevils,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie; \xe2\x80\x9cthey think themselves on\r\nthe skirts of Benlomond already, where they may gang whewingand whistling\r\nabout without minding Sunday or Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he was interrupted by\r\nsomething which fell with a heavy clash on the street before us--\xe2\x80\x9cGude\r\nguide us what's this mair o't?--Mattie, haud up the lantern--Conscience\r\nif it isna the keys!--Weel, that's just as weel--they cost the burgh\r\nsiller, and there might hae been some clavers about the loss o' them. O,\r\nan Bailie Grahame were to get word o' this night's job, it would be a\r\nsair hair in my neck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we were still but a few steps from the tolbooth door, we carried back\r\nthese implements of office, and consigned them to the head jailor, who,\r\nin lieu of the usual mode of making good his post by turning the keys,\r\nwas keeping sentry in the vestibule till the arrival of some assistant,\r\nwhom he had summoned in order to replace the Celtic fugitive Dougal.\r\n\r\nHaving discharged this piece of duty to the burgh, and my road lying the\r\nsame way with the honest magistrate's, I profited by the light of his\r\nlantern, and he by my arm, to find our way through the streets, which,\r\nwhatever they may now be, were then dark, uneven, and ill-paved. Age is\r\neasily propitiated by attentions from the young. The Bailie expressed\r\nhimself interested in me, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cThat since I was nane o' that\r\nplay-acting and play-ganging generation, whom his saul hated, he wad be\r\nglad if I wad eat a reisted haddock or a fresh herring, at breakfast wi'\r\nhim the morn, and meet my friend, Mr. Owen, whom, by that time, he would\r\nplace at liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when I had accepted of the invitation with thanks,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow could you possibly connect me with the stage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI watna,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Jarvie;--\xe2\x80\x9cit was a bletherin' phrasin' chield they\r\nca' Fairservice, that cam at e'en to get an order to send the crier\r\nthrough the toun for ye at skreigh o' day the morn. He tell't me whae ye\r\nwere, and how ye were sent frae your father's house because ye wadna be a\r\ndealer, and that ye mightna disgrace your family wi' ganging on the\r\nstage. Ane Hammorgaw, our precentor, brought him here, and said he was an\r\nauld acquaintance; but I sent them both away wi' a flae in their lug for\r\nbringing me sic an errand, on sic a night. But I see he's a fule-creature\r\na'thegither, and clean mistaen about ye. I like ye, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like a lad that will stand by his friends in trouble--I aye did it\r\nmysell, and sae did the deacon my father, rest and bless him! But ye\r\nsuldna keep ower muckle company wi' Hielandmen and thae wild cattle. Can\r\na man touch pitch and no be defiled?--aye mind that. Nae doubt, the best\r\nand wisest may err--Once, twice, and thrice have I backslidden, man, and\r\ndune three things this night--my father wadna hae believed his een if he\r\ncould hae looked up and seen me do them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was by this time arrived at the door of his own dwelling. He paused,\r\nhowever, on the threshold, and went on in a solemn tone of deep\r\ncontrition,--\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, I hae thought my ain thoughts on the\r\nSabbath--secondly, I hae gi'en security for an Englishman--and, in the\r\nthird and last place, well-a-day! I hae let an ill-doer escape from the\r\nplace of imprisonment--But there's balm in Gilead, Mr. Osbaldistone--\r\nMattie, I can let mysell in--see Mr. Osbaldistone to Luckie Flyter's, at\r\nthe corner o' the wynd.--Mr. Osbaldistone\xe2\x80\x9d--in a whisper--\xe2\x80\x9cye'll offer\r\nnae incivility to Mattie--she's an honest man's daughter, and a near\r\ncousin o' the Laird\r\no' Limmerfield's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWill it please your worship to accept of my poor service? I beseech\r\n     that I may feed upon your bread, though it be the brownest, and\r\n     drink of your drink, though it be of the smallest; for I will do\r\n     your Worship as much service for forty shillings as another man\r\n     shall for three pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                      Greene's _Tu Quoque._\r\n\r\nI remembered the honest Bailie's parting charge, but did not conceive\r\nthere was any incivility in adding a kiss to the half-crown with which I\r\nremunerated Mattie's attendance;--nor did her \xe2\x80\x9cFie for shame, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n express any very deadly resentment of the affront. Repeated knocking at\r\nMrs. Flyter's gate awakened in due order, first, one or two stray dogs,\r\nwho began to bark with all their might; next two or three night-capped\r\nheads, which were thrust out of the neighbouring windows to reprehend me\r\nfor disturbing the solemnity of the Sunday night by that untimely noise.\r\nWhile I trembled lest the thunders of their wrath might dissolve in\r\nshowers like that of Xantippe, Mrs. Flyter herself awoke, and began, in a\r\ntone of objurgation not unbecoming the philosophical spouse of Socrates,\r\nto scold one or two loiterers in her kitchen, for not hastening to the\r\ndoor to prevent a repetition of my noisy summons.\r\n\r\nThese worthies were, indeed, nearly concerned in the fracas which their\r\nlaziness occasioned, being no other than the faithful Mr. Fairservice,\r\nwith his friend Mr. Hammorgaw, and another person, whom I afterwards\r\nfound to be the town-crier, who were sitting over a cog of ale, as they\r\ncalled it (at my expense, as my bill afterwards informed me), in order to\r\ndevise the terms and style of a proclamation to be made through the\r\nstreets the next day, in order that \xe2\x80\x9cthe unfortunate young gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nthey had the impudence to qualify me, might be restored to his friends\r\nwithout farther delay. It may be supposed that I did not suppress my\r\ndispleasure at this impertinent interference with my affairs; but Andrew\r\nset up such ejaculations of transport at my arrival, as fairly drowned my\r\nexpressions of resentment. His raptures, perchance, were partly\r\npolitical; and the tears of joy which he shed had certainly their source\r\nin that noble fountain of emotion, the tankard. However, the tumultuous\r\nglee which he felt, or pretended to feel, at my return, saved Andrew the\r\nbroken head which I had twice destined him;--first, on account of the\r\ncolloquy he had held with the precentor on my affairs; and secondly, for\r\nthe impertinent history he had thought proper to give of me to Mr.\r\nJarvie. I however contented myself with slapping the door of my bedroom\r\nin his face as he followed me, praising Heaven for my safe return, and\r\nmixing his joy with admonitions to me to take care how I walked my own\r\nways in future. I then went to bed, resolving my first business in the\r\nmorning should be to discharge this troublesome, pedantic, self-conceited\r\ncoxcomb, who seemed so much disposed to constitute himself rather a\r\npreceptor than a domestic.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in the morning I resumed my purpose, and calling Andrew into\r\nmy apartment, requested to know his charge for guiding and attending me\r\nas far as Glasgow. Mr. Fairservice looked very blank at this demand,\r\njustly considering it as a presage to approaching dismission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cwunna think--wunna\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out, you rascal, or I'll break your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as Andrew,\r\nbetween the double risk of losing all by asking too much, or a part, by\r\nstating his demand lower than what I might be willing to pay, stood\r\ngasping in the agony of doubt and calculation.\r\n\r\nOut it came with a bolt, however, at my threat; as the kind violence of a\r\nblow on the back sometimes delivers the windpipe from an intrusive\r\nmorsel.--\xe2\x80\x9cAughteen pennies sterling per diem--that is, by the day--your\r\nhonour wadna think unconscionable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is double what is usual, and treble what you merit, Andrew; but\r\nthere's a guinea for you, and get about your business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord forgi'e us! Is your honour mad?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Andrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I think you mean to make me so--I give you a third above your\r\ndemand, and you stand staring and expostulating there as if I were\r\ncheating you. Take your money, and go about your business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGude safe us!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cin what can I hae offended your\r\nhonour? Certainly a' flesh is but as the flowers of the field; but if a\r\nbed of camomile hath value in medicine, of a surety the use of Andrew\r\nFairservice to your honour is nothing less evident--it's as muckle as\r\nyour life's worth to part wi' me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cit is difficult to say whether you are more\r\nknave or fool. So you intend then to remain with me whether I like it or\r\nno?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroth, I was e'en thinking sae,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew, dogmatically; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if\r\nyour honour disna ken when ye hae a gude servant, I ken when I hae a gude\r\nmaster, and the deil be in my feet gin I leave ye--and there's the brief\r\nand the lang o't besides I hae received nae regular warning to quit my\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour place, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said I;--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, you are no hired servant of mine,--you\r\nare merely a guide, whose knowledge of the country I availed myself of on\r\nmy road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no just a common servant, I admit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Mr.\r\nFairservice; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your honour kens I quitted a gude place at an hour's\r\nnotice, to comply wi' your honour's solicitations. A man might make\r\nhonestly, and wi' a clear conscience, twenty sterling pounds per annum,\r\nweel counted siller, o' the garden at Osbaldistone Hall, and I wasna\r\nlikely to gi'e up a' that for a guinea, I trow--I reckoned on staying wi'\r\nyour honour to the term's end at the least o't; and I account my wage,\r\nboard-wage, fee and bountith,--ay, to that length o't at the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cthese impudent pretensions won't serve\r\nyour turn; and if I hear any more of them, I shall convince you that\r\nSquire Thorncliff is not the only one of my name that can use his\r\nfingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile I spoke thus, the whole matter struck me as so ridiculous, that,\r\nthough really angry, I had some difficulty to forbear laughing at the\r\ngravity with which Andrew supported a plea so utterly extravagant. The\r\nrascal, aware of the impression he had made on my muscles, was encouraged\r\nto perseverance. He judged it safer, however, to take his pretensions a\r\npeg lower, in case of overstraining at the same time both his plea and my\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmitting that my honour could part with a faithful servant, that had\r\nserved me and mine by day and night for twenty years, in a strange place,\r\nand at a moment's warning, he was weel assured,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit wasna in my\r\nheart, nor in no true gentleman's, to pit a puir lad like himself, that\r\nhad come forty or fifty, or say a hundred miles out o' his road purely to\r\nbear my honour company, and that had nae handing but his penny-fee, to\r\nsic a hardship as this comes to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think it was you, Will, who once told me, that, to be an obstinate man,\r\nI am in certain things the most gullable and malleable of mortals. The\r\nfact is, that it is only contradiction which makes me peremptory, and\r\nwhen I do not feel myself called on to give battle to any proposition, I\r\nam always willing to grant it, rather than give myself much trouble. I\r\nknew this fellow to be a greedy, tiresome, meddling coxcomb; still,\r\nhowever, I must have some one about me in the quality of guide and\r\ndomestic, and I was so much used to Andrew's humour, that on some\r\noccasions it was rather amusing. In the state of indecision to which\r\nthese reflections led me, I asked Fairservice if he knew the roads,\r\ntowns, etc., in the north of Scotland, to which my father's concerns with\r\nthe proprietors of Highland forests were likely to lead me. I believe if\r\nI had asked him the road to the terrestrial paradise, he would have at\r\nthat moment undertaken to guide me to it; so that I had reason afterwards\r\nto think myself fortunate in finding that his actual knowledge did not\r\nfall very much short of that which he asserted himself to possess. I\r\nfixed the amount of his wages, and reserved to myself the privilege of\r\ndismissing him when I chose, on paying him a week in advance. I gave him\r\nfinally a severe lecture on his conduct of the preceding day, and then\r\ndismissed him rejoicing at heart, though somewhat crestfallen in\r\ncountenance, to rehearse to his friend the precentor, who was taking his\r\nmorning draught in the kitchen, the mode in which he had \xe2\x80\x9ccuitled up the\r\ndaft young English squire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgreeable to appointment, I went next to Bailie Nicol Jarvie's, where a\r\ncomfortable morning's repast was arranged in the parlour, which served as\r\nan apartment of all hours, and almost all work, to that honest gentleman.\r\nThe bustling and benevolent magistrate had been as good as his word. I\r\nfound my friend Owen at liberty, and, conscious of the refreshments and\r\npurification of brush and basin, was of course a very different person\r\nfrom Owen a prisoner, squalid, heart-broken, and hopeless. Yet the sense\r\nof pecuniary difficulties arising behind, before, and around him, had\r\ndepressed his spirit, and the almost paternal embrace which the good man\r\ngave me, was embittered by a sigh of the deepest anxiety. And when he\r\nsate down, the heaviness in his eye and manner, so different from the\r\nquiet composed satisfaction which they usually exhibited, indicated that\r\nhe was employing his arithmetic in mentally numbering up the days, the\r\nhours, the minutes, which yet remained as an interval between the\r\ndishonour of bills and the downfall of the great commercial establishment\r\nof Osbaldistone and Tresham. It was left to me, therefore, to do honour\r\nto our landlord's hospitable cheer--to his tea, right from China, which\r\nhe got in a present from some eminent ship's-husband at Wapping--to his\r\ncoffee, from a snug plantation of his own, as he informed us with a wink,\r\ncalled Saltmarket Grove, in the island of Jamaica--to his English toast\r\nand ale, his Scotch dried salmon, his Lochfine herrings, and even to the\r\ndouble-damask table-cloth, \xe2\x80\x9cwrought by no hand, as you may guess,\xe2\x80\x9d save\r\nthat of his deceased father the worthy Deacon Jarvie.\r\n\r\nHaving conciliated our good-humoured host by those little attentions\r\nwhich are great to most men, I endeavoured in my turn to gain from him\r\nsome information which might be useful for my guidance, as well as for\r\nthe satisfaction of my curiosity. We had not hitherto made the least\r\nallusion to the transactions of the preceding night, a circumstance which\r\nmade my question sound somewhat abrupt, when, without any previous\r\nintroduction of the subject, I took advantage of a pause when the history\r\nof the table-cloth ended, and that of the napkins was about to commence,\r\nto inquire, \xe2\x80\x9cPray, by the by, Mr. Jarvie, who may this Mr. Robert\r\nCampbell be, whom we met with last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe interrogatory seemed to strike the honest magistrate, to use the\r\nvulgar phrase, \xe2\x80\x9call of a heap,\xe2\x80\x9d and instead of answering, he returned the\r\nquestion--\xe2\x80\x9cWhae's Mr. Robert Campbell?--ahem! ahay! Whae's Mr. Robert\r\nCampbell, quo' he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean who and what is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he's--ahay!--he's--ahem!--Where did ye meet with Mr. Robert\r\nCampbell, as ye ca' him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met him by chance,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9csome months ago in the north of\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu then, Mr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, doggedly, \xe2\x80\x9cye'll ken as\r\nmuckle about him as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should suppose not, Mr. Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied;--\xe2\x80\x9cyou are his relation, it\r\nseems, and his friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some cousin-red between us, doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie\r\nreluctantly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we hae seen little o' ilk other since Rob gae tip the\r\ncattle-line o' dealing, poor fallow! he was hardly guided by them might\r\nhae used him better--and they haena made their plack a bawbee o't\r\nneither. There's mony ane this day wad rather they had never chased puir\r\nRobin frae the Cross o' Glasgow--there's mony ane wad rather see him\r\nagain at the tale o' three hundred kyloes, than at the head o' thirty\r\nwaur cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this explains nothing to me, Mr. Jarvie, of Mr. Campbell's rank,\r\nhabits of life, and means of subsistence,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRank?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie; \xe2\x80\x9che's a Hieland gentleman, nae doubt--better\r\nrank need nane to be;--and for habit, I judge he wears the Hieland habit\r\namang the hills, though he has breeks on when he comes to Glasgow;--and\r\nas for his subsistence, what needs we care about his subsistence, sae\r\nlang as he asks naething frae us, ye ken? But I hae nae time for\r\nclavering about him e'en now, because we maun look into your father's\r\nconcerns wi' all speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he put on his spectacles, and sate down to examine Mr. Owen's\r\nstates, which the other thought it most prudent to communicate to him\r\nwithout reserve. I knew enough of business to be aware that nothing could\r\nbe more acute and sagacious than the views which Mr. Jarvie entertained\r\nof the matters submitted to his examination; and, to do him justice, it\r\nwas marked by much fairness, and even liberality. He scratched his ear\r\nindeed repeatedly on observing the balance which stood at the debit of\r\nOsbaldistone and Tresham in account with himself personally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a dead loss,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed; \xe2\x80\x9cand, conscience! whate'er ane o'\r\nyour Lombard Street goldsmiths may say to it, it's a snell ane in the\r\nSaut-Market* o' Glasgow. It will be a heavy deficit--a staff out o' my\r\nbicker, I trow.\r\n\r\n* [The Saltmarket. This ancient street, situate in the heart of Glasgow,\r\nhas of late been almost entirely renovated.]\r\n\r\nBut what then?--I trust the house wunna coup the crane for a' that's come\r\nand gane yet; and if it does, I'll never bear sae base a mind as thae\r\ncorbies in the Gallowgate--an I am to lose by ye, I'se ne'er deny I hae\r\nwon by ye mony a fair pund sterling--Sae, an it come to the warst, I'se\r\neen lay the head o' the sow to the tail o' the grice.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* _Anglice,_ the head of the sow to the tail of the pig.\r\n\r\nI did not altogether understand the proverbial arrangement with which Mr.\r\nJarvie consoled himself, but I could easily see that he took a kind and\r\nfriendly interest in the arrangement of my father's affairs, suggested\r\nseveral expedients, approved several plans proposed by Owen, and by his\r\ncountenance and counsel greatly abated the gloom upon the brow of that\r\nafflicted delegate of my father's establishment.\r\n\r\nAs I was an idle spectator on this occasion, and, perhaps, as I showed\r\nsome inclination more than once to return to the prohibited, and\r\napparently the puzzling subject of Mr. Campbell, Mr. Jarvie dismissed me\r\nwith little formality, with an advice to \xe2\x80\x9cgang up the gate to the\r\ncollege, where I wad find some chields could speak Greek and Latin\r\nweel--at least they got plenty o' siller for doing deil haet else, if they\r\ndidna do that; and where I might read a spell o' the worthy Mr. Zachary\r\nBoyd's translation o' the Scriptures--better poetry need nane to be, as\r\nhe had been tell'd by them that ken'd or suld hae ken'd about sic\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d But he seasoned this dismission with a kind and hospitable\r\ninvitation \xe2\x80\x9cto come back and take part o' his family-chack at ane\r\npreceesely--there wad be a leg o' mutton, and, it might be, a tup's head,\r\nfor they were in season;\xe2\x80\x9d but above all, I was to return at \xe2\x80\x9cane o'clock\r\npreceesely--it was the hour he and the deacon his father aye dined\r\nat--they pat it off for naething nor for naebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n              So stands the Thracian herdsman with his spear\r\n              Full in the gap, and hopes the hunted bear;\r\n              And hears him in the rustling wood, and sees\r\n              His course at distance by the bending trees,\r\n                  And thinks--Here comes my mortal enemy,\r\n                  And either he must fall in fight, or I.\r\n                                         Palamon and Arcite.\r\n\r\nI took the route towards the college, as recommended by Mr. Jarvie, less\r\nwith the intention of seeking for any object of interest or amusement,\r\nthan to arrange my own ideas, and meditate on my future conduct. I\r\nwandered from one quadrangle of old-fashioned buildings to another, and\r\nfrom thence to the College-yards, or walking ground, where, pleased with\r\nthe solitude of the place, most of the students being engaged in their\r\nclasses, I took several turns, pondering on the waywardness of my own\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nI could not doubt, from the circumstances attending my first meeting with\r\nthis person Campbell, that he was engaged in some strangely desperate\r\ncourses; and the reluctance with which Mr. Jarvie alluded to his person\r\nor pursuits, as well as all the scene of the preceding night, tended to\r\nconfirm these suspicions. Yet to this man Diana Vernon had not, it would\r\nseem, hesitated to address herself in my behalf; and the conduct of the\r\nmagistrate himself towards him showed an odd mixture of kindness, and\r\neven respect, with pity and censure. Something there must be uncommon in\r\nCampbell's situation and character; and what was still more\r\nextraordinary, it seemed that his fate was doomed to have influence over,\r\nand connection with, my own. I resolved to bring Mr. Jarvie to close\r\nquarters on the first proper opportunity, and learn as much as was\r\npossible on the subject of this mysterious person, in order that I might\r\njudge whether it was possible for me, without prejudice to my reputation,\r\nto hold that degree of farther correspondence with him to which he seemed\r\nto invite.\r\n\r\nWhile I was musing on these subjects, my attention was attracted by three\r\npersons who appeared at the upper end of the walk through which I was\r\nsauntering, seemingly engaged in very earnest conversation. That\r\nintuitive impression which announces to us the approach of whomsoever we\r\nlove or hate with intense vehemence, long before a more indifferent eye\r\ncan recognise their persons, flashed upon my mind the sure conviction\r\nthat the midmost of these three men was Rashleigh Osbaldistone. To\r\naddress him was my first impulse;--my second was, to watch him until he\r\nwas alone, or at least to reconnoitre his companions before confronting\r\nhim. The party was still at such distance, and engaged in such deep\r\ndiscourse, that I had time to step unobserved to the other side of a\r\nsmall hedge, which imperfectly screened the alley in which I was walking.\r\nIt was at this period the fashion of the young and gay to wear, in their\r\nmorning walks, a scarlet cloak, often laced and embroidered, above their\r\nother dress, and it was the trick of the time for gallants occasionally\r\nto dispose it so as to muffle a part of the face. The imitating this\r\nfashion, with the degree of shelter which I received from the hedge,\r\nenabled me to meet my cousin, unobserved by him or the others, except\r\nperhaps as a passing stranger. I was not a little startled at recognising\r\nin his companions that very Morris on whose account I had been summoned\r\nbefore Justice Inglewood, and Mr. MacVittie the merchant, from whose\r\nstarched and severe aspect I had recoiled on the preceding day.\r\n\r\nA more ominous conjunction to my own affairs, and those of my father,\r\ncould scarce have been formed. I remembered Morris's false accusation\r\nagainst me, which he might be as easily induced to renew as he had been\r\nintimidated to withdraw; I recollected the inauspicious influence of\r\nMacVittie over my father's affairs, testified by the imprisonment of\r\nOwen;--and I now saw both these men combined with one, whose talent for\r\nmischief I deemed little inferior to those of the great author of all\r\nill, and my abhorrence of whom almost amounted to dread.\r\n\r\nWhen they had passed me for some paces, I turned and followed them\r\nunobserved. At the end of the walk they separated, Morris and MacVittie\r\nleaving the gardens, and Rashleigh returning alone through the walks. I\r\nwas now determined to confront him, and demand reparation for the\r\ninjuries he had done my father, though in what form redress was likely to\r\nbe rendered remained to be known. This, however, I trusted to chance; and\r\nflinging back the cloak in which I was muffled, I passed through a gap of\r\nthe low hedge, and presented myself before Rashleigh, as, in a deep\r\nreverie, he paced down the avenue.\r\n\r\nRashleigh was no man to be surprised or thrown off his guard by sudden\r\noccurrences. Yet he did not find me thus close to him, wearing\r\nundoubtedly in my face the marks of that indignation which was glowing in\r\nmy bosom, without visibly starting at an apparition so sudden and\r\nmenacing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are well met, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was my commencement; \xe2\x80\x9cI was about to take a long\r\nand doubtful journey in quest of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know little of him you sought then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rashleigh, with his\r\nusual undaunted composure. \xe2\x80\x9cI am easily found by my friends--still more\r\neasily by my foes;--your manner compels me to ask in which class I must\r\nrank Mr. Francis Osbaldistone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that of your foes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered--\xe2\x80\x9cin that of your mortal foes,\r\nunless you instantly do justice to your benefactor, my father, by\r\naccounting for his property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to whom, Mr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rashleigh, \xe2\x80\x9cam I, a member of\r\nyour father's commercial establishment, to be compelled to give any\r\naccount of my proceedings in those concerns, which are in every respect\r\nidentified with my own?--Surely not to a young gentleman whose exquisite\r\ntaste for literature would render such discussions disgusting and\r\nunintelligible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sneer, sir, is no answer; I will not part with you until I have\r\nfull satisfaction concerning the fraud you meditate--you shall go with me\r\nbefore a magistrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, and made a step or two as if to accompany me;\r\nthen pausing, proceeded--\xe2\x80\x9cWere I inclined to do so as you would have me,\r\nyou should soon feel which of us had most reason to dread the presence of\r\na magistrate. But I have no wish to accelerate your fate. Go, young man!\r\namuse yourself in your world of poetical imaginations, and leave the\r\nbusiness of life to those who understand and can conduct it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis intention, I believe, was to provoke me, and he succeeded. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nOsbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis tone of calm insolence shall not avail you.\r\nYou ought to be aware that the name we both bear never submitted to\r\ninsult, and shall not in my person be exposed to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remind me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, with one of his blackest looks, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\r\nwas dishonoured in my person!--and you remind me also by whom! Do you\r\nthink I have forgotten the evening at Osbaldistone Hall when you cheaply\r\nand with impunity played the bully at my expense? For that insult--never\r\nto be washed out but by blood!--for the various times you have crossed my\r\npath, and always to my prejudice--for the persevering folly with which\r\nyou seek to traverse schemes, the importance of which you neither know\r\nnor are capable of estimating,--for all these, sir, you owe me a long\r\naccount, for which there shall come an early day of reckoning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it come when it will,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be willing and ready to\r\nmeet it. Yet you seem to have forgotten the heaviest article--that I had\r\nthe pleasure to aid Miss Vernon's good sense and virtuous feeling in\r\nextricating her from your infamous toils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think his dark eyes flashed actual fire at this home-taunt, and yet his\r\nvoice retained the same calm expressive tone with which he had hitherto\r\nconducted the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had other views with respect to you, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer: \xe2\x80\x9cless\r\nhazardous for you, and more suitable to my present character and former\r\neducation. But I see you will draw on yourself the personal chastisement\r\nyour boyish insolence so well merits. Follow me to a more remote spot,\r\nwhere we are less likely to be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed him accordingly, keeping a strict eye on his motions, for I\r\nbelieved him capable of the very worst actions. We reached an open spot\r\nin a sort of wilderness, laid out in the Dutch taste, with clipped\r\nhedges, and one or two statues. I was on my guard, and it was well with\r\nme that I was so; for Rashleigh's sword was out and at my breast ere I\r\ncould throw down my cloak, or get my weapon unsheathed, so that I only\r\nsaved my life by springing a pace or two backwards. He had some advantage\r\nin the difference of our weapons; for his sword, as I recollect, was\r\nlonger than mine, and had one of those bayonet or three-cornered blades\r\nwhich are now generally worn; whereas mine was what we then called a\r\nSaxon blade--narrow, flat, and two-edged, and scarcely so manageable as\r\nthat of my enemy. In other respects we were pretty equally matched: for\r\nwhat advantage I might possess in superior address and agility, was fully\r\ncounterbalanced by Rashleigh's great strength and coolness. He fought,\r\nindeed, more like a fiend than a man--with concentrated spite and desire\r\nof blood, only allayed by that cool consideration which made his worst\r\nactions appear yet worse from the air of deliberate premeditation which\r\nseemed to accompany them. His obvious malignity of purpose never for a\r\nmoment threw him off his guard, and he exhausted every feint and\r\nstratagem proper to the science of defence; while, at the same time, he\r\nmeditated the most desperate catastrophe to our rencounter.\r\n\r\nOn my part, the combat was at first sustained with more moderation. My\r\npassions, though hasty, were not malevolent; and the walk of two or three\r\nminutes' space gave me time to reflect that Rashleigh was my father's\r\nnephew, the son of an uncle, who after his fashion had been kind to me,\r\nand that his falling by my hand could not but occasion much family\r\ndistress. My first resolution, therefore, was to attempt to disarm my\r\nantagonist--a manoeuvre in which, confiding in my superiority of skill\r\nand practice, I anticipated little difficulty. I found, however, I had\r\nmet my match; and one or two foils which I received, and from the\r\nconsequences of which I narrowly escaped, obliged me to observe more\r\ncaution in my mode of fighting. By degrees I became exasperated at the\r\nrancour with which Rashleigh sought my life, and returned his passes with\r\nan inveteracy resembling in some degree his own; so that the combat had\r\nall the appearance of being destined to have a tragic issue. That issue\r\nhad nearly taken place at my expense. My foot slipped in a full lounge\r\nwhich I made at my adversary, and I could not so far recover myself as\r\ncompletely to parry the thrust with which my pass was repaid. Yet it took\r\nbut partial effect, running through my waistcoat, grazing my ribs, and\r\npassing through my coat behind. The hilt of Rashleigh's sword, so great\r\nwas the vigour of his thrust, struck against my breast with such force as\r\nto give me great pain, and confirm me in the momentary belief that I was\r\nmortally wounded. Eager for revenge, I grappled with my enemy, seizing\r\nwith my left hand the hilt of his sword, and shortening my own with the\r\npurpose of running him through the body. Our death-grapple was\r\ninterrupted by a man who forcibly threw himself between us, and pushing\r\nus separate from each other, exclaimed, in a loud and commanding voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the sons of those fathers who sucked the same breast shedding each\r\nothers bluid as it were strangers'!--By the hand of my father, I will\r\ncleave to the brisket the first man that mints another stroke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked up in astonishment. The speaker was no other than Campbell. He\r\nhad a basket-hilted broadsword drawn in his hand, which he made to\r\nwhistle around his head as he spoke, as if for the purpose of enforcing\r\nhis mediation. Rashleigh and I stared in silence at this unexpected\r\nintruder, who proceeded to exhort us alternately:--\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Maister\r\nFrancis, opine that ye will re-establish your father's credit by cutting\r\nyour kinsman's thrapple, or getting your ain sneckit instead thereof in\r\nthe College-yards of Glasgow?--Or do you, Mr Rashleigh, think men will\r\ntrust their lives and fortunes wi' ane, that, when in point of trust and\r\nin point of confidence wi' a great political interest, gangs about\r\nbrawling like a drunken gillie?--Nay, never look gash or grim at me,\r\nman--if ye're angry, ye ken how to turn the buckle o' your belt behind\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou presume on my present situation,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rashleigh, \xe2\x80\x9cor you would\r\nhave hardly dared to interfere where my honour is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rob Roy Parting the Duelists--100]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout! tout! tout!--Presume? And what for should it be presuming?--Ye may\r\nbe the richer man, Mr. Osbaldistone, as is maist likely; and ye may be\r\nthe mair learned man, whilk I dispute not: but I reckon ye are neither a\r\nprettier man nor a better gentleman than mysell--and it will be news to\r\nme when I hear ye are as gude. And _dare_ too? Muckle daring there's\r\nabout it--I trow, here I stand, that hae slashed as het a haggis as ony\r\no' the twa o' ye, and thought nae muckle o' my morning's wark when it was\r\ndune. If my foot were on the heather as it's on the causeway, or this\r\npickle gravel, that's little better, I hae been waur mistrysted than if I\r\nwere set to gie ye baith your ser'ing o't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh had by this time recovered his temper completely. \xe2\x80\x9cMy kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill acknowledge he forced this quarrel on me. It was none of\r\nmy seeking. I am glad we are interrupted before I chastised his\r\nforwardness more severely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre ye hurt, lad?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Campbell of me, with some appearance of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very slight scratch,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich my kind cousin would not long\r\nhave boasted of had not you come between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn troth, and that's true, Maister Rashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\ncauld iron and your best bluid were like to hae become acquaint when I\r\nmastered Mr. Frank's right hand. But never look like a sow playing upon a\r\ntrump for the luve of that, man--come and walk wi' me. I hae news to tell\r\nye, and ye'll cool and come to yourself, like MacGibbon's crowdy, when he\r\nset it out at the window-bole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYour intentions have seemed friendly to me on\r\nmore occasions than one; but I must not, and will not, quit sight of this\r\nperson until he yields up to me those means of doing justice to my\r\nfather's engagements, of which he has treacherously possessed himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe're daft, man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Campbell; \xe2\x80\x9cit will serve ye naething to follow\r\nus e'enow; ye hae just enow o' ae man--wad ye bring twa on your head, and\r\nmight bide quiet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cif it be necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laid my hand on Rashleigh's collar, who made no resistance, but said,\r\nwith a sort of scornful smile, \xe2\x80\x9cYou hear him, MacGregor! he rushes on his\r\nfate--will it be my fault if he falls into it?--The warrants are by this\r\ntime ready, and all is prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman was obviously embarrassed. He looked around, and before,\r\nand behind him, and then said--\xe2\x80\x9cThe ne'er a bit will I yield my consent\r\nto his being ill-guided for standing up for the father that got him--and\r\nI gie God's malison and mine to a' sort o' magistrates, justices,\r\nbailies., sheriffs, sheriff-officers, constables, and sic-like black\r\ncattle, that hae been the plagues o' puir auld Scotland this hunder\r\nyear.--it was a merry warld when every man held his ain gear wi' his ain\r\ngrip, and when the country side wasna fashed wi' warrants and poindings\r\nand apprizings, and a' that cheatry craft. And ance mair I say it, my\r\nconscience winna see this puir thoughtless lad ill-guided, and especially\r\nwi' that sort o' trade. I wad rather ye fell till't again, and fought it\r\nout like douce honest men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour conscience, MacGregor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh; \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget how long you\r\nand I have known each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Campbell, or MacGregor, or whatever was\r\nhis name; \xe2\x80\x9cI hae such a thing about me, Maister Osbaldistone; and therein\r\nit may weel chance that I hae the better o' you. As to our knowledge of\r\neach other,--if ye ken what I am, ye ken what usage it was made me what I\r\nam; and, whatever you may think, I would not change states with the\r\nproudest of the oppressors that hae driven me to tak the heather-bush for\r\na beild. What _you_ are, Maister Rashleigh, and what excuse ye hae for\r\nbeing _what_ you are, is between your ain heart and the lang day.--And\r\nnow, Maister Francis, let go his collar; for he says truly, that ye are\r\nin mair danger from a magistrate than he is, and were your cause as\r\nstraight as an arrow, he wad find a way to put you wrang--So let go his\r\ncraig, as I was saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seconded his words with an effort so sudden and unexpected, that he\r\nfreed Rashleigh from my hold, and securing me, notwithstanding my\r\nstruggles, in his own Herculean gripe, he called out--\xe2\x80\x9cTake the bent, Mr.\r\nRashleigh--Make ae pair o' legs worth twa pair o' hands; ye hae dune that\r\nbefore now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may thank this gentleman, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, \xe2\x80\x9cif I leave any\r\npart of my debt to you unpaid; and if I quit you now, it is only in the\r\nhope we shall soon meet again without the possibility of interruption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up his sword, wiped it, sheathed it, and was lost among the\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman, partly by force, partly by remonstrance, prevented my\r\nfollowing him; indeed I began to be of opinion my doing so would be to\r\nlittle purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I live by bread,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, when, after one or two struggles in\r\nwhich he used much forbearance towards me, he perceived me inclined to\r\nstand quiet, \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw sae daft a callant! I wad hae gien the best man\r\nin the country the breadth o' his back gin he had gien me sic a kemping\r\nas ye hae dune. What wad ye do?--Wad ye follow the wolf to his den? I\r\ntell ye, man, he has the auld trap set for ye--He has got the\r\ncollector-creature Morris to bring up a' the auld story again,\r\nand ye maun look for nae help frae me here, as ye got at Justice\r\nInglewood's;--it isna good for my health to come in the gate o' the\r\nwhigamore bailie bodies. Now gang your ways hame, like a gude\r\nbairn--jouk and let the jaw gae by--Keep out o' sight o' Rashleigh, and\r\nMorris, and that MacVittie animal--Mind the Clachan of Aberfoil, as I\r\nsaid before, and by the word of a gentleman, I wunna see ye wranged. But\r\nkeep a calm sough till we meet again--I maun gae and get Rashleigh out\r\no' the town afore waur comes o't, for the neb o' him's never out o'\r\nmischief--Mind the Clachan of Aberfoil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned upon his heel, and left me to meditate on the singular events\r\nwhich had befallen me. My first care was to adjust my dress and reassume\r\nmy cloak, disposing it so as to conceal the blood which flowed down my\r\nright side. I had scarcely accomplished this, when, the classes of the\r\ncollege being dismissed, the gardens began to be filled with parties of\r\nthe students. I therefore left them as soon as possible; and in my way\r\ntowards Mr. Jarvie's, whose dinner hour was now approaching, I stopped at\r\na small unpretending shop, the sign of which intimated the indweller to\r\nbe Christopher Neilson, surgeon and apothecary. I requested of a little\r\nboy who was pounding some stuff in a mortar, that he would procure me an\r\naudience of this learned pharmacopolist. He opened the door of the back\r\nshop, where I found a lively elderly man, who shook his head\r\nincredulously at some idle account I gave him of having been wounded\r\naccidentally by the button breaking off my antagonist's foil while I was\r\nengaged in a fencing match. When he had applied some lint and somewhat\r\nelse he thought proper to the trifling wound I had received, he\r\nobserved--\xe2\x80\x9cThere never was button on the foil that made this hurt. Ah!\r\nyoung blood! young blood!--But we surgeons are a secret generation--If\r\nit werena for hot blood and ill blood, what wad become of the twa\r\nlearned faculties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith which moral reflection he dismissed me; and I experienced very\r\nlittle pain or inconvenience afterwards from the scratch I had received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n              An iron race the mountain-cliffs maintain,\r\n                  Foes to the gentler genius of the plain.\r\n                                *******\r\n              Who while their rocky ramparts round they see,\r\n                  The rough abode of want and liberty,\r\n              As lawless force from confidence will grow,\r\n                 Insult the plenty of the vales below.\r\n                                                   Gray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made ye sae late?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie, as I entered the dining-parlour\r\nof that honest gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cit is chappit ane the best feek o' five\r\nminutes by-gane. Mattie has been twice at the door wi' the dinner, and\r\nweel for you it was a tup's head, for that canna suffer by delay. A\r\nsheep's head ower muckle boiled is rank poison, as my worthy father used\r\nto say--he likit the lug o' ane weel, honest man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made a suitable apology for my breach of punctuality, and was soon\r\nseated at table, where Mr. Jarvie presided with great glee and\r\nhospitality, compelling, however, Owen and myself to do rather more\r\njustice to the Scottish dainties with which his board was charged, than\r\nwas quite agreeable to our southern palates. I escaped pretty well, from\r\nhaving those habits of society which enable one to elude this species of\r\nwell-meant persecution. But it was ridiculous enough to see Owen, whose\r\nideas of politeness were more rigorous and formal, and who was willing,\r\nin all acts of lawful compliance, to evince his respect for the friend of\r\nthe firm, eating with rueful complaisance mouthful after mouthful of\r\nsinged wool, and pronouncing it excellent, in a tone in which disgust\r\nalmost overpowered civility.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloth was removed, Mr. Jarvie compounded with his own hands a\r\nvery small bowl of brandy-punch, the first which I had ever the fortune\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe limes,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured us, \xe2\x80\x9cwere from his own little farm yonder-awa\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (indicating the West Indies with a knowing shrug of his shoulders), \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhe had learned the art of composing the liquor from auld Captain\r\nCoffinkey, who acquired it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9c'as maist folk\r\nthought, among the Buccaniers. But it's excellent liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nhelping us round; \xe2\x80\x9cand good ware has aften come frae a wicked market. And\r\nas for Captain Coffinkey, he was a decent man when I kent him, only he\r\nused to swear awfully--But he's dead, and gaen to his account, and I\r\ntrust he's accepted--I trust he's accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe found the liquor exceedingly palatable, and it led to a long\r\nconversation between Owen and our host on the opening which the Union had\r\nafforded to trade between Glasgow and the British Colonies in America and\r\nthe West Indies, and on the facilities which Glasgow possessed of making\r\nup sortable cargoes for that market. Mr. Jarvie answered some objection\r\nwhich Owen made on the difficulty of sorting a cargo for America, without\r\nbuying from England, with vehemence and volubility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na, sir, we stand on our ain bottom--we pickle in our ain\r\npock-neuk--We hae our Stirling serges, Musselburgh stuffs, Aberdeen hose,\r\nEdinburgh shalloons, and the like, for our woollen or worsted goods--and\r\nwe hae linens of a' kinds better and cheaper than you hae in Lunnon\r\nitsell--and we can buy your north o' England wares, as Manchester wares,\r\nSheffield wares, and Newcastle earthenware, as cheap as you can at\r\nLiverpool--And we are making a fair spell at cottons and muslins--Na, na!\r\nlet every herring hing by its ain head, and every sheep by its ain shank,\r\nand ye'll find, sir, us Glasgow folk no sae far ahint but what we may\r\nfollow.--This is but poor entertainment for you, Mr. Osbaldistone\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (observing that I had been for some time silent); \xe2\x80\x9cbut ye ken cadgers\r\nmaun aye be speaking about cart-saddles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI apologised, alleging the painful circumstances of my own situation, and\r\nthe singular adventures of the morning, as the causes of my abstraction\r\nand absence of mind. In this manner I gained what I sought--an\r\nopportunity of telling my story distinctly and without interruption. I\r\nonly omitted mentioning the wound I had received, which I did not think\r\nworthy of notice. Mr. Jarvie listened with great attention and apparent\r\ninterest, twinkling his little grey eyes, taking snuff, and only\r\ninterrupting me by brief interjections. When I came to the account of the\r\nrencounter, at which Owen folded his hands and cast up his eyes to\r\nHeaven, the very image of woeful surprise, Mr. Jarvie broke in upon the\r\nnarration with \xe2\x80\x9cWrang now--clean wrang--to draw a sword on your kinsman\r\nis inhibited by the laws o' God and man; and to draw a sword on the\r\nstreets of a royal burgh is punishable by fine and imprisonment--and the\r\nCollege-yards are nae better privileged--they should be a place of peace\r\nand quietness, I trow. The College didna get gude L600 a year out o'\r\nbishops' rents (sorrow fa' the brood o' bishops and their rents too!),\r\nnor yet a lease o' the archbishopric o' Glasgow the sell o't, that they\r\nsuld let folk tuilzie in their yards, or the wild callants bicker there\r\nwi' snaw-ba's as they whiles do, that when Mattie and I gae through, we\r\nare fain to make a baik and a bow, or run the risk o' our harns being\r\nknocked out--it suld be looked to.*--But come awa'wi' your tale--what\r\nfell neist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* The boys in Scotland used formerly to make a sort of Saturnalia in a\r\nsnow-storm, by pelting passengers with snowballs. But those exposed to\r\nthat annoyance were excused from it on the easy penalty of a baik\r\n(courtesy) from a female, or a bow from a man. It was only the refractory\r\nwho underwent the storm.\r\n\r\nOn my mentioning the appearance of Mr. Campbell, Jarvie arose in great\r\nsurprise, and paced the room, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cRobin again!--Robert's\r\nmad--clean wud, and waur--Rob will be hanged, and disgrace a' his\r\nkindred, and that will be seen and heard tell o'. My father the deacon\r\nwrought him his first hose--Od, I am thinking Deacon Threeplie, the\r\nrape-spinner, will be twisting his last cravat. Ay, ay, puir Robin is in\r\na fair way o' being hanged--But come awa', come awa'--let's hear the\r\nlave o't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told the whole story as pointedly as I could; but Mr. Jarvie still\r\nfound something lacking to make it clear, until I went back, though with\r\nconsiderable reluctance, on the whole story of Morris, and of my meeting\r\nwith Campbell at the house of Justice Inglewood. Mr. Jarvie inclined a\r\nserious ear to all this, and remained silent for some time after I had\r\nfinished my narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon all these matters I am now to ask your advice, Mr. Jarvie, which, I\r\nhave no doubt, will point out the best way to act for my father's\r\nadvantage and my own honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe're right, young man--ye're right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie. \xe2\x80\x9cAye take the\r\ncounsel of those who are aulder and wiser than yourself, and binna like\r\nthe godless Rehoboam, who took the advice o' a wheen beardless callants,\r\nneglecting the auld counsellors who had sate at the feet o' his father\r\nSolomon, and, as it was weel put by Mr. Meiklejohn, in his lecture on the\r\nchapter, were doubtless partakers of his sapience. But I maun hear\r\nnaething about honour--we ken naething here but about credit. Honour is a\r\nhomicide and a bloodspiller, that gangs about making frays in the street;\r\nbut Credit is a decent honest man, that sits at hame and makes the pat\r\nplay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly, Mr. Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d said our friend Owen, \xe2\x80\x9ccredit is the sum total;\r\nand if we can but save that, at whatever discount\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are right, Mr. Owen--ye are right; ye speak weel and wisely; and I\r\ntrust bowls will row right, though they are a wee ajee e'enow. But\r\ntouching Robin, I am of opinion he will befriend this young man if it is\r\nin his power. He has a gude heart, puir Robin; and though I lost a matter\r\no' twa hundred punds wi' his former engagements, and haena muckle\r\nexpectation ever to see back my thousand punds Scots that he promises me\r\ne'enow, yet I will never say but what Robin means fair by men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am then to consider him,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cas an honest man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jarvie, with a precautionary sort of cough--\xe2\x80\x9cAy, he has a\r\nkind o' Hieland honesty--he's honest after a sort, as they say. My father\r\nthe deacon used aye to laugh when he tauld me how that by-word came up.\r\nAne Captain Costlett was cracking crouse about his loyalty to King\r\nCharles, and Clerk Pettigrew (ye'll hae heard mony a tale about him)\r\nasked him after what manner he served the king, when he was fighting\r\nagain him at Wor'ster in Cromwell's army; and Captain Costlett was a\r\nready body, and said that he served him _after a sort._ My honest father\r\nused to laugh weel at that sport--and sae the by-word came up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you think,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this man will be able to serve me after\r\na sort, or should I trust myself to this place of rendezvous which he has\r\ngiven me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly and fairly, it's worth trying. Ye see yourself there's some risk\r\nin your staying here. This bit body Morris has gotten a custom-house\r\nplace doun at Greenock--that's a port on the Firth doun by here; and tho'\r\na' the world kens him to be but a twa-leggit creature, wi' a goose's head\r\nand a hen's heart, that goes about on the quay plaguing folk about\r\npermits, and cockits, and dockits, and a' that vexatious trade, yet if he\r\nlodge an information--ou, nae doubt a man in magisterial duty maun attend\r\nto it, and ye might come to be clapped up between four wa's, whilk wad be\r\nill-convenient to your father's affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed; \xe2\x80\x9cyet what service am I likely to render him by\r\nleaving Glasgow, which, it is probable, will be the principal scene of\r\nRashleigh's machinations, and committing myself to the doubtful faith of\r\na man of whom I know little but that he fears justice, and has doubtless\r\ngood reasons for doing so; and that, for some secret, and probably\r\ndangerous purpose, he is in close league and alliance with the very\r\nperson who is like to be the author of our ruin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but ye judge Rob hardly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cye judge him hardly,\r\npuir chield; and the truth is, that ye ken naething about our hill\r\ncountry, or Hielands, as we ca' them. They are clean anither set frae the\r\nlike o' huz;--there's nae bailie-courts amang them--nae magistrates that\r\ndinna bear the sword in vain, like the worthy deacon that's awa', and, I\r\nmay say't, like mysell and other present magistrates in this city--But\r\nit's just the laird's command, and the loon maun loup; and the never\r\nanother law hae they but the length o' their dirks--the broadsword's\r\npursuer, or plaintiff, as you Englishers ca' it, and the target is\r\ndefender; the stoutest head bears langest out;--and there's a Hieland\r\nplea for ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOwen groaned deeply; and I allow that the description did not greatly\r\nincrease my desire to trust myself in a country so lawless as he\r\ndescribed these Scottish mountains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jarvie, \xe2\x80\x9cwe speak little o' thae things, because they\r\nare familiar to oursells; and where's the use o' vilifying ane's country,\r\nand bringing a discredit on ane's kin, before southrons and strangers?\r\nIt's an ill bird that files its ain nest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, but as it is no impertinent curiosity of mine, but real\r\nnecessity, that obliges me to make these inquiries, I hope you will not\r\nbe offended at my pressing for a little farther information. I have to\r\ndeal, on my father's account, with several gentlemen of these wild\r\ncountries, and I must trust your good sense and experience for the\r\nrequisite lights upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis little morsel of flattery was not thrown out in vain. \xe2\x80\x9cExperience!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the Bailie--\xe2\x80\x9cI hae had experience, nae doubt, and I hae made some\r\ncalculations--Ay, and to speak quietly amang oursells, I hae made some\r\nperquisitions through Andrew Wylie, my auld clerk; he's wi' MacVittie &\r\nCo. now--but he whiles drinks a gill on the Saturday afternoons wi' his\r\nauld master. And since ye say ye are willing to be guided by the Glasgow\r\nweaver-body's advice, I am no the man that will refuse it to the son of\r\nan auld correspondent, and my father the deacon was nane sic afore me. I\r\nhave whiles thought o' letting my lights burn before the Duke of Argyle,\r\nor his brother Lord Ilay (for wherefore should they be hidden under a\r\nbushel?), but the like o' thae grit men wadna mind the like o' me, a puir\r\nwabster body--they think mair o' wha says a thing, than o' what the thing\r\nis that's said. The mair's the pity--mair's the pity. Not that I wad\r\nspeak ony ill of this MacCallum More--'Curse not the rich in your\r\nbedchamber,' saith the son of Sirach, 'for a bird of the air shall carry\r\nthe clatter, and pint-stoups hae lang lugs.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI interrupted these prolegomena, in which Mr. Jarvie was apt to be\r\nsomewhat diffuse, by praying him to rely upon Mr. Owen and myself as\r\nperfectly secret and safe confidants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's no for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I fear nae man--what for suld I?--I\r\nspeak nae treason--Only thae Hielandmen hae lang grips, and I whiles gang\r\na wee bit up the glens to see some auld kinsfolks, and I wadna willingly\r\nbe in bad blude wi' ony o' their clans. Howsumever, to proceed--ye maun\r\nunderstand I found my remarks on figures, whilk as Mr. Owen here weel\r\nkens, is the only true demonstrable root of human knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOwen readily assented to a proposition so much in his own way, and our\r\norator proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese Hielands of ours, as we ca' them, gentlemen, are but a wild kind\r\nof warld by themsells, full of heights and howes, woods, caverns, lochs,\r\nrivers, and mountains, that it wad tire the very deevil's wings to flee\r\nto the tap o' them. And in this country, and in the isles, whilk are\r\nlittle better, or, to speak the truth, rather waur than the mainland,\r\nthere are about twa hunder and thirty parochines, including the Orkneys,\r\nwhere, whether they speak Gaelic or no I wotna, but they are an\r\nuncivilised people. Now, sirs, I sall haud ilk parochine at the moderate\r\nestimate of eight hunder examinable persons, deducting children under\r\nnine years of age, and then adding one-fifth to stand for bairns of nine\r\nyears auld, and under, the whole population will reach to the sum of--let\r\nus add one-fifth to 800 to be the multiplier, and 230 being the\r\nmultiplicand\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe product,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Owen, who entered delightedly into these\r\nstatistics of Mr. Jarvie, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be 230,000.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, sir--perfectly right; and the military array of this Hieland\r\ncountry, were a' the men-folk between aughteen and fifty-six brought out\r\nthat could bear arms, couldna come weel short of fifty-seven thousand\r\nfive hundred men. Now, sir, it's a sad and awfu' truth, that there is\r\nneither wark, nor the very fashion nor appearance of wark, for the tae\r\nhalf of thae puir creatures; that is to say, that the agriculture, the\r\npasturage, the fisheries, and every species of honest industry about the\r\ncountry, cannot employ the one moiety of the population, let them work as\r\nlazily as they like, and they do work as if a pleugh or a spade burnt\r\ntheir fingers. Aweel, sir, this moiety of unemployed bodies, amounting\r\nto\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo one hundred and fifteen thousand souls,\xe2\x80\x9d said Owen, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing the half\r\nof the above product.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe hae't, Mr. Owen--ye hae't--whereof there may be twenty-eight thousand\r\nseven hundred able-bodied gillies fit to bear arms, and that do bear\r\narms, and will touch or look at nae honest means of livelihood even if\r\nthey could get it--which, lack-a-day! they cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jarvie, that this can be a just\r\npicture of so large a portion of the island of Britain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I'll make it as plain as Peter Pasley's pike-staff. I will allow\r\nthat ilk parochine, on an average, employs fifty pleughs, whilk is a\r\ngreat proportion in sic miserable soil as thae creatures hae to labour,\r\nand that there may be pasture enough for pleugh-horses, and owsen, and\r\nforty or fifty cows; now, to take care o' the pleughs and cattle, we'se\r\nallow seventy-five families of six lives in ilk family, and we'se add\r\nfifty mair to make even numbers, and ye hae five hundred souls, the tae\r\nhalf o' the population, employed and maintained in a sort o' fashion, wi'\r\nsome chance of sour-milk and crowdie; but I wad be glad to ken what the\r\nother five hunder are to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of God!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat _do_ they do, Mr. Jarvie? It makes me\r\nshudder to think of their situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cye wad maybe shudder mair if ye were living\r\nnear hand them. For, admitting that the tae half of them may make some\r\nlittle thing for themsells honestly in the Lowlands by shearing in harst,\r\ndroving, hay-making, and the like; ye hae still mony hundreds and\r\nthousands o' lang-legged Hieland gillies that will neither work nor want,\r\nand maun gang thigging and sorning* about on their acquaintance, or live\r\nby doing the laird's bidding, be't right or be't wrang.\r\n\r\n* _Thigging_ and _sorning_ was a kind of genteel begging, or rather\r\nsomething between begging and robbing, by which the needy in Scotland\r\nused to extort cattle, or the means of subsistence, from those who had\r\nany to give.\r\n\r\nAnd mair especially, mony hundreds o' them come down to the borders of\r\nthe low country, where there's gear to grip, and live by stealing,\r\nreiving, lifting cows, and the like depredations--a thing deplorable in\r\nony Christian country!--the mair especially, that they take pride in it,\r\nand reckon driving a spreagh (whilk is, in plain Scotch, stealing a herd\r\nof nowte) a gallant, manly action, and mair befitting of pretty* men (as\r\nsic reivers will ca' themselves), than to win a day's wage by ony honest\r\nthrift.\r\n\r\n* The word _pretty_ is or was used in Scotch, in the sense of the German\r\n_prachtig,_ and meant a gallant, alert fellow, prompt and ready at his\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nAnd the lairds are as bad as the loons; for if they dinna bid them gae\r\nreive and harry, the deil a bit they forbid them; and they shelter them,\r\nor let them shelter themselves, in their woods and mountains, and\r\nstrongholds, whenever the thing's dune. And every ane o' them will\r\nmaintain as mony o' his ane name, or his clan, as we say, as he can rap\r\nand rend means for; or, whilk's the same thing, as mony as can in ony\r\nfashion, fair or foul, mainteen themsells. And there they are wi' gun and\r\npistol, dirk and dourlach, ready to disturb the peace o' the country\r\nwhenever the laird likes; and that's the grievance of the Hielands, whilk\r\nare, and hae been for this thousand years by-past, a bike o' the maist\r\nlawless unchristian limmers that ever disturbed a douce, quiet,\r\nGod-fearing neighbourhood, like this o' ours in the west here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this kinsman of yours, and friend of mine, is he one of those great\r\nproprietors who maintain the household troops you speak of?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bailie Jarvie; \xe2\x80\x9che's nane o' your great grandees o'\r\nchiefs, as they ca' them, neither. Though he is weel born, and lineally\r\ndescended frae auld Glenstrae--I ken his lineage--indeed he is a near\r\nkinsman, and, as I said, of gude gentle Hieland blude, though ye may\r\nthink weel that I care little about that nonsense--it's a' moonshine in\r\nwater--waste threads and thrums, as we say--But I could show ye letters\r\nfrae his father, that was the third aff Glenstrae, to my father Deacon\r\nJarvie (peace be wi' his memory!) beginning, Dear Deacon, and ending,\r\nyour loving kinsman to command,--they are amaist a' about borrowed\r\nsiller, sae the gude deacon, that's dead and gane, keepit them as\r\ndocuments and evidents--He was a carefu' man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he is not,\xe2\x80\x9d I resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cone of their chiefs or patriarchal\r\nleaders, whom I have heard my father talk of, this kinsman of yours has,\r\nat least, much to say in the Highlands, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may say that--nae name better ken'd between the Lennox and\r\nBreadalbane. Robin was ance a weel-doing, painstaking drover, as ye wad\r\nsee amang ten thousand--It was a pleasure to see him in his belted plaid\r\nand brogues, wi' his target at his back, and claymore and dirk at his\r\nbelt, following a hundred Highland stots, and a dozen o' the gillies, as\r\nrough and ragged as the beasts they drave. And he was baith civil and\r\njust in his dealings; and if he thought his chapman had made a hard\r\nbargain, he wad gie him a luck-penny to the mends. I hae ken'd him gie\r\nback five shillings out o' the pund sterling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five per cent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Owen--\xe2\x80\x9ca heavy discount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wad gie it though, sir, as I tell ye; mair especially if he thought\r\nthe buyer was a puir man, and couldna stand by a loss. But the times cam\r\nhard, and Rob was venturesome. It wasna my faut--it wasna my faut; he\r\ncanna wyte me--I aye tauld him o't--And the creditors, mair especially\r\nsome grit neighbours o' his, gripped to his living and land; and they say\r\nhis wife was turned out o' the house to the hill-side, and sair misguided\r\nto the boot. Shamefu'! shamefu'!--I am a peacefu' man and a magistrate,\r\nbut if ony ane had guided sae muckle as my servant quean, Mattie, as it's\r\nlike they guided Rob's wife, I think it suld hae set the shabble* that my\r\nfather the deacon had at Bothwell brig a-walking again.\r\n\r\n* Cutlass.\r\n\r\nWeel, Rob cam hame, and fand desolation, God pity us! where he left\r\nplenty; he looked east, west, south, north, and saw neither hauld nor\r\nhope--neither beild nor shelter; sae he e'en pu'd the bonnet ower his\r\nbrow, belted the broadsword to his side, took to the brae-side, and\r\nbecame a broken man.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* An outlaw.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the good citizen was broken by his contending feelings. He\r\nobviously, while he professed to contemn the pedigree of his Highland\r\nkinsman, attached a secret feeling of consequence to the connection, and\r\nhe spoke of his friend in his prosperity with an overflow of affection,\r\nwhich deepened his sympathy for his misfortunes, and his regret for their\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus tempted and urged by despair,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, seeing Mr. Jarvie did not\r\nproceed in his narrative, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose your kinsman became one of those\r\ndepredators you have described to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sae bad as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Glaswegian,--\xe2\x80\x9cno a'thegither and outright\r\nsae bad as that; but he became a levier of black-mail, wider and farther\r\nthan ever it was raised in our day, a through the Lennox and Menteith,\r\nand up to the gates o' Stirling Castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack-mail?--I do not understand the phrase,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, ye see, Rob soon gathered an unco band o' blue-bonnets at his back,\r\nfor he comes o' a rough name when he's kent by his ain, and a name that's\r\nheld its ain for mony a lang year, baith again king and parliament, and\r\nkirk too, for aught I ken--an auld and honourable name, for as sair as it\r\nhas been worried and hadden down and oppressed. My mother was a\r\nMacGregor--I carena wha kens it--And Rob had soon a gallant band; and as\r\nit grieved him (he said) to see sic _hership_ and waste and depredation\r\nto the south o' the Hieland line, why, if ony heritor or farmer wad pay\r\nhim four punds Scots out of each hundred punds of valued rent, whilk\r\nwas doubtless a moderate consideration, Rob engaged to keep them\r\nscaithless;--let them send to him if they lost sae muckle as a single\r\ncloot by thieving, and Rob engaged to get them again, or pay the\r\nvalue--and he aye keepit his word--I canna deny but he keepit his\r\nword--a' men allow Rob keeps his word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very singular contract of assurance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's clean again our statute law, that must be owned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jarvie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cclean again law; the levying and the paying black-mail are baith\r\npunishable: but if the law canna protect my barn and byre, whatfor suld I\r\nno engage wi' a Hieland gentleman that can?--answer me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jarvie, is this contract of black-mail, as you call\r\nit, completely voluntary on the part of the landlord or farmer who pays\r\nthe insurance? or what usually happens, in case any one refuses payment\r\nof this tribute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha, lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, laughing, and putting his finger to his\r\nnose, \xe2\x80\x9cye think ye hae me there. Troth, I wad advise ony friends o' mine\r\nto gree wi' Rob; for, watch as they like, and do what they like, they are\r\nsair apt to be harried* when the lang nights come on.\r\n\r\n* Plundered.\r\n\r\nSome o' the Grahame and Cohoon gentry stood out; but what then?--they\r\nlost their haill stock the first winter; sae maist folks now think it\r\nbest to come into Rob's terms. He's easy wi' a' body that will be easy\r\nwi' him; but if ye thraw him, ye had better thraw the deevil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by his exploits in these vocations,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he has\r\nrendered himself amenable to the laws of the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmenable?--ye may say that; his craig wad ken the weight o' his hurdies\r\nif they could get haud o' Rob. But he has gude friends amang the grit\r\nfolks; and I could tell ye o' ae grit family that keeps him up as far as\r\nthey decently can, to be a them in the side of another. And then he's sic\r\nan auld-farran lang-headed chield as never took up the trade o' cateran\r\nin our time; mony a daft reik he has played--mair than wad fill a book,\r\nand a queer ane it wad be--as gude as Robin Hood, or William Wallace--a'\r\nfu' o' venturesome deeds and escapes, sic as folk tell ower at a winter\r\ningle in the daft days. It's a queer thing o' me, gentlemen, that am a\r\nman o' peace mysell, and a peacefu man's son--for the deacon my father\r\nquarrelled wi' nane out o the town-council--it's a queer thing, I say,\r\nbut I think the Hieland blude o' me warms at thae daft tales, and whiles\r\nI like better to hear them than a word o' profit, gude forgie me! But\r\nthey are vanities--sinfu' vanities--and, moreover, again the statute\r\nlaw--again the statute and gospel law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI now followed up my investigation, by inquiring what means of influence\r\nthis Mr. Robert Campbell could possibly possess over my affairs, or those\r\nof my father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ye are to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie in a very subdued tone--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nspeak amang friends, and under the rose--Ye are to understand, that the\r\nHielands hae been keepit quiet since the year aughty-nine--that was\r\nKilliecrankie year. But how hae they been keepit quiet, think ye? By\r\nsiller, Mr. Owen--by siller, Mr. Osbaldistone. King William caused\r\nBreadalbane distribute twenty thousand oude punds sterling amang them,\r\nand it's said the auld Hieland Earl keepit a lang lug o't in his ain\r\nsporran. And then Queen Anne, that's dead, gae the chiefs bits o'\r\npensions, sae they had wherewith to support their gillies and caterans\r\nthat work nae wark, as I said afore; and they lay by quiet eneugh, saying\r\nsome spreagherie on the Lowlands, whilk is their use and wont, and some\r\ncutting o' thrapples amang themsells, that nae civilised body kens or\r\ncares onything anent.--Weel, but there's a new warld come up wi' this\r\nKing George (I say, God bless him, for ane)--there's neither like to be\r\nsiller nor pensions gaun amang them; they haena the means o' mainteening\r\nthe clans that eat them up, as ye may guess frae what I said before;\r\ntheir credit's gane in the Lowlands; and a man that can whistle ye up a\r\nthousand or feifteen hundred linking lads to do his will, wad hardly get\r\nfifty punds on his band at the Cross o' Glasgow--This canna stand\r\nlang--there will be an outbreak for the Stuarts--there will be an\r\noutbreak--they will come down on the low country like a flood, as they\r\ndid in the waefu' wars o' Montrose, and that will be seen and heard tell\r\no' ere a twalmonth gangs round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet still,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not see how this concerns Mr. Campbell, much\r\nless my father's affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob can levy five hundred men, sir, and therefore war suld concern him\r\nas muckle as maist folk,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is a faculty that\r\nis far less profitable in time o' peace. Then, to tell ye the truth, I\r\ndoubt he has been the prime agent between some o' our Hieland chiefs and\r\nthe gentlemen in the north o' England. We a' heard o' the public money\r\nthat was taen frae the chield Morris somewhere about the fit o' Cheviot\r\nby Rob and ane o' the Osbaldistone lads; and, to tell ye the truth, word\r\ngaed that it was yoursell Mr. Francis,--and sorry was I that your\r\nfather's son suld hae taen to sic practices--Na, ye needna say a word\r\nabout it--I see weel I was mistaen; but I wad believe onything o' a\r\nstage-player, whilk I concluded ye to be. But now, I doubtna, it has been\r\nRashleigh himself or some other o' your cousins--they are a' tarred wi'\r\nthe same stick--rank Jacobites and papists, and wad think the government\r\nsiller and government papers lawfu' prize. And the creature Morris is sic\r\na cowardly caitiff, that to this hour he daurna say that it was Rob took\r\nthe portmanteau aff him; and troth he's right, for your custom-house and\r\nexcise cattle are ill liket on a' sides, and Rob might get a back-handed\r\nlick at him, before the Board, as they ca't, could help him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have long suspected this, Mr. Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand perfectly agree\r\nwith you. But as to my father's affairs\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspected it?--it's certain--it's certain--I ken them that saw some of\r\nthe papers that were taen aff Morris--it's needless to say where. But to\r\nyour father's affairs--Ye maun think that in thae twenty years by-gane,\r\nsome o' the Hieland lairds and chiefs hae come to some sma' sense o'\r\ntheir ain interest--your father and others hae bought the woods of\r\nGlen-Disseries, Glen Kissoch, Tober-na-Kippoch, and mony mair besides,\r\nand your father's house has granted large bills in payment,--and as the\r\ncredit o' Osbaldistone and Tresham was gude--for I'll say before Mr.\r\nOwen's face, as I wad behind his back, that, bating misfortunes o' the\r\nLord's sending, nae men could be mair honourable in business--the Hieland\r\ngentlemen, holders o' thae bills, hae found credit in Glasgow and\r\nEdinburgh--(I might amaist say in Glasgow wholly, for it's little the\r\npridefu' Edinburgh folk do in real business)--for all, or the greater\r\npart of the contents o' thae bills. So that--Aha! d'ye see me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI confessed I could not quite follow his drift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif these bills are not paid, the Glasgow merchant comes\r\non the Hieland lairds, whae hae deil a boddle o' siller, and will like\r\nill to spew up what is item a' spent--They will turn desperate--five\r\nhundred will rise that might hae sitten at hame--the deil will gae ower\r\nJock Wabster--and the stopping of your father's house will hasten the\r\noutbreak that's been sae lang biding us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, surprised at this singular view of the case,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Rashleigh Osbaldistone has done this injury to my father, merely to\r\naccelerate a rising in the Highlands, by distressing the gentlemen to whom\r\nthese bills were originally granted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless--doubtless--it has been one main reason, Mr. Osbaldistone. I\r\ndoubtna but what the ready money he carried off wi' him might be another.\r\nBut that makes comparatively but a sma' part o' your father's loss,\r\nthough it might make the maist part o' Rashleigh's direct gain. The\r\nassets he carried off are of nae mair use to him than if he were to light\r\nhis pipe wi' them. He tried if MacVittie & Co. wad gie him siller on\r\nthem--that I ken by Andro Wylie--but they were ower auld cats to draw\r\nthat strae afore them--they keepit aff, and gae fair words. Rashleigh\r\nOsbaldistone is better ken'd than trusted in Glasgow, for he was here\r\nabout some jacobitical papistical troking in seventeen hundred and seven,\r\nand left debt ahint him. Na, na--he canna pit aff the paper here; folk\r\nwill misdoubt him how he came by it. Na, na--he'll hae the stuff safe at\r\nsome o' their haulds in the Hielands, and I daur say my cousin Rob could\r\nget at it gin he liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would he be disposed to serve us in this pinch, Mr. Jarvie?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have described him as an agent of the Jacobite party, and deeply\r\nconnected in their intrigues: will he be disposed for my sake, or, if you\r\nplease, for the sake of justice, to make an act of restitution, which,\r\nsupposing it in his power, would, according to your view of the case,\r\nmaterially interfere with their plans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna preceesely speak to that: the grandees among them are doubtfu'\r\no' Rob, and he's doubtfu' o' them.--And he's been weel friended wi' the\r\nArgyle family, wha stand for the present model of government. If he was\r\nfreed o' his hornings and captions, he would rather be on Argyle's side\r\nthan he wad be on Breadalbane's, for there's auld ill-will between the\r\nBreadalbane family and his kin and name. The truth is, that Rob is for\r\nhis ain hand, as Henry Wynd feught*--he'll take the side that suits him\r\nbest; if the deil was laird, Rob wad be for being tenant; and ye canna\r\nblame him, puir fallow, considering his circumstances.\r\n\r\n* Two great clans fought out a quarrel with thirty men of a side, in\r\npresence of the king, on the North Inch of Perth, on or about the year\r\n1392; a man was amissing on one side, whose room was filled by a little\r\nbandy-legged citizen of Perth. This substitute, Henry Wynd--or, as the\r\nHighlanders called him, _Gow Chrom,_ that is, the bandy-legged\r\nsmith--fought well, and contributed greatly to the fate of the battle,\r\nwithout knowing which side he fought on;--so, \xe2\x80\x9cTo fight for your own\r\nhand, like Henry Wynd,\xe2\x80\x9d passed into a proverb. [This incident forms a\r\nconspicuous part of the subsequent novel, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fair Maid of Perth.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there's ae thing sair again ye--Rob has a grey mear in his stable at\r\nhame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA grey mare?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that to the purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wife, man--the wife,--an awfu' wife she is. She downa bide the sight\r\no' a kindly Scot, if he come frae the Lowlands, far less of an Inglisher,\r\nand she'll be keen for a' that can set up King James, and ding down King\r\nGeorge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very singular,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the mercantile transactions of\r\nLondon citizens should become involved with revolutions and rebellions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at a', man--not at a',\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Jarvie; \xe2\x80\x9cthat's a' your silly\r\nprejudications. I read whiles in the lang dark nights, and I hae read in\r\nBaker's Chronicle* that the merchants o'London could gar the Bank of\r\nGenoa break their promise to advance a mighty sum to the King o' Spain,\r\nwhereby the sailing of the Grand Spanish Armada was put aff for a haill\r\nyear--What think you of that, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* [_The Chronicle of the Kings of England,_ by Sir Richard Baker, with\r\ncontinuations, passed through several editions between 1641 and 1733.\r\nWhether any of them contain the passage alluded to is doubtful.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the merchants did their country golden service, which ought to be\r\nhonourably remembered in our histories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think sae too; and they wad do weel, and deserve weal baith o' the\r\nstate and o' humanity, that wad save three or four honest Hieland\r\ngentlemen frae louping heads ower heels into destruction, wi' a' their\r\npuir sackless* followers, just because they canna pay back the siller\r\nthey had reason to count upon as their ain--and save your father's\r\ncredit--and my ain gude siller that Osbaldistone and Tresham awes me into\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\n* Sackless, that is, innocent.\r\n\r\nI say, if ane could manage a' this, I think it suld be done and said unto\r\nhim, even if he were a puir ca'-the-shuttle body, as unto one whom the\r\nking delighteth to honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot pretend to estimate the extent of public gratitude,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut our own thankfulness, Mr. Jarvie, would be commensurate with the\r\nextent of the obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Owen, \xe2\x80\x9cwe would endeavour to balance with a _per\r\ncontra,_ the instant our Mr. Osbaldistone returns from Holland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubtna--I doubtna--he is a very worthy gentleman, and a sponsible,\r\nand wi' some o' my lights might do muckle business in Scotland--Weel,\r\nsir, if these assets could be redeemed out o' the hands o' the\r\nPhilistines, they are gude paper--they are the right stuff when they are\r\nin the right hands, and that's yours, Mr. Owen. And I'se find ye three\r\nmen in Glasgow, for as little as ye may think o' us, Mr. Owen--that's\r\nSandie Steenson in the Trade's-Land, and John Pirie in Candleriggs, and\r\nanother that sall be nameless at this present, sall advance what soums\r\nare sufficient to secure the credit of your house, and seek nae better\r\nsecurity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOwen's eyes sparkled at this prospect of extrication; but his countenance\r\ninstantly fell on recollecting how improbable it was that the recovery of\r\nthe assets, as he technically called them, should be successfully\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna despair, sir--dinna despair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie; \xe2\x80\x9cI hae taen sae\r\nmuckle concern wi' your affairs already, that it maun een be ower shoon\r\nower boots wi' me now. I am just like my father the deacon (praise be wi'\r\nhim!) I canna meddle wi' a friend's business, but I aye end wi' making it\r\nmy ain--Sae, I'll e'en pit on my boots the morn, and be jogging ower\r\nDrymen Muir wi' Mr. Frank here; and if I canna mak Rob hear reason, and\r\nhis wife too, I dinna ken wha can--I hae been a kind freend to them afore\r\nnow, to say naething o' ower-looking him last night, when naming his name\r\nwad hae cost him his life--I'll be hearing o' this in the council maybe\r\nfrae Bailie Grahame and MacVittie, and some o' them. They hae coost up\r\nmy kindred to Rob to me already--set up their nashgabs! I tauld them I\r\nwad vindicate nae man's faults; but set apart what he had done again the\r\nlaw o' the country, and the hership o' the Lennox, and the misfortune o'\r\nsome folk losing life by him, he was an honester man than stood on ony o'\r\ntheir shanks--And whatfor suld I mind their clavers? If Rob is an outlaw,\r\nto himsell be it said--there is nae laws now about reset of\r\ninter-communed persons, as there was in the ill times o' the last\r\nStuarts--I trow I hae a Scotch tongue in my head--if they speak, I'se\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was with great pleasure that I saw the Bailie gradually surmount the\r\nbarriers of caution, under the united influence of public spirit and\r\ngood-natured interest in our affairs, together with his natural wish to\r\navoid loss and acquire gain, and not a little harmless vanity. Through\r\nthe combined operation of these motives, he at length arrived at the\r\ndoughty resolution of taking the field in person, to aid in the recovery\r\nof my father's property. His whole information led me to believe, that if\r\nthe papers were in possession of this Highland adventurer, it might be\r\npossible to induce him to surrender what he could not keep with any\r\nprospect of personal advantage; and I was conscious that the presence of\r\nhis kinsman was likely to have considerable weight with him. I therefore\r\ncheerfully acquiesced in Mr. Jarvie's proposal that we should set out\r\nearly next morning.\r\n\r\nThat honest gentleman was indeed as vivacious and alert in preparing to\r\ncarry his purpose into execution, as he had been slow and cautious in\r\nforming it. He roared to Mattie to \xe2\x80\x9cair his trot-cosey, to have his\r\njack-boots greased and set before the kitchen-fire all night, and to see\r\nthat his beast be corned, and a' his riding gear in order.\xe2\x80\x9d Having agreed\r\nto meet him at five o'clock next morning, and having settled that Owen,\r\nwhose presence could be of no use to us upon this expedition, should\r\nawait our return at Glasgow, we took a kind farewell of this unexpectedly\r\nzealous friend. I installed Owen in an apartment in my lodgings,\r\ncontiguous to my own, and, giving orders to Andrew Fairservice to attend\r\nme next morning at the hour appointed, I retired to rest with better\r\nhopes than it had lately been my fortune to entertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TENTH.\r\n\r\n             Far as the eye could reach no tree was seen,\r\n             Earth, clad in russet, scorned the lively green;\r\n                No birds, except as birds of passage flew;\r\n                No bee was heard to hum, no dove to coo;\r\n                No streams, as amber smooth-as amber clear,\r\n                Were seen to glide, or heard to warble here.\r\n                                             Prophecy of Famine.\r\n\r\nIt was in the bracing atmosphere of a harvest morning, that I met by\r\nappointment Fairservice, with the horses, at the door of Mr. Jarvie's\r\nhouse, which was but little space distant from Mrs. Flyter's hotel. The\r\nfirst matter which caught my attention was, that whatever were the\r\ndeficiencies of the pony which Mr. Fairservice's legal adviser, Clerk\r\nTouthope, generously bestowed upon him in exchange for Thorncliff's mare,\r\nhe had contrived to part with it, and procure in its stead an animal with\r\nso curious and complete a lameness, that it seemed only to make use of\r\nthree legs for the purpose of progression, while the fourth appeared as\r\nif meant to be flourished in the air by way of accompaniment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou mean by bringing such a creature as that here, sir? and where is the\r\npony you rode to Glasgow upon?\xe2\x80\x9d were my very natural and impatient\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sell't it, sir. It was a slink beast, and wad hae eaten its head aff,\r\nstanding at Luckie Flyter's at livery. And I hae bought this on your\r\nhonour's account. It's a grand bargain--cost but a pund sterling the\r\nfoot--that's four a'thegither. The stringhalt will gae aff when it's gaen\r\na mile; it's a weel-ken'd ganger; they call it Souple Tam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my soul, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will never rest till my supple-jack and\r\nyour shoulders become acquainted. If you do not go instantly and procure\r\nthe other brute, you shall pay the penalty of your ingenuity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrew, notwithstanding my threats, continued to battle the point, as he\r\nsaid it would cost him a guinea of rue-bargain to the man who had bought\r\nhis pony, before he could get it back again. Like a true Englishman,\r\nthough sensible I was duped by the rascal, I was about to pay his\r\nexaction rather than lose time, when forth sallied Mr. Jarvie, cloaked,\r\nmantled, hooded, and booted, as if for a Siberian winter, while two\r\napprentices, under the immediate direction of Mattie, led forth the\r\ndecent ambling steed which had the honour on such occasions to support\r\nthe person of the Glasgow magistrate. Ere he \xe2\x80\x9cclombe to the saddle,\xe2\x80\x9d an\r\nexpression more descriptive of the Bailie's mode of mounting than that of\r\nthe knights-errant to whom Spenser applies it, he inquired the cause of\r\nthe dispute betwixt my servant and me. Having learned the nature of\r\nhonest Andrew's manoeuvre he instantly cut short all debate, by\r\npronouncing, that if Fairservice did not forthwith return the\r\nthree-legged palfrey, and produce the more useful quadruped which he had\r\ndiscarded, he would send him to prison, and amerce him in half his wages.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ccontracted for the service of both your\r\nhorse and you--twa brutes at ance--ye unconscionable rascal!--but I'se\r\nlook weel after you during this journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be nonsense fining me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, doughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat hasna a\r\ngrey groat to pay a fine wi'--it's ill taking the breeks aff a\r\nHielandman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye hae nae purse to fine, ye hae flesh to pine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I will look weel to ye getting your deserts the tae way or the\r\ntither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the commands of Mr. Jarvie, therefore, Andrew was compelled to submit,\r\nonly muttering between his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cOwer mony maisters,--ower mony\r\nmaisters, as the paddock said to the harrow, when every tooth gae her a\r\ntig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently he found no difficulty in getting rid of Supple Tam, and\r\nrecovering possession of his former Bucephalus, for he accomplished the\r\nexchange without being many minutes absent; nor did I hear further of his\r\nhaving paid any smart-money for breach of bargain.\r\n\r\nWe now set forward, but had not reached the top of the street in which\r\nMr. Jarvie dwelt, when a loud hallooing and breathless call of \xe2\x80\x9cStop,\r\nstop!\xe2\x80\x9d was heard behind us. We stopped accordingly, and were overtaken by\r\nMr. Jarvie's two lads, who bore two parting tokens of Mattie's care for\r\nher master. The first was conveyed in the form of a voluminous silk\r\nhandkerchief, like the mainsail of one of his own West-Indiamen, which\r\nMrs. Mattie particularly desired he would put about his neck, and which,\r\nthus entreated, he added to his other integuments. The second youngster\r\nbrought only a verbal charge (I thought I saw the rogue disposed to laugh\r\nas he delivered it) on the part of the housekeeper, that her master would\r\ntake care of the waters. \xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh! silly hussy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Jarvie;\r\nbut added, turning to me, \xe2\x80\x9cit shows a kind heart though--it shows a kind\r\nheart in sae young a quean--Mattie's a carefu' lass.\xe2\x80\x9d So speaking, he\r\npricked the sides of his palfrey, and we left the town without farther\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nWhile we paced easily forward, by a road which conducted us\r\nnorth-eastward from the town, I had an opportunity to estimate and admire\r\nthe good qualities of my new friend. Although, like my father, he\r\nconsidered commercial transactions the most important objects of human\r\nlife, he was not wedded to them so as to undervalue more general\r\nknowledge. On the contrary, with much oddity and vulgarity of\r\nmanner,--with a vanity which he made much more ridiculous by disguising\r\nit now and then under a thin veil of humility, and devoid as he was of\r\nall the advantages of a learned education, Mr. Jarvie's conversation\r\nshowed tokens of a shrewd, observing, liberal, and, to the extent of its\r\nopportunities, a well-improved mind. He was a good local antiquary, and\r\nentertained me, as we passed along, with an account of remarkable events\r\nwhich had formerly taken place in the scenes through which we passed.\r\nAnd as he was well acquainted with the ancient history of his district,\r\nhe saw with the prospective eye of an enlightened patriot, the buds of\r\nmany of those future advantages which have only blossomed and ripened\r\nwithin these few years. I remarked also, and with great pleasure, that\r\nalthough a keen Scotchman, and abundantly zealous for the honour of his\r\ncountry, he was disposed to think liberally of the sister kingdom. When\r\nAndrew Fairservice (whom, by the way, the Bailie could not abide) chose\r\nto impute the accident of one of the horses casting his shoe to the\r\ndeteriorating influence of the Union, he incurred a severe rebuke from\r\nMr. Jarvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhisht, sir!--whisht! it's ill-scraped tongues like yours, that make\r\nmischief atween neighbourhoods and nations. There's naething sae gude on\r\nthis side o' time but it might hae been better, and that may be said o'\r\nthe Union. Nane were keener against it than the Glasgow folk, wi' their\r\nrabblings and their risings, and their mobs, as they ca' them now-a-days.\r\nBut it's an ill wind blaws naebody gude--Let ilka ane roose the ford as\r\nthey find it--I say let Glasgow flourish! whilk is judiciously and\r\nelegantly putten round the town's arms, by way of by-word.--Now, since\r\nSt. Mungo catched herrings in the Clyde, what was ever like to gar us\r\nflourish like the sugar and tobacco trade? Will onybody tell me that, and\r\ngrumble at the treaty that opened us a road west-awa' yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrew Fairservice was far from acquiescing in these arguments of\r\nexpedience, and even ventured to enter a grumbling protest, \xe2\x80\x9cThat it was\r\nan unco change to hae Scotland's laws made in England; and that, for his\r\nshare, he wadna for a' the herring-barrels in Glasgow, and a' the\r\ntobacco-casks to boot, hae gien up the riding o' the Scots Parliament, or\r\nsent awa' our crown, and our sword, and our sceptre, and Mons Meg,* to be\r\nkeepit by thae English pock-puddings in the Tower o' Lunnon.\r\n\r\n* Note G. Mons Meg.\r\n\r\nWhat wad Sir William Wallace, or auld Davie Lindsay, hae said to the\r\nUnion, or them that made it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe road which we travelled, while diverting the way with these\r\ndiscussions, had become wild and open, as soon as we had left Glasgow a\r\nmile or two behind us, and was growing more dreary as we advanced. Huge\r\ncontinuous heaths spread before, behind, and around us, in hopeless\r\nbarrenness--now level and interspersed with swamps, green with\r\ntreacherous verdure, or sable with turf, or, as they call them in\r\nScotland, peat-bogs,--and now swelling into huge heavy ascents, which\r\nwanted the dignity and form of hills, while they were still more toilsome\r\nto the passenger. There were neither trees nor bushes to relieve the eye\r\nfrom the russet livery of absolute sterility. The very heath was of that\r\nstinted imperfect kind which has little or no flower, and affords the\r\ncoarsest and meanest covering, which, as far as my experience enables me\r\nto judge, mother Earth is ever arrayed in. Living thing we saw none,\r\nexcept occasionally a few straggling sheep of a strange diversity of\r\ncolours, as black, bluish, and orange. The sable hue predominated,\r\nhowever, in their faces and legs. The very birds seemed to shun these\r\nwastes, and no wonder, since they had an easy method of escaping from\r\nthem;--at least I only heard the monotonous and plaintive cries of the\r\nlapwing and curlew, which my companions denominated the peasweep and\r\nwhaup.\r\n\r\nAt dinner, however, which we took about noon, at a most miserable\r\nalehouse, we had the good fortune to find that these tiresome screamers\r\nof the morass were not the only inhabitants of the moors. The goodwife\r\ntold us, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe gudeman had been at the hill;\xe2\x80\x9d and well for us that he\r\nhad been so, for we enjoyed the produce of his _chasse_ in the shape of\r\nsome broiled moor-game,--a dish which gallantly eked out the ewe-milk\r\ncheese, dried salmon, and oaten bread, being all besides that the house\r\nafforded. Some very indifferent two-penny ale, and a glass of excellent\r\nbrandy, crowned our repast; and as our horses had, in the meantime,\r\ndiscussed their corn, we resumed our journey with renovated vigour.\r\n\r\nI had need of all the spirits a good dinner could give, to resist the\r\ndejection which crept insensibly on my mind, when I combined the strange\r\nuncertainty of my errand with the disconsolate aspect of the country\r\nthrough which it was leading me. Our road continued to be, if possible,\r\nmore waste and wild than that we had travelled in the forenoon. The few\r\nmiserable hovels that showed some marks of human habitation, were now of\r\nstill rarer occurrence; and at length, as we began to ascend an\r\nuninterrupted swell of moorland, they totally disappeared. The only\r\nexercise which my imagination received was, when some particular turn of\r\nthe road gave us a partial view, to the left, of a large assemblage of\r\ndark-blue mountains stretching to the north and north-west, which\r\npromised to include within their recesses a country as wild perhaps, but\r\ncertainly differing greatly in point of interest, from that which we now\r\ntravelled. The peaks of this screen of mountains were as wildly varied\r\nand distinguished, as the hills which we had seen on the right were tame\r\nand lumpish; and while I gazed on this Alpine region, I felt a longing to\r\nexplore its recesses, though accompanied with toil and danger, similar to\r\nthat which a sailor feels when he wishes for the risks and animation of a\r\nbattle or a gale, in exchange for the insupportable monotony of a\r\nprotracted calm. I made various inquiries of my friend Mr. Jarvie\r\nrespecting the names and positions of these remarkable mountains; but it\r\nwas a subject on which he had no information, or did not choose to be\r\ncommunicative. \xe2\x80\x9cThey're the Hieland hills--the Hieland hills--Ye'll see\r\nand hear eneugh about them before ye see Glasgow Cross again--I downa\r\nlook at them--I never see them but they gar me grew. It's no for fear--no\r\nfor fear, but just for grief, for the puir blinded half-starved creatures\r\nthat inhabit them--but say nae mair about it--it's ill speaking o'\r\nHielandmen sae near the line. I hae ken'd mony an honest man wadna hae\r\nventured this length without he had made his last will and\r\ntestament--Mattie had ill-will to see me set awa' on this ride, and grat\r\nawee, the sillie tawpie; but it's nae mair ferlie to see a woman greet\r\nthan to see a goose gang barefit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI next attempted to lead the discourse on the character and history of\r\nthe person whom we were going to visit; but on this topic Mr. Jarvie was\r\ntotally inaccessible, owing perhaps in part to the attendance of Mr.\r\nAndrew Fairservice, who chose to keep so close in our rear that his ears\r\ncould not fail to catch every word which was spoken, while his tongue\r\nassumed the freedom of mingling in our conversation as often as he saw an\r\nopportunity. For this he occasionally incurred Mr. Jarvie's reproof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep back, sir, as best sets ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, as Andrew pressed\r\nforward to catch the answer to some question I had asked about Campbell.\r\n--\xe2\x80\x9cye wad fain ride the fore-horse, an ye wist how.--That chield's aye\r\nfor being out o' the cheese-fat he was moulded in.--Now, as for your\r\nquestions, Mr. Osbaldistone, now that chield's out of ear-shot, I'll just\r\ntell you it's free to you to speer, and it's free to me to answer, or\r\nno--Gude I canna say muckle o' Rob, puir chield; ill I winna say o' him,\r\nfor, forby that he's my cousin, we're coming near his ain country, and\r\nthere may be ane o' his gillies ahint every whin-bush, for what I\r\nken--And if ye'll be guided by my advice, the less ye speak about him, or\r\nwhere we are gaun, or what we are gaun to do, we'll be the mair likely to\r\nspeed us in our errand. For it's like we may fa' in wi' some o' his\r\nunfreends--there are e'en ower mony o' them about--and his bonnet sits\r\neven on his brow yet for a' that; but I doubt they'll be upsides wi' Rob\r\nat the last--air day or late day, the fox's hide finds aye the flaying\r\nknife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbe entirely guided by your experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, Mr. Osbaldistone--right. But I maun speak to this gabbling skyte\r\ntoo, for bairns and fules speak at the Cross what they hear at the\r\ningle-side.--D'ye hear, you, Andrew--what's your name?--Fairservice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrew, who at the last rebuff had fallen a good way behind, did not\r\nchoose to acknowledge the summons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, ye scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jarvie; \xe2\x80\x9chere, sir here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is for the dog.\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, coming up sulkily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll gie you dog's wages, ye rascal, if ye dinna attend to what I say\r\nt'ye--We are gaun into the Hielands a bit\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI judged as muckle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaud your peace, ye knave, and hear what I have to say till ye--We are\r\ngaun a bit into the Hielands\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe tauld me sae already,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the incorrigible Andrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll break your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, rising in wrath, \xe2\x80\x9cif ye dinna\r\nhaud your tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hadden tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a slabbered mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary I should interfere, which I did by commanding\r\nAndrew, with an authoritative tone, to be silent at his peril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am silent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI'se do a' your lawfu' bidding without a\r\nnay-say. My puir mother used aye to tell me,\r\n\r\n                      Be it better, be it worse,\r\n                      Be ruled by him that has the purse.\r\n\r\nSae ye may e'en speak as lang as ye like, baith the tane and the tither\r\no' you, for Andrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jarvie took the advantage of his stopping after quoting the above\r\nproverb, to give him the requisite instructions. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, it's as\r\nmuckle as your life's worth--that wad be dear o' little siller, to be\r\nsure--but it is as muckle as a' our lives are worth, if ye dinna mind\r\nwhat I sae to ye. In this public whar we are gaun to, and whar it is like\r\nwe may hae to stay a' night, men o' a' clans and kindred--Hieland and\r\nLawland--tak up their quarters--And whiles there are mair drawn dirks\r\nthan open Bibles amang them, when the usquebaugh gets uppermost. See ye\r\nneither meddle nor mak, nor gie nae offence wi' that clavering tongue o'\r\nyours, but keep a calm sough, and let ilka cock fight his ain battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuckle needs to tell me that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cas if I had\r\nnever seen a Hielandman before, and ken'd nae how to manage them. Nae man\r\nalive can cuitle up Donald better than mysell--I hae bought wi' them,\r\nsauld wi' them, eaten wi' them, drucken wi' them\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye ever fight wi' them?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI took care o' that: it wad ill hae set me,\r\nthat am an artist and half a scholar to my trade, to be fighting amang a\r\nwheen kilted loons that dinna ken the name o' a single herb or flower in\r\nbraid Scots, let abee in the Latin tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie, \xe2\x80\x9cas ye wad keep either your tongue in your\r\nmouth, or your lugs in your head (and ye might miss them, for as saucy\r\nmembers as they are), I charge ye to say nae word, gude or bad, that ye\r\ncan weel get by, to onybody that may be in the Clachan. And ye'll\r\nspecially understand that ye're no to be bleezing and blasting about your\r\nmaster's name and mine, or saying that this is Mr. Bailie Nicol Jarvie o'\r\nthe Saut Market, son o' the worthy Deacon Nicol Jarvie, that a' body has\r\nheard about; and this is Mr. Frank Osbaldistone, son of the managing\r\npartner of the great house of Osbaldistone and Tresham, in the City.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEneueh said,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Andrew--\xe2\x80\x9ceneueh said. What need ye think I wad be\r\nspeaking about your names for?--I hae mony things o' mair importance to\r\nspeak about, I trow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's thae very things of importance that I am feared for, ye blethering\r\ngoose; ye maunna speak ony thing, gude or bad, that ye can by any\r\npossibility help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye dinna think me fit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew, in a huff, \xe2\x80\x9cto speak like\r\nither folk, gie me my wages and my board-wages, and I'se gae back to\r\nGlasgow--There's sma' sorrow at our parting, as the auld mear said to the\r\nbroken cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding Andrew's perverseness again rising to a point which threatened to\r\noccasion me inconvenience, I was under the necessity of explaining to\r\nhim, that he might return if he thought proper, but that in that case I\r\nwould not pay him a single farthing for his past services. The argument\r\n_ad crumenam,_ as it has been called by jocular logicians, has weight\r\nwith the greater part of mankind, and Andrew was in that particular far\r\nfrom affecting any trick of singularity. He \xe2\x80\x9cdrew in his horns,\xe2\x80\x9d to use\r\nthe Bailie's phrase, on the instant, professed no intention whatever to\r\ndisoblige, and a resolution to be guided by my commands, whatever they\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nConcord being thus happily restored to our small party, we continued to\r\npursue our journey. The road, which had ascended for six or seven English\r\nmiles, began now to descend for about the same space, through a country\r\nwhich neither in fertility nor interest could boast any advantage over\r\nthat which we had passed already, and which afforded no variety, unless\r\nwhen some tremendous peak of a Highland mountain appeared at a distance.\r\nWe continued, however, to ride on without pause and even when night fell\r\nand overshadowed the desolate wilds which we traversed, we were, as I\r\nunderstood from Mr. Jarvie, still three miles and a bittock distant from\r\nthe place where we were to spend the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVENTH.\r\n\r\n                          Baron of Bucklivie,\r\n                       May the foul fiend drive ye,\r\n                          And a' to pieces rive ye,\r\n                          For building sic a town,\r\n                       Where there's neither horse meat,\r\n                          Nor man's meat,\r\n                       Nor a chair to sit down.\r\n                                Scottish Popular Rhymes on a bad Inn.\r\n\r\nThe night was pleasant, and the moon afforded us good light for our\r\njourney. Under her rays, the ground over which we passed assumed a more\r\ninteresting appearance than during the broad daylight, which discovered\r\nthe extent of its wasteness. The mingled light and shadows gave it an\r\ninterest which naturally did not belong to it; and, like the effect of a\r\nveil flung over a plain woman, irritated our curiosity on a subject which\r\nhad in itself nothing gratifying.\r\n\r\nThe descent, however, still continued, turned, winded, left the more open\r\nheaths, and got into steeper ravines, which promised soon to lead us to\r\nthe banks of some brook or river, and ultimately made good their presage.\r\nWe found ourselves at length on the bank of a stream, which rather\r\nresembled one of my native English rivers than those I had hitherto seen\r\nin Scotland. It was narrow, deep, still, and silent; although the\r\nimperfect light, as it gleamed on its placid waters, showed also that we\r\nwere now among the lofty mountains which formed its cradle. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's the\r\nForth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, with an air of reverence, which I have observed\r\nthe Scotch usually pay to their distinguished rivers. The Clyde, the\r\nTweed, the Forth, the Spey, are usually named by those who dwell on their\r\nbanks with a sort of respect and pride, and I have known duels occasioned\r\nby any word of disparagement. I cannot say I have the least quarrel with\r\nthis sort of harmless enthusiasm. I received my friend's communication\r\nwith the importance which he seemed to think appertained to it. In fact,\r\nI was not a little pleased, after so long and dull a journey, to approach\r\na region which promised to engage the imagination. My faithful squire,\r\nAndrew, did not seem to be quite of the same opinion, for he received the\r\nsolemn information, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the Forth,\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cUmph!--an he had said\r\nthat's the public-house, it wad hae been mair to the purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Forth, however, as far as the imperfect light permitted me to judge,\r\nseemed to merit the admiration of those who claimed an interest in its\r\nstream. A beautiful eminence of the most regular round shape, and clothed\r\nwith copsewood of hazels, mountain-ash, and dwarf-oak, intermixed with a\r\nfew magnificent old trees, which, rising above the underwood, exposed\r\ntheir forked and bared branches to the silver moonshine, seemed to\r\nprotect the sources from which the river sprung. If I could trust the\r\ntale of my companion, which, while professing to disbelieve every word of\r\nit, he told under his breath, and with an air of something like\r\nintimidation, this hill, so regularly formed, so richly verdant, and\r\ngarlanded with such a beautiful variety of ancient trees and thriving\r\ncopsewood, was held by the neighbourhood to contain, within its unseen\r\ncaverns, the palaces of the fairies--a race of airy beings, who formed an\r\nintermediate class between men and demons, and who, if not positively\r\nmalignant to humanity, were yet to be avoided and feared, on account of\r\ntheir capricious, vindictive, and irritable disposition.*\r\n\r\n* Note H. Fairy Superstition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ca' them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9c_Daoine Schie,_--whilk\r\nsignifies, as I understand, men of peace; meaning thereby to make their\r\ngudewill. And we may e'en as weel ca' them that too, Mr. Osbaldistone,\r\nfor there's nae gude in speaking ill o' the laird within his ain bounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But he added presently after, on seeing one or two lights which twinkled\r\nbefore us, \xe2\x80\x9cIt's deceits o' Satan, after a', and I fearna to say it--for\r\nwe are near the manse now, and yonder are the lights in the Clachan of\r\nAberfoil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI own I was well pleased at the circumstance to which Mr. Jarvie alluded;\r\nnot so much that it set his tongue at liberty, in his opinion, with all\r\nsafety to declare his real sentiments with respect to the _Daoine Schie,_\r\nor fairies, as that it promised some hours' repose to ourselves and our\r\nhorses, of which, after a ride of fifty miles and upwards, both stood in\r\nsome need.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the infant Forth by an old-fashioned stone bridge, very high\r\nand very narrow. My conductor, however, informed me, that to get through\r\nthis deep and important stream, and to clear all its tributary\r\ndependencies, the general pass from the Highlands to the southward lay by\r\nwhat was called the Fords of Frew, at all times deep and difficult of\r\npassage, and often altogether unfordable. Beneath these fords, there was\r\nno pass of general resort until so far east as the bridge of Stirling; so\r\nthat the river of Forth forms a defensible line between the Highlands and\r\nLowlands of Scotland, from its source nearly to the Firth, or inlet of\r\nthe ocean, in which it terminates. The subsequent events which we\r\nwitnessed led me to recall with attention what the shrewdness of Bailie\r\nJarvie suggested in his proverbial expression, that \xe2\x80\x9cForth bridles the\r\nwild Highlandman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile's riding, after we crossed the bridge, placed us at the\r\ndoor of the public-house where we were to pass the evening. It was a\r\nhovel rather worse than better than that in which we had dined; but its\r\nlittle windows were lighted up, voices were heard from within, and all\r\nintimated a prospect of food and shelter, to which we were by no means\r\nindifferent. Andrew was the first to observe that there was a peeled\r\nwillow-wand placed across the half-open door of the little inn. He hung\r\nback and advised us not to enter. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9csome of their\r\nchiefs and grit men are birling at the usquebaugh in by there, and dinna\r\nwant to be disturbed; and the least we'll get, if we gang ramstam in on\r\nthem, will be a broken head, to learn us better havings, if we dinna come\r\nby the length of a cauld dirk in our wame, whilk is just as likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at the Bailie, who acknowledged, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the gowk\r\nhad some reason for singing, ance in the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime a staring half-clad wench or two came out of the inn and the\r\nneighbouring cottages, on hearing the sound of our horses' feet. No one\r\nbade us welcome, nor did any one offer to take our horses, from which we\r\nhad alighted; and to our various inquiries, the hopeless response of \xe2\x80\x9cHa\r\nniel Sassenach,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only answer we could extract. The Bailie,\r\nhowever, found (in his experience) a way to make them speak English. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nI gie ye a bawbee,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to an urchin of about ten years old, with a\r\nfragment of a tattered plaid about him, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you understand Sassenach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, that will I,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the brat, in very decent English. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\ngang and tell your mammy, my man, there's twa Sassenach gentlemen come to\r\nspeak wi' her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady presently appeared, with a lighted piece of split fir\r\nblazing in her hand. The turpentine in this species of torch (which is\r\ngenerally dug from out the turf-bogs) makes it blaze and sparkle readily,\r\nso that it is often used in the Highlands in lieu of candles. On this\r\noccasion such a torch illuminated the wild and anxious features of a\r\nfemale, pale, thin, and rather above the usual size, whose soiled and\r\nragged dress, though aided by a plaid or tartan screen, barely served the\r\npurposes of decency, and certainly not those of comfort. Her black hair,\r\nwhich escaped in uncombed elf-locks from under her coif, as well as the\r\nstrange and embarrassed look with which she regarded us, gave me the idea\r\nof a witch disturbed in the midst of her unlawful rites. She plainly\r\nrefused to admit us into the house. We remonstrated anxiously, and\r\npleaded the length of our journey, the state of our horses, and the\r\ncertainty that there was not another place where we could be received\r\nnearer than Callander, which the Bailie stated to be seven Scots miles\r\ndistant. How many these may exactly amount to in English measurement, I\r\nhave never been able to ascertain, but I think the double _ratio_ may be\r\npretty safely taken as a medium computation. The obdurate hostess treated\r\nour expostulation with contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter gang farther than fare waur,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, speaking the Scottish Lowland dialect, and being indeed a\r\nnative of the Lennox district--\xe2\x80\x9cHer house was taen up wi' them wadna like\r\nto be intruded on wi' strangers. She didna ken wha mair might be\r\nthere--red-coats, it might be, frae the garrison.\xe2\x80\x9d (These last words she\r\nspoke under her breath, and with very strong emphasis.) \xe2\x80\x9cThe night,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwas fair abune head--a night amang the heather wad caller our\r\nbloods--we might sleep in our claes, as mony a gude blade does in the\r\nscabbard--there wasna muckle flowmoss in the shaw, if we took up our\r\nquarters right, and we might pit up our horses to the hill, naebody wad\r\nsay naething against it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my good woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, while the Bailie groaned and remained\r\nundecided, \xe2\x80\x9cit is six hours since we dined, and we have not taken a\r\nmorsel since. I am positively dying with hunger, and I have no taste for\r\ntaking up my abode supperless among these mountains of yours. I\r\npositively must enter; and make the best apology you can to your guests\r\nfor adding a stranger or two to their number. Andrew, you will see the\r\nhorses put up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Hecate looked at me with surprise, and then ejaculated--\xe2\x80\x9cA wilfu' man\r\nwill hae his way--them that will to Cupar maun to Cupar!--To see thae\r\nEnglish belly-gods! he has had ae fu' meal the day already, and he'll\r\nventure life and liberty, rather than he'll want a het supper! Set\r\nroasted beef and pudding on the opposite side o' the pit o' Tophet, and\r\nan Englishman will mak a spang at it--But I wash my hands o't--Follow me\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x9d (to Andrew), \xe2\x80\x9cand I'se show ye where to pit the beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI own I was somewhat dismayed at my landlady's expressions, which seemed\r\nto be ominous of some approaching danger. I did not, however, choose to\r\nshrink back after having declared my resolution, and accordingly I boldly\r\nentered the house; and after narrowly escaping breaking my shins over a\r\nturf back and a salting tub, which stood on either side of the narrow\r\nexterior passage, I opened a crazy half-decayed door, constructed not of\r\nplank, but of wicker, and, followed by the Bailie, entered into the\r\nprincipal apartment of this Scottish caravansary.\r\n\r\nThe interior presented a view which seemed singular enough to southern\r\neyes. The fire, fed with blazing turf and branches of dried wood, blazed\r\nmerrily in the centre; but the smoke, having no means to escape but\r\nthrough a hole in the roof, eddied round the rafters of the cottage, and\r\nhung in sable folds at the height of about five feet from the floor. The\r\nspace beneath was kept pretty clear by innumerable currents of air which\r\nrushed towards the fire from the broken panel of basket-work which served\r\nas a door--from two square holes, designed as ostensible windows, through\r\none of which was thrust a plaid, and through the other a tattered\r\ngreat-coat--and moreover, through various less distinguishable apertures\r\nin the walls of the tenement, which, being built of round stones and\r\nturf, cemented by mud, let in the atmosphere at innumerable crevices.\r\n\r\nAt an old oaken table, adjoining to the fire, sat three men, guests\r\napparently, whom it was impossible to regard with indifference. Two were\r\nin the Highland dress; the one, a little dark-complexioned man, with a\r\nlively, quick, and irritable expression of features, wore the trews, or\r\nclose pantaloons wove out of a sort of chequered stocking stuff. The\r\nBailie whispered me, that \xe2\x80\x9che behoved to be a man of some consequence,\r\nfor that naebody but their Duinhe'wassels wore the trews--they were ill\r\nto weave exactly to their Highland pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other mountaineer was a very tall, strong man, with a quantity of\r\nreddish hair, freckled face, high cheek-bones, and long chin--a sort of\r\ncaricature of the national features of Scotland. The tartan which he wore\r\ndiffered from that of his companion, as it had much more scarlet in it,\r\nwhereas the shades of black and dark-green predominated in the chequers\r\nof the other. The third, who sate at the same table, was in the Lowland\r\ndress,--a bold, stout-looking man, with a cast of military daring in his\r\neye and manner, his riding-dress showily and profusely laced, and his\r\ncocked hat of formidable dimensions. His hanger and a pair of pistols lay\r\non the table before him. Each of the Highlanders had their naked dirks\r\nstuck upright in the board beside him,--an emblem, I was afterwards\r\ninformed, but surely a strange one, that their computation was not to be\r\ninterrupted by any brawl. A mighty pewter measure, containing about an\r\nEnglish quart of usquebaugh, a liquor nearly as strong as brandy, which\r\nthe Highlanders distil from malt, and drink undiluted in excessive\r\nquantities, was placed before these worthies. A broken glass, with a\r\nwooden foot, served as a drinking cup to the whole party, and circulated\r\nwith a rapidity, which, considering the potency of the liquor, seemed\r\nabsolutely marvellous. These men spoke loudly and eagerly together,\r\nsometimes in Gaelic, at other times in English. Another Highlander, wrapt\r\nin his plaid, reclined on the floor, his head resting on a stone, from\r\nwhich it was only separated by a wisp of straw, and slept or seemed to\r\nsleep, without attending to what was going on around him. He also was\r\nprobably a stranger, for he lay in full dress, and accoutred with the\r\nsword and target, the usual arms of his countrymen when on a journey.\r\nCribs there were of different dimensions beside the walls, formed, some\r\nof fractured boards, some of shattered wicker-work or plaited boughs, in\r\nwhich slumbered the family of the house, men, women, and children, their\r\nplaces of repose only concealed by the dusky wreaths of vapour which\r\narose above, below, and around them.\r\n\r\nOur entrance was made so quietly, and the carousers I have described were\r\nso eagerly engaged in their discussions, that we escaped their notice for\r\na minute or two. But I observed the Highlander who lay beside the fire\r\nraise himself on his elbow as we entered, and, drawing his plaid over the\r\nlower part of his face, fix his look on us for a few seconds, after which\r\nhe resumed his recumbent posture, and seemed again to betake himself to\r\nthe repose which our entrance had interrupted,\r\n\r\nWe advanced to the fire, which was an agreeable spectacle after our late\r\nride, during the chillness of an autumn evening among the mountains, and\r\nfirst attracted the attention of the guests who had preceded us, by\r\ncalling for the landlady. She approached, looking doubtfully and timidly,\r\nnow at us, now at the other party, and returned a hesitating and doubtful\r\nanswer to our request to have something to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didna ken,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe wasna sure there was onything in the\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d and then modified her refusal with the qualification--\xe2\x80\x9cthat is,\r\nonything fit for the like of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured her we were indifferent to the quality of our supper; and\r\nlooking round for the means of accommodation, which were not easily to be\r\nfound, I arranged an old hen-coop as a seat for Mr. Jarvie, and turned\r\ndown a broken tub to serve for my own. Andrew Fairservice entered\r\npresently afterwards, and took a place in silence behind our backs. The\r\nnatives, as I may call them, continued staring at us with an air as if\r\nconfounded by our assurance, and we, at least I myself, disguised as well\r\nas we could, under an appearance of indifference, any secret anxiety we\r\nmight feel concerning the mode in which we were to be received by those\r\nwhose privacy we had disturbed.\r\n\r\nAt length, the lesser Highlander, addressing himself to me said, in very\r\ngood English, and in a tone of great haughtiness, \xe2\x80\x9cYe make yourself at\r\nhome, sir, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI usually do so,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I come into a house of public\r\nentertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did she na see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller man, \xe2\x80\x9cby the white wand at the\r\ndoor, that gentlemans had taken up the public-house on their ain\r\nbusiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not pretend to understand the customs of this country but I am yet\r\nto learn,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9chow three persons should be entitled to exclude\r\nall other travellers from the only place of shelter and refreshment for\r\nmiles round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's nae reason for't, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cwe mean nae\r\noffence--but there's neither law nor reason for't; but as far as a stoup\r\no' gude brandy wad make up the quarrel, we, being peaceable folk, wad be\r\nwilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn your brandy, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lowlander, adjusting his cocked hat\r\nfiercely upon his head; \xe2\x80\x9cwe desire neither your brandy nor your company,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and up he rose from his seat. His companions also arose, muttering to\r\neach other, drawing up their plaids, and snorting and snuffing the air\r\nafter the mariner of their countrymen when working themselves into a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tauld ye what wad come, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady, \xe2\x80\x9can ye wad hae\r\nbeen tauld:--get awa' wi' ye out o' my house, and make nae disturbance\r\nhere--there's nae gentleman be disturbed at Jeanie MacAlpine's an she can\r\nhinder. A wheen idle English loons, gaun about the country under cloud o'\r\nnight, and disturbing honest peaceable gentlemen that are drinking their\r\ndrap drink at the fireside!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt another time I should have thought of the old Latin adage,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat veniam corvis, vexat censure columbas\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nBut I had not any time for classical quotation, for there was obviously a\r\nfray about to ensue, at which, feeling myself indiginant at the\r\ninhospitable insolence with which I was treated, I was totally\r\nindifferent, unless on the Bailie's account, whose person and qualities\r\nwere ill qualified for such an adventure. I started up, however, on\r\nseeing the others rise, and dropped my cloak from my shoulders, that I\r\nmight be ready to stand on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are three to three,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lesser Highlander, glancing his eyes at\r\nour party: \xe2\x80\x9cif ye be pretty men, draw!\xe2\x80\x9d and unsheathing his broadsword,\r\nhe advanced on me. I put myself in a posture of defence, and aware of the\r\nsuperiority of my weapon, a rapier or small-sword, was little afraid of\r\nthe issue of the contest. The Bailie behaved with unexpected mettle. As\r\nhe saw the gigantic Highlander confront him with his weapon drawn, he\r\ntugged for a second or two at the hilt of his _shabble,_ as he called it;\r\nbut finding it loth to quit the sheath, to which it had long been secured\r\nby rust and disuse, he seized, as a substitute, on the red-hot coulter of\r\na plough which had been employed in arranging the fire by way of a poker,\r\nand brandished it with such effect, that at the first pass he set the\r\nHighlander's plaid on fire, and compelled him to keep a respectful\r\ndistance till he could get it extinguished. Andrew, on the contrary, who\r\nought to have faced the Lowland champion, had, I grieve to say it,\r\nvanished at the very commencement of the fray. But his antagonist, crying\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair play, fair play!\xe2\x80\x9d seemed courteously disposed to take no share in\r\nthe scuffle. Thus we commenced our rencontre on fair terms as to numbers.\r\nMy own aim was, to possess myself, if possible, of my antagonist's\r\nweapon; but I was deterred from closing, for fear of the dirk which he\r\nheld in his left hand, and used in parrying the thrusts of my rapier.\r\nMeantime the Bailie, notwithstanding the success of his first onset, was\r\nsorely bested. The weight of his weapon, the corpulence of his person,\r\nthe very effervescence of his own passions, were rapidly exhausting both\r\nhis strength and his breath, and he was almost at the mercy of his\r\nantagonist, when up started the sleeping Highlander from the floor on\r\nwhich he reclined, with his naked sword and target in his hand, and threw\r\nhimself between the discomfited magistrate and his assailant, exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer nainsell has eaten the town pread at the Cross o' Glasgow, and py\r\nher troth she'll fight for Bailie Sharvie at the Clachan of Aberfoil--tat\r\nwill she e'en!\xe2\x80\x9d And seconding his words with deeds, this unexpected\r\nauxiliary made his sword whistle about the ears of his tall countryman,\r\nwho, nothing abashed, returned his blows with interest. But being both\r\naccoutred with round targets made of wood, studded with brass, and\r\ncovered with leather, with which they readily parried each other's\r\nstrokes, their combat was attended with much more noise and clatter than\r\nserious risk of damage. It appeared, indeed, that there was more of\r\nbravado than of serious attempt to do us any injury; for the Lowland\r\ngentleman, who, as I mentioned, had stood aside for want of an antagonist\r\nwhen the brawl commenced, was now pleased to act the part of moderator\r\nand peacemaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fray at Jeannie MacAlpine's--154]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHand your hands! haud your hands!--eneugh done!--eneugh done! the\r\nquarrel's no mortal. The strange gentlemen have shown themselves men of\r\nhonour, and gien reasonable satisfaction. I'll stand on mine honour as\r\nkittle as ony man, but I hate unnecessary bloodshed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not, of course, my wish to protract the fray--my adversary seemed\r\nequally disposed to sheathe his sword--the Bailie, gasping for breath,\r\nmight be considered as _hors de combat,_ and our two sword-and-buckler\r\nmen gave up their contest with as much indifference as they had entered\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the worthy gentleman who acted as umpire, \xe2\x80\x9clet us drink\r\nand gree like honest fellows--The house will haud us a'. I propose that\r\nthis good little gentleman, that seems sair forfoughen, as I may say, in\r\nthis tuilzie, shall send for a tass o' brandy and I'll pay for another,\r\nby way of archilowe,* and then we'll birl our bawbees a' round about,\r\nlike brethren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd fa's to pay my new ponnie plaid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the larger Highlander, \xe2\x80\x9cwi' a\r\nhole burnt in't ane might put a kail-pat through? Saw ever onybody a\r\ndecent gentleman fight wi' a firebrand before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet that be nae hinderance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, who had now recovered his\r\nbreath, and was at once disposed to enjoy the triumph of having behaved\r\nwith spirit, and avoid the necessity of again resorting to such hard and\r\ndoubtful arbitrament--\xe2\x80\x9cGin I hae broken the head,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI sall find\r\nthe plaister. A new plaid sall ye hae, and o' the best--your ain\r\nclan-colours, man,--an ye will tell me where it can be sent t'ye frae\r\nGlasco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI needna name my clan--I am of a king's clan, as is weel ken'd,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Highlander; \xe2\x80\x9cbut ye may tak a bit o' the plaid--figh! she smells like\r\na singit sheep's head!--and that'll learn ye the sett--and a gentleman,\r\nthat's a cousin o' my ain, that carries eggs doun frae Glencroe, will ca'\r\nfor't about Martimas, an ye will tell her where ye bide. But, honest\r\ngentleman, neist time ye fight, an ye hae ony respect for your\r\nathversary, let it be wi' your sword, man, since ye wear ane, and no wi'\r\nthae het culters and fireprands, like a wild Indian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConscience!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cevery man maun do as he dow. My sword\r\nhasna seen the light since Bothwell Brigg, when my father that's dead and\r\ngane, ware it; and I kenna weel if it was forthcoming then either, for\r\nthe battle was o' the briefest--At ony rate, it's glued to the scabbard\r\nnow beyond my power to part them; and, finding that, I e'en grippit at\r\nthe first thing I could make a fend wi'. I trow my fighting days is done,\r\nthough I like ill to take the scorn, for a' that.--But where's the honest\r\nlad that tuik my quarrel on himself sae frankly?--I'se bestow a gill o'\r\naquavitae on him, an I suld never ca' for anither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Archilowe, of unknown derivation, signifies a peace-offering.\r\n\r\nThe champion for whom he looked around was, however, no longer to be\r\nseen. He had escaped unobserved by the Bailie, immediately when the brawl\r\nwas ended, yet not before I had recognised, in his wild features and\r\nshaggy red hair, our acquaintance Dougal, the fugitive turnkey of the\r\nGlasgow jail. I communicated this observation in a whisper to the Bailie,\r\nwho answered in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel,--I see that him that ye ken\r\no' said very right; there _is_ some glimmering o' common sense about that\r\ncreature Dougal; I maun see and think o' something will do him some\r\ngude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, he sat down, and fetching one or two deep aspirations, by\r\nway of recovering his breath, called to the landlady--\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Luckie,\r\nnow that I find that there's nae hole in my wame, whilk I had muckle\r\nreason to doubt frae the doings o' your house, I wad be the better o'\r\nsomething to pit intill't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dame, who was all officiousness so soon as the storm had blown over,\r\nimmediately undertook to broil something comfortable for our supper.\r\nIndeed, nothing surprised me more, in the course of the whole matter,\r\nthan the extreme calmness with which she and her household seemed to\r\nregard the martial tumult that had taken place. The good woman was only\r\nheard to call to some of her assistants--\xe2\x80\x9cSteek the door! steek the door!\r\nkill or be killed, let naebody pass out till they hae paid the lawin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And as for the slumberers in those lairs by the wall, which served the\r\nfamily for beds, they only raised their shirtless bodies to look at the\r\nfray, ejaculated, \xe2\x80\x9cOigh! oigh!\xe2\x80\x9d in the tone suitable to their respective\r\nsex and ages, and were, I believe, fast asleep again, ere our swords were\r\nwell returned to their scabbards.\r\n\r\nOur landlady, however, now made a great bustle to get some victuals\r\nready, and, to my surprise, very soon began to prepare for us in the\r\nfrying-pan a savoury mess of venison collops, which she dressed in a\r\nmanner that might well satisfy hungry men, if not epicures. In the\r\nmeantime the brandy was placed on the table, to which the Highlanders,\r\nhowever partial to their native strong waters, showed no objection, but\r\nmuch the contrary; and the Lowland gentleman, after the first cup had\r\npassed round, became desirous to know our profession, and the object of\r\nour journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are bits o' Glasgow bodies, if it please your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBailie, with an affectation of great humility, \xe2\x80\x9ctravelling to Stirling to\r\nget in some siller that is awing us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so silly as to feel a little disconcerted at the unassuming account\r\nwhich he chose to give of us; but I recollected my promise to be silent,\r\nand allow the Bailie to manage the matter his own way. And really, when I\r\nrecollected, Will, that I had not only brought the honest man a long\r\njourney from home, which even in itself had been some inconvenience (if I\r\nwere to judge from the obvious pain and reluctance with which he took his\r\nseat, or arose from it), but had also put him within a hair's-breadth of\r\nthe loss of his life, I could hardly refuse him such a compliment. The\r\nspokesman of the other party, snuffing up his breath through his nose,\r\nrepeated the words with a sort of sneer;--\xe2\x80\x9cYou Glasgow tradesfolks hae\r\nnaething to do but to gang frae the tae end o' the west o' Scotland to\r\nthe ither, to plague honest folks that may chance to be awee ahint the\r\nhand, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf our debtors were a' sic honest gentlemen as I believe you to be,\r\nGarschattachin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cconscience! we might save ourselves\r\na labour, for they wad come to seek us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! what! how!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the person whom he had addressed,--\xe2\x80\x9cas I shall\r\nlive by bread (not forgetting beef and brandy), it's my auld friend Nicol\r\nJarvie, the best man that ever counted doun merks on a band till a\r\ndistressed gentleman. Were ye na coming up my way?--were ye na coming up\r\nthe Endrick to Garschattachin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroth no, Maister Galbraith,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cI had other eggs on\r\nthe spit--and I thought ye wad be saying I cam to look about the annual\r\nrent that's due on the bit heritable band that's between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the annual rent!\xe2\x80\x9d said the laird, with an appearance of great\r\nheartiness--\xe2\x80\x9cDeil a word o' business will you or I speak, now that ye're\r\nso near my country. To see how a trot-cosey and a joseph can disguise a\r\nman--that I suldna ken my auld feal friend the deacon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bailie, if ye please,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed my companion; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I ken what gars ye\r\nmistak--the band was granted to my father that's happy, and he was\r\ndeacon; but his name was Nicol as weel as mine. I dinna mind that there's\r\nbeen a payment of principal sum or annual rent on it in my day, and\r\ndoubtless that has made the mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, the devil take the mistake and all that occasioned it!\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMr. Galbraith. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am glad ye are a bailie. Gentlemen, fill a\r\nbrimmer--this is my excellent friend, Bailie Nicol Jarvie's health--I\r\nken'd him and his father these twenty years. Are ye a' cleared kelty\r\naff?--Fill anither. Here's to his being sune provost--I say\r\nprovost--Lord Provost Nicol Jarvie!--and them that affirms there's a man\r\nwalks the Hie-street o' Glasgow that's fitter for the office, they will\r\ndo weel not to let me, Duncan Galbraith of Garschattachin, hear them say\r\nsae--that's all.\xe2\x80\x9d And therewith Duncan Galbraith martially cocked his\r\nhat, and placed it on one side of his head with an air of defiance.\r\n\r\nThe brandy was probably the best recommendation of there complimentary\r\ntoasts to the two Highlanders, who drank them without appearing anxious\r\nto comprehend their purport. They commenced a conversation with Mr.\r\nGalbraith in Gaelic, which he talked with perfect fluency, being, as I\r\nafterwards learned, a near neighbour to the Highlands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken'd that Scant-o'-grace weel eneugh frae the very outset,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBailie, in a whisper to me; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when blude was warm, and swords were out\r\nat ony rate, wha kens what way he might hae thought o' paying his debts?\r\nit will be lang or he does it in common form. But he's an honest lad, and\r\nhas a warm heart too; he disna come often to the Cross o' Glasgow, but\r\nmony a buck and blackcock he sends us doun frae the hills. And I can want\r\nmy siller weel eneugh. My father the deacon had a great regard for the\r\nfamily of Garschattachin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSupper being now nearly ready, I looked round for Andrew Fairservice; but\r\nthat trusty follower had not been seen by any one since the beginning of\r\nthe rencontre. The hostess, however, said that she believed our servant\r\nhad gone into the stable, and offered to light me to the place, saying\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cno entreaties of the bairns or hers could make him give any answer;\r\nand that truly she caredna to gang into the stable herself at this hour.\r\nShe was a lone woman, and it was weel ken'd how the Brownie of\r\nBen-ye-gask guided the gudewife of Ardnagowan; and it was aye judged\r\nthere was a Brownie in our stable, which was just what garr'd me gie ower\r\nkeeping an hostler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs, however, she lighted me towards the miserable hovel into which they\r\nhad crammed our unlucky steeds, to regale themselves on hay, every fibre\r\nof which was as thick as an ordinary goose-quill, she plainly showed me\r\nthat she had another reason for drawing me aside from the company than\r\nthat which her words implied. \xe2\x80\x9cRead that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, slipping a piece of\r\npaper into my hand, as we arrived at the door of the shed; \xe2\x80\x9cI bless God I\r\nam rid o't. Between sogers and Saxons, and caterans and cattle-lifters,\r\nand hership and bluidshed, an honest woman wad live quieter in hell than\r\non the Hieland line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she put the pine-torch into my hand, and returned into the\r\nhouse,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Bagpipes, not lyres, the Highland hills adorn,\r\n              MacLean's loud hollo, and MacGregor's horn.\r\n                          John Cooper's Reply to Allan Ramsay.\r\n\r\nI stopped in the entrance of the stable, if indeed a place be entitled to\r\nthat name where horses were stowed away along with goats, poultry, pigs,\r\nand cows, under the same roof with the mansion-house; although, by a\r\ndegree of refinement unknown to the rest of the hamlet, and which I\r\nafterwards heard was imputed to an overpride on the part of Jeanie\r\nMacAlpine, our landlady, the apartment was accommodated with an entrance\r\ndifferent from that used by her biped customers. By the light of my\r\ntorch, I deciphered the following billet, written on a wet, crumpled, and\r\ndirty piece of paper, and addressed--\xe2\x80\x9cFor the honoured hands of Mr. F.\r\nO., a Saxon young gentleman--These.\xe2\x80\x9d The contents were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are night-hawks abroad, so that I cannot give you and my respected\r\nkinsman, B. N. J., the meeting at the Clachan of Aberfoil, whilk was my\r\npurpose. I pray you to avoid unnecessary communication with those you may\r\nfind there, as it may give future trouble. The person who gives you this\r\nis faithful and may be trusted, and will guide you to a place where, God\r\nwilling, I may safely give you the meeting, when I trust my kinsman and\r\nyou will visit my poor house, where, in despite of my enemies, I can\r\nstill promise sic cheer as ane Hielandman may gie his friends, and where\r\nwe will drink a solemn health to a certain D. V., and look to certain\r\naffairs whilk I hope to be your aidance in; and I rest, as is wont among\r\ngentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour servant to command,\r\nR. M. C.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI was a good deal mortified at the purport of this letter, which seemed\r\nto adjourn to a more distant place and date the service which I had hoped\r\nto receive from this man Campbell. Still, however, it was some comfort to\r\nknow that he continued to be in my interest, since without him I could\r\nhave no hope of recovering my father's papers. I resolved, therefore, to\r\nobey his instructions; and, observing all caution before the guests, to\r\ntake the first good opportunity I could find to procure from the landlady\r\ndirections how I was to obtain a meeting with this mysterious person.\r\n\r\nMy next business was to seek out Andrew Fairservice, whom I called\r\nseveral times by name, without receiving any answer, surveying the stable\r\nall round, at the same time, not without risk of setting the premises on\r\nfire, had not the quantity of wet litter and mud so greatly\r\ncounterbalanced two or three bunches of straw and hay. At length my\r\nrepeated cries of \xe2\x80\x9cAndrew Fairservice! Andrew! fool!--ass! where are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d produced a doleful \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d in a groaning tone, which might have\r\nbeen that of the Brownie itself. Guided by this sound, I advanced to the\r\ncorner of a shed, where, ensconced in the angle of the wall, behind a\r\nbarrel full of the feathers of all the fowls which had died in the cause\r\nof the public for a month past, I found the manful Andrew; and partly by\r\nforce, partly by command and exhortation, compelled him forth into the\r\nopen air. The first words he spoke were, \xe2\x80\x9cI am an honest lad, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil questions your honesty?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cor what have we to do\r\nwith it at present? I desire you to come and attend us at supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Andrew, without apparently understanding what I said to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cI am an honest lad, whatever the Bailie may say to the contrary. I\r\ngrant the warld and the warld's gear sits ower near my heart whiles, as\r\nit does to mony a ane--But I am an honest lad; and, though I spak o'\r\nleaving ye in the muir, yet God knows it was far frae my purpose, but\r\njust like idle things folk says when they're driving a bargain, to get it\r\nas far to their ain side as they can--And I like your honour weel for sae\r\nyoung a lad, and I wadna part wi' ye lightly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce are you driving at now?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHas not everything\r\nbeen settled again and again to your satisfaction? And are you to talk of\r\nleaving me every hour, without either rhyme or reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,--but I was only making fashion before,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it's\r\ncome on me in sair earnest now--Lose or win, I daur gae nae farther wi'\r\nyour honour; and if ye'll tak my foolish advice, ye'll bide by a broken\r\ntryste, rather than gang forward yoursell. I hae a sincere regard for ye,\r\nand I'm sure ye'll be a credit to your friends if ye live to saw out your\r\nwild aits, and get some mair sense and steadiness--But I can follow ye\r\nnae farther, even if ye suld founder and perish from the way for lack of\r\nguidance and counsel. To gang into Rob Roy's country is a mere tempting\r\no' Providence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in some surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cI know no such person. What new\r\ntrick is this, Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew--\xe2\x80\x9cvery hard, that a man canna be believed when\r\nhe speaks Heaven's truth, just because he's whiles owercome, and tells\r\nlees a little when there is necessary occasion. Ye needna ask whae Rob\r\nRoy is, the reiving lifter that he is--God forgie me! I hope naebody\r\nhears us--when ye hae a letter frae him in your pouch. I heard ane o' his\r\ngillies bid that auld rudas jaud of a gudewife gie ye that. They thought\r\nI didna understand their gibberish; but, though I canna speak it muckle,\r\nI can gie a gude guess at what I hear them say--I never thought to hae\r\ntauld ye that, but in a fright a' things come out that suld be keepit in.\r\nO, Maister Frank! a' your uncle's follies, and a' your cousin's pliskies,\r\nwere naething to this! Drink clean cap out, like Sir Hildebrand; begin\r\nthe blessed morning with brandy sops, like Squire Percy; swagger, like\r\nSquire Thorncliff; rin wud amang the lasses, like Squire John; gamble,\r\nlike Richard; win souls to the Pope and the deevil, like Rashleigh; rive,\r\nrant, break the Sabbath, and do the Pope's bidding, like them a' put\r\nthegither--But, merciful Providence! take care o' your young bluid, and\r\ngang nae near Rob Roy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrew's alarm was too sincere to permit me to suppose he counterfeited.\r\nI contented myself, however, with telling him, that I meant to remain in\r\nthe alehouse that night, and desired to have the horses well looked\r\nafter. As to the rest, I charged him to observe the strictest silence\r\nupon the subject of his alarm, and he might rely upon it I would not\r\nincur any serious danger without due precaution. He followed me with a\r\ndejected air into the house, observing between his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cMan suld be\r\nserved afore beast--I haena had a morsel in my mouth, but the rough legs\r\no' that auld muircock, this haill blessed day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe harmony of the company seemed to have suffered some interruption\r\nsince my departure, for I found Mr. Galbraith and my friend the Bailie\r\nhigh in dispute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll hear nae sic language,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie, as I entered, \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\r\nthe Duke o' Argyle and the name o' Campbell. He's a worthy\r\npublic-spirited nobleman, and a credit to the country, and a friend and\r\nbenefactor to the trade o' Glasgow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll sae naething against MacCallum More and the Slioch-nan-Diarmid,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the lesser Highlander, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI live on the wrang side of\r\nGlencroe to quarrel with Inverara.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur loch ne'er saw the Cawmil lymphads,\xe2\x80\x9d * said the bigger Highlander.\r\n\r\n* _Lymphads._ The galley which the family of Argyle and others of the *\r\nClan Campbell carry in their arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe'll speak her mind and fear naebody--She doesna value a Cawmil mair\r\nas a Cowan, and ye may tell MacCallum More that Allan Iverach said sae--\r\nIt's a far cry to Lochow.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* Lochow and the adjacent districts formed the original seat of the *\r\nCampbells. The expression of a \xe2\x80\x9cfar cry to Lochow\xe2\x80\x9d was proverbial.\r\n\r\nMr. Galbraith, on whom the repeated pledges which he had quaffed had\r\nproduced some influence, slapped his hand on the table with great force,\r\nand said, in a stern voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThere's a bloody debt due by that family,\r\nand they will pay it one day--The banes of a loyal and a gallant Grahame\r\nhae lang rattled in their coffin for vengeance on thae Dukes of Guile and\r\nLords for Lorn. There ne'er was treason in Scotland but a Cawmil was at\r\nthe bottom o't; and now that the wrang side's uppermost, wha but the\r\nCawmils for keeping down the right? But this warld winna last lang, and\r\nit will be time to sharp the maiden* for shearing o' craigs and\r\nthrapples. I hope to see the auld rusty lass linking at a bluidy harst\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* A rude kind of guillotine formerly used in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Garschattachin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cfy for shame, sir!\r\nWad ye say sic things before a magistrate, and bring yoursell into\r\ntrouble?--How d'ye think to mainteen your family and satisfy your\r\ncreditors (mysell and others), if ye gang on in that wild way, which\r\ncannot but bring you under the law, to the prejudice of a' that's\r\nconnected wi' ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n my creditors!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the gallant Galbraith, \xe2\x80\x9cand you if ye be\r\nane o' them! I say there will be a new warld sune--And we shall hae nae\r\nCawmils cocking their bonnet sae hie, and hounding their dogs where they\r\ndaurna come themsells, nor protecting thieves, nor murderers, and\r\noppressors, to harry and spoil better men and mair loyal clans than\r\nthemsells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie had a great mind to have continued the dispute, when the\r\nsavoury vapour of the broiled venison, which our landlady now placed\r\nbefore us, proved so powerful a mediator, that he betook himself to his\r\ntrencher with great eagerness, leaving the strangers to carry on the\r\ndispute among themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tat's true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller Highlander--whose name I found was\r\nStewart--\xe2\x80\x9cfor we suldna be plagued and worried here wi' meetings to pit\r\ndown Rob Roy, if the Cawmils didna gie him refutch. I was ane o' thirty\r\no' my ain name--part Glenfinlas, and part men that came down frae Appine.\r\nWe shased the MacGregors as ye wad shase rae-deer, till we came into\r\nGlenfalloch's country, and the Cawmils raise, and wadna let us pursue nae\r\nfarder, and sae we lost our labour; but her wad gie twa and a plack to be\r\nas near Rob as she was tat day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to happen very unfortunately, that in every topic of discourse\r\nwhich these warlike gentlemen introduced, my friend the Bailie found some\r\nmatter of offence. \xe2\x80\x9cYe'll forgie me speaking my mind, sir; but ye wad\r\nmaybe hae gien the best bowl in your bonnet to hae been as far awae frae\r\nRob as ye are e'en now--Od! my het pleugh-culter wad hae been naething to\r\nhis claymore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had better speak nae mair about her culter, or, by G--! her will gar\r\nher eat her words, and twa handfuls o' cauld steel to drive them ower\r\nwi'!\xe2\x80\x9d And, with a most inauspicious and menacing look, the mountaineer\r\nlaid his hand on his dagger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll hae nae quarrelling, Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d said his shorter companion; \xe2\x80\x9cand if\r\nthe Glasgow gentleman has ony regard for Rob Roy, he'll maybe see him in\r\ncauld irons the night, and playing tricks on a tow the morn; for this\r\ncountry has been owre lang plagued wi' him, and his race is near-hand\r\nrun--And it's time, Allan, we were ganging to our lads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout awa, Inverashalloch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Galbraith;--\xe2\x80\x9cMind the auld saw, man--\r\nIt's a bauld moon, quoth Bennygask--another pint, quoth Lesley;--we'll no\r\nstart for another chappin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hae had chappins eneugh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Inverashalloch; \xe2\x80\x9cI'll drink my quart of\r\nusquebaugh or brandy wi' ony honest fellow, but the deil a drap mair when\r\nI hae wark to do in the morning. And, in my puir thinking,\r\nGarschattachin, ye had better be thinking to bring up your horsemen to\r\nthe Clachan before day, that we may ay start fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deevil are ye in sic a hurry for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Garschattachin; \xe2\x80\x9cmeat\r\nand mass never hindered wark. An it had been my directing, deil a bit o'\r\nme wad hae fashed ye to come down the glens to help us. The garrison and\r\nour ain horse could hae taen Rob Roy easily enough. There's the hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, holding up his own, \xe2\x80\x9cshould lay him on the green, and never ask a\r\nHielandman o' ye a' for his help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe might hae loot us bide still where we were, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nInverashalloch. \xe2\x80\x9cI didna come sixty miles without being sent for. But an\r\nye'll hae my opinion, I redd ye keep your mouth better steekit, if ye\r\nhope to speed. Shored folk live lang, and sae may him ye ken o'. The way\r\nto catch a bird is no to fling your bannet at her. And also thae\r\ngentlemen hae heard some things they suldna hae heard, an the brandy\r\nhadna been ower bauld for your brain, Major Galbraith. Ye needna cock\r\nyour hat and bully wi' me, man, for I will not bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hae said it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Galbraith, with a solemn air of drunken gravity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I will quarrel no more this night either with broadcloth or tartan.\r\nWhen I am off duty I'll quarrel with you or ony man in the Hielands or\r\nLowlands, but not on duty--no--no. I wish we heard o' these red-coats. If\r\nit had been to do onything against King James, we wad hae seen them lang\r\nsyne--but when it's to keep the peace o' the country they can lie as\r\nlound as their neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke we heard the measured footsteps of a body of infantry on the\r\nmarch; and an officer, followed by two or three files of soldiers,\r\nentered the apartment. He spoke in an English accent, which was very\r\npleasant to my ears, now so long accustomed to the varying brogue of the\r\nHighland and Lowland Scotch.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou are, I suppose, Major Galbraith, of\r\nthe squadron of Lennox Militia, and these are the two Highland gentlemen\r\nwith whom I was appointed to meet in this place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey assented, and invited the officer to take some refreshments, which\r\nhe declined.--\xe2\x80\x9cI have been too late, gentlemen, and am desirous to make\r\nup time. I have orders to search for and arrest two persons guilty of\r\ntreasonable practices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll wash our hands o' that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Inverashalloch. \xe2\x80\x9cI came here wi' my\r\nmen to fight against the red MacGregor that killed my cousin, seven times\r\nremoved, Duncan MacLaren, in Invernenty;* but I will hae nothing to do\r\ntouching honest gentlemen that may be gaun through the country on their\r\nain business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* This, as appears from the introductory matter to this Tale, is an\r\nanachronism. The slaughter of MacLaren, a retainer of the chief of\r\nAppine, by the MacGregors, did not take place till after Rob Roy's death,\r\nsince it happened in 1736.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iverach.\r\n\r\nMajor Galbraith took up the matter more solemnly, and, premising his\r\noration with a hiccup, spoke to the following purpose:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall say nothing against King George, Captain, because, as it\r\nhappens, my commission may rin in his name--But one commission being\r\ngood, sir, does not make another bad; and some think that James may be\r\njust as good a name as George. There's the king that is--and there's the\r\nking that suld of right be--I say, an honest man may and suld be loyal to\r\nthem both, Captain. But I am of the Lord Lieutenant's opinion for the\r\ntime, as it becomes a militia officer and a depute-lieutenant--and about\r\ntreason and all that, it's lost time to speak of it--least said is sunest\r\nmended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to see how you have been employing your time, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe English officer--as indeed the honest gentleman's reasoning had a\r\nstrong relish of the liquor he had been drinking--\xe2\x80\x9cand I could wish, sir,\r\nit had been otherwise on an occasion of this consequence. I would\r\nrecommend to you to try to sleep for an hour.--Do these gentlemen belong\r\nto your party?\xe2\x80\x9d--looking at the Bailie and me, who, engaged in eating our\r\nsupper, had paid little attention to the officer on his entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTravellers, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Galbraith--\xe2\x80\x9clawful travellers by sea and land, as\r\nthe prayer-book hath it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, taking a light to survey us closer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care to place under arrest an elderly and a young person--and I think\r\nthese gentlemen answer nearly the description.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care what you say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie; \xe2\x80\x9cit shall not be your red\r\ncoat nor your laced hat shall protect you, if you put any affront on me.\r\nI'se convene ye baith in an action of scandal and false imprisonment--I\r\nam a free burgess and a magistrate o' Glasgow; Nicol Jarvie is my name,\r\nsae was my father's afore me--I am a bailie, be praised for the honour,\r\nand my father was a deacon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a prick-eared cur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Major Galbraith, \xe2\x80\x9cand fought agane the\r\nKing at Bothwell Brigg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe paid what he ought and what he bought, Mr. Galbraith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBailie, \xe2\x80\x9cand was an honester man than ever stude on your shanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no time to attend to all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer; \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\npositively detain you, gentlemen, unless you can produce some respectable\r\nsecurity that you are loyal subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire to be carried before some civil magistrate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBailie--\xe2\x80\x9cthe sherra or the judge of the bounds;--I am not obliged to\r\nanswer every red-coat that speers questions at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I shall know how to manage you if you are silent--And you,\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x9d (to me), \xe2\x80\x9cwhat may your name be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrancis Osbaldistone, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, a son of Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone of Northumberland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9ca son of the great William\r\nOsbaldistone of the House of Osbaldistone and Tresham, Crane-Alley,\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cyour name only increases the\r\nsuspicions against you, and lays me under the necessity of requesting\r\nthat you will give up what papers you have in charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI observed the Highlanders look anxiously at each other when this\r\nproposal was made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had none,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto surrender.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer commanded me to be disarmed and searched. To have resisted\r\nwould have been madness. I accordingly gave up my arms, and submitted to\r\na search, which was conducted as civilly as an operation of the kind well\r\ncould. They found nothing except the note which I had received that night\r\nthrough the hand of the landlady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is different from what I expected,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\r\naffords us good grounds for detaining you. Here I find you in written\r\ncommunication with the outlawed robber, Robert MacGregor Campbell, who\r\nhas been so long the plague of this district--How do you account for\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpies of Rob!\xe2\x80\x9d said Inverashalloch. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wad serve them right to strap\r\nthem up till the neist tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are gaun to see after some gear o' our ain, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBailie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat's fa'en into his hands by accident--there's nae law agane a\r\nman looking after his ain, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come by this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, addressing himself\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nI could not think of betraying the poor woman who had given it to me, and\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything of it, fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, looking at\r\nAndrew, whose jaws were chattering like a pair of castanets at the\r\nthreats thrown out by the Highlander.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO ay, I ken a' about it--it was a Hieland loon gied the letter to that\r\nlang-tongued jaud the gudewife there; I'll be sworn my maister ken'd\r\nnaething about it. But he's wilfu' to gang up the hills and speak wi'\r\nRob; and oh, sir, it wad be a charity just to send a wheen o' your\r\nred-coats to see him safe back to Glasgow again whether he will or\r\nno--And ye can keep Mr. Jarvie as lang as ye like--He's responsible\r\nenough for ony fine ye may lay on him--and so's my master for that\r\nmatter; for me, I'm just a puir gardener lad, and no worth your\r\nsteering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best thing I can do is to send these\r\npersons to the garrison under an escort. They seem to be in immediate\r\ncorrespondence with the enemy, and I shall be in no respect answerable\r\nfor suffering them to be at liberty. Gentlemen, you will consider\r\nyourselves as my prisoners. So soon as dawn approaches, I will send you\r\nto a place of security. If you be the persons you describe yourselves, it\r\nwill soon appear, and you will sustain no great inconvenience from being\r\ndetained a day or two. I can hear no remonstrances,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nturning away from the Bailie, whose mouth was open to address him; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nservice I am on gives me no time for idle discussions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, aweel, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cyou're welcome to a tune on your\r\nain fiddle; but see if I dinna gar ye dance till't afore a's dune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn anxious consultation now took place between the officer and the\r\nHighlanders, but carried on in so low a tone, that it was impossible to\r\ncatch the sense. So soon as it was concluded they all left the house. At\r\ntheir departure, the Bailie thus expressed himself:--\xe2\x80\x9cThae Hielandmen are\r\no' the westland clans, and just as light-handed as their neighbours, an\r\na' tales be true, and yet ye see they hae brought them frae the head o'\r\nArgyleshire to make war wi' puir Rob for some auld ill-will that they hae\r\nat him and his sirname. And there's the Grahames, and the Buchanans, and\r\nthe Lennox gentry, a' mounted and in order--It's weel ken'd their\r\nquarrel; and I dinna blame them--naebody likes to lose his kye. And then\r\nthere's sodgers, puir things, hoyed out frae the garrison at a' body's\r\nbidding--Puir Rob will hae his hands fu' by the time the sun comes ower\r\nthe hill. Weel--it's wrang for a magistrate to be wishing onything agane\r\nthe course o' justice, but deil o' me an I wad break my heart to hear\r\nthat Rob had gien them a' their paiks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              --General,\r\n                 Hear me, and mark me well, and look upon me\r\n                 Directly in my face--my woman's face--\r\n                 See if one fear, one shadow of a terror,\r\n                 One paleness dare appear, but from my anger,\r\n                       To lay hold on your mercies.\r\n                                               Bonduca.\r\n\r\nWe were permitted to slumber out the remainder of the night in the best\r\nmanner that the miserable accommodations of the alehouse permitted. The\r\nBailie, fatigued with his journey and the subsequent scenes--less\r\ninterested also in the event of our arrest, which to him could only be a\r\nmatter of temporary inconvenience--perhaps less nice than habit had\r\nrendered me about the cleanliness or decency of his couch,--tumbled\r\nhimself into one of the cribs which I have already described, and soon\r\nwas heard to snore soundly. A broken sleep, snatched by intervals, while\r\nI rested my head upon the table, was my only refreshment. In the course\r\nof the night I had occasion to observe that there seemed to be some doubt\r\nand hesitation in the motions of the soldiery. Men were sent out, as if\r\nto obtain intelligence, and returned apparently without bringing any\r\nsatisfactory information to their commanding officer. He was obviously\r\neager and anxious, and again despatched small parties of two or three\r\nmen, some of whom, as I could understand from what the others whispered\r\nto each other, did not return again to the Clachan.\r\n\r\nThe morning had broken, when a corporal and two men rushed into the hut,\r\ndragging after them, in a sort of triumph, a Highlander, whom I\r\nimmediately recognised as my acquaintance the ex-turnkey. The Bailie, who\r\nstarted up at the noise with which they entered, immediately made the\r\nsame discovery, and exclaimed--\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us! they hae grippit the puir\r\ncreature Dougal.--Captain, I will put in bail--sufficient bail, for that\r\nDougal creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this offer, dictated undoubtedly by a grateful recollection of the\r\nlate interference of the Highlander in his behalf, the Captain only\r\nanswered by requesting Mr. Jarvie to \xe2\x80\x9cmind his own affairs, and remember\r\nthat he was himself for the present a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take you to witness, Mr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, who was\r\nprobably better acquainted with the process in civil than in military\r\ncases, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has refused sufficient bail. It's my opinion that the\r\ncreature Dougal will have a good action of wrongous imprisonment and\r\ndamages agane him, under the Act seventeen hundred and one, and I'll see\r\nthe creature righted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer, whose name I understood was Thornton, paying no attention to\r\nthe Bailie's threats or expostulations, instituted a very close inquiry\r\ninto Dougal's life and conversation, and compelled him to admit, though\r\nwith apparent reluctance, the successive facts,--that he knew Rob Roy\r\nMacGregor--that he had seen him within these twelve months--within these\r\nsix months--within this month--within this week; in fine, that he had\r\nparted from him only an hour ago. All this detail came like drops of\r\nblood from the prisoner, and was, to all appearance, only extorted by the\r\nthreat of a halter and the next tree, which Captain Thornton assured him\r\nshould be his doom, if he did not give direct and special information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will please inform me how\r\nmany men your master has with him at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDougal looked in every direction except at the querist, and began to\r\nanswer, \xe2\x80\x9cShe canna just be sure about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me, you Highland dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cand remember your life\r\ndepends on your answer. How many rogues had that outlawed scoundrel with\r\nhim when you left him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, no aboon sax rogues when I was gane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where are the rest of his banditti?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGane wi' the Lieutenant agane ta westland carles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst the westland clans?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cUmph--that is likely\r\nenough; and what rogue's errand were you despatched upon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust to see what your honour and ta gentlemen red-coats were doing doun\r\nhere at ta Clachan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe creature will prove fause-hearted, after a',\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, who\r\nby this time had planted himself close behind me; \xe2\x80\x9cit's lucky I didna pit\r\nmysell to expenses anent him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9clet us understand each other.\r\nYou have confessed yourself a spy, and should string up to the next\r\ntree--But come, if you will do me one good turn, I will do you another.\r\nYou, Donald--you shall just, in the way of kindness, carry me and a small\r\nparty to the place where you left your master, as I wish to speak a few\r\nwords with him on serious affairs; and I'll let you go about your\r\nbusiness, and give you five guineas to boot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOigh! oigh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Dougal, in the extremity of distress and\r\nperplexity; \xe2\x80\x9cshe canna do tat--she canna do tat; she'll rather be\r\nhanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHanged, then, you shall be, my friend\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer; \xe2\x80\x9cand your blood\r\nbe upon your own head. Corporal Cramp, do you play Provost-Marshal--away\r\nwith him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe corporal had confronted poor Dougal for some time, ostentatiously\r\ntwisting a piece of cord which he had found in the house into the form of\r\na halter. He now threw it about the culprit's neck, and, with the\r\nassistance of two soldiers, had dragged Dougal as far as the door, when,\r\novercome with the terror of immediate death, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cShentlemans,\r\nstops--stops! She'll do his honour's bidding--stops!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwa' wi' the creature!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9che deserves hanging mair now\r\nthan ever; awa' wi' him, corporal. Why dinna ye tak him awa'?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's my belief and opinion, honest gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nif you were going to be hanged yourself, you would be in no such d--d\r\nhurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis by-dialogue prevented my hearing what passed between the prisoner\r\nand Captain Thornton; but I heard the former snivel out, in a very\r\nsubdued tone, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd ye'll ask her to gang nae farther than just to show ye\r\nwhere the MacGregor is?--Ohon! ohon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence your howling, you rascal--No; I give you my word I will ask you\r\nto go no farther.--Corporal, make the men fall in, in front of the\r\nhouses. Get out these gentlemen's horses; we must carry them with us. I\r\ncannot spare any men to guard them here. Come, my lads, get under arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldiers bustled about, and were ready to move. We were led out,\r\nalong with Dougal, in the capacity of prisoners. As we left the hut, I\r\nheard our companion in captivity remind the Captain of \xe2\x80\x9cta foive\r\nkuineas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, putting gold into his hand;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut observe, that if you attempt to mislead me, I will blow your brains\r\nout with my own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe creature,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cis waur than I judged him--it is a\r\nwarldly and a perfidious creature. O the filthy lucre of gain that men\r\ngies themsells up to! My father the deacon used to say, the penny siller\r\nslew mair souls than the naked sword slew bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady now approached, and demanded payment of her reckoning,\r\nincluding all that had been quaffed by Major Galbraith and his Highland\r\nfriends. The English officer remonstrated, but Mrs. MacAlpine declared,\r\nif \xe2\x80\x9cshe hadna trusted to his honour's name being used in their company,\r\nshe wad never hae drawn them a stoup o' liquor; for Mr. Galbraith, she\r\nmight see him again, or she might no, but weel did she wot she had sma'\r\nchance of seeing her siller--and she was a puir widow, had naething but\r\nher custom to rely on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Thornton put a stop to her remonstrances by paying the charge,\r\nwhich was only a few English shillings, though the amount sounded very\r\nformidable in Scottish denominations. The generous officer would have\r\nincluded Mr. Jarvie and me in this general acquittance; but the Bailie,\r\ndisregarding an intimation from the landlady to \xe2\x80\x9cmake as muckle of the\r\nInglishers as we could, for they were sure to gie us plague eneugh,\xe2\x80\x9d went\r\ninto a formal accounting respecting our share of the reckoning, and paid\r\nit accordingly. The Captain took the opportunity to make us some slight\r\napology for detaining us. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we were loyal and peaceable subjects,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwe would not regret being stopt for a day, when it was essential\r\nto the king's service; if otherwise, he was acting according to his\r\nduty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were compelled to accept an apology which it would have served no\r\npurpose to refuse, and we sallied out to attend him on his march.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the delightful sensation with which I exchanged the\r\ndark, smoky, smothering atmosphere of the Highland hut, in which we had\r\npassed the night so uncomfortably, for the refreshing fragrance of the\r\nmorning air, and the glorious beams of the rising sun, which, from a\r\ntabernacle of purple and golden clouds, were darted full on such a scene\r\nof natural romance and beauty as had never before greeted my eyes. To the\r\nleft lay the valley, down which the Forth wandered on its easterly\r\ncourse, surrounding the beautiful detached hill, with all its garland of\r\nwoods. On the right, amid a profusion of thickets, knolls, and crags, lay\r\nthe bed of a broad mountain lake, lightly curled into tiny waves by the\r\nbreath of the morning breeze, each glittering in its course under the\r\ninfluence of the sunbeams. High hills, rocks, and banks, waving with\r\nnatural forests of birch and oak, formed the borders of this enchanting\r\nsheet of water; and, as their leaves rustled to the wind and twinkled in\r\nthe sun, gave to the depth of solitude a sort of life and vivacity. Man\r\nalone seemed to be placed in a state of inferiority, in a scene where all\r\nthe ordinary features of nature were raised and exalted. The miserable\r\nlittle _bourocks,_ as the Bailie termed them, of which about a dozen\r\nformed the village called the Clachan of Aberfoil, were composed of loose\r\nstones, cemented by clay instead of mortar, and thatched by turfs, laid\r\nrudely upon rafters formed of native and unhewn birches and oaks from the\r\nwoods around. The roofs approached the ground so nearly, that Andrew\r\nFairservice observed we might have ridden over the village the night\r\nbefore, and never found out we were near it, unless our horses' feet had\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgane through the riggin'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom all we could see, Mrs. MacAlpine's house, miserable as were the\r\nquarters it afforded, was still by far the best in the hamlet; and I dare\r\nsay (if my description gives you any curiosity to see it) you will hardly\r\nfind it much improved at the present day, for the Scotch are not a people\r\nwho speedily admit innovation, even when it comes in the shape of\r\nimprovement.*\r\n\r\n* Note I. Clachan of Aberfoil.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these miserable dwellings were disturbed by the noise\r\nof our departure; and as our party of about twenty soldiers drew up in\r\nrank before marching off, we were reconnoitred by many a beldam from the\r\nhalf-opened door of her cottage. As these sibyls thrust forth their grey\r\nheads, imperfectly covered with close caps of flannel, and showed their\r\nshrivelled brows, and long skinny arms, with various gestures, shrugs,\r\nand muttered expressions in Gaelic addressed to each other, my\r\nimagination recurred to the witches of Macbeth, and I imagined I read in\r\nthe features of these crones the malevolence of the weird sisters. The\r\nlittle children also, who began to crawl forth, some quite naked, and\r\nothers very imperfectly covered with tatters of tartan stuff, clapped\r\ntheir tiny hands, and grinned at the English soldiers, with an expression\r\nof national hate and malignity which seemed beyond their years. I\r\nremarked particularly that there were no men, nor so much as a boy of ten\r\nor twelve years old, to be seen among the inhabitants of a village which\r\nseemed populous in proportion to its extent; and the idea certainly\r\noccurred to me, that we were likely to receive from them, in the course\r\nof our journey, more effectual tokens of ill-will than those which\r\nlowered on the visages, and dictated the murmurs, of the women and\r\nchildren. It was not until we commenced our march that the malignity of\r\nthe elder persons of the community broke forth into expressions. The last\r\nfile of men had left the village, to pursue a small broken track, formed\r\nby the sledges in which the natives transported their peats and turfs,\r\nand which led through the woods that fringed the lower end of the lake,\r\nwhen a shrilly sound of female exclamation broke forth, mixed with the\r\nscreams of children, the whooping of boys, and the clapping of hands,\r\nwith which the Highland dames enforce their notes, whether of rage or\r\nlamentation. I asked Andrew, who looked as pale as death, what all this\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt we'll ken that ower sune,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cMeans? It means that the\r\nHighland wives are cursing and banning the red-coats, and wishing\r\nill-luck to them, and ilka ane that ever spoke the Saxon tongue. I have\r\nheard wives flyte in England and Scotland--it's nae marvel to hear them\r\nflyte ony gate; but sic ill-scrapit tongues as thae Highland\r\ncarlines'--and sic grewsome wishes, that men should be slaughtered like\r\nsheep--and that they may lapper their hands to the elbows in their\r\nheart's blude--and that they suld dee the death of Walter Cuming of\r\nGuiyock,* wha hadna as muckle o' him left thegither as would supper a\r\nmessan-dog--sic awsome language as that I ne'er heard out o' a human\r\nthrapple;--and, unless the deil wad rise amang them to gie them a\r\nlesson, I thinkna that their talent at cursing could be amended.\r\n\r\n* A great feudal oppressor, who, riding on some cruel purpose through the\r\nforest of Guiyock, was thrown from his horse, and his foot being caught\r\nin the stirrup, was dragged along by the frightened animal till he was\r\ntorn to pieces. The expression, \xe2\x80\x9cWalter of Guiyock's curse,\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nproverbial.\r\n\r\nThe warst o't is, they bid us aye gang up the loch, and see what we'll\r\nland in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdding Andrew's information to what I had myself observed, I could scarce\r\ndoubt that some attack was meditated upon our party. The road, as we\r\nadvanced, seemed to afford every facility for such an unpleasant\r\ninterruption. At first it winded apart from the lake through marshy\r\nmeadow ground, overgrown with copsewood, now traversing dark and close\r\nthickets which would have admitted an ambuscade to be sheltered within a\r\nfew yards of our line of march, and frequently crossing rough mountain\r\ntorrents, some of which took the soldiers up to the knees, and ran with\r\nsuch violence, that their force could only be stemmed by the strength of\r\ntwo or three men holding fast by each other's arms. It certainly appeared\r\nto me, though altogether unacquainted with military affairs, that a sort\r\nof half-savage warriors, as I had heard the Highlanders asserted to be,\r\nmight, in such passes as these, attack a party of regular forces with\r\ngreat advantage. The Bailie's good sense and shrewd observation had led\r\nhim to the same conclusion, as I understood from his requesting to speak\r\nwith the captain, whom he addressed nearly in the following terms:--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, it's no to fleech ony favour out o' ye, for I scorn it--and\r\nit's under protest that I reserve my action and pleas of oppression and\r\nwrongous imprisonment;--but, being a friend to King George and his army,\r\nI take the liberty to speer--Dinna ye think ye might tak a better time to\r\ngang up this glen? If ye are seeking Rob Roy, he's ken'd to be better\r\nthan half a hunder men strong when he's at the fewest; an if he brings in\r\nthe Glengyle folk, and the Glenfinlas and Balquhidder lads, he may come\r\nto gie you your kail through the reek; and it's my sincere advice, as a\r\nking's friend, ye had better tak back again to the Clachan, for thae\r\nwomen at Aberfoil are like the scarts and seamaws at the Cumries--there's\r\naye foul weather follows their skirting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake yourself easy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Thornton; \xe2\x80\x9cI am in the\r\nexecution of my orders. And as you say you are a friend to King George,\r\nyou will be glad to learn that it is impossible that this gang of\r\nruffians, whose license has disturbed the country so long, can escape the\r\nmeasures now taken to suppress them. The horse squadron of militia,\r\ncommanded by Major Galbraith, is already joined by two or more troops of\r\ncavalry, which will occupy all the lower passes of this wild country;\r\nthree hundred Highlanders, under the two gentlemen you saw at the inn,\r\nare in possession of the upper part, and various strong parties from the\r\ngarrison are securing the hills and glens in different directions. Our\r\nlast accounts of Rob Roy correspond with what this fellow has confessed,\r\nthat, finding himself surrounded on all sides, he had dismissed the\r\ngreater part of his followers, with the purpose either of lying\r\nconcealed, or of making his escape through his superior knowledge of the\r\npasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cthere's mair brandy than brains in\r\nGarschattachin's head this morning--And I wadna, an I were you, Captain,\r\nrest my main dependence on the Hielandmen--hawks winna pike out hawks'\r\neen. They may quarrel among themsells, and gie ilk ither ill names, and\r\nmaybe a slash wi' a claymore; but they are sure to join in the lang run,\r\nagainst a' civilised folk, that wear breeks on their hinder ends, and hae\r\npurses in their pouches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently these admonitions were not altogether thrown away on Captain\r\nThornton. He reformed his line of march, commanded his soldiers to\r\nunsling their firelocks and fix their bayonets, and formed an advanced\r\nand rear-guard, each consisting of a non-commissioned officer and two\r\nsoldiers, who received strict orders to keep an alert look-out. Dougal\r\nunderwent another and very close examination, in which he steadfastly\r\nasserted the truth of what he had before affirmed; and being rebuked on\r\naccount of the suspicious and dangerous appearance of the route by which\r\nhe was guiding them, he answered with a sort of testiness that seemed\r\nvery natural, \xe2\x80\x9cHer nainsell didna mak ta road; an shentlemans likit grand\r\nroads, she suld hae pided at Glasco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this passed off well enough, and we resumed our progress.\r\n\r\nOur route, though leading towards the lake, had hitherto been so much\r\nshaded by wood, that we only from time to time obtained a glimpse of that\r\nbeautiful sheet of water. But the road now suddenly emerged from the\r\nforest ground, and, winding close by the margin of the loch, afforded us\r\na full view of its spacious mirror, which now, the breeze having totally\r\nsubsided, reflected in still magnificence the high dark heathy mountains,\r\nhuge grey rocks, and shaggy banks, by which it is encircled. The hills\r\nnow sunk on its margin so closely, and were so broken and precipitous, as\r\nto afford no passage except just upon the narrow line of the track which\r\nwe occupied, and which was overhung with rocks, from which we might have\r\nbeen destroyed merely by rolling down stones, without much possibility of\r\noffering resistance. Add to this, that, as the road winded round every\r\npromontory and bay which indented the lake, there was rarely a\r\npossibility of seeing a hundred yards before us. Our commander appeared\r\nto take some alarm at the nature of the pass in which he was engaged,\r\nwhich displayed itself in repeated orders to his soldiers to be on the\r\nalert, and in many threats of instant death to Dougal, if he should be\r\nfound to have led them into danger. Dougal received these threats with an\r\nair of stupid impenetrability, which might arise either from conscious\r\ninnocence, or from dogged resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf shentlemans were seeking ta Red Gregarach,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto be sure they\r\ncouldna expect to find her without some wee danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust as the Highlander uttered these words, a halt was made by the\r\ncorporal commanding the advance, who sent back one of the file who formed\r\nit, to tell the Captain that the path in front was occupied by\r\nHighlanders, stationed on a commanding point of particular difficulty.\r\nAlmost at the same instant a soldier from the rear came to say, that they\r\nheard the sound of a bagpipe in the woods through which we had just\r\npassed. Captain Thornton, a man of conduct as well as courage, instantly\r\nresolved to force the pass in front, without waiting till he was assailed\r\nfrom the rear; and, assuring his soldiers that the bagpipes which they\r\nheard were those of the friendly Highlanders who were advancing to their\r\nassistance, he stated to them the importance of advancing and securing\r\nRob Roy, if possible, before these auxiliaries should come up to divide\r\nwith them the honour, as well as the reward which was placed on the head\r\nof this celebrated freebooter. He therefore ordered the rearguard to join\r\nthe centre, and both to close up to the advance, doubling his files so as\r\nto occupy with his column the whole practicable part of the road, and to\r\npresent such a front as its breadth admitted. Dougal, to whom he said in\r\na whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cYou dog, if you have deceived me, you shall die for it!\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nplaced in the centre, between two grenadiers, with positive orders to\r\nshoot him if he attempted an escape. The same situation was assigned to\r\nus, as being the safest, and Captain Thornton, taking his half-pike from\r\nthe soldier who carried it, placed himself at the head of his little\r\ndetachment, and gave the word to march forward.\r\n\r\nThe party advanced with the firmness of English soldiers. Not so Andrew\r\nFairservice, who was frightened out of his wits; and not so, if truth\r\nmust be told, either the Bailie or I myself, who, without feeling the\r\nsame degree of trepidation, could not with stoical indifference see our\r\nlives exposed to hazard in a quarrel with which we had no concern. But\r\nthere was neither time for remonstrance nor remedy.\r\n\r\nWe approached within about twenty yards of the spot where the advanced\r\nguard had seen some appearance of an enemy. It was one of those\r\npromontories which run into the lake, and round the base of which the\r\nroad had hitherto winded in the manner I have described. In the present\r\ncase, however, the path, instead of keeping the water's edge, sealed the\r\npromontory by one or two rapid zigzags, carried in a broken track along\r\nthe precipitous face of a slaty grey rock, which would otherwise have\r\nbeen absolutely inaccessible. On the top of this rock, only to be\r\napproached by a road so broken, so narrow, and so precarious, the\r\ncorporal declared he had seen the bonnets and long-barrelled guns of\r\nseveral mountaineers, apparently couched among the long heath and\r\nbrushwood which crested the eminence. Captain Thornton ordered him to\r\nmove forward with three files, to dislodge the supposed ambuscade, while,\r\nat a more slow but steady pace, he advanced to his support with the rest\r\nof his party.\r\n\r\nThe attack which he meditated was prevented by the unexpected apparition\r\nof a female upon the summit of the rock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a commanding tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me what ye seek in\r\nMacGregor's country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have seldom seen a finer or more commanding form than this woman. She\r\nmight be between the term of forty and fifty years, and had a countenance\r\nwhich must once have been of a masculine cast of beauty; though now,\r\nimprinted with deep lines by exposure to rough weather, and perhaps by\r\nthe wasting influence of grief and passion, its features were only\r\nstrong, harsh, and expressive. She wore her plaid, not drawn around her\r\nhead and shoulders, as is the fashion of the women in Scotland, but\r\ndisposed around her body as the Highland soldiers wear theirs. She had a\r\nman's bonnet, with a feather in it, an unsheathed sword in her hand, and\r\na pair of pistols at her girdle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's Helen Campbell, Rob's wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, in a whisper of\r\nconsiderable alarm; \xe2\x80\x9cand there will be broken heads amang us or it's\r\nlang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat seek ye here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked again of Captain Thornton, who had himself\r\nadvanced to reconnoitre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe seek the outlaw, Rob Roy MacGregor Campbell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the officer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand make no war on women; therefore offer no vain opposition to the\r\nking's troops, and assure yourself of civil treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the Amazon, \xe2\x80\x9cI am no stranger to your tender mercies. Ye\r\nhave left me neither name nor fame--my mother's bones will shrink aside\r\nin their grave when mine are laid beside them--Ye have left me neither\r\nhouse nor hold, blanket nor bedding, cattle to feed us, or flocks to\r\nclothe us--Ye have taken from us all--all!--The very name of our\r\nancestors have ye taken away, and now ye come for our lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seek no man's life,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cI only execute my orders.\r\nIf you are alone, good woman, you have nought to fear--if there are any\r\nwith you so rash as to offer useless resistance, their own blood be on\r\ntheir own heads. Move forward, sergeant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForward! march!\xe2\x80\x9d said the non-commissioned officer. \xe2\x80\x9cHuzza, my boys, for\r\nRob Roy's head and a purse of gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe quickened his pace into a run, followed by the six soldiers; but as\r\nthey attained the first traverse of the ascent, the flash of a dozen of\r\nfirelocks from various parts of the pass parted in quick succession and\r\ndeliberate aim. The sergeant, shot through the body, still struggled to\r\ngain the ascent, raised himself by his hands to clamber up the face of\r\nthe rock, but relaxed his grasp, after a desperate effort, and falling,\r\nrolled from the face of the cliff into the deep lake, where he perished.\r\nOf the soldiers, three fell, slain or disabled; the others retreated on\r\ntheir main body, all more or less wounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrenadiers, to the front!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Thornton.--You are to recollect,\r\nthat in those days this description of soldiers actually carried that\r\ndestructive species of firework from which they derive their name. The\r\nfour grenadiers moved to the front accordingly. The officer commanded the\r\nrest of the party to be ready to support them, and only saying to us,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook to your safety, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d gave, in rapid succession, the word to\r\nthe grenadiers--\xe2\x80\x9cOpen your pouches--handle your grenades--blow your\r\nmatches--fall on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole advanced with a shout, headed by Captain Thornton,--the\r\ngrenadiers preparing to throw their grenades among the bushes where the\r\nambuscade lay, and the musketeers to support them by an instant and close\r\nassault. Dougal, forgotten in the scuffle, wisely crept into the thicket\r\nwhich overhung that part of the road where we had first halted, which he\r\nascended with the activity of a wild cat. I followed his example,\r\ninstinctively recollecting that the fire of the Highlanders would sweep\r\nthe open track. I clambered until out of breath; for a continued\r\nspattering fire, in which every shot was multiplied by a thousand echoes,\r\nthe hissing of the kindled fusees of the grenades, and the successive\r\nexplosion of those missiles, mingled with the huzzas of the soldiers, and\r\nthe yells and cries of their Highland antagonists, formed a contrast\r\nwhich added--I do not shame to own it--wings to my desire to reach a\r\nplace of safety. The difficulties of the ascent soon increased so much,\r\nthat I despaired of reaching Dougal, who seemed to swing himself from\r\nrock to rock, and stump to stump, with the facility of a squirrel, and I\r\nturned down my eyes to see what had become of my other companions. Both\r\nwere brought to a very awkward standstill.\r\n\r\nThe Bailie, to whom I suppose fear had given a temporary share of\r\nagility, had ascended about twenty feet from the path, when his foot\r\nslipping, as he straddled from one huge fragment of rock to another, he\r\nwould have slumbered with his father the deacon, whose acts and words he\r\nwas so fond of quoting, but for a projecting branch of a ragged thorn,\r\nwhich, catching hold of the skirts of his riding-coat, supported him in\r\nmid-air, where he dangled not unlike to the sign of the Golden Fleece\r\nover the door of a mercer in the Trongate of his native city.\r\n\r\nAs for Andrew Fairservice, he had advanced with better success, until he\r\nhad attained the top of a bare cliff, which, rising above the wood,\r\nexposed him, at least in his own opinion, to all the dangers of the\r\nneighbouring skirmish, while, at the same time, it was of such a\r\nprecipitous and impracticable nature, that he dared neither to advance\r\nnor retreat. Footing it up and down upon the narrow space which the top\r\nof the cliff afforded (very like a fellow at a country-fair dancing upon\r\na trencher), he roared for mercy in Gaelic and English alternately,\r\naccording to the side on which the scale of victory seemed to\r\npredominate, while his exclamations were only answered by the groans of\r\nthe Bailie, who suffered much, not only from apprehension, but from the\r\npendulous posture in which he hung suspended by the loins.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving the Bailie's precarious situation, my first idea was to\r\nattempt to render him assistance; but this was impossible without the\r\nconcurrence of Andrew, whom neither sign, nor entreaty, nor command, nor\r\nexpostulation, could inspire with courage to adventure the descent from\r\nhis painful elevation, where, like an unskilful and obnoxious minister of\r\nstate, unable to escape from the eminence to which he had presumptuously\r\nascended, he continued to pour forth piteous prayers for mercy, which no\r\none heard, and to skip to and fro, writhing his body into all possible\r\nantic shapes to avoid the balls which he conceived to be whistling around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes this cause of terror ceased, for the fire, at first so\r\nwell sustained, now sunk at once--a sure sign that the conflict was\r\nconcluded. To gain some spot from which I could see how the day had gone\r\nwas now my object, in order to appeal to the mercy of the victors, who, I\r\ntrusted (whichever side might be gainers), would not suffer the honest\r\nBailie to remain suspended, like the coffin of Mahomet, between heaven\r\nand earth, without lending a hand to disengage him. At length, by dint of\r\nscrambling, I found a spot which commanded a view of the field of battle.\r\nIt was indeed ended; and, as my mind already augured, from the place and\r\ncircumstances attending the contest, it had terminated in the defeat of\r\nCaptain Thornton. I saw a party of Highlanders in the act of disarming\r\nthat officer, and the scanty remainder of his party. They consisted of\r\nabout twelve men most of whom were wounded, who, surrounded by treble\r\ntheir number, and without the power either to advance or retreat, exposed\r\nto a murderous and well-aimed fire, which they had no means of returning\r\nwith effect, had at length laid down their arms by the order of their\r\nofficer, when he saw that the road in his rear was occupied, and that\r\nprotracted resistance would be only wasting the lives of his brave\r\nfollowers. By the Highlanders, who fought under cover, the victory was\r\ncheaply bought, at the expense of one man slain and two wounded by the\r\ngrenades. All this I learned afterwards. At present I only comprehended\r\nthe general result of the day, from seeing the English officer, whose\r\nface was covered with blood, stripped of his hat and arms, and his men,\r\nwith sullen and dejected countenances which marked their deep regret,\r\nenduring, from the wild and martial figures who surrounded them, the\r\nsevere measures to which the laws of war subject the vanquished for\r\nsecurity of the victors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cWoe to the vanquished!\xe2\x80\x9d was stern Brenno's word,\r\n             When sunk proud Rome beneath the Gallic sword--\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cWoe to the vanquished!\xe2\x80\x9d when his massive blade\r\n             Bore down the scale against her ransom weigh'd;\r\n                And on the field of foughten battle still,\r\n                Woe knows no limits save the victor's will.\r\n                                                  The Gaulliad.\r\n\r\nI anxiously endeavoured to distinguish Dougal among the victors. I had\r\nlittle doubt that the part he had played was assumed, on purpose to lead\r\nthe English officer into the defile, and I could not help admiring the\r\naddress with which the ignorant, and apparently half-brutal savage, had\r\nveiled his purpose, and the affected reluctance with which he had\r\nsuffered to be extracted from him the false information which it must\r\nhave been his purpose from the beginning to communicate. I foresaw we\r\nshould incur some danger on approaching the victors in the first flush of\r\ntheir success, which was not unstained with cruelty; for one or two of\r\nthe soldiers, whose wounds prevented them from rising, were poniarded by\r\nthe victors, or rather by some ragged Highland boys who had mingled with\r\nthem. I concluded, therefore, it would be unsafe to present ourselves\r\nwithout some mediator; and as Campbell, whom I now could not but identify\r\nwith the celebrated freebooter Rob Roy, was nowhere to be seen, I\r\nresolved to claim the protection of his emissary, Dougal.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing everywhere in vain, I at length retraced my steps to see\r\nwhat assistance I could individually render to my unlucky friend, when,\r\nto my great joy, I saw Mr. Jarvie delivered from his state of suspense;\r\nand though very black in the face, and much deranged in the garments,\r\nsafely seated beneath the rock, in front of which he had been so lately\r\nsuspended. I hastened to join him and offer my congratulations, which he\r\nwas at first far from receiving in the spirit of cordiality with which\r\nthey were offered. A heavy fit of coughing scarce permitted him breath\r\nenough to express the broken hints which he threw out against my\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh! uh! uh! uh!--they say a friend--uh! uh!--a friend sticketh closer\r\nthan a brither--uh! uh! uh! When I came up here, Maister Osbaldistone, to\r\nthis country, cursed of God and man--uh! uh--Heaven forgie me for\r\nswearing--on nae man's errand but yours, d'ye think it was fair--uh! uh!\r\nuh!--to leave me, first, to be shot or drowned atween red-wad Highlanders\r\nand red-coats; and next to be hung up between heaven and earth, like an\r\nauld potato-bogle, without sae muckle as trying--uh! uh!--sae muckle as\r\ntrying to relieve me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made a thousand apologies, and laboured so hard to represent the\r\nimpossibility of my affording him relief by my own unassisted exertions,\r\nthat at length I succeeded, and the Bailie, who was as placable as hasty\r\nin his temper, extended his favour to me once more. I next took the\r\nliberty of asking him how he had contrived to extricate himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe extricate! I might hae hung there till the day of judgment or I could\r\nhae helped mysell, wi' my head hinging down on the tae side, and my heels\r\non the tother, like the yarn-scales in the weigh-house. It was the\r\ncreature Dougal that extricated me, as he did yestreen; he cuttit aff the\r\ntails o' my coat wi' his durk, and another gillie and him set me on my\r\nlegs as cleverly as if I had never been aff them. But to see what a thing\r\ngude braid claith is! Had I been in ony o' your rotten French camlets\r\nnow, or your drab-de-berries, it would hae screeded like an auld rag wi'\r\nsic a weight as mine. But fair fa' the weaver that wrought the weft\r\no't--I swung and bobbit yonder as safe as a gabbart* that's moored by a\r\nthree-ply cable at the Broomielaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* A kind of lighter used in the river Clyde,--probably from the French *\r\n_abare._\r\n\r\nI now inquired what had become of his preserver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe creature,\xe2\x80\x9d so he continued to call the Highlandman, \xe2\x80\x9ccontrived to\r\nlet me ken there wad be danger in gaun near the leddy till he came back,\r\nand bade me stay here. I am o' the mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he's\r\nseeking after you--it's a considerate creature--and troth, I wad swear he\r\nwas right about the leddy, as he ca's her, too--Helen Campbell was nane\r\no' the maist douce maidens, nor meekest wives neither, and folk say that\r\nRob himsell stands in awe o' her. I doubt she winna ken me, for it's mony\r\nyears since we met--I am clear for waiting for the Dougal creature or we\r\ngang near her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified my acquiescence in this reasoning; but it was not the will of\r\nfate that day that the Bailie's prudence should profit himself or any one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nAndrew Fairservice, though he had ceased to caper on the pinnacle upon\r\nthe cessation of the firing, which had given occasion for his whimsical\r\nexercise, continued, as perched on the top of an exposed cliff, too\r\nconspicuous an object to escape the sharp eyes of the Highlanders, when\r\nthey had time to look a little around them. We were apprized he was\r\ndiscovered, by a wild and loud halloo set up among the assembled victors,\r\nthree or four of whom instantly plunged into the copsewood, and ascended\r\nthe rocky side of the hill in different directions towards the place\r\nwhere they had discovered this whimsical apparition.\r\n\r\nThose who arrived first within gunshot of poor Andrew, did not trouble\r\nthemselves to offer him any assistance in the ticklish posture of his\r\naffairs, but levelling their long Spanish-barrelled guns, gave him to\r\nunderstand, by signs which admitted of no misconstruction, that he must\r\ncontrive to come down and submit himself to their mercy, or to be marked\r\nat from beneath, like a regimental target set up for ball-practice. With\r\nsuch a formidable hint for venturous exertion, Andrew Fairservice could\r\nno longer hesitate; the more imminent peril overcame his sense of that\r\nwhich seemed less inevitable, and he began to descend the cliff at all\r\nrisks, clutching to the ivy and oak stumps, and projecting fragments of\r\nrock, with an almost feverish anxiety, and never failing, as\r\ncircumstances left him a hand at liberty, to extend it to the plaided\r\ngentry below in an attitude of supplication, as if to deprecate the\r\ndischarge of their levelled firearms. In a word, the fellow, under the\r\ninfluence of a counteracting motive for terror, achieved a safe descent\r\nfrom his perilous eminence, which, I verily believe, nothing but the fear\r\nof instant death could have moved him to attempt. The awkward mode of\r\nAndrew's descent greatly amused the Highlanders below, who fired a shot\r\nor two while he was engaged in it, without the purpose of injuring him,\r\nas I believe, but merely to enhance the amusement they derived from his\r\nextreme terror, and the superlative exertions of agility to which it\r\nexcited him.\r\n\r\nAt length he attained firm and comparatively level ground--or rather, to\r\nspeak more correctly, his foot slipping at the last point of descent, he\r\nfell on the earth at his full length, and was raised by the assistance of\r\nthe Highlanders, who stood to receive him, and who, ere he gained his\r\nlegs, stripped him not only of the whole contents of his pockets, but of\r\nperiwig, hat, coat, doublet, stockings, and shoes, performing the feat\r\nwith such admirable celerity, that, although he fell on his back a\r\nwell-clothed and decent burgher-seeming serving-man, he arose a forked,\r\nuncased, bald-pated, beggarly-looking scarecrow. Without respect to the\r\npain which his undefended toes experienced from the sharp encounter of\r\nthe rocks over which they hurried him, those who had detected Andrew\r\nproceeded to drag him downward towards the road through all the\r\nintervening obstacles.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their descent, Mr. Jarvie and I became exposed to their\r\nlynx-eyed observation, and instantly half-a-dozen of armed Highlanders\r\nthronged around us, with drawn dirks and swords pointed at our faces and\r\nthroats, and cocked pistols presented against our bodies. To have offered\r\nresistance would have been madness, especially as we had no weapons\r\ncapable of supporting such a demonstration. We therefore submitted to our\r\nfate; and with great roughness on the part of those who assisted at our\r\ntoilette, were in the act of being reduced to as unsophisticated a state\r\n(to use King Lear's phrase) as the plume-less biped Andrew Fairservice,\r\nwho stood shivering between fear and cold at a few yards' distance. Good\r\nchance, however, saved us from this extremity of wretchedness; for, just\r\nas I had yielded up my cravat (a smart Steinkirk, by the way, and richly\r\nlaced), and the Bailie had been disrobed of the fragments of his\r\nriding-coat--enter Dougal, and the scene was changed. By a high tone of\r\nexpostulation, mixed with oaths and threats, as far as I could conjecture\r\nthe tenor of his language from the violence of his gestures, he compelled\r\nthe plunderers, however reluctant, not only to give up their further\r\ndepredations on our property, but to restore the spoil they had already\r\nappropriated. He snatched my cravat from the fellow who had seized it,\r\nand twisted it (in the zeal of his restitution) around my neck with such\r\nsuffocating energy as made me think that he had not only been, during his\r\nresidence at Glasgow, a substitute of the jailor, but must moreover have\r\ntaken lessons as an apprentice of the hangman. He flung the tattered\r\nremnants of Mr. Jarvie's coat around his shoulders, and as more\r\nHighlanders began to flock towards us from the high road, he led the way\r\ndownwards, directing and commanding the others to afford us, but\r\nparticularly the Bailie, the assistance necessary to our descending with\r\ncomparative ease and safety. It was, however, in vain that Andrew\r\nFairservice employed his lungs in obsecrating a share of Dougal's\r\nprotection, or at least his interference to procure restoration of his\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dougal in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cshe's nae gentle pody, I trow; her\r\npetters hae ganged parefoot, or she's muckle mista'en.\xe2\x80\x9d And, leaving\r\nAndrew to follow at his leisure, or rather at such leisure as the\r\nsurrounding crowd were pleased to indulge him with, he hurried us down to\r\nthe pathway in which the skirmish had been fought, and hastened to\r\npresent us as additional captives to the female leader of his band.\r\n\r\nWe were dragged before her accordingly, Dougal fighting, struggling,\r\nscreaming, as if he were the party most apprehensive of hurt, and\r\nrepulsing, by threats and efforts, all those who attempted to take a\r\nnearer interest in our capture than he seemed to do himself. At length we\r\nwere placed before the heroine of the day, whose appearance, as well as\r\nthose of the savage, uncouth, yet martial figures who surrounded us,\r\nstruck me, to own the truth, with considerable apprehension. I do not\r\nknow if Helen MacGregor had personally mingled in the fray, and indeed I\r\nwas afterwards given to understand the contrary; but the specks of blood\r\non her brow, her hands and naked arms, as well as on the blade of her\r\nsword which she continued to hold in her hand--her flushed countenance,\r\nand the disordered state of the raven locks which escaped from under the\r\nred bonnet and plume that formed her head-dress, seemed all to intimate\r\nthat she had taken an immediate share in the conflict. Her keen black\r\neyes and features expressed an imagination inflamed by the pride of\r\ngratified revenge, and the triumph of victory. Yet there was nothing\r\npositively sanguinary, or cruel, in her deportment; and she reminded me,\r\nwhen the immediate alarm of the interview was over, of some of the\r\npaintings I had seen of the inspired heroines in the Catholic churches of\r\nFrance. She was not, indeed, sufficiently beautiful for a Judith, nor had\r\nshe the inspired expression of features which painters have given to\r\nDeborah, or to the wife of Heber the Kenite, at whose feet the strong\r\noppressor of Israel, who dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles, bowed\r\ndown, fell, and lay a dead man. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm by which she\r\nwas agitated gave her countenance and deportment, wildly dignified in\r\nthemselves, an air which made her approach nearly to the ideas of those\r\nwonderful artists who gave to the eye the heroines of Scripture history.\r\n\r\nI was uncertain in what terms to accost a personage so uncommon, when Mr.\r\nJarvie, breaking the ice with a preparatory cough (for the speed with\r\nwhich he had been brought into her presence had again impeded his\r\nrespiration), addressed her as follows:--\xe2\x80\x9cUh! uh! &c. &c. I am very happy\r\nto have this _joyful_ opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d (a quaver in his voice strongly belied\r\nthe emphasis which he studiously laid on the word joyful)--\xe2\x80\x9cthis joyful\r\noccasion,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, trying to give the adjective a more suitable\r\naccentuation, \xe2\x80\x9cto wish my kinsman Robin's wife a very good morning--Uh!\r\nuh!--How's a' wi' ye?\xe2\x80\x9d (by this time he had talked himself into his usual\r\njog-trot manner, which exhibited a mixture of familiarity and\r\nself-importance)--\xe2\x80\x9cHow's a' wi' ye this lang time? Ye'll hae forgotten\r\nme, Mrs. MacGregor Campbell, as your cousin--uh! uh!--but ye'll mind my\r\nfather, Deacon Nicol Jarvie, in the Saut Market o' Glasgow?--an honest\r\nman he was, and a sponsible, and respectit you and yours. Sae, as I said\r\nbefore, I am right glad to see you, Mrs. MacGregor Campbell, as my\r\nkinsman's wife. I wad crave the liberty of a kinsman to salute you, but\r\nthat your gillies keep such a dolefu' fast haud o' my arms, and, to speak\r\nHeaven's truth and a magistrate's, ye wadna be the waur of a cogfu' o'\r\nwater before ye welcomed your friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in the familiarity of this introduction which ill\r\nsuited the exalted state of temper of the person to whom it was\r\naddressed, then busied with distributing dooms of death, and warm from\r\nconquest in a perilous encounter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fellow are you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat dare to claim kindred with the\r\nMacGregor, and neither wear his dress nor speak his language?--What are\r\nyou, that have the tongue and the habit of the hound, and yet seek to lie\r\ndown with the deer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undaunted Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cif the kindred has ever been\r\nweel redd out to you yet, cousin--but it's ken'd, and can be prov'd. My\r\nmother, Elspeth MacFarlane, was the wife of my father, Deacon Nicol\r\nJarvie--peace be wi' them baith!--and Elspeth was the daughter of Parlane\r\nMacFarlane, at the Sheeling o' Loch Sloy. Now, this Parlane MacFarlane,\r\nas his surviving daughter Maggy MacFarlane, _alias_ MacNab, wha married\r\nDuncan MacNab o' Stuckavrallachan, can testify, stood as near to your\r\ngudeman, Robert MacGregor, as in the fourth degree of kindred, for\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nThe virago lopped the genealogical tree, by demanding haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cIf a\r\nstream of rushing water acknowledged any relation with the portion\r\nwithdrawn from it for the mean domestic uses of those who dwelt on its\r\nbanks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVera true, kinswoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for a' that, the burn wad\r\nbe glad to hae the milldam back again in simmer, when the chuckie-stanes\r\nare white in the sun. I ken weel eneugh you Hieland folk haud us Glasgow\r\npeople light and cheap for our language and our claes;--but everybody\r\nspeaks their native tongue that they learned in infancy; and it would be\r\na daft-like thing to see me wi' my fat wame in a short Hieland coat, and\r\nmy puir short houghs gartered below the knee, like ane o' your\r\nlang-legged gillies. Mair by token, kinswoman,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in defiance\r\nof various intimations by which Dougal seemed to recommend silence, as\r\nwell as of the marks of impatience which the Amazon evinced at his\r\nloquacity, \xe2\x80\x9cI wad hae ye to mind that the king's errand whiles comes in\r\nthe cadger's gate, and that, for as high as ye may think o' the gudeman,\r\nas it's right every wife should honour her husband--there's Scripture\r\nwarrant for that--yet as high as ye haud him, as I was saying, I hae been\r\nserviceable to Rob ere now;--forbye a set o' pearlins I sent yourself\r\nwhen ye was gaun to be married, and when Rob was an honest weel-doing\r\ndrover, and nane o' this unlawfu' wark, wi' fighting, and flashes, and\r\nfluff-gibs, disturbing the king's peace and disarming his soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had apparently touched on a key which his kinswoman could not brook.\r\nShe drew herself up to her full height, and betrayed the acuteness of her\r\nfeelings by a laugh of mingled scorn and bitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, and such as you, might claim a relation to us,\r\nwhen we stooped to be the paltry wretches fit to exist under your\r\ndominion, as your hewers of wood and drawers of water--to find cattle for\r\nyour banquets, and subjects for your laws to oppress and trample on. But\r\nnow we are free--free by the very act which left us neither house nor\r\nhearth, food nor covering--which bereaved me of all--of all--and makes me\r\ngroan when I think I must still cumber the earth for other purposes than\r\nthose of vengeance. And I will carry on the work, this day has so well\r\ncommenced, by a deed that shall break all bands between MacGregor and the\r\nLowland churls. Here Allan--Dougal--bind these Sassenachs neck and heel\r\ntogether, and throw them into the Highland Loch to seek for their\r\nHighland kinsfolk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie, alarmed at this mandate, was commencing an expostulation,\r\nwhich probably would have only inflamed the violent passions of the\r\nperson whom he addressed, when Dougal threw himself between them, and in\r\nhis own language, which he spoke with a fluency and rapidity strongly\r\ncontrasted by the slow, imperfect, and idiot-like manner in which he\r\nexpressed himself in English, poured forth what I doubt not was a very\r\nanimated pleading in our behalf.\r\n\r\nHis mistress replied to him, or rather cut short his harangue, by\r\nexclaiming in English (as if determined to make us taste in anticipation\r\nthe full bitterness of death)--\xe2\x80\x9cBase dog, and son of a dog, do you\r\ndispute my commands? Should I tell ye to cut out their tongues and put\r\nthem into each other's throats, to try which would there best knap\r\nSouthron, or to tear out their hearts and put them into each other's\r\nbreasts, to see which would there best plot treason against the\r\nMacGregor--and such things have been done of old in the day of revenge,\r\nwhen our fathers had wrongs to redress--Should I command you to do this,\r\nwould it be your part to dispute my orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Dougal replied, with accents of profound\r\nsubmission; \xe2\x80\x9cher pleasure suld be done--tat's but reason; but an it\r\nwere--tat is, an it could be thought the same to her to coup the\r\nill-faured loon of ta red-coat Captain, and hims corporal Cramp, and twa\r\nthree o' the red-coats, into the loch, herself wad do't wi' muckle mair\r\ngreat satisfaction than to hurt ta honest civil shentlemans as were\r\nfriends to the Gregarach, and came up on the Chiefs assurance, and not\r\nto do no treason, as herself could testify.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady was about to reply, when a few wild strains of a pibroch were\r\nheard advancing up the road from Aberfoil, the same probably which had\r\nreached the ears of Captain Thornton's rear-guard, and determined him to\r\nforce his way onward rather than return to the village, on finding the\r\npass occupied. The skirmish being of very short duration, the armed men\r\nwho followed this martial melody, had not, although quickening their\r\nmarch when they heard the firing, been able to arrive in time sufficient\r\nto take any share in the rencontre. The victory, therefore, was complete\r\nwithout them, and they now arrived only to share in the triumph of their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThere was a marked difference betwixt the appearance of these new comers\r\nand that of the party by which our escort had been defeated--and it was\r\ngreatly in favour of the former. Among the Highlanders who surrounded the\r\nChieftainess, if I may presume to call her so without offence to grammar,\r\nwere men in the extremity of age, boys scarce able to bear a sword, and\r\neven women--all, in short, whom the last necessity urges to take up arms;\r\nand it added a shade of bitter shame to the defection which clouded\r\nThornton's manly countenance, when he found that the numbers and position\r\nof a foe, otherwise so despicable, had enabled them to conquer his brave\r\nveterans. But the thirty or forty Highlanders who now joined the others,\r\nwere all men in the prime of youth or manhood, active clean-made fellows,\r\nwhose short hose and belted plaids set out their sinewy limbs to the best\r\nadvantage. Their arms were as superior to those of the first party as\r\ntheir dress and appearance. The followers of the female Chief had axes,\r\nscythes, and other antique weapons, in aid of their guns; and some had\r\nonly clubs, daggers, and long knives. But of the second party, most had\r\npistols at the belt, and almost all had dirks hanging at the pouches\r\nwhich they wore in front. Each had a good gun in his hand, and a\r\nbroadsword by his side, besides a stout round target, made of light wood,\r\ncovered with leather, and curiously studded with brass, and having a\r\nsteel spike screwed into the centre. These hung on their left shoulder\r\nduring a march, or while they were engaged in exchanging fire with the\r\nenemy, and were worn on their left arm when they charged with sword in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nBut it was easy to see that this chosen band had not arrived from a\r\nvictory such as they found their ill-appointed companions possessed of.\r\nThe pibroch sent forth occasionally a few wailing notes expressive of a\r\nvery different sentiment from triumph; and when they appeared before the\r\nwife of their Chieftain, it was in silence, and with downcast and\r\nmelancholy looks. They paused when they approached her, and the pipes\r\nagain sent forth the same wild and melancholy strain.\r\n\r\nHelen rushed towards them with a countenance in which anger was mingled\r\nwith apprehension.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat means this, Alaster?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the\r\nminstrel--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy a lament in the moment of victory?--Robert--Hamish--where's\r\nthe MacGregor?--where's your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sons, who led the band, advanced with slow and irresolute steps\r\ntowards her, and murmured a few words in Gaelic, at hearing which she set\r\nup a shriek that made the rocks ring again, in which all the women and\r\nboys joined, clapping their hands and yelling as if their lives had been\r\nexpiring in the sound. The mountain echoes, silent since the military\r\nsounds of battle had ceased, had now to answer these frantic and\r\ndiscordant shrieks of sorrow, which drove the very night-birds from their\r\nhaunts in the rocks, as if they were startled to hear orgies more hideous\r\nand ill-omened than their own, performed in the face of open day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaken!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Helen, when the clamour had subsided--\xe2\x80\x9cTaken!--\r\ncaptive!--and you live to say so?--Coward dogs! did I nurse you for this,\r\nthat you should spare your blood on your father's enemies? or see him\r\nprisoner, and come back to tell it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sons of MacGregor, to whom this expostulation was addressed, were\r\nyouths, of whom the eldest had hardly attained his twentieth year.\r\n_Hamish,_ or James, the elder of these youths, was the tallest by a head,\r\nand much handsomer than his brother; his light-blue eyes, with a\r\nprofusion of fair hair, which streamed from under his smart blue bonnet,\r\nmade his whole appearance a most favourable specimen of the Highland\r\nyouth. The younger was called Robert; but, to distinguish him from his\r\nfather, the Highlanders added the epithet _Oig,_ or the young. Dark hair,\r\nand dark features, with a ruddy glow of health and animation, and a form\r\nstrong and well-set beyond his years, completed the sketch of the young\r\nmountaineer.\r\n\r\nBoth now stood before their mother with countenances clouded with grief\r\nand shame, and listened, with the most respectful submission, to the\r\nreproaches with which she loaded them. At length when her resentment\r\nappeared in some degree to subside, the eldest, speaking in English,\r\nprobably that he might not be understood by their followers, endeavoured\r\nrespectfully to vindicate himself and his brother from his mother's\r\nreproaches. I was so near him as to comprehend much of what he said; and,\r\nas it was of great consequence to me to be possessed of information in\r\nthis strange crisis, I failed not to listen as attentively as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe MacGregor,\xe2\x80\x9d his son stated, \xe2\x80\x9chad been called out upon a trysting\r\nwith a Lowland hallion, who came with a token from\xe2\x80\x9d--he muttered the name\r\nvery low, but I thought it sounded like my own. \xe2\x80\x9cThe MacGregor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9caccepted of the invitation, but commanded the Saxon who brought the\r\nmessage to be detained, as a hostage that good faith should be observed\r\nto him. Accordingly he went to the place of appointment\xe2\x80\x9d (which had some\r\nwild Highland name that I cannot remember), \xe2\x80\x9cattended only by Angus Breck\r\nand Little Rory, commanding no one to follow him. Within half an hour\r\nAngus Breck came back with the doleful tidings that the MacGregor had\r\nbeen surprised and made prisoner by a party of Lennox militia, under\r\nGalbraith of Garschattachin.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Galbraith, on being\r\nthreatened by MacGregor, who upon his capture menaced him with\r\nretaliation on the person of the hostage, had treated the threat with\r\ngreat contempt, replying, 'Let each side hang his man; we'll hang the\r\nthief, and your catherans may hang the gauger, Rob, and the country will\r\nbe rid of two damned things at once, a wild Highlander and a revenue\r\nofficer.' Angus Breck, less carefully looked to than his master,\r\ncontrived to escape from the hands of the captors, after having been in\r\ntheir custody long enough to hear this discussion, and to bring off the\r\nnews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you learn this, you false-hearted traitor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife of\r\nMacGregor, \xe2\x80\x9cand not instantly rush to your father's rescue, to bring him\r\noff, or leave your body on the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young MacGregor modestly replied, by representing the very superior\r\nforce of the enemy, and stated, that as they made no preparation for\r\nleaving the country, he had fallen back up the glen with the purpose of\r\ncollecting a band sufficient to attempt a rescue with some tolerable\r\nchance of success. At length he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe militiamen would quarter, he\r\nunderstood, in the neighbouring house of Gartartan, or the old castle in\r\nthe port of Monteith, or some other stronghold, which, although strong\r\nand defensible, was nevertheless capable of being surprised, could they\r\nbut get enough of men assembled for the purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood afterwards that the rest of the freebooter's followers were\r\ndivided into two strong bands, one destined to watch the remaining\r\ngarrison of Inversnaid, a party of which, under Captain Thornton, had\r\nbeen defeated; and another to show front to the Highland clans who had\r\nunited with the regular troops and Lowlanders in this hostile and\r\ncombined invasion of that mountainous and desolate territory, which lying\r\nbetween the lakes of Loch Lomond, Loch Katrine, and Loch Ard, was at this\r\ntime currently called Rob Roy's, or the MacGregor country. Messengers\r\nwere despatched in great haste, to concentrate, as I supposed, their\r\nforces, with a view to the purposed attack on the Lowlanders; and the\r\ndejection and despair, at first visible on each countenance, gave place\r\nto the hope of rescuing their leader, and to the thirst of vengeance. It\r\nwas under the burning influence of the latter passion that the wife of\r\nMacGregor commanded that the hostage exchanged for his safety should be\r\nbrought into her presence. I believe her sons had kept this unfortunate\r\nwretch out of her sight, for fear of the consequences; but if it was so,\r\ntheir humane precaution only postponed his fate. They dragged forward at\r\nher summons a wretch already half dead with terror, in whose agonised\r\nfeatures I recognised, to my horror and astonishment, my old acquaintance\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\nHe fell prostrate before the female Chief with an effort to clasp her\r\nknees, from which she drew back, as if his touch had been pollution, so\r\nthat all he could do in token of the extremity of his humiliation, was to\r\nkiss the hem of her plaid. I never heard entreaties for life poured forth\r\nwith such agony of spirit. The ecstasy of fear was such, that instead of\r\nparalysing his tongue, as on ordinary occasions, it even rendered him\r\neloquent; and, with cheeks pale as ashes, hands compressed in agony, eyes\r\nthat seemed to be taking their last look of all mortal objects, he\r\nprotested, with the deepest oaths, his total ignorance of any design on\r\nthe person of Rob Roy, whom he swore he loved and honoured as his own\r\nsoul. In the inconsistency of his terror, he said he was but the agent of\r\nothers, and he muttered the name of Rashleigh. He prayed but for\r\nlife--for life he would give all he had in the world: it was but life he\r\nasked--life, if it were to be prolonged under tortures and privations:\r\nhe asked only breath, though it should be drawn in the damps of the\r\nlowest caverns of their hills.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the scorn, the loathing, and contempt, with\r\nwhich the wife of MacGregor regarded this wretched petitioner for the\r\npoor boon of existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have bid ye live,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chad life been to you the same\r\nweary and wasting burden that it is to me--that it is to every noble and\r\ngenerous mind. But you--wretch! you could creep through the world\r\nunaffected by its various disgraces, its ineffable miseries, its\r\nconstantly accumulating masses of crime and sorrow: you could live and\r\nenjoy yourself, while the noble-minded are betrayed--while nameless and\r\nbirthless villains tread on the neck of the brave and the long-descended:\r\nyou could enjoy yourself, like a butcher's dog in the shambles, battening\r\non garbage, while the slaughter of the oldest and best went on around\r\nyou! This enjoyment you shall not live to partake of!--you shall die,\r\nbase dog! and that before yon cloud has passed over the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a brief command in Gaelic to her attendants, two of whom seized\r\nupon the prostrate suppliant, and hurried him to the brink of a cliff\r\nwhich overhung the flood. He set up the most piercing and dreadful cries\r\nthat fear ever uttered--I may well term them dreadful, for they haunted\r\nmy sleep for years afterwards. As the murderers, or executioners, call\r\nthem as you will, dragged him along, he recognised me even in that moment\r\nof horror, and exclaimed, in the last articulate words I ever heard him\r\nutter, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Osbaldistone, save me!--save me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so much moved by this horrid spectacle, that, although in momentary\r\nexpectation of sharing his fate, I did attempt to speak in his behalf,\r\nbut, as might have been expected, my interference was sternly\r\ndisregarded. The victim was held fast by some, while others, binding a\r\nlarge heavy stone in a plaid, tied it round his neck, and others again\r\neagerly stripped him of some part of his dress. Half-naked, and thus\r\nmanacled, they hurled him into the lake, there about twelve feet deep,\r\nwith a loud halloo of vindictive triumph,--above which, however, his last\r\ndeath-shriek, the yell of mortal agony, was distinctly heard. The heavy\r\nburden splashed in the dark-blue waters, and the Highlanders, with their\r\npole-axes and swords, watched an instant to guard, lest, extricating\r\nhimself from the load to which he was attached, the victim might have\r\nstruggled to regain the shore. But the knot had been securely bound--the\r\nwretched man sunk without effort; the waters, which his fall had\r\ndisturbed, settled calmly over him, and the unit of that life for which\r\nhe had pleaded so strongly, was for ever withdrawn from the sum of human\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                And be he safe restored ere evening set,\r\n                Or, if there's vengeance in an injured heart,\r\n                And power to wreak it in an armed hand,\r\n                      Your land shall ache for't.\r\n                                          Old Play.\r\n\r\nI know not why it is that a single deed of violence and cruelty affects\r\nour nerves more than when these are exercised on a more extended scale. I\r\nhad seen that day several of my brave countrymen fall in battle: it\r\nseemed to me that they met a lot appropriate to humanity, and my bosom,\r\nthough thrilling with interest, was affected with nothing of that\r\nsickening horror with which I beheld the unfortunate Morris put to death\r\nwithout resistance, and in cold blood. I looked at my companion, Mr.\r\nJarvie, whose face reflected the feelings which were painted in mine.\r\nIndeed he could not so suppress his horror, but that the words escaped\r\nhim in a low and broken whisper,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take up my protest against this deed, as a bloody and cruel murder--it\r\nis a cursed deed, and God will avenge it in his due way and time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you do not fear to follow?\xe2\x80\x9d said the virago, bending on him a look\r\nof death, such as that with which a hawk looks at his prey ere he\r\npounces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKinswoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cnae man willingly wad cut short his thread\r\nof life before the end o' his pirn was fairly measured off on the\r\nyarn-winles--And I hae muckle to do, an I be spared, in this\r\nwarld--public and private business, as weel that belonging to the\r\nmagistracy as to my ain particular; and nae doubt I hae some to depend\r\non me, as puir Mattie, wha is an orphan--She's a far-awa' cousin o' the\r\nLaird o' Limmerfield. Sae that, laying a' this thegither--skin for skin,\r\nyea all that a man hath, will he give for his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd were I to set you at liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the imperious dame, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat name\r\ncould you give to the drowning of that Saxon dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh! uh!--hem! hem!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, clearing his throat as well as he\r\ncould, \xe2\x80\x9cI suld study to say as little on that score as might be--least\r\nsaid is sunest mended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you were called on by the courts, as you term them, of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she again demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat then would be your answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie looked this way and that way, like a person who meditates an\r\nescape, and then answered in the tone of one who, seeing no means of\r\naccomplishing a retreat, determines to stand the brunt of battle--\xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nwhat you are driving me to the wa' about. But I'll tell you't plain,\r\nkinswoman,--I behoved just to speak according to my ain conscience; and\r\nthough your ain gudeman, that I wish had been here for his ain sake and\r\nmine, as wool as the puir Hieland creature Dougal, can tell ye that Nicol\r\nJarvie can wink as hard at a friend's failings as onybody, yet I'se tell\r\nye, kinswoman, mine's ne'er be the tongue to belie my thought; and sooner\r\nthan say that yonder puir wretch was lawfully slaughtered, I wad consent\r\nto be laid beside him--though I think ye are the first Hieland woman wad\r\nmint sic a doom to her husband's kinsman but four times removed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the tone and firmness assumed by the Bailie in his\r\nlast speech was better suited to make an impression on the hard heart of\r\nhis kinswoman than the tone of supplication he had hitherto assumed, as\r\ngems can be cut with steel, though they resist softer metals. She\r\ncommanded us both to be placed before her. \xe2\x80\x9cYour name,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis Osbaldistone?--the dead dog, whose death you have witnessed, called\r\nyou so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name _is_ Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d was my answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRashleigh, then, I suppose, is your Christian name?\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,--my name is Francis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know Rashleigh Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is your\r\nbrother, if I mistake not,--at least your kinsman and near friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not my friend. We were lately engaged\r\ntogether in a rencontre, when we were separated by a person whom I\r\nunderstand to be your husband. My blood is hardly yet dried on his sword,\r\nand the wound on my side is yet green. I have little reason to\r\nacknowledge him as a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cif a stranger to his intrigues, you can go in\r\nsafety to Garschattachin and his party without fear of being detained,\r\nand carry them a message from the wife of the MacGregor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered that I knew no reasonable cause why the militia gentlemen\r\nshould detain me; that I had no reason, on my own account, to fear being\r\nin their hands; and that if my going on her embassy would act as a\r\nprotection to my friend and servant, who were here prisoners, \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nready to set out directly.\xe2\x80\x9d I took the opportunity to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat I had\r\ncome into this country on her husband's invitation, and his assurance\r\nthat he would aid me in some important matters in which I was interested;\r\nthat my companion, Mr. Jarvie, had accompanied me on the same errand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish Mr. Jarvie's boots had been fu' o' boiling water when he drew\r\nthem on for sic a purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Bailie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may read your father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen MacGregor, turning to her sons,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin what this young Saxon tells us--Wise only when the bonnet is on his\r\nhead, and the sword is in his hand, he never exchanges the tartan for the\r\nbroad-cloth, but he runs himself into the miserable intrigues of the\r\nLowlanders, and becomes again, after all he has suffered, their\r\nagent--their tool--their slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdd, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand their benefactor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is the most empty title of them all, since\r\nhe has uniformly sown benefits to reap a harvest of the most foul\r\ningratitude.--But enough of this. I shall cause you to be guided to the\r\nenemy's outposts. Ask for their commander, and deliver him this message\r\nfrom me, Helen MacGregor;--that if they injure a hair of MacGregor's\r\nhead, and if they do not set him at liberty within the space of twelve\r\nhours, there is not a lady in the Lennox but shall before Christmas cry\r\nthe coronach for them she will be loath to lose,--there is not a farmer\r\nbut shall sing well-a-wa over a burnt barnyard and an empty byre,--there\r\nis not a laird nor heritor shall lay his head on the pillow at night with\r\nthe assurance of being a live man in the morning,--and, to begin as we\r\nare to end, so soon as the term is expired, I will send them this Glasgow\r\nBailie, and this Saxon Captain, and all the rest of my prisoners, each\r\nbundled in a plaid, and chopped into as many pieces as there are checks\r\nin the tartan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she paused in her denunciation, Captain Thornton, who was within\r\nhearing, added, with great coolness, \xe2\x80\x9cPresent my compliments--Captain\r\nThornton's of the Royals, compliments--to the commanding officer, and\r\ntell him to do his duty and secure his prisoner, and not waste a thought\r\nupon me. If I have been fool enough to have been led into an ambuscade by\r\nthese artful savages, I am wise enough to know how to die for it without\r\ndisgracing the service. I am only sorry for my poor fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat have fallen into such butcherly hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhist! whist!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9care ye weary o' your life?--Ye'll\r\ngie _my_ service to the commanding officer, Mr. Osbaldistone--Bailie\r\nNicol Jarvie's service, a magistrate o' Glasgow, as his father the deacon\r\nwas before him--and tell him, here are a wheen honest men in great\r\ntrouble, and like to come to mair; and the best thing he can do for the\r\ncommon good, will be just to let Rob come his wa's up the glen, and nae\r\nmair about it. There's been some ill dune here already; but as it has\r\nlighted chiefly on the gauger, it winna be muckle worth making a stir\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these very opposite injunctions from the parties chiefly interested\r\nin the success of my embassy, and with the reiterated charge of the wife\r\nof MacGregor to remember and detail every word of her injunctions, I was\r\nat length suffered to depart; and Andrew Fairservice, chiefly, I believe,\r\nto get rid of his clamorous supplications, was permitted to attend me.\r\nDoubtful, however, that I might use my horse as a means of escape from my\r\nguides, or desirous to retain a prize of some value, I was given to\r\nunderstand that I was to perform my journey on foot, escorted by Hamish\r\nMacGregor, the elder brother, who, with two followers, attended, as well\r\nto show me the way, as to reconnoitre the strength and position of the\r\nenemy. Dougal had been at first ordered on this party, but he contrived\r\nto elude the service, with the purpose, as we afterwards understood, of\r\nwatching over Mr. Jarvie, whom, according to his wild principles of\r\nfidelity, he considered as entitled to his good offices, from having once\r\nacted in some measure as his patron or master.\r\n\r\nAfter walking with great rapidity about an hour, we arrived at an\r\neminence covered with brushwood, which gave us a commanding prospect down\r\nthe valley, and a full view of the post which the militia occupied. Being\r\nchiefly cavalry, they had judiciously avoided any attempt to penetrate\r\nthe pass which had been so unsuccessfully essayed by Captain Thornton.\r\nThey had taken up their situation with some military skill, on a rising\r\nground in the centre of the little valley of Aberfoil, through which the\r\nriver Forth winds its earliest course, and which is formed by two ridges\r\nof hills, faced with barricades of limestone rock, intermixed with huge\r\nmasses of breecia, or pebbles imbedded in some softer substance which has\r\nhardened around them like mortar; and surrounded by the more lofty\r\nmountains in the distance. These ridges, however, left the valley of\r\nbreadth enough to secure the cavalry from any sudden surprise by the\r\nmountaineers and they had stationed sentinels and outposts at proper\r\ndistances from this main body, in every direction, so that they might\r\nsecure full time to mount and get under arms upon the least alarm. It was\r\nnot, indeed, expected at that time, that Highlanders would attack cavalry\r\nin an open plain, though late events have shown that they may do so with\r\nsuccess.*\r\n\r\n* The affairs of Prestonpans and Falkirk are probably alluded to, which *\r\nmarks the time of writing the Memoirs as subsequent to 1745.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew the Highlanders, they had almost a superstitious dread\r\nof a mounted trooper, the horse being so much more fierce and imposing in\r\nhis appearance than the little shelties of their own hills, and moreover\r\nbeing trained, as the more ignorant mountaineers believed, to fight with\r\nhis feet and his teeth. The appearance of the piequeted horses, feeding\r\nin this little vale--the forms of the soldiers, as they sate, stood, or\r\nwalked, in various groups in the vicinity of the beautiful river, and of\r\nthe bare yet romantic ranges of rock which hedge in the landscape on\r\neither side,--formed a noble foreground; while far to the eastward the\r\neye caught a glance of the lake of Menteith; and Stirling Castle, dimly\r\nseen along with the blue and distant line of the Ochil Mountains, closed\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing on this landscape with great earnestness, young MacGregor\r\nintimated to me that I was to descend to the station of the militia and\r\nexecute my errand to their commander,--enjoining me at the same time,\r\nwith a menacing gesture, neither to inform them who had guided me to that\r\nplace, nor where I had parted from my escort. Thus tutored, I descended\r\ntowards the military post, followed by Andrew, who, only retaining his\r\nbreeches and stockings of the English costume, without a hat,\r\nbare-legged, with brogues on his feet, which Dougal had given him out of\r\ncompassion, and having a tattered plaid to supply the want of all upper\r\ngarments, looked as if he had been playing the part of a Highland\r\nTom-of-Bedlam. We had not proceeded far before we became visible to one\r\nof the videttes, who, riding towards us, presented his carabine and\r\ncommanded me to stand. I obeyed, and when the soldier came up, desired to\r\nbe conducted to his commanding-officer. I was immediately brought where a\r\ncircle of officers, sitting upon the grass, seemed in attendance upon one\r\nof superior rank. He wore a cuirass of polished steel, over which were\r\ndrawn the insignia of the ancient Order of the Thistle. My friend\r\nGarschattachin, and many other gentlemen, some in uniform, others in\r\ntheir ordinary dress, but all armed and well attended, seemed to receive\r\ntheir orders from this person of distinction. Many servants in rich\r\nliveries, apparently a part of his household, were also in waiting.\r\n\r\nHaving paid to this nobleman the respect which his rank appeared to\r\ndemand, I acquainted him that I had been an involuntary witness to the\r\nking's soldiers having suffered a defeat from the Highlanders at the pass\r\nof Loch-Ard (such I had learned was the name of the place where Mr.\r\nThornton was made prisoner), and that the victors threatened every\r\nspecies of extremity to those who had fallen into their power, as well as\r\nto the Low Country in general, unless their Chief, who had that morning\r\nbeen made prisoner, were returned to them uninjured. The Duke (for he\r\nwhom I addressed was of no lower rank) listened to me with great\r\ncomposure, and then replied, that he should be extremely sorry to expose\r\nthe unfortunate gentlemen who had been made prisoners to the cruelty of\r\nthe barbarians into whose hands they had fallen, but that it was folly to\r\nsuppose that he would deliver up the very author of all these disorders\r\nand offences, and so encourage his followers in their license. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may\r\nreturn to those who sent you,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cand inform them, that I\r\nshall certainly cause Rob Roy Campbell, whom they call MacGregor, to be\r\nexecuted, by break of day, as an outlaw taken in arms, and deserving\r\ndeath by a thousand acts of violence; that I should be most justly held\r\nunworthy of my situation and commission did I act otherwise; that I shall\r\nknow how to protect the country against their insolent threats of\r\nviolence; and that if they injure a hair of the head of any of the\r\nunfortunate gentlemen whom an unlucky accident has thrown into their\r\npower, I will take such ample vengeance, that the very stones of their\r\nglens shall sing woe for it this hundred years to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI humbly begged leave to remonstrate respecting the honourable mission\r\nimposed on me, and touched upon the obvious danger attending it, when the\r\nnoble commander replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat such being the case, I might send my\r\nservant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deil be in my feet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, without either having respect to\r\nthe presence in which he stood, or waiting till I replied--\xe2\x80\x9cthe deil be\r\nin my feet, if I gang my tae's length. Do the folk think I hae another\r\nthrapple in my pouch after John Highlandman's sneeked this ane wi' his\r\njoctaleg? or that I can dive doun at the tae side of a Highland loch and\r\nrise at the tother, like a shell-drake? Na, na--ilk ane for himsell, and\r\nGod for us a'. Folk may just make a page o' their ain age, and serve\r\nthemsells till their bairns grow up, and gang their ain errands for\r\nAndrew. Rob Roy never came near the parish of Dreepdaily, to steal either\r\npippin or pear frae me or mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilencing my follower with some difficulty, I represented to the Duke the\r\ngreat danger Captain Thornton and Mr. Jarvie would certainly be exposed\r\nto, and entreated he would make me the bearer of such modified terms as\r\nmight be the means of saving their lives. I assured him I should decline\r\nno danger if I could be of service; but from what I had heard and seen, I\r\nhad little doubt they would be instantly murdered should the chief of the\r\noutlaws suffer death.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was obviously much affected. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a hard case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhe felt it as such; but he had a paramount duty to perform to the\r\ncountry--Rob Roy must die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI own it was not without emotion that I heard this threat of instant\r\ndeath to my acquaintance Campbell, who had so often testified his\r\ngood-will towards me. Nor was I singular in the feeling, for many of\r\nthose around the Duke ventured to express themselves in his favour. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould be more advisable,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cto send him to Stirling Castle, and\r\nthere detain him a close prisoner, as a pledge for the submission and\r\ndispersion of his gang. It were a great pity to expose the country to be\r\nplundered, which, now that the long nights approached, it would be found\r\nvery difficult to prevent, since it was impossible to guard every point,\r\nand the Highlanders were sure to select those that were left exposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n They added, that there was great hardship in leaving the unfortunate\r\nprisoners to the almost certain doom of massacre denounced against them,\r\nwhich no one doubted would be executed in the first burst of revenge.\r\n\r\nGarschattachin ventured yet farther, confiding in the honour of the\r\nnobleman whom he addressed, although he knew he had particular reasons\r\nfor disliking their prisoner. \xe2\x80\x9cRob Roy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthough a kittle\r\nneighbour to the Low Country, and particularly obnoxious to his Grace,\r\nand though he maybe carried the catheran trade farther than ony man o'\r\nhis day, was an auld-farrand carle, and there might be some means of\r\nmaking him hear reason; whereas his wife and sons were reckless fiends,\r\nwithout either fear or mercy about them, and, at the head of a' his\r\nlimmer loons, would be a worse plague to the country than ever he had\r\nbeen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied his Grace, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the very sense and cunning of\r\nthis fellow which has so long maintained his reign--a mere Highland\r\nrobber would have been put down in as many weeks as he has flourished\r\nyears. His gang, without him, is no more to be dreaded as a permanent\r\nannoyance--it will no longer exist--than a wasp without its head, which\r\nmay sting once perhaps, but is instantly crushed into annihilation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGarschattachin was not so easily silenced. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure, my Lord Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no favour for Rob, and he as little for me, seeing he\r\nhas twice cleaned out my ain byres, beside skaith amang my tenants; but,\r\nhowever\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, however, Garschattachin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, with a smile of peculiar\r\nexpression, \xe2\x80\x9cI fancy you think such a freedom may be pardoned in a\r\nfriend's friend, and Rob's supposed to be no enemy to Major Galbraith's\r\nfriends over the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be so, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Garschattachin, in the same tone of\r\njocularity, \xe2\x80\x9cit's no the warst thing I have heard of him. But I wish we\r\nheard some news from the clans, that we have waited for sae lang. I vow\r\nto God they'll keep a Hielandman's word wi' us--I never ken'd them\r\nbetter--it's ill drawing boots upon trews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cThese gentlemen are known to be\r\nmen of honour, and I must necessarily suppose they are to keep their\r\nappointment. Send out two more horse-men to look for our friends. We\r\ncannot, till their arrival, pretend to attack the pass where Captain\r\nThornton has suffered himself to be surprised, and which, to my\r\nknowledge, ten men on foot might make good against a regiment of the best\r\nhorse in Europe--Meanwhile let refreshments be given to the men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had the benefit of this last order, the more necessary and acceptable,\r\nas I had tasted nothing since our hasty meal at Aberfoil the evening\r\nbefore. The videttes who had been despatched returned without tidings of\r\nthe expected auxiliaries, and sunset was approaching, when a Highlander\r\nbelonging to the clans whose co-operation was expected, appeared as the\r\nbearer of a letter, which he delivered to the Duke with a most profound\r\nconge'.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow will I wad a hogshead of claret,\xe2\x80\x9d said Garschattachin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is\r\na message to tell us that these cursed Highlandmen, whom we have fetched\r\nhere at the expense of so much plague and vexation, are going to draw\r\noff, and leave us to do our own business if we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is even so, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, reddening with indignation,\r\nafter having perused the letter, which was written upon a very dirty\r\nscrap of paper, but most punctiliously addressed, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the much-honoured\r\nhands of Ane High and Mighty Prince, the Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. &c. &c. \xe2\x80\x9cOur allies,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n continued the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9chave deserted us, gentlemen, and have made a\r\nseparate peace with the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's just the fate of all alliances,\xe2\x80\x9d said Garschattachin, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Dutch\r\nwere gaun to serve us the same gate, if we had not got the start of them\r\nat Utrecht.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are facetious, air,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, with a frown which showed how\r\nlittle he liked the pleasantry; \xe2\x80\x9cbut our business is rather of a grave\r\ncut just now.--I suppose no gentleman would advise our attempting to\r\npenetrate farther into the country, unsupported either by friendly\r\nHighlanders, or by infantry from Inversnaid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA general answer announced that the attempt would be perfect madness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor would there be great wisdom,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke added, \xe2\x80\x9cin remaining exposed\r\nto a night-attack in this place. I therefore propose that we should\r\nretreat to the house of Duchray and that of Gartartan, and keep safe and\r\nsure watch and ward until morning. But before we separate, I will examine\r\nRob Roy before you all, and make you sensible, by your own eyes and ears,\r\nof the extreme unfitness of leaving him space for farther outrage.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ngave orders accordingly, and the prisoner was brought before him, his\r\narms belted down above the elbow, and secured to his body by a\r\nhorse-girth buckled tight behind him. Two non-commissioned officers had\r\nhold of him, one on each side, and two file of men with carabines and\r\nfixed bayonets attended for additional security.\r\n\r\nI had never seen this man in the dress of his country, which set in a\r\nstriking point of view the peculiarities of his form. A shock-head of red\r\nhair, which the hat and periwig of the Lowland costume had in a great\r\nmeasure concealed, was seen beneath the Highland bonnet, and verified the\r\nepithet of _Roy,_ or Red, by which he was much better known in the Low\r\nCountry than by any other, and is still, I suppose, best remembered. The\r\njustice of the appellation was also vindicated by the appearance of that\r\npart of his limbs, from the bottom of his kilt to the top of his short\r\nhose, which the fashion of his country dress left bare, and which was\r\ncovered with a fell of thick, short, red hair, especially around his\r\nknees, which resembled in this respect, as well as from their sinewy\r\nappearance of extreme strength, the limbs of a red-coloured Highland\r\nbull. Upon the whole, betwixt the effect produced by the change of dress,\r\nand by my having become acquainted with his real and formidable\r\ncharacter, his appearance had acquired to my eyes something so much\r\nwilder and more striking than it before presented, that I could scarce\r\nrecognise him to be the same person.\r\n\r\nHis manner was bold, unconstrained unless by the actual bonds, haughty,\r\nand even dignified. He bowed to the Duke, nodded to Garschattachin and\r\nothers, and showed some surprise at seeing me among the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is long since we have met, Mr. Campbell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so, my Lord Duke; I could have wished it had been\xe2\x80\x9d (looking at the\r\nfastening on his arms) \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I could have better paid the compliments I\r\nowe to your Grace;--but there's a gude time coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo time like the time present, Mr. Campbell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthe hours are fast flying that must settle your last account with all\r\nmortal affairs. I do not say this to insult your distress; but you must\r\nbe aware yourself that you draw near the end of your career. I do not\r\ndeny that you may sometimes have done less harm than others of your\r\nunhappy trade, and that you may occasionally have exhibited marks of\r\ntalent, and even of a disposition which promised better things. But you\r\nare aware how long you have been the terror and the oppressor of a\r\npeaceful neighbourhood, and by what acts of violence you have maintained\r\nand extended your usurped authority. You know, in short, that you have\r\ndeserved death, and that you must prepare for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob Roy, \xe2\x80\x9calthough I may well lay my misfortunes at your\r\nGrace's door, yet I will never say that you yourself have been the wilful\r\nand witting author of them. My Lord, if I had thought sae, your Grace\r\nwould not this day have been sitting in judgment on me; for you have been\r\nthree times within good rifle distance of me when you were thinking but\r\nof the red deer, and few people have ken'd me miss my aim. But as for\r\nthem that have abused your Grace's ear, and set you up against a man that\r\nwas ance as peacefu' a man as ony in the land, and made your name the\r\nwarrant for driving me to utter extremity,--I have had some amends of\r\nthem, and, for a' that your Grace now says, I expect to live to hae\r\nmair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, in rising anger, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are a determined and\r\nimpudent villain, who will keep his oath if he swears to mischief; but it\r\nshall be my care to prevent you. You have no enemies but your own wicked\r\nactions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad I called myself Grahame, instead of Campbell, I might have heard\r\nless about them,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob Roy, with dogged resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cto warn your wife and family and\r\nfollowers, to beware how they use the gentlemen now in their hands, as I\r\nwill requite tenfold on them, and their kin and allies, the slightest\r\ninjury done to any of his Majesty's liege subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roy in answer, \xe2\x80\x9cnone of my enemies will allege that I\r\nhave been a bloodthirsty man, and were I now wi' my folk, I could rule\r\nfour or five hundred wild Hielanders as easy as your Grace those eight or\r\nten lackeys and foot-boys--But if your Grace is bent to take the head\r\naway from a house, ye may lay your account there will be misrule amang\r\nthe members.--However, come o't what like, there's an honest man, a\r\nkinsman o' my ain, maun come by nae skaith. Is there ony body here wad do\r\na gude deed for MacGregor?--he may repay it, though his hands be now\r\ntied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Highlander who had delivered the letter to the Duke replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll do\r\nyour will for you, MacGregor; and I'll gang back up the glen on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced, and received from the prisoner a message to his wife, which,\r\nbeing in Gaelic, I did not understand, but I had little doubt it related\r\nto some measures to be taken for the safety of Mr. Jarvie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear the fellow's impudence?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9che confides in his\r\ncharacter of a messenger. His conduct is of a piece with his master's,\r\nwho invited us to make common cause against these freebooters, and have\r\ndeserted us so soon as the MacGregors have agreed to surrender the\r\nBalquhidder lands they were squabbling about.\r\n\r\n             No truth in plaids, no faith in tartan trews!\r\n             Chameleon-like, they change a thousand hues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour great ancestor never said so, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Major\r\nGalbraith;--\xe2\x80\x9cand, with submission, neither would your Grace have\r\noccasion to say it, wad ye but be for beginning justice at the\r\nwell-head--Gie the honest man his mear again--Let every head wear it's\r\nane bannet, and the distractions o' the Lennox wad be mended wi' them\r\no'the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush! Garschattachin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is language dangerous\r\nfor you to talk to any one, and especially to me; but I presume you\r\nreckon yourself a privileged person. Please to draw off your party\r\ntowards Gartartan; I shall myself see the prisoner escorted to Duchray,\r\nand send you orders tomorrow. You will please grant no leave of absence\r\nto any of your troopers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's auld ordering and counter-ordering,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Garschattachin\r\nbetween his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cBut patience! patience!--we may ae day play at change\r\nseats, the king's coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two troops of cavalry now formed, and prepared to march off the\r\nground, that they might avail themselves of the remainder of daylight to\r\nget to their evening quarters. I received an intimation, rather than an\r\ninvitation, to attend the party; and I perceived, that, though no longer\r\nconsidered as a prisoner, I was yet under some sort of suspicion. The\r\ntimes were indeed so dangerous,--the great party questions of Jacobite\r\nand Hanoverian divided the country so effectually,--and the constant\r\ndisputes and jealousies between the Highlanders and Lowlanders, besides a\r\nnumber of inexplicable causes of feud which separated the great leading\r\nfamilies in Scotland from each other, occasioned such general suspicion,\r\nthat a solitary and unprotected stranger was almost sure to meet with\r\nsomething disagreeable in the course of his travels.\r\n\r\nI acquiesced, however, in my destination with the best grace I could,\r\nconsoling myself with the hope that I might obtain from the captive\r\nfreebooter some information concerning Rashleigh and his machinations. I\r\nshould do myself injustice did I not add, that my views were not merely\r\nselfish. I was too much interested in my singular acquaintance not to be\r\ndesirous of rendering him such services as his unfortunate situation\r\nmight demand, or admit of his receiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\n                   And when he came to broken brigg,\r\n                       He bent his bow and swam;\r\n                   And when he came to grass growing,\r\n                       Set down his feet and ran.\r\n                                     Gil Morrice.\r\n\r\nThe echoes of the rocks and ravines, on either side, now rang to the\r\ntrumpets of the cavalry, which, forming themselves into two distinct\r\nbodies, began to move down the valley at a slow trot. That commanded by\r\nMajor Galbraith soon took to the right hand, and crossed the Forth, for\r\nthe purpose of taking up the quarters assigned them for the night, when\r\nthey were to occupy, as I understood, an old castle in the vicinity. They\r\nformed a lively object while crossing the stream, but were soon lost in\r\nwinding up the bank on the opposite side, which was clothed with wood.\r\n\r\nWe continued our march with considerable good order. To ensure the safe\r\ncustody of the prisoner, the Duke had caused him to be placed on\r\nhorseback behind one of his retainers, called, as I was informed, Ewan of\r\nBrigglands, one of the largest and strongest men who were present. A\r\nhorse-belt, passed round the bodies of both, and buckled before the\r\nyeoman's breast, rendered it impossible for Rob Roy to free himself from\r\nhis keeper. I was directed to keep close beside them, and accommodated\r\nfor the purpose with a troop-horse. We were as closely surrounded by the\r\nsoldiers as the width of the road would permit, and had always at least\r\none, if not two, on each side, with pistol in hand. Andrew Fairservice,\r\nfurnished with a Highland pony, of which they had made prey somewhere or\r\nother, was permitted to ride among the other domestics, of whom a great\r\nnumber attended the line of march, though without falling into the ranks\r\nof the more regularly trained troopers.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we travelled for a certain distance, until we arrived at a\r\nplace where we also were to cross the river. The Forth, as being the\r\noutlet of a lake, is of considerable depth, even where less important in\r\npoint of width, and the descent to the ford was by a broken precipitous\r\nravine, which only permitted one horseman to descend at once. The rear\r\nand centre of our small body halting on the bank while the front files\r\npassed down in succession, produced a considerable delay, as is usual on\r\nsuch occasions, and even some confusion; for a number of those riders,\r\nwho made no proper part of the squadron, crowded to the ford without\r\nregularity, and made the militia cavalry, although tolerably well\r\ndrilled, partake in some degree of their own disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Escape of Rob Roy at the Ford--232]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was while we were thus huddled together on the bank that I heard Rob\r\nRoy whisper to the man behind whom he was placed on horseback, \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nfather, Ewan, wadna hae carried an auld friend to the shambles, like a\r\ncalf, for a' the Dukes in Christendom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEwan returned no answer, but shrugged, as one who would express by that\r\nsign that what he was doing was none of his own choice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when the MacGregors come down the glen, and ye see toom faulds, a\r\nbluidy hearthstone, and the fire flashing out between the rafters o' your\r\nhouse, ye may be thinking then, Ewan, that were your friend Rob to the\r\nfore, you would have had that safe which it will make your heart sair to\r\nlose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEwan of Brigglands again shrugged and groaned, but remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a sair thing,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rob, sliding his insinuations so gently\r\ninto Ewan's ear that they reached no other but mine, who certainly saw\r\nmyself in no shape called upon to destroy his prospects of escape--\xe2\x80\x9cIt's\r\na sair thing, that Ewan of Brigglands, whom Roy MacGregor has helped with\r\nhand, sword, and purse, suld mind a gloom from a great man mair than a\r\nfriend's life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEwan seemed sorely agitated, but was silent.--We heard the Duke's voice\r\nfrom the opposite bank call, \xe2\x80\x9cBring over the prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEwan put his horse in motion, and just as I heard Roy say, \xe2\x80\x9cNever weigh a\r\nMacGregor's bluid against a broken whang o' leather, for there will be\r\nanother accounting to gie for it baith here and hereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d they passed\r\nme hastily, and dashing forward rather precipitately, entered the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, sir--not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said some of the troopers to me, as I was about\r\nto follow, while others pressed forward into the stream.\r\n\r\nI saw the Duke on the other side, by the waning light, engaged in\r\ncommanding his people to get into order, as they landed dispersedly, some\r\nhigher, some lower. Many had crossed, some were in the water, and the\r\nrest were preparing to follow, when a sudden splash warned me that\r\nMacGregor's eloquence had prevailed on Ewan to give him freedom and a\r\nchance for life. The Duke also heard the sound, and instantly guessed its\r\nmeaning. \xe2\x80\x9cDog!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed to Ewan as he landed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is your\r\nprisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d and, without waiting to hear the apology which the terrified\r\nvassal began to falter forth, he fired a pistol at his head, whether\r\nfatally I know not, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, disperse and pursue the\r\nvillain--An hundred guineas for him that secures Rob Roy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll became an instant scene of the most lively confusion. Rob Roy,\r\ndisengaged from his bonds, doubtless by Ewan's slipping the buckle of his\r\nbelt, had dropped off at the horse's tail, and instantly dived, passing\r\nunder the belly of the troop-horse which was on his left hand. But as he\r\nwas obliged to come to the surface an instant for air, the glimpse of his\r\ntartan plaid drew the attention of the troopers, some of whom plunged\r\ninto the river, with a total disregard to their own safety, rushing,\r\naccording to the expression of their country, through pool and stream,\r\nsometimes swimming their horses, sometimes losing them and struggling for\r\ntheir own lives. Others, less zealous or more prudent, broke off in\r\ndifferent directions, and galloped up and down the banks, to watch the\r\nplaces at which the fugitive might possibly land. The hollowing, the\r\nwhooping, the calls for aid at different points, where they saw, or\r\nconceived they saw, some vestige of him they were seeking,--the frequent\r\nreport of pistols and carabines, fired at every object which excited the\r\nleast suspicion,--the sight of so many horsemen riding about, in and out\r\nof the river, and striking with their long broadswords at whatever\r\nexcited their attention, joined to the vain exertions used by their\r\nofficers to restore order and regularity,--and all this in so wild a\r\nscene, and visible only by the imperfect twilight of an autumn evening,\r\nmade the most extraordinary hubbub I had hitherto witnessed. I was indeed\r\nleft alone to observe it, for our whole cavalcade had dispersed in\r\npursuit, or at least to see the event of the search. Indeed, as I partly\r\nsuspected at the time, and afterwards learned with certainty, many of\r\nthose who seemed most active in their attempts to waylay and recover the\r\nfugitive, were, in actual truth, least desirous that he should be taken,\r\nand only joined in the cry to increase the general confusion, and to give\r\nRob Roy a better opportunity of escaping.\r\n\r\nEscape, indeed, was not difficult for a swimmer so expert as the\r\nfreebooter, as soon as he had eluded the first burst of pursuit. At one\r\ntime he was closely pressed, and several blows were made which flashed in\r\nthe water around him; the scene much resembling one of the otter-hunts\r\nwhich I had seen at Osbaldistone Hall, where the animal is detected by\r\nthe hounds from his being necessitated to put his nose above the stream\r\nto vent or breathe, while he is enabled to elude them by getting under\r\nwater again so soon as he has refreshed himself by respiration.\r\nMacGregor, however, had a trick beyond the otter; for he contrived, when\r\nvery closely pursued, to disengage himself unobserved from his plaid, and\r\nsuffer it to float down the stream, where in its progress it quickly\r\nattracted general attention; many of the horsemen were thus put upon a\r\nfalse scent, and several shots or stabs were averted from the party for\r\nwhom they were designed.\r\n\r\nOnce fairly out of view, the recovery of the prisoner became almost\r\nimpossible, since, in so many places, the river was rendered inaccessible\r\nby the steepness of its banks, or the thickets of alders, poplars, and\r\nbirch, which, overhanging its banks, prevented the approach of horsemen.\r\nErrors and accidents had also happened among the pursuers, whose task the\r\napproaching night rendered every moment more hopeless. Some got\r\nthemselves involved in the eddies of the stream, and required the\r\nassistance of their companions to save them from drowning. Others, hurt\r\nby shots or blows in the confused mele'e, implored help or threatened\r\nvengeance, and in one or two instances such accidents led to actual\r\nstrife. The trumpets, therefore, sounded the retreat, announcing that the\r\ncommanding officer, with whatsoever unwillingness, had for the present\r\nrelinquished hopes of the important prize which had thus unexpectedly\r\nescaped his grasp, and the troopers began slowly, reluctantly, and\r\nbrawling with each other as they returned, again to assume their ranks. I\r\ncould see them darkening, as they formed on the southern bank of the\r\nriver,--whose murmurs, long drowned by the louder cries of vengeful\r\npursuit, were now heard hoarsely mingling with the deep, discontented,\r\nand reproachful voices of the disappointed horsemen.\r\n\r\nHitherto I had been as it were a mere spectator, though far from an\r\nuninterested one, of the singular scene which had passed. But now I heard\r\na voice suddenly exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the English stranger?--It was he gave\r\nRob Roy the knife to cut the belt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCleeve the pock-pudding to the chafts!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeize a brace of balls through his harn-pan!\xe2\x80\x9d said a second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive three inches of cauld airn into his brisket!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a third.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard several horses galloping to and fro, with the kind purpose,\r\ndoubtless, of executing these denunciations. I was immediately awakened\r\nto the sense of my situation, and to the certainty that armed men, having\r\nno restraint whatever on their irritated and inflamed passions, would\r\nprobably begin by shooting or cutting me down, and afterwards investigate\r\nthe justice of the action. Impressed by this belief, I leaped from my\r\nhorse, and turning him loose, plunged into a bush of alder-trees, where,\r\nconsidering the advancing obscurity of the night, I thought there was\r\nlittle chance of my being discovered. Had I been near enough to the Duke\r\nto have invoked his personal protection, I would have done so; but he had\r\nalready commenced his retreat, and I saw no officer on the left bank of\r\nthe river, of authority sufficient to have afforded protection, in case\r\nof my surrendering myself. I thought there was no point of honour which\r\ncould require, in such circumstances, an unnecessary exposure of my life.\r\nMy first idea, when the tumult began to be appeased, and the clatter of\r\nthe horses' feet was heard less frequently in the immediate vicinity of\r\nmy hiding-place, was to seek out the Duke's quarters when all should be\r\nquiet, and give myself up to him, as a liege subject, who had nothing to\r\nfear from his justice, and a stranger, who had every right to expect\r\nprotection and hospitality. With this purpose I crept out of my\r\nhiding-place, and looked around me.\r\n\r\nThe twilight had now melted nearly into darkness; a few or none of the\r\ntroopers were left on my side of the Forth, and of those who were already\r\nacross it, I only heard the distant trample of the horses' feet, and the\r\nwailing and prolonged sound of their trumpets, which rung through the\r\nwoods to recall stragglers. Here, therefore, I was left in a situation of\r\nconsiderable difficulty. I had no horse, and the deep and wheeling stream\r\nof the river, rendered turbid by the late tumult of which its channel had\r\nbeen the scene, and seeming yet more so under the doubtful influence of\r\nan imperfect moonlight, had no inviting influence for a pedestrian by no\r\nmeans accustomed to wade rivers, and who had lately seen horsemen\r\nweltering, in this dangerous passage, up to the very saddle-laps. At the\r\nsame time, my prospect, if I remained on the side of the river on which I\r\nthen stood, could be no other than of concluding the various fatigues of\r\nthis day and the preceding night, by passing that which was now closing\r\nin, _al fresco_ on the side of a Highland hill.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's reflection, I began to consider that Fairservice, who\r\nhad doubtless crossed the river with the other domestics, according to\r\nhis forward and impertinent custom of putting himself always among the\r\nforemost, could not fail to satisfy the Duke, or the competent\r\nauthorities, respecting my rank and situation; and that, therefore, my\r\ncharacter did not require my immediate appearance, at the risk of being\r\ndrowned in the river--of being unable to trace the march of the squadron\r\nin case of my reaching the other side in safety--or, finally, of being\r\ncut down, right or wrong, by some straggler, who might think such a piece\r\nof good service a convenient excuse for not sooner rejoining his ranks. I\r\ntherefore resolved to measure my steps back to the little inn, where I\r\nhad passed the preceding night. I had nothing to apprehend from Rob Roy.\r\nHe was now at liberty, and I was certain, in case of my falling in with\r\nany of his people, the news of his escape would ensure me protection. I\r\nmight thus also show, that I had no intention to desert Mr. Jarvie in the\r\ndelicate situation in which he had engaged himself chiefly on my account.\r\nAnd lastly, it was only in this quarter that I could hope to learn\r\ntidings concerning Rashleigh and my father's papers, which had been the\r\noriginal cause of an expedition so fraught with perilous adventure. I\r\ntherefore abandoned all thoughts of crossing the Forth that evening; and,\r\nturning my back on the Fords of Frew, began to retrace my steps towards\r\nthe little village of Aberfoil.\r\n\r\nA sharp frost-wind, which made itself heard and felt from time to time,\r\nremoved the clouds of mist which might otherwise have slumbered till\r\nmorning on the valley; and, though it could not totally disperse the\r\nclouds of vapour, yet threw them in confused and changeful masses, now\r\nhovering round the heads of the mountains, now filling, as with a dense\r\nand voluminous stream of smoke, the various deep gullies where masses of\r\nthe composite rock, or breccia, tumbling in fragments from the cliffs,\r\nhave rushed to the valley, leaving each behind its course a rent and torn\r\nravine resembling a deserted water-course. The moon, which was now high,\r\nand twinkled with all the vivacity of a frosty atmosphere, silvered the\r\nwindings of the river and the peaks and precipices which the mist left\r\nvisible, while her beams seemed as it were absorbed by the fleecy\r\nwhiteness of the mist, where it lay thick and condensed; and gave to the\r\nmore light and vapoury specks, which were elsewhere visible, a sort of\r\nfilmy transparency resembling the lightest veil of silver gauze. Despite\r\nthe uncertainty of my situation, a view so romantic, joined to the active\r\nand inspiring influence of the frosty atmosphere, elevated my spirits\r\nwhile it braced my nerves. I felt an inclination to cast care away, and\r\nbid defiance to danger, and involuntarily whistled, by way of cadence to\r\nmy steps, which my feeling of the cold led me to accelerate, and I felt\r\nthe pulse of existence beat prouder and higher in proportion as I felt\r\nconfidence in my own strength, courage, and resources. I was so much lost\r\nin these thoughts, and in the feelings which they excited, that two\r\nhorsemen came up behind me without my hearing their approach, until one\r\nwas on each side of me, when the left-hand rider, pulling up his horse,\r\naddressed me in the English tongue--\xe2\x80\x9cSo ho, friend! whither so late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my supper and bed at Aberfoil,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the passes open?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, with the same commanding tone of\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall learn when I get there. But,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nadded, the fate of Morris recurring to my recollection, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are an\r\nEnglish stranger, I advise you to turn back till daylight; there has been\r\nsome disturbance in this neighbourhood, and I should hesitate to say it\r\nis perfectly safe for strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe soldiers had the worst?--had they not?\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had indeed; and an officer's party were destroyed or made\r\nprisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of that?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the horseman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs sure as that I hear you speak,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI was an unwilling\r\nspectator of the skirmish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnwilling!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the interrogator. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you not engaged in it\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly no,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI was detained by the king's officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what suspicion? and who are you? or what is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really do not know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy I should answer so many\r\nquestions to an unknown stranger. I have told you enough to convince you\r\nthat you are going into a dangerous and distracted country. If you choose\r\nto proceed, it is your own affair; but as I ask you no questions\r\nrespecting your name and business, you will oblige me by making no\r\ninquiries after mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Francis Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other rider, in a voice the tones of\r\nwhich thrilled through every nerve of my body, \xe2\x80\x9cshould not whistle his\r\nfavourite airs when he wishes to remain undiscovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Diana Vernon--for she, wrapped in a horseman's cloak, was the last\r\nspeaker--whistled in playful mimicry the second part of the tune which\r\nwas on my lips when they came up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, like one thunderstruck, \xe2\x80\x9ccan it be you, Miss\r\nVernon, on such a spot--at such an hour--in such a lawless country--in\r\nsuch\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn such a masculine dress, you would say.--But what would you have? The\r\nphilosophy of the excellent Corporal Nym is the best after all; things\r\nmust be as they may--_pauca verba._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she was thus speaking, I eagerly took advantage of an unusually\r\nbright gleam of moonshine, to study the appearance of her companion; for\r\nit may be easily supposed, that finding Miss Vernon in a place so\r\nsolitary, engaged in a journey so dangerous, and under the protection of\r\none gentleman only, were circumstances to excite every feeling of\r\njealousy, as well as surprise. The rider did not speak with the deep\r\nmelody of Rashleigh's voice; his tones were more high and commanding; he\r\nwas taller, moreover, as he sate on horseback, than that first-rate\r\nobject of my hate and suspicion. Neither did the stranger's address\r\nresemble that of any of my other cousins; it had that indescribable tone\r\nand manner by which we recognise a man of sense and breeding, even in the\r\nfirst few sentences he speaks.\r\n\r\nThe object of my anxiety seemed desirous to get rid of my investigation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of mingled kindness and authority, \xe2\x80\x9cgive your\r\ncousin his property, and let us not spend time here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon had in the meantime taken out a small case, and leaning down\r\nfrom her horse towards me, she said, in a tone in which an effort at her\r\nusual quaint lightness of expression contended with a deeper and more\r\ngrave tone of sentiment, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear coz, I was born to be your\r\nbetter angel. Rashleigh has been compelled to yield up his spoil, and had\r\nwe reached this same village of Aberfoil last night, as we purposed, I\r\nshould have found some Highland sylph to have wafted to you all these\r\nrepresentatives of commercial wealth. But there were giants and dragons\r\nin the way; and errant-knights and damsels of modern times, bold though\r\nthey be, must not, as of yore, run into useless danger--Do not you do so\r\neither, my dear coz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion, \xe2\x80\x9clet me once more warn you that the evening\r\nwaxes late, and we are still distant from our home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming, sir, I am coming--Consider,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nlately I have been subjected to control--besides, I have not yet given my\r\ncousin the packet, and bid him fare-well--for ever. Yes, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cfor ever!--there is a gulf between us--a gulf of absolute\r\nperdition;--where we go, you must not follow--what we do, you must not\r\nshare in--Farewell--be happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parting of Die and Frank on the Moor --242]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the attitude in which she bent from her horse, which was a Highland\r\npony, her face, not perhaps altogether unwillingly, touched mine. She\r\npressed my hand, while the tear that trembled in her eye found its\r\nway to my cheek instead of her own. It was a moment never to be\r\nforgotten--inexpressibly bitter, yet mixed with a sensation of pleasure\r\nso deeply soothing and affecting, as at once to unlock all the\r\nflood-gates of the heart. It was _but_ a moment, however; for, instantly\r\nrecovering from the feeling to which she had involuntarily given way,\r\nshe intimated to her companion she was ready to attend him, and putting\r\ntheir horses to a brisk pace, they were soon far distant from the place\r\nwhere I stood.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows, it was not apathy which loaded my frame and my tongue so\r\nmuch, that I could neither return Miss Vernon's half embrace, nor even\r\nanswer her farewell. The word, though it rose to my tongue, seemed to\r\nchoke in my throat like the fatal _guilty,_ which the delinquent who\r\nmakes it his plea, knows must be followed by the doom of death. The\r\nsurprise--the sorrow, almost stupified me. I remained motionless with the\r\npacket in my hand, gazing after them, as if endeavouring to count the\r\nsparkles which flew from the horses' hoofs. I continued to look after\r\neven these had ceased to be visible, and to listen for their footsteps\r\nlong after the last distant trampling had died in my ears. At length,\r\ntears rushed to my eyes, glazed as they were by the exertion of straining\r\nafter what was no longer to be seen. I wiped them mechanically, and\r\nalmost without being aware that they were flowing--but they came thicker\r\nand thicker; I felt the tightening of the throat and breast--the\r\n_hysterica passio_ of poor Lear; and sitting down by the wayside, I shed\r\na flood of the first and most bitter tears which had flowed from my eyes\r\nsince childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Dangle._--Egad, I think the interpreter is the harder to be\r\n          understood of the two.\r\n                                        Critic.\r\n\r\nI had scarce given vent to my feelings in this paroxysm, ere was ashamed\r\nof my weakness. I remembered that I had been for some time endeavouring\r\nto regard Diana Vernon, when her idea intruded itself on my remembrance,\r\nas a friend, for whose welfare I should indeed always be anxious, but\r\nwith whom I could have little further communication. But the almost\r\nunrepressed tenderness of her manner, joined to the romance of our sudden\r\nmeeting where it was so little to have been expected, were circumstances\r\nwhich threw me entirely off my guard. I recovered, however, sooner than\r\nmight have been expected, and without giving myself time accurately to\r\nexamine my motives. I resumed the path on which I had been travelling\r\nwhen overtaken by this strange and unexpected apparition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not,\xe2\x80\x9d was my reflection, \xe2\x80\x9ctransgressing her injunction so\r\npathetically given, since I am but pursuing my own journey by the only\r\nopen route.--If I have succeeded in recovering my father's property, it\r\nstill remains incumbent on me to see my Glasgow friend delivered from the\r\nsituation in which he has involved himself on my account; besides, what\r\nother place of rest can I obtain for the night excepting at the little\r\ninn of Aberfoil? They also must stop there, since it is impossible for\r\ntravellers on horseback to go farther--Well, then, we shall meet\r\nagain--meet for the last time perhaps--But I shall see and hear her--I\r\nshall learn who this happy man is who exercises over her the authority\r\nof a husband--I shall learn if there remains, in the difficult course in\r\nwhich she seems engaged, any difficulty which my efforts may remove, or\r\naught that I can do to express my gratitude for her generosity--for her\r\ndisinterested friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I reasoned thus with myself, colouring with every plausible pretext\r\nwhich occurred to my ingenuity my passionate desire once more to see and\r\nconverse with my cousin, I was suddenly hailed by a touch on the\r\nshoulder; and the deep voice of a Highlander, who, walking still faster\r\nthan I, though I was proceeding at a smart pace, accosted me with, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nbraw night, Maister Osbaldistone--we have met at the mirk hour before\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the tone of MacGregor; he had escaped the pursuit\r\nof his enemies, and was in full retreat to his own wilds and to his\r\nadherents. He had also contrived to arm himself, probably at the house of\r\nsome secret adherent, for he had a musket on his shoulder, and the usual\r\nHighland weapons by his side. To have found myself alone with such a\r\ncharacter in such a situation, and at this late hour in the evening,\r\nmight not have been pleasant to me in any ordinary mood of mind; for,\r\nthough habituated to think of Rob Roy in rather a friendly point of view,\r\nI will confess frankly that I never heard him speak but that it seemed to\r\nthrill my blood. The intonation of the mountaineers gives a habitual\r\ndepth and hollowness to the sound of their words, owing to the guttural\r\nexpression so common in their native language, and they usually speak\r\nwith a good deal of emphasis. To these national peculiarities Rob Roy\r\nadded a sort of hard indifference of accent and manner, expressive of a\r\nmind neither to be daunted, nor surprised, nor affected by what passed\r\nbefore him, however dreadful, however sudden, however afflicting.\r\nHabitual danger, with unbounded confidence in his own strength and\r\nsagacity, had rendered him indifferent to fear, and the lawless and\r\nprecarious life he led had blunted, though its dangers and errors had not\r\ndestroyed, his feelings for others. And it was to be remembered that I\r\nhad very lately seen the followers of this man commit a cruel slaughter\r\non an unarmed and suppliant individual.\r\n\r\nYet such was the state of my mind, that I welcomed the company of the\r\noutlaw leader as a relief to my own overstrained and painful thoughts;\r\nand was not without hopes that through his means I might obtain some clew\r\nof guidance through the maze in which my fate had involved me. I\r\ntherefore answered his greeting cordially, and congratulated him on his\r\nlate escape in circumstances when escape seemed impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is as much between the craig and the woodie* as\r\nthere is between the cup and the lip. But my peril was less than you may\r\nthink, being a stranger to this country.\r\n\r\n* _i.e._ The throat and the withy. Twigs of willow, such as bind faggots,\r\nwere often used for halters in Scotland and Ireland, being a sage economy\r\nof hemp.\r\n\r\nOf those that were summoned to take me, and to keep me, and to retake me\r\nagain, there was a moiety, as cousin Nicol Jarvie calls it, that had nae\r\nwill that I suld be either taen, or keepit fast, or retaen; and of tother\r\nmoiety, there was as half was feared to stir me; and so I had only like\r\nthe fourth part of fifty or sixty men to deal withal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd enough, too, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I ken, that turn every ill-willer that\r\nI had amang them out upon the green before the Clachan of Aberfoil, I wad\r\nfind them play with broadsword and target, one down and another come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe now inquired into my adventures since we entered his country, and\r\nlaughed heartily at my account of the battle we had in the inn, and at\r\nthe exploits of the Bailie with the red-hot poker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet Glasgow Flourish!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of Cromwell on me, if I\r\nwad hae wished better sport than to see cousin Nicol Jarvie singe\r\nIverach's plaid, like a sheep's head between a pair of tongs. But my\r\ncousin Jarvie,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, more gravely, \xe2\x80\x9chas some gentleman's bluid in\r\nhis veins, although he has been unhappily bred up to a peaceful and\r\nmechanical craft, which could not but blunt any pretty man's spirit.--Ye\r\nmay estimate the reason why I could not receive you at the Clachan of\r\nAberfoil as I purposed. They had made a fine hosenet for me when I was\r\nabsent twa or three days at Glasgow, upon the king's business--But I\r\nthink I broke up the league about their lugs--they'll no be able to hound\r\none clan against another as they hae dune. I hope soon to see the day\r\nwhen a' Hielandmen will stand shouther to shouther. But what chanced\r\nnext?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave him an account of the arrival of Captain Thornton and his party,\r\nand the arrest of the Bailie and myself under pretext of our being\r\nsuspicious persons; and upon his more special inquiry, I recollected the\r\nofficer had mentioned that, besides my name sounding suspicious in his\r\nears, he had orders to secure an old and young person, resembling our\r\ndescription. This again moved the outlaw's risibility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs man lives by bread,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe buzzards have mistaen my friend\r\nthe Bailie for his Excellency, and you for Diana Vernon--O, the most\r\negregious night-howlets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vernon?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with hesitation, and trembling for the\r\nanswer--\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she still bear that name? She passed but now, along with\r\na gentleman who seemed to use a style of authority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cshe's under lawfu' authority now; and full time,\r\nfor she was a daft hempie--But she's a mettle quean. It's a pity his\r\nExcellency is a thought eldern. The like o' yourself, or my son Hamish,\r\nwad be mair sortable in point of years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a complete downfall of those castles of cards which my\r\nfancy had, in despite of my reason, so often amused herself with\r\nbuilding. Although in truth I had scarcely anything else to expect, since\r\nI could not suppose that Diana could be travelling in such a country, at\r\nsuch an hour, with any but one who had a legal title to protect her, I\r\ndid not feel the blow less severely when it came; and MacGregor's voice,\r\nurging me to pursue my story, sounded in my ears without conveying any\r\nexact import to my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length, after he had spoken twice without\r\nreceiving an answer; \xe2\x80\x9cthis day's wark has been ower muckle for ane\r\ndoubtless unused to sic things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of kindness in which this was spoken, recalling me to myself,\r\nand to the necessities of my situation, I continued my narrative as well\r\nas I could. Rob Roy expressed great exultation at the successful skirmish\r\nin the pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat king's chaff is better than other folk's\r\ncorn; but I think that canna be said o' king's soldiers, if they let\r\nthemselves be beaten wi' a wheen auld carles that are past fighting, and\r\nbairns that are no come till't, and wives wi' their rocks and distaffs,\r\nthe very wally-draigles o' the countryside. And Dougal Gregor, too--wha\r\nwad hae thought there had been as muckle sense in his tatty-pow, that\r\nne'er had a better covering than his ain shaggy hassock of hair!--But say\r\naway--though I dread what's to come neist--for my Helen's an incarnate\r\ndevil when her bluid's up--puir thing, she has ower muckle reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI observed as much delicacy as I could in communicating to him the usage\r\nwe had received, but I obviously saw the detail gave him great pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wad rather than a thousand merks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had been at hame!\r\nTo misguide strangers, and forbye a', my ain natural cousin, that had\r\nshowed me sic kindness--I wad rather they had burned half the Lennox in\r\ntheir folly! But this comes o' trusting women and their bairns, that have\r\nneither measure nor reason in their dealings. However, it's a' owing to\r\nthat dog of a gauger, wha betrayed me by pretending a message from your\r\ncousin Rashleigh, to meet him on the king's affairs, whilk I thought was\r\nvery like to be anent Garschattachin and a party of the Lennox declaring\r\nthemselves for King James. Faith! but I ken'd I was clean beguiled when I\r\nheard the Duke was there; and when they strapped the horse-girth ower my\r\narms, I might hae judged what was biding me; for I ken'd your kinsman,\r\nbeing, wi' pardon, a slippery loon himself, is prone to employ those of\r\nhis ain kidney--I wish he mayna hae been at the bottom o' the ploy\r\nhimsell--I thought the chield Morris looked devilish queer when I\r\ndetermined he should remain a wad, or hostage, for my safe back-coming.\r\nBut I _am_ come back, nae thanks to him, or them that employed him; and\r\nthe question is, how the collector loon is to win back himsell--I promise\r\nhim it will not be without a ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorris,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chas already paid the last ransom which mortal man can\r\nowe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! What?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my companion hastily; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat d'ye say? I trust it\r\nwas in the skirmish he was killed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was slain in cold blood after the fight was over, Mr. Campbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold blood?--Damnation!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, muttering betwixt his teeth--\xe2\x80\x9cHow fell\r\nthat, sir? Speak out, sir, and do not Maister or Campbell me--my foot is\r\non my native heath, and my name is MacGregor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis passions were obviously irritated; but without noticing the rudeness\r\nof his tone, I gave him a short and distinct account of the death of\r\nMorris. He struck the butt of his gun with great vehemence against the\r\nground, and broke out--\xe2\x80\x9cI vow to God, such a deed might make one forswear\r\nkin, clan, country, wife, and bairns! And yet the villain wrought long\r\nfor it. And what is the difference between warsling below the water wi' a\r\nstane about your neck, and wavering in the wind wi' a tether round\r\nit?--it's but choking after a', and he drees the doom he ettled for me. I\r\ncould have wished, though, they had rather putten a ball through him, or\r\na dirk; for the fashion of removing him will give rise to mony idle\r\nclavers--But every wight has his weird, and we maun a' dee when our day\r\ncomes--And naebody will deny that Helen MacGregor has deep wrongs to\r\navenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he seemed to dismiss the theme altogether from his mind, and\r\nproceeded to inquire how I got free from the party in whose hands he had\r\nseen me.\r\n\r\nMy story was soon told; and I added the episode of my having recovered\r\nthe papers of my father, though I dared not trust my voice to name the\r\nname of Diana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sure ye wad get them,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacGregor;--\xe2\x80\x9cthe letter ye brought me\r\ncontained his Excellency's pleasure to that effect and nae doubt it was\r\nmy will to have aided in it. And I asked ye up into this glen on the very\r\nerrand. But it's like his Excellency has foregathered wi' Rashleigh\r\nsooner than I expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first part of this answer was what most forcibly struck me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the letter I brought you, then, from this person you call his\r\nExcellency? Who is he? and what is his rank and proper name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacGregor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat since ye dinna ken them already\r\nthey canna be o' muckle consequence to you, and sae I shall say naething\r\non that score. But weel I wot the letter was frae his ain hand, or,\r\nhaving a sort of business of my ain on my hands, being, as ye weel may\r\nsee, just as much as I can fairly manage, I canna say I would hae fashed\r\nmysell sae muckle about the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI now recollected the lights seen in the library--the various\r\ncircumstances which had excited my jealousy--the glove--the agitation of\r\nthe tapestry which covered the secret passage from Rashleigh's apartment;\r\nand, above all, I recollected that Diana retired in order to write, as I\r\nthen thought, the billet to which I was to have recourse in case of the\r\nlast necessity. Her hours, then, were not spent in solitude, but in\r\nlistening to the addresses of some desperate agent of Jacobitical\r\ntreason, who was a secret resident within the mansion of her uncle! Other\r\nyoung women have sold themselves for gold, or suffered themselves to be\r\nseduced from their first love from vanity; but Diana had sacrificed my\r\naffections and her own to partake the fortunes of some desperate\r\nadventurer--to seek the haunts of freebooters through midnight deserts,\r\nwith no better hopes of rank or fortune than that mimicry of both which\r\nthe mock court of the Stuarts at St. Germains had in their power to\r\nbestow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see her,\xe2\x80\x9d I said internally, \xe2\x80\x9cif it be possible, once more. I\r\nwill argue with her as a friend--as a kinsman--on the risk she is\r\nincurring, and I will facilitate her retreat to France, where she may,\r\nwith more comfort and propriety, as well as safety, abide the issue of\r\nthe turmoils which the political trepanner, to whom she has united her\r\nfate, is doubtless busied in putting into motion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conclude, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to MacGregor, after about five minutes'\r\nsilence on both sides, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his Excellency, since you give me no other\r\nname for him, was residing in Osbaldistone Hall at the same time with\r\nmyself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure--to be sure--and in the young lady's apartment, as best\r\nreason was.\xe2\x80\x9d This gratuitous information was adding gall to bitterness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut few,\xe2\x80\x9d added MacGregor, \xe2\x80\x9cken'd he was derned there, save Rashleigh\r\nand Sir Hildebrand; for you were out o' the question; and the young lads\r\nhaena wit eneugh to ca' the cat frae the cream--But it's a bra'\r\nauld-fashioned house, and what I specially admire is the abundance o'\r\nholes and bores and concealments--ye could put twenty or thirty men in ae\r\ncorner, and a family might live a week without finding them out--whilk,\r\nnae doubt, may on occasion be a special convenience. I wish we had the\r\nlike o' Osbaldistone Hall on the braes o' Craig-Royston--But we maun gar\r\nwoods and caves serve the like o' us puir Hieland bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose his Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwas privy to the first accident\r\nwhich befell\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nI could not help hesitating a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe were going to say Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob Roy coolly, for he was too much\r\naccustomed to deeds of violence for the agitation he had at first\r\nexpressed to be of long continuance. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to laugh heartily at that\r\nreik; but I'll hardly hae the heart to do't again, since the ill-far'd\r\naccident at the Loch. Na, na--his Excellency ken'd nought o' that\r\nploy--it was a' managed atween Rashleigh and mysell. But the sport that\r\ncame after--and Rashleigh's shift o' turning the suspicion aff himself\r\nupon you, that he had nae grit favour to frae the beginning--and then\r\nMiss Die, she maun hae us sweep up a' our spiders' webs again, and set\r\nyou out o' the Justice's claws--and then the frightened craven Morris,\r\nthat was scared out o' his seven senses by seeing the real man when he\r\nwas charging the innocent stranger--and the gowk of a clerk--and the\r\ndrunken carle of a justice--Ohon! ohon!--mony a laugh that job's gien\r\nme--and now, a' that I can do for the puir devil is to get some messes\r\nsaid for his soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chow Miss Vernon came to have so much influence over\r\nRashleigh and his accomplices as to derange your projected plan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine! it was none of mine. No man can say I ever laid my burden on other\r\nfolk's shoulders--it was a' Rashleigh's doings. But, undoubtedly, she had\r\ngreat influence wi' us baith on account of his Excellency's affection, as\r\nweel as that she ken'd far ower mony secrets to be lightlied in a matter\r\no' that kind.--Deil tak him,\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated, by way of summing up, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\ngies women either secret to keep or power to abuse--fules shouldna hae\r\nchapping-sticks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were now within a quarter of a mile from the village, when three\r\nHighlanders, springing upon us with presented arms, commanded us to stand\r\nand tell our business. The single word _Gregaragh,_ in the deep and\r\ncommanding voice of my companion, was answered by a shout, or rather\r\nyell, of joyful recognition. One, throwing down his firelock, clasped his\r\nleader so fast round the knees, that he was unable to extricate himself,\r\nmuttering, at the same time, a torrent of Gaelic gratulation, which every\r\nnow and then rose into a sort of scream of gladness. The two others,\r\nafter the first howling was over, set off literally with the speed of\r\ndeers, contending which should first carry to the village, which a strong\r\nparty of the MacGregors now occupied, the joyful news of Rob Roy's escape\r\nand return. The intelligence excited such shouts of jubilation, that the\r\nvery hills rung again, and young and old, men, women, and children,\r\nwithout distinction of sex or age, came running down the vale to meet us,\r\nwith all the tumultuous speed and clamour of a mountain torrent. When I\r\nheard the rushing noise and yells of this joyful multitude approach us, I\r\nthought it a fitting precaution to remind MacGregor that I was a\r\nstranger, and under his protection. He accordingly held me fast by the\r\nhand, while the assemblage crowded around him with such shouts of devoted\r\nattachment, and joy at his return, as were really affecting; nor did he\r\nextend to his followers what all eagerly sought, the grasp, namely, of\r\nhis hand, until he had made them understand that I was to be kindly and\r\ncarefully used.\r\n\r\nThe mandate of the Sultan of Delhi could not have been more promptly\r\nobeyed. Indeed, I now sustained nearly as much inconvenience from their\r\nwell-meant attentions as formerly from their rudeness. They would hardly\r\nallow the friend of their leader to walk upon his own legs, so earnest\r\nwere they in affording me support and assistance upon the way; and at\r\nlength, taking advantage of a slight stumble which I made over a stone,\r\nwhich the press did not permit me to avoid, they fairly seized upon me,\r\nand bore me in their arms in triumph towards Mrs. MacAlpine's.\r\n\r\nOn arrival before her hospitable wigwam, I found power and popularity had\r\nits inconveniences in the Highlands, as everywhere else; for, before\r\nMacGregor could be permitted to enter the house where he was to obtain\r\nrest and refreshment, he was obliged to relate the story of his escape at\r\nleast a dozen times over, as I was told by an officious old man, who\r\nchose to translate it at least as often for my edification, and to whom I\r\nwas in policy obliged to seem to pay a decent degree of attention. The\r\naudience being at length satisfied, group after group departed to take\r\ntheir bed upon the heath, or in the neighbouring huts, some cursing the\r\nDuke and Garschattachin, some lamenting the probable danger of Ewan of\r\nBrigglands, incurred by his friendship to MacGregor, but all agreeing\r\nthat the escape of Rob Roy himself lost nothing in comparison with the\r\nexploit of any one of their chiefs since the days of Dougal Ciar, the\r\nfounder of his line.\r\n\r\nThe friendly outlaw, now taking me by the arm, conducted me into the\r\ninterior of the hut. My eyes roved round its smoky recesses in quest of\r\nDiana and her companion; but they were nowhere to be seen, and I felt as\r\nif to make inquiries might betray some secret motives, which were best\r\nconcealed. The only known countenance upon which my eyes rested was that\r\nof the Bailie, who, seated on a stool by the fireside, received with a\r\nsort of reserved dignity, the welcomes of Rob Roy, the apologies which he\r\nmade for his indifferent accommodation, and his inquiries after his\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am pretty weel, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie--\xe2\x80\x9cindifferent weel, I thank\r\nye; and for accommodations, ane canna expect to carry about the Saut\r\nMarket at his tail, as a snail does his caup;--and I am blythe that ye\r\nhae gotten out o' the hands o' your unfreends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel, then,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Roy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is't ails ye, man--a's weel that\r\nends weel!--the warld will last our day--Come, take a cup o' brandy--your\r\nfather the deacon could take ane at an orra time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be he might do sae, Robin, after fatigue--whilk has been my lot\r\nmair ways than ane this day. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, slowly filling up a\r\nlittle wooden stoup which might hold about three glasses, \xe2\x80\x9che was a\r\nmoderate man of his bicker, as I am mysell--Here's wussing health to ye,\r\nRobin\xe2\x80\x9d (a sip), \xe2\x80\x9cand your weelfare here and hereafter\xe2\x80\x9d (another taste),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand also to my cousin Helen--and to your twa hopefu' lads, of whom mair\r\nanon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he drank up the contents of the cup with great gravity and\r\ndeliberation, while MacGregor winked aside to me, as if in ridicule of\r\nthe air of wisdom and superior authority which the Bailie assumed towards\r\nhim in their intercourse, and which he exercised when Rob was at the head\r\nof his armed clan, in full as great, or a greater degree, than when he\r\nwas at the Bailie's mercy in the Tolbooth of Glasgow. It seemed to me,\r\nthat MacGregor wished me, as a stranger, to understand, that if he\r\nsubmitted to the tone which his kinsman assumed, it was partly out of\r\ndeference to the rights of hospitality, but still more for the jest's\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nAs the Bailie set down his cup he recognised me, and giving me a cordial\r\nwelcome on my return, he waived farther communication with me for the\r\npresent.--\xe2\x80\x9cI will speak to your matters anon; I maun begin, as in reason,\r\nwi' those of my kinsman.--I presume, Robin, there's naebody here will\r\ncarry aught o' what I am gaun to say, to the town-council or elsewhere,\r\nto my prejudice or to yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake yourself easy on that head, cousin Nicol,\xe2\x80\x9d answered MacGregor; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ntae half o' the gillies winna ken what ye say, and the tother winna\r\ncare--besides that, I wad stow the tongue out o' the head o' any o' them\r\nthat suld presume to say ower again ony speech held wi' me in their\r\npresence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, cousin, sic being the case, and Mr. Osbaldistone here being a\r\nprudent youth, and a safe friend--I'se plainly tell ye, ye are breeding\r\nup your family to gang an ill gate.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, clearing his voice with a\r\npreliminary hem, he addressed his kinsman, checking, as Malvolio proposed\r\nto do when seated in his state, his familiar smile with an austere regard\r\nof control.--\xe2\x80\x9cYe ken yourself ye haud light by the law--and for my cousin\r\nHelen, forbye that her reception o' me this blessed day--whilk I excuse\r\non account of perturbation of mind, was muckle on the north side o'\r\n_friendly,_ I say (outputting this personal reason of complaint) I hae\r\nthat to say o' your wife\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay _nothing_ of her, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, in a grave and stern tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut what is befitting a friend to say, and her husband to hear. Of me\r\nyou are welcome to say your full pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, aweel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, somewhat disconcerted, \xe2\x80\x9cwe'se let that\r\nbe a pass-over--I dinna approve of making mischief in families. But here\r\nare your twa sons, Hamish and Robin, whilk signifies, as I'm gien to\r\nunderstand, James and Robert--I trust ye will call them sae in\r\nfuture--there comes nae gude o' Hamishes, and Eachines, and Angusses,\r\nexcept that they're the names ane aye chances to see in the indictments\r\nat the Western Circuits for cow-lifting, at the instance of his\r\nmajesty's advocate for his majesty's interest. Aweel, but the twa lads,\r\nas I was saying, they haena sae muckle as the ordinar grunds, man, of\r\nliberal education--they dinna ken the very multiplication table itself,\r\nwhilk is the root of a' usefu' knowledge, and they did naething but\r\nlaugh and fleer at me when I tauld them my mind on their ignorance--It's\r\nmy belief they can neither read, write, nor cipher, if sic a thing could\r\nbe believed o' ane's ain connections in a Christian land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they could, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacGregor, with great indifference, \xe2\x80\x9ctheir\r\nlearning must have come o' free will, for whar the deil was I to get them\r\na teacher?--wad ye hae had me put on the gate o' your Divinity Hall at\r\nGlasgow College, 'Wanted, a tutor for Rob Roy's bairns?'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Jarvie, \xe2\x80\x9cbut ye might hae sent the lads whar\r\nthey could hae learned the fear o' God, and the usages of civilised\r\ncreatures. They are as ignorant as the kyloes ye used to drive to market,\r\nor the very English churls that ye sauld them to, and can do naething\r\nwhatever to purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob; \xe2\x80\x9cHamish can bring doun a black-cock when he's on\r\nthe wing wi' a single bullet, and Rob can drive a dirk through a twa-inch\r\nboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSae muckle the waur for them, cousin!--sae muckle the waur for them\r\nbaith!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Glasgow merchant in a tone of great decision; \xe2\x80\x9can\r\nthey ken naething better than that, they had better no ken that neither.\r\nTell me yourself, Rob, what has a' this cutting, and stabbing, and\r\nshooting, and driving of dirks, whether through human flesh or fir deals,\r\ndune for yourself?--and werena ye a happier man at the tail o' your\r\nnowte-bestial, when ye were in an honest calling, than ever ye hae been\r\nsince, at the head o' your Hieland kernes and gally-glasses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI observed that MacGregor, while his well-meaning kinsman spoke to him in\r\nthis manner, turned and writhed his body like a man who indeed suffers\r\npain, but is determined no groan shall escape his lips; and I longed for\r\nan opportunity to interrupt the well-meant, but, as it was obvious to me,\r\nquite mistaken strain, in which Jarvie addressed this extraordinary\r\nperson. The dialogue, however, came to an end without my interference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sae,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cI hae been thinking, Rob, that as it may be\r\nye are ower deep in the black book to win a pardon, and ower auld to mend\r\nyourself, that it wad be a pity to bring up twa hopefu' lads to sic a\r\ngodless trade as your ain, and I wad blythely tak them for prentices at\r\nthe loom, as I began mysell, and my father the deacon afore me, though,\r\npraise to the Giver, I only trade now as wholesale dealer--And--and\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nHe saw a storm gathering on Rob's brow, which probably induced him to\r\nthrow in, as a sweetener of an obnoxious proposition, what he had\r\nreserved to crown his own generosity, had it been embraced as an\r\nacceptable one;--\xe2\x80\x9cand Robin, lad, ye needna look sae glum, for I'll pay\r\nthe prentice-fee, and never plague ye for the thousand merks neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ceade millia diaoul,_ hundred thousand devils!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rob,\r\nrising and striding through the hut, \xe2\x80\x9cMy sons weavers!--_Millia\r\nmolligheart!_--but I wad see every loom in Glasgow, beam, traddles,\r\nand shuttles, burnt in hell-fire sooner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty I made the Bailie, who was preparing a reply,\r\ncomprehend the risk and impropriety of pressing our host on this topic,\r\nand in a minute he recovered, or reassumed, his serenity of temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye mean weel--ye mean weel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cso gie me your hand, Nicol,\r\nand if ever I put my sons apprentice, I will gie you the refusal o' them.\r\nAnd, as you say, there's the thousand merks to be settled between us.--\r\nHere, Eachin MacAnaleister, bring me my sporran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe person he addressed, a tall, strong mountaineer, who seemed to act as\r\nMacGregor's lieutenant, brought from some place of safety a large\r\nleathern pouch, such as Highlanders of rank wear before them when in full\r\ndress, made of the skin of the sea-otter, richly garnished with silver\r\nornaments and studs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise no man to attempt opening this sporran till he has my secret,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Rob Roy; and then twisting one button in one direction, and another\r\nin another, pulling one stud upward, and pressing another downward, the\r\nmouth of the purse, which was bound with massive silver plate, opened and\r\ngave admittance to his hand. He made me remark, as if to break short the\r\nsubject on which Bailie Jarvie had spoken, that a small steel pistol was\r\nconcealed within the purse, the trigger of which was connected with the\r\nmounting, and made part of the machinery, so that the weapon would\r\ncertainly be discharged, and in all probability its contents lodged in\r\nthe person of any one, who, being unacquainted with the secret, should\r\ntamper with the lock which secured his treasure. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said he touching\r\nthe pistol--\xe2\x80\x9cthis is the keeper of my privy purse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the contrivance to secure a furred pouch, which could\r\nhave been ripped open without any attempt on the spring, reminded me of\r\nthe verses in the Odyssey, where Ulysses, in a yet ruder age, is content\r\nto secure his property by casting a curious and involved complication of\r\ncordage around the sea-chest in which it was deposited.\r\n\r\nThe Bailie put on his spectacles to examine the mechanism, and when he\r\nhad done, returned it with a smile and a sigh, observing--\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Rob, had\r\nither folk's purses been as weel guarded, I doubt if your sporran wad hae\r\nbeen as weel filled as it kythes to be by the weight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cit will aye open for a\r\nfriend's necessity, or to pay a just due--and here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pulling\r\nout a rouleau of gold, \xe2\x80\x9chere is your ten hundred merks--count them, and\r\nsee that you are full and justly paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jarvie took the money in silence, and weighing it in his hand for an\r\ninstant, laid it on the table, and replied, \xe2\x80\x9cRob, I canna tak it--I downa\r\nintromit with it--there can nae gude come o't--I hae seen ower weel the\r\nday what sort of a gate your gowd is made in--ill-got gear ne'er\r\nprospered; and, to be plain wi' you, I winna meddle wi't--it looks as\r\nthere might be bluid on't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroutsho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the outlaw, affecting an indifference which perhaps he\r\ndid not altogether feel; \xe2\x80\x9cit's gude French gowd, and ne'er was in\r\nScotchman's pouch before mine. Look at them, man--they are a'\r\nlouis-d'ors, bright and bonnie as the day they were coined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe waur, the waur--just sae muckle the waur, Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nBailie, averting his eyes from the money, though, like Caesar on the\r\nLupercal, his fingers seemed to itch for it--\xe2\x80\x9cRebellion is waur than\r\nwitchcraft, or robbery either; there's gospel warrant for't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the warrant, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the freebooter; \xe2\x80\x9cyou come by the\r\ngowd honestly, and in payment of a just debt--it came from the one king,\r\nyou may gie it to the other, if ye like; and it will just serve for a\r\nweakening of the enemy, and in the point where puir King James is weakest\r\ntoo, for, God knows, he has hands and hearts eneugh, but I doubt he wants\r\nthe siller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe'll no get mony Hielanders then, Robin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie, as, again\r\nreplacing his spectacles on his nose, he undid the rouleau, and began to\r\ncount its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor Lowlanders neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacGregor, arching his eyebrow, and, as he\r\nlooked at me, directing a glance towards Mr. Jarvie, who, all unconscious\r\nof the ridicule, weighed each piece with habitual scrupulosity; and\r\nhaving told twice over the sum, which amounted to the discharge of his\r\ndebt, principal and interest, he returned three pieces to buy his\r\nkinswoman a gown, as he expressed himself, and a brace more for the twa\r\nbairns, as he called them, requesting they might buy anything they liked\r\nwith them except gunpowder. The Highlander stared at his kinsman's\r\nunexpected generosity, but courteously accepted his gift, which he\r\ndeposited for the time in his well-secured pouch.\r\n\r\nThe Bailie next produced the original bond for the debt, on the back of\r\nwhich he had written a formal discharge, which, having subscribed\r\nhimself, he requested me to sign as a witness. I did so, and Bailie\r\nJarvie was looking anxiously around for another, the Scottish law\r\nrequiring the subscription of two witnesses to validate either a bond or\r\nacquittance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will hardly find a man that can write save ourselves\r\nwithin these three miles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I'll settle the matter as\r\neasily;\xe2\x80\x9d and, taking the paper from before his kinsman, he threw it in\r\nthe fire. Bailie Jarvie stared in his turn, but his kinsman continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's a Hieland settlement of accounts. The time might come, cousin,\r\nwere I to keep a' these charges and discharges, that friends might be\r\nbrought into trouble for having dealt with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie attempted no reply to this argument, and our supper now\r\nappeared in a style of abundance, and even delicacy, which, for the\r\nplace, might be considered as extraordinary. The greater part of the\r\nprovisions were cold, intimating they had been prepared at some distance;\r\nand there were some bottles of good French wine to relish pasties of\r\nvarious sorts of game, as well as other dishes. I remarked that\r\nMacGregor, while doing the honours of the table with great and anxious\r\nhospitality, prayed us to excuse the circumstance that some particular\r\ndish or pasty had been infringed on before it was presented to us. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust know,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Mr. Jarvie, but without looking towards me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare not the only guests this night in the MacGregor's country, whilk,\r\ndoubtless, ye will believe, since my wife and the twa lads would\r\notherwise have been maist ready to attend you, as weel beseems them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBailie Jarvie looked as if he felt glad at any circumstance which\r\noccasioned their absence; and I should have been entirely of his opinion,\r\nhad it not been that the outlaw's apology seemed to imply they were in\r\nattendance on Diana and her companion, whom even in my thoughts I could\r\nnot bear to designate as her husband.\r\n\r\nWhile the unpleasant ideas arising from this suggestion counteracted the\r\ngood effects of appetite, welcome, and good cheer, I remarked that Rob\r\nRoy's attention had extended itself to providing us better bedding than\r\nwe had enjoyed the night before. Two of the least fragile of the\r\nbedsteads, which stood by the wall of the hut, had been stuffed with\r\nheath, then in full flower, so artificially arranged, that, the flowers\r\nbeing uppermost, afforded a mattress at once elastic and fragrant.\r\nCloaks, and such bedding as could be collected, stretched over this\r\nvegetable couch, made it both soft and warm. The Bailie seemed exhausted\r\nby fatigue. I resolved to adjourn my communication to him until next\r\nmorning; and therefore suffered him to betake himself to bed so soon as\r\nhe had finished a plentiful supper. Though tired and harassed, I did not\r\nmyself feel the same disposition to sleep, but rather a restless and\r\nfeverish anxiety, which led to some farther discourse betwixt me and\r\nMacGregor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.\r\n\r\n               A hopeless darkness settles o'er my fate;\r\n               I've seen the last look of her heavenly eyes,--\r\n               I've heard the last sound of her blessed voice,--\r\n               I've seen her fair form from my sight depart;\r\n                          My doom is closed.\r\n                                        Count Basil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken not what to make of you, Mr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacGregor, as he\r\npushed the flask towards me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou eat not, you show no wish for rest; and\r\nyet you drink not, though that flask of Bourdeaux might have come out of\r\nSir Hildebrand's ain cellar. Had you been always as abstinent, you would\r\nhave escaped the deadly hatred of your cousin Rashleigh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad I been always prudent,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, blushing at the scene he recalled to\r\nmy recollection, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have escaped a worse evil--the reproach of my\r\nown conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacGregor cast a keen and somewhat fierce glance on me, as if to read\r\nwhether the reproof, which he evidently felt, had been intentionally\r\nconveyed. He saw that I was thinking of myself, not of him, and turned\r\nhis face towards the fire with a deep sigh. I followed his example, and\r\neach remained for a few minutes wrapt in his own painful reverie. All in\r\nthe hut were now asleep, or at least silent, excepting ourselves.\r\n\r\nMacGregor first broke silence, in the tone of one who takes up his\r\ndetermination to enter on a painful subject. \xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin Nicol Jarvie\r\nmeans well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he presses ower hard on the temper and\r\nsituation of a man like me, considering what I have been--what I have\r\nbeen forced to become--and, above all, that which has forced me to become\r\nwhat I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused; and, though feeling the delicate nature of the discussion in\r\nwhich the conversation was likely to engage me, I could not help\r\nreplying, that I did not doubt his present situation had much which must\r\nbe most unpleasant to his feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be happy to learn,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is an honourable\r\nchance of your escaping from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak like a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned MacGregor, in a low tone that growled\r\nlike distant thunder--\xe2\x80\x9clike a boy, who thinks the auld gnarled oak can be\r\ntwisted as easily as the young sapling. Can I forget that I have been\r\nbranded as an outlaw--stigmatised as a traitor--a price set on my head as\r\nif I had been a wolf--my family treated as the dam and cubs of the\r\nhill-fox, whom all may torment, vilify, degrade, and insult--the very\r\nname which came to me from a long and noble line of martial ancestors,\r\ndenounced, as if it were a spell to conjure up the devil with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he went on in this manner, I could plainly see, that, by the\r\nenumeration of his wrongs, he was lashing himself up into a rage, in\r\norder to justify in his own eyes the errors they had led him into. In\r\nthis he perfectly succeeded; his light grey eyes contracting alternately\r\nand dilating their pupils, until they seemed actually to flash with\r\nflame, while he thrust forward and drew back his foot, grasped the hilt\r\nof his dirk, extended his arm, clenched his fist, and finally rose from\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they _shall_ find,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the same muttered but deep tone of\r\nstifled passion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the name they have dared to proscribe--that the\r\nname of MacGregor--_is_ a spell to raise the wild devil withal. _They_\r\nshall hear of my vengeance, that would scorn to listen to the story of my\r\nwrongs--The miserable Highland drover, bankrupt, barefooted,--stripped of\r\nall, dishonoured and hunted down, because the avarice of others grasped\r\nat more than that poor all could pay, shall burst on them in an awful\r\nchange. They that scoffed at the grovelling worm, and trode upon him, may\r\ncry and howl when they see the stoop of the flying and fiery-mouthed\r\ndragon.--But why do I speak of all this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting down again,\r\nand in a calmer tone--\xe2\x80\x9cOnly ye may opine it frets my patience, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone, to be hunted like an otter, or a sealgh, or a salmon upon\r\nthe shallows, and that by my very friends and neighbours; and to have as\r\nmany sword-cuts made, and pistols flashed at me, as I had this day in the\r\nford of Avondow, would try a saint's temper, much more a Highlander's,\r\nwho are not famous for that gude gift, as ye may hae heard, Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone.--But as thing bides wi' me o' what Nicol said;--I'm vexed\r\nfor the bairns--I'm vexed when I think o' Hamish and Robert living their\r\nfather's life.\xe2\x80\x9d And yielding to despondence on account of his sons, which\r\nhe felt not upon his own, the father rested his head upon his hand.\r\n\r\nI was much affected, Will. All my life long I have been more melted by\r\nthe distress under which a strong, proud, and powerful mind is compelled\r\nto give way, than by the more easily excited sorrows of softer\r\ndispositions. The desire of aiding him rushed strongly on my mind,\r\nnotwithstanding the apparent difficulty, and even impossibility, of the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have extensive connections abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said I: \xe2\x80\x9cmight not your sons,\r\nwith some assistance--and they are well entitled to what my father's\r\nhouse can give--find an honourable resource in foreign service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI believe my countenance showed signs of sincere emotion; but my\r\ncompanion, taking me by the hand, as I was going to speak farther,\r\nsaid--\xe2\x80\x9cI thank--I thank ye--but let us say nae mair o' this. I did not\r\nthink the eye of man would again have seen a tear on MacGregor's\r\neye-lash.\xe2\x80\x9d He dashed the moisture from his long gray eye-lash and shaggy\r\nred eye-brow with the back of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe'll talk of this, and we will talk, too, of your affairs--for we are\r\nearly starters in the dawn, even when we have the luck to have good beds\r\nto sleep in. Will ye not pledge me in a grace cup?\xe2\x80\x9d I declined the\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, by the soul of St. Maronoch! I must pledge myself,\xe2\x80\x9d and he poured\r\nout and swallowed at least half-a-quart of wine.\r\n\r\nI laid myself down to repose, resolving to delay my own inquiries until\r\nhis mind should be in a more composed state. Indeed, so much had this\r\nsingular man possessed himself of my imagination, that I felt it\r\nimpossible to avoid watching him for some minutes after I had flung\r\nmyself on my heath mattress to seeming rest. He walked up and down the\r\nhut, crossed himself from time to time, muttering over some Latin prayer\r\nof the Catholic church; then wrapped himself in his plaid, with his naked\r\nsword on one side, and his pistol on the other, so disposing the folds of\r\nhis mantle that he could start up at a moment's warning, with a weapon in\r\neither hand, ready for instant combat. In a few minutes his heavy\r\nbreathing announced that he was fast asleep. Overpowered by fatigue, and\r\nstunned by the various unexpected and extraordinary scenes of the day, I,\r\nin my turn, was soon overpowered by a slumber deep and overwhelming, from\r\nwhich, notwithstanding every cause for watchfulness, I did not awake\r\nuntil the next morning.\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, and recollected my situation, I found that\r\nMacGregor had already left the hut. I awakened the Bailie, who, after\r\nmany a snort and groan, and some heavy complaints of the soreness of his\r\nbones, in consequence of the unwonted exertions of the preceding day, was\r\nat length able to comprehend the joyful intelligence, that the assets\r\ncarried off by Rashleigh Osbaldistone had been safely recovered. The\r\ninstant he understood my meaning, he forgot all his grievances, and,\r\nbustling up in a great hurry, proceeded to compare the contents of the\r\npacket which I put into his hands, with Mr. Owen's memorandums,\r\nmuttering, as he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cRight, right--the real thing--Bailie and\r\nWhittington--where's Bailie and Whittington?--seven hundred, six, and\r\neight--exact to a fraction--Pollock and Peelman--twenty-eight,\r\nseven--exact--Praise be blest!--Grub and Grinder--better men cannot\r\nbe--three hundred and seventy--Gliblad--twenty; I doubt Gliblad's\r\nganging--Slipprytongue; Slipprytongue's gaen--but they are\r\nsma'sums--sma'sums--the rest's a'right--Praise be blest! we have got the\r\nstuff, and may leave this doleful country. I shall never think on\r\nLoch-Ard but the thought will gar me grew again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacGregor, who entered the hut during the last\r\nobservation, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not been altogether in the circumstances to make\r\nyour reception sic as I could have desired--natheless, if you would\r\ncondescend to visit my puir dwelling\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuckle obliged, muckle obliged,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Jarvie, very hastily--\xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwe maun be ganging--we maun be jogging, Mr. Osbaldistone and me--business\r\ncanna wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Highlander, \xe2\x80\x9cye ken our fashion--foster the\r\nguest that comes--further him that maun gang. But ye cannot return by\r\nDrymen--I must set you on Loch Lomond, and boat ye down to the Ferry o'\r\nBalloch, and send your nags round to meet ye there. It's a maxim of a\r\nwise man never to return by the same road he came, providing another's\r\nfree to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Rob,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat's ane o' the maxims ye learned when\r\nye were a drover;--ye caredna to face the tenants where your beasts had\r\nbeen taking a rug of their moorland grass in the by-ganging, and I doubt\r\nyour road's waur marked now than it was then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mair need not to travel it ower often, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI'se send round your nags to the ferry wi' Dougal Gregor, wha is\r\nconverted for that purpose into the Bailie's man, coming--not, as ye may\r\nbelieve, from Aberfoil or Rob Roy's country, but on a quiet jaunt from\r\nStirling. See, here he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wadna hae ken'd the creature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie; nor indeed was it easy\r\nto recognise the wild Highlander, when he appeared before the door of the\r\ncottage, attired in a hat, periwig, and riding-coat, which had once\r\ncalled Andrew Fairservice master, and mounted on the Bailie's horse, and\r\nleading mine. He received his last orders from his master to avoid\r\ncertain places where he might be exposed to suspicion--to collect what\r\nintelligence he could in the course of his journey, and to await our\r\ncoming at an appointed place, near the Ferry of Balloch.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, MacGregor invited us to accompany him upon our own\r\nroad, assuring us that we must necessarily march a few miles before\r\nbreakfast, and recommending a dram of brandy as a proper introduction to\r\nthe journey, in which he was pledged by the Bailie, who pronounced it \xe2\x80\x9can\r\nunlawful and perilous habit to begin the day wi' spirituous liquors,\r\nexcept to defend the stomach (whilk was a tender part) against the\r\nmorning mist; in whilk case his father the deacon had recommended a dram,\r\nby precept and example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cfor which reason we, who are Children\r\nof the Mist, have a right to drink brandy from morning till night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie, thus refreshed, was mounted on a small Highland pony; another\r\nwas offered for my use, which, however, I declined; and we resumed, under\r\nvery different guidance and auspices, our journey of the preceding day.\r\n\r\nOur escort consisted of MacGregor, and five or six of the handsomest,\r\nbest armed, and most athletic mountaineers of his band, and whom he had\r\ngenerally in immediate attendance upon his own person.\r\n\r\nWhen we approached the pass, the scene of the skirmish of the preceding\r\nday, and of the still more direful deed which followed it, MacGregor\r\nhastened to speak, as if it were rather to what he knew must be\r\nnecessarily passing in my mind, than to any thing I had said--he spoke,\r\nin short, to my thoughts, and not to my words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must think hardly of us, Mr. Osbaldistone, and it is not natural\r\nthat it should be otherwise. But remember, at least, we have not been\r\nunprovoked. We are a rude and an ignorant, and it may be a violent and\r\npassionate, but we are not a cruel people. The land might be at peace and\r\nin law for us, did they allow us to enjoy the blessings of peaceful law.\r\nBut we have been a persecuted generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd persecution,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cmaketh wise men mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must it do then to men like us, living as our fathers did a\r\nthousand years since, and possessing scarce more lights than they did?\r\nCan we view their bluidy edicts against us--their hanging, heading,\r\nhounding, and hunting down an ancient and honourable name--as deserving\r\nbetter treatment than that which enemies give to enemies?--Here I stand,\r\nhave been in twenty frays, and never hurt man but when I was in het\r\nbluid; and yet they wad betray me and hang me like a masterless dog, at\r\nthe gate of ony great man that has an ill will at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the proscription of his name and family sounded in\r\nEnglish ears as a very cruel and arbitrary law;\xe2\x80\x9d and having thus far\r\nsoothed him, I resumed my propositions of obtaining military employment\r\nfor himself, if he chose it, and his sons, in foreign parts. MacGregor\r\nshook me very cordially by the hand, and detaining me, so as to permit\r\nMr. Jarvie to precede us, a manoeuvre for which the narrowness of the\r\nroad served as an excuse, he said to me--\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a kind-hearted and an\r\nhonourable youth, and understand, doubtless, that which is due to the\r\nfeelings of a man of honour. But the heather that I have trode upon when\r\nliving, must bloom ower me when I am dead--my heart would sink, and my\r\narm would shrink and wither like fern in the frost, were I to lose sight\r\nof my native hills; nor has the world a scene that would console me for\r\nthe loss of the rocks and cairns, wild as they are, that you see around\r\nus.--And Helen--what could become of her, were I to leave her the subject\r\nof new insult and atrocity?--or how could she bear to be removed from\r\nthese scenes, where the remembrance of her wrongs is aye sweetened by the\r\nrecollection of her revenge?--I was once so hard put at by my Great\r\nenemy, as I may well ca' him, that I was forced e'en to gie way to the\r\ntide, and removed myself and my people and family from our dwellings in\r\nour native land, and to withdraw for a time into MacCallum More's\r\ncountry--and Helen made a Lament on our departure, as weel as MacRimmon*\r\nhimsell could hae framed it--and so piteously sad and waesome, that our\r\nhearts amaist broke as we sate and listened to her--it was like the\r\nwailing of one that mourns for the mother that bore him--the tears came\r\ndown the rough faces of our gillies as they hearkened; and I wad not have\r\nthe same touch of heartbreak again, no, not to have all the lands that\r\never were owned by MacGregor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* The MacRimmons or MacCrimonds were hereditary pipers to the chiefs of\r\nMacLeod, and celebrated for their talents. The pibroch said to have  been\r\ncomposed by Helen MacGregor is still in existence. See the Introduction\r\nto this Novel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your sons,\xe2\x80\x9d I said--\xe2\x80\x9cthey are at the age when your countrymen have\r\nusually no objection to see the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should be content,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they pushed their fortune in\r\nthe French or Spanish service, as is the wont of Scottish cavaliers of\r\nhonour; and last night your plan seemed feasible eneugh--But I hae seen\r\nhis Excellency this morning before ye were up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he then quarter so near us?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, my bosom throbbing with\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearer than ye thought,\xe2\x80\x9d was MacGregor's reply; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he seemed rather in\r\nsome shape to jalouse your speaking to the young leddy; and so you see\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no occasion for jealousy,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, with some haughtiness;\r\n--\xe2\x80\x9cI should not have intruded on his privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye must not be offended, or look out from amang your curls then,\r\nlike a wildcat out of an ivy-tod, for ye are to understand that he wishes\r\nmost sincere weel to you, and has proved it. And it's partly that whilk\r\nhas set the heather on fire e'en now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeather on fire?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed MacGregor, \xe2\x80\x9cye ken weel eneugh that women and gear are at\r\nthe bottom of a' the mischief in this warld. I hae been misdoubting your\r\ncousin Rashleigh since ever he saw that he wasna to get Die Vernon for\r\nhis marrow, and I think he took grudge at his Excellency mainly on that\r\naccount. But then came the splore about the surrendering your papers--and\r\nwe hae now gude evidence, that, sae soon as he was compelled to yield\r\nthem up, he rade post to Stirling, and tauld the Government all and mair\r\nthan all, that was gaun doucely on amang us hill-folk; and, doubtless,\r\nthat was the way that the country was laid to take his Excellency and the\r\nleddy, and to make sic an unexpected raid on me. And I hae as little\r\ndoubt that the poor deevil Morris, whom he could gar believe onything,\r\nwas egged on by him, and some of the Lowland gentry, to trepan me in the\r\ngate he tried to do. But if Rashleigh Osbaldistone were baith the last\r\nand best of his name, and granting that he and I ever forgather again,\r\nthe fiend go down my weasand with a bare blade at his belt, if we part\r\nbefore my dirk and his best blude are weel acquainted thegither!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pronounced the last threat with an ominous frown, and the appropriate\r\ngesture of his hand upon his dagger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should almost rejoice at what has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ccould I hope\r\nthat Rashleigh's treachery might prove the means of preventing the\r\nexplosion of the rash and desperate intrigues in which I have long\r\nsuspected him to be a prime agent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrow ye na that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob Roy; \xe2\x80\x9ctraitor's word never yet hurt honest\r\ncause. He was ower deep in our secrets, that's true; and had it not been\r\nso, Stirling and Edinburgh Castles would have been baith in our hands by\r\nthis time, or briefly hereafter, whilk is now scarce to be hoped for. But\r\nthere are ower mony engaged, and far ower gude a cause to be gien up for\r\nthe breath of a traitor's tale, and that will be seen and heard of ere it\r\nbe lang. And so, as I was about to say, the best of my thanks to you for\r\nyour offer anent my sons, whilk last night I had some thoughts to have\r\nembraced in their behalf. But I see that this villain's treason will\r\nconvince our great folks that they must instantly draw to a head, and\r\nmake a blow for it, or be taen in their houses, coupled up like hounds,\r\nand driven up to London like the honest noblemen and gentlemen in the\r\nyear seventeen hundred and seven. Civil war is like a cockatrice;--we\r\nhave sitten hatching the egg that held it for ten years, and might hae\r\nsitten on for ten years mair, when in comes Rashleigh, and chips the\r\nshell, and out bangs the wonder amang us, and cries to fire and sword.\r\nNow in sic a matter I'll hae need o' a' the hands I can mak; and, nae\r\ndisparagement to the Kings of France and Spain, whom I wish very weel to,\r\nKing James is as gude a man as ony o' them, and has the best right to\r\nHamish and Rob, being his natural-born subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI easily comprehended that these words boded a general national\r\nconvulsion; and, as it would have been alike useless and dangerous to\r\nhave combated the political opinions of my guide, at such a place and\r\nmoment, I contented myself with regretting the promiscuous scene of\r\nconfusion and distress likely to arise from any general exertion in\r\nfavour of the exiled royal family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it come, man--let it come,\xe2\x80\x9d answered MacGregor; \xe2\x80\x9cye never saw dull\r\nweather clear without a shower; and if the world is turned upside down,\r\nwhy, honest men have the better chance to cut bread out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI again attempted to bring him back to the subject of Diana; but although\r\non most occasions and subjects he used a freedom of speech which I had no\r\ngreat delight in listening to, yet upon that alone which was most\r\ninteresting to me, he kept a degree of scrupulous reserve, and contented\r\nhimself with intimating, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he hoped the leddy would be soon in a\r\nquieter country than this was like to be for one while.\xe2\x80\x9d I was obliged to\r\nbe content with this answer, and to proceed in the hope that accident\r\nmight, as on a former occasion, stand my friend, and allow me at least\r\nthe sad gratification of bidding farewell to the object which had\r\noccupied such a share of my affections, so much beyond even what I had\r\nsupposed, till I was about to be separated from her for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loch Lomond--284]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pursued the margin of the lake for about six English miles, through a\r\ndevious and beautifully variegated path, until we attained a sort of\r\nHighland farm, or assembly of hamlets, near the head of that fine sheet\r\nof water, called, if I mistake not, Lediart, or some such name. Here a\r\nnumerous party of MacGregor's men were stationed in order to receive us.\r\nThe taste as well as the eloquence of tribes in a savage, or, to speak\r\nmore properly, in a rude state, is usually just, because it is unfettered\r\nby system and affectation; and of this I had an example in the choice\r\nthese mountaineers had made of a place to receive their guests. It has\r\nbeen said that a British monarch would judge well to receive the embassy\r\nof a rival power in the cabin of a man-of-war; and a Highland leader\r\nacted with some propriety in choosing a situation where the natural\r\nobjects of grandeur proper to his country might have their full effect on\r\nthe minds of his guests.\r\n\r\nWe ascended about two hundred yards from the shores of the lake, guided\r\nby a brawling brook, and left on the right hand four or five Highland\r\nhuts, with patches of arable land around them, so small as to show that\r\nthey must have been worked with the spade rather than the plough, cut as\r\nit were out of the surrounding copsewood, and waving with crops of barley\r\nand oats. Above this limited space the hill became more steep; and on its\r\nedge we descried the glittering arms and waving drapery of about fifty of\r\nMacGregor's followers. They were stationed on a spot, the recollection of\r\nwhich yet strikes me with admiration. The brook, hurling its waters\r\ndownwards from the mountain, had in this spot encountered a barrier rock,\r\nover which it had made its way by two distinct leaps. The first fall,\r\nacross which a magnificent old oak, slanting out from the farther bank,\r\npartly extended itself as if to shroud the dusky stream of the cascade,\r\nmight be about twelve feet high; the broken waters were received in a\r\nbeautiful stone basin, almost as regular as if hewn by a sculptor; and\r\nafter wheeling around its flinty margin, they made a second precipitous\r\ndash, through a dark and narrow chasm, at least fifty feet in depth, and\r\nfrom thence, in a hurried, but comparatively a more gentle course,\r\nescaped to join the lake.\r\n\r\nWith the natural taste which belongs to mountaineers, and especially to\r\nthe Scottish Highlanders, whose feelings, I have observed, are often\r\nallied with the romantic and poetical, Rob Roy's wife and followers had\r\nprepared our morning repast in a scene well calculated to impress\r\nstrangers with some feelings of awe. They are also naturally a grave and\r\nproud people, and, however rude in our estimation, carry their ideas of\r\nform and politeness to an excess that would appear overstrained, except\r\nfrom the demonstration of superior force which accompanies the display of\r\nit; for it must be granted that the air of punctilious deference and\r\nrigid etiquette which would seem ridiculous in an ordinary peasant, has,\r\nlike the salute of a _corps-de-garde,_ a propriety when tendered by a\r\nHighlander completely armed. There was, accordingly, a good deal of\r\nformality in our approach and reception.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, who had been dispersed on the side of the hill, drew\r\nthemselves together when we came in view, and, standing firm and\r\nmotionless, appeared in close column behind three figures, whom I soon\r\nrecognised to be Helen MacGregor and her two sons. MacGregor himself\r\narranged his attendants in the rear, and, requesting Mr. Jarvie to\r\ndismount where the ascent became steep, advanced slowly, marshalling us\r\nforward at the head of the troop. As we advanced, we heard the wild notes\r\nof the bagpipes, which lost their natural discord from being mingled with\r\nthe dashing sound of the cascade. When we came close, the wife of\r\nMacGregor came forward to meet us. Her dress was studiously arranged in a\r\nmore feminine taste than it had been on the preceding day, but her\r\nfeatures wore the same lofty, unbending, and resolute character; and as\r\nshe folded my friend the Bailie in an unexpected and apparently unwelcome\r\nembrace, I could perceive by the agitation of his wig, his back, and the\r\ncalves of his legs, that he felt much like to one who feels himself\r\nsuddenly in the gripe of a she-bear, without being able to distinguish\r\nwhether the animal is in kindness or in wrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are welcome--and you, too, stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, releasing my alarmed companion, who instinctively drew back and\r\nsettled his wig, and addressing herself to me--\xe2\x80\x9cyou also are welcome. You\r\ncame,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cto our unhappy country, when our bloods were chafed,\r\nand our hands were red. Excuse the rudeness that gave you a rough\r\nwelcome, and lay it upon the evil times, and not upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d All this was\r\nsaid with the manners of a princess, and in the tone and style of a\r\ncourt. Nor was there the least tincture of that vulgarity, which we\r\nnaturally attach to the Lowland Scottish. There was a strong provincial\r\naccentuation, but, otherwise, the language rendered by Helen MacGregor,\r\nout of the native and poetical Gaelic, into English, which she had\r\nacquired as we do learned tongues, but had probably never heard applied\r\nto the mean purposes of ordinary life, was graceful, flowing, and\r\ndeclamatory. Her husband, who had in his time played many parts, used a\r\nmuch less elevated and emphatic dialect;--but even _his_ language rose in\r\npurity of expression, as you may have remarked, if I have been accurate\r\nin recording it, when the affairs which he discussed were of an agitating\r\nand important nature; and it appears to me in his case, and in that of\r\nsome other Highlanders whom I have known, that, when familiar and\r\nfacetious, they used the Lowland Scottish dialect,--when serious and\r\nimpassioned, their thoughts arranged themselves in the idiom of their\r\nnative language; and in the latter case, as they uttered the\r\ncorresponding ideas in English, the expressions sounded wild, elevated,\r\nand poetical. In fact, the language of passion is almost always pure as\r\nwell as vehement, and it is no uncommon thing to hear a Scotchman, when\r\noverwhelmed by a countryman with a tone of bitter and fluent upbraiding,\r\nreply by way of taunt to his adversary, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have gotten to your\r\nEnglish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the wife of MacGregor invited us to a refreshment\r\nspread out on the grass, which abounded with all the good things their\r\nmountains could offer, but was clouded by the dark and undisturbed\r\ngravity which sat on the brow of our hostess, as well as by our deep and\r\nanxious recollection of what had taken place on the preceding day. It was\r\nin vain that the leader exerted himself to excite mirth;--a chill hung\r\nover our minds, as if the feast had been funereal; and every bosom felt\r\nlight when it was ended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mr. Jarvie, as we rose from the\r\nentertainment; \xe2\x80\x9cthe best wish Helen MacGregor can give to a friend is,\r\nthat he may see her no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie struggled to answer, probably with some commonplace maxim of\r\nmorality;--but the calm and melancholy sternness of her countenance bore\r\ndown and disconcerted the mechanical and formal importance of the\r\nmagistrate. He coughed,--hemmed,--bowed,--and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you, stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a token, from one whom you can\r\nnever\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted MacGregor, in a loud and stern voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat means\r\nthis?--have you forgotten the charge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMacGregor,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten nought that is fitting for me\r\nto remember. It is not such hands as these,\xe2\x80\x9d and she stretched forth her\r\nlong, sinewy, and bare arm, \xe2\x80\x9cthat are fitting to convey love-tokens, were\r\nthe gift connected with aught but misery. Young man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\npresenting me with a ring, which I well remembered as one of the few\r\nornaments that Miss Vernon sometimes wore, \xe2\x80\x9cthis comes from one whom you\r\nwill never see more. If it is a joyless token, it is well fitted to pass\r\nthrough the hands of one to whom joy can never be known. Her last words\r\nwere--Let him forget me for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can she,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, almost without being conscious that I spoke,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csuppose that is possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll may be forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d said the extraordinary female who addressed\r\nme,--\xe2\x80\x9call--but the sense of dishonour, and the desire of vengeance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Seid suas!_\xe2\x80\x9c* cried the MacGregor, stamping with impatience.\r\n\r\n* \xe2\x80\x9cStrike up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bagpipes sounded, and with their thrilling and jarring tones cut\r\nshort our conference. Our leave of our hostess was taken by silent\r\ngestures; and we resumed our journey with an additional proof on my part,\r\nthat I was beloved by Diana, and was separated from her for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEENTH.\r\n\r\n            Farewell to the land where the clouds love to rest,\r\n            Like the shroud of the dead, on the mountain's cold breast\r\n            To the cataract's roar where the eagles reply,\r\n            And the lake her lone bosom expands to the sky.\r\n\r\nOur route lay through a dreary, yet romantic country, which the distress\r\nof my own mind prevented me from remarking particularly, and which,\r\ntherefore, I will not attempt to describe. The lofty peak of Ben Lomond,\r\nhere the predominant monarch of the mountains, lay on our right hand, and\r\nserved as a striking landmark. I was not awakened from my apathy, until,\r\nafter a long and toilsome walk, we emerged through a pass in the hills,\r\nand Loch Lomond opened before us. I will spare you the attempt to\r\ndescribe what you would hardly comprehend without going to see it. But\r\ncertainly this noble lake, boasting innumerable beautiful islands, of\r\nevery varying form and outline which fancy can frame,--its northern\r\nextremity narrowing until it is lost among dusky and retreating\r\nmountains,--while, gradually widening as it extends to the southward, it\r\nspreads its base around the indentures and promontories of a fair and\r\nfertile land, affords one of the most surprising, beautiful, and sublime\r\nspectacles in nature. The eastern side, peculiarly rough and rugged, was\r\nat this time the chief seat of MacGregor and his clan,--to curb whom, a\r\nsmall garrison had been stationed in a central position betwixt Loch\r\nLomond and another lake. The extreme strength of the country, however,\r\nwith the numerous passes, marshes, caverns, and other places of\r\nconcealment or defence, made the establishment of this little fort seem\r\nrather an acknowledgment of the danger, than an effectual means of\r\nsecuring against it.\r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion, as well as on that which I witnessed, the\r\ngarrison suffered from the adventurous spirit of the outlaw and his\r\nfollowers. These advantages were never sullied by ferocity when he\r\nhimself was in command; for, equally good-tempered and sagacious, he\r\nunderstood well the danger of incurring unnecessary odium. I learned with\r\npleasure that he had caused the captives of the preceding day to be\r\nliberated in safety; and many traits of mercy, and even of generosity,\r\nare recorded of this remarkable man on similar occasions.\r\n\r\nA boat waited for us in a creek beneath a huge rock, manned by four lusty\r\nHighland rowers; and our host took leave of us with great cordiality, and\r\neven affection. Betwixt him and Mr. Jarvie, indeed, there seemed to exist\r\na degree of mutual regard, which formed a strong contrast to their\r\ndifferent occupations and habits. After kissing each other very lovingly,\r\nand when they were just in the act of parting, the Bailie, in the fulness\r\nof his heart, and with a faltering voice, assured his kinsman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if\r\never an hundred pund, or even twa hundred, would put him or his family in\r\na settled way, he need but just send a line to the Saut-Market;\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob,\r\ngrasping his basket-hilt with one hand, and shaking Mr. Jarvie's heartily\r\nwith the other, protested, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if ever anybody should affront his\r\nkinsman, an he would but let him ken, he would stow his lugs out of his\r\nhead, were he the best man in Glasgow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these assurances of mutual aid and continued good-will, we bore away\r\nfrom the shore, and took our course for the south-western angle of the\r\nlake, where it gives birth to the river Leven. Rob Roy remained for some\r\ntime standing on the rock from beneath which we had departed, conspicuous\r\nby his long gun, waving tartans, and the single plume in his cap, which\r\nin those days denoted the Highland gentleman and soldier; although I\r\nobserve that the present military taste has decorated the Highland bonnet\r\nwith a quantity of black plumage resembling that which is borne before\r\nfunerals. At length, as the distance increased between us, we saw him\r\nturn and go slowly up the side of the hill, followed by his immediate\r\nattendants or bodyguard.\r\n\r\nWe performed our voyage for a long time in silence, interrupted only by\r\nthe Gaelic chant which one of the rowers sung in low irregular measure,\r\nrising occasionally into a wild chorus, in which the others joined.\r\n\r\nMy own thoughts were sad enough;--yet I felt something soothing in the\r\nmagnificent scenery with which I was surrounded; and thought, in the\r\nenthusiasm of the moment, that had my faith been that of Rome, I could\r\nhave consented to live and die a lonely hermit in one of the romantic and\r\nbeautiful islands amongst which our boat glided.\r\n\r\nThe Bailie had also his speculations, but they were of somewhat a\r\ndifferent complexion; as I found when, after about an hour's silence,\r\nduring which he had been mentally engaged in the calculations necessary,\r\nhe undertook to prove the possibility of draining the lake, and \xe2\x80\x9cgiving\r\nto plough and harrow many hundred, ay, many a thousand acres, from whilk\r\nno man could get earthly gude e'enow, unless it were a gedd,* or a dish\r\nof perch now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* A pike.\r\n\r\nAmidst a long discussion, which he \xe2\x80\x9ccrammed into mine ear against the\r\nstomach of my sense,\xe2\x80\x9d I only remember, that it was part of his project to\r\npreserve a portion of the lake just deep enough and broad enough for the\r\npurposes of water-carriage, so that coal-barges and gabbards should pass\r\nas easily between Dumbarton and Glenfalloch as between Glasgow and\r\nGreenock.\r\n\r\nAt length we neared our distant place of landing, adjoining to the ruins\r\nof an ancient castle, and just where the lake discharges its superfluous\r\nwaters into the Leven. There we found Dougal with the horses. The Bailie\r\nhad formed a plan with respect to \xe2\x80\x9cthe creature,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as upon the\r\ndraining of the lake; and, perhaps in both cases, with more regard to the\r\nutility than to the practical possibility of his scheme. \xe2\x80\x9cDougal,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cye are a kindly creature, and hae the sense and feeling o' what is\r\ndue to your betters--and I'm e'en wae for you, Dougal, for it canna be\r\nbut that in the life ye lead you suld get a Jeddart cast* ae day suner or\r\nlater. I trust, considering my services as a magistrate, and my father\r\nthe deacon's afore me, I hae interest eneugh in the council to gar them\r\nwink a wee at a waur faut than yours.\r\n\r\n* [\xe2\x80\x9cThe memory of Dunbar's legal (?) proceedings at Jedburgh is preserved\r\nin the proverbial phrase _Jeddart Justice,_ which signifies trial _after_\r\nexecution.\xe2\x80\x9d--_Minstrelsy of the Border,_ Preface, p. lvi.]\r\n\r\nSae I hae been thinking, that if ye will gang back to Glasgow wi' us,\r\nbeing a strong-backit creature, ye might be employed in the warehouse\r\ntill something better suld cast up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer nainsell muckle obliged till the Bailie's honour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dougal;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut teil be in her shanks fan she gangs on a cause-way'd street, unless\r\nshe be drawn up the Gallowgate wi' tows, as she was before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, I afterwards learned that Dougal had originally come to Glasgow\r\nas a prisoner, from being concerned in some depredation, but had somehow\r\nfound such favour in the eyes of the jailor, that, with rather\r\noverweening confidence, he had retained him in his service as one of the\r\nturnkeys; a task which Dougal had discharged with sufficient fidelity, so\r\nfar as was known, until overcome by his clannish prejudices on the\r\nunexpected appearance of his old leader.\r\n\r\nAstonished at receiving so round a refusal to so favourable an offer, the\r\nBailie, turning to me, observed, that the \xe2\x80\x9ccreature was a natural-born\r\nidiot.\xe2\x80\x9d I testified my own gratitude in a way which Dougal much better\r\nrelished, by slipping a couple of guineas into his hand. He no sooner\r\nfelt the touch of the gold, than he sprung twice or thrice from the earth\r\nwith the agility of a wild buck, flinging out first one heel and then\r\nanother, in a manner which would have astonished a French dancing-master.\r\nHe ran to the boatmen to show them the prize, and a small gratuity made\r\nthem take part in his raptures. He then, to use a favourite expression of\r\nthe dramatic John Bunyan, \xe2\x80\x9cwent on his way, and I saw him no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie and I mounted our horses, and proceeded on the road to\r\nGlasgow. When we had lost the view of the lake, and its superb\r\namphitheatre of mountains, I could not help expressing with enthusiasm,\r\nmy sense of its natural beauties, although I was conscious that Mr.\r\nJarvie was a very uncongenial spirit to communicate with on such a\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are a young gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand an Englishman, and a' this\r\nmay be very fine to you; but for me, wha am a plain man, and ken\r\nsomething o' the different values of land, I wadna gie the finest sight\r\nwe hae seen in the Hielands, for the first keek o' the Gorbals o'\r\nGlasgow; and if I were ance there, it suldna be every fule's errand,\r\nbegging your pardon, Mr. Francis, that suld take me out o' sight o' Saint\r\nMungo's steeple again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe honest man had his wish; for, by dint of travelling very late, we\r\narrived at his own house that night, or rather on the succeeding morning.\r\nHaving seen my worthy fellow-traveller safely consigned to the charge of\r\nthe considerate and officious Mattie, I proceeded to Mrs. Flyter's, in\r\nwhose house, even at this unwonted hour, light was still burning. The\r\ndoor was opened by no less a person than Andrew Fairservice himself, who,\r\nupon the first sound of my voice, set up a loud shout of joyful\r\nrecognition, and, without uttering a syllable, ran up stairs towards a\r\nparlour on the second floor, from the windows of which the light\r\nproceeded. Justly conceiving that he went to announce my return to the\r\nanxious Owen, I followed him upon the foot. Owen was not alone, there was\r\nanother in the apartment--it was my father.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse was to preserve the dignity of his usual\r\nequanimity,--\xe2\x80\x9cFrancis, I am glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d The next was to embrace me\r\ntenderly,--\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear--dear son!\xe2\x80\x9d--Owen secured one of my hands, and\r\nwetted it with his tears, while he joined in gratulating my return.\r\nThese are scenes which address themselves to the eye and to the heart\r\nrather than to the ear--My old eye-lids still moisten at the\r\nrecollection of our meeting; but your kind and affectionate feelings\r\ncan well imagine what I should find it impossible to describe.\r\n\r\nWhen the tumult of our joy was over, I learnt that my father had arrived\r\nfrom Holland shortly after Owen had set off for Scotland. Determined and\r\nrapid in all his movements, he only stopped to provide the means of\r\ndischarging the obligations incumbent on his house. By his extensive\r\nresources, with funds enlarged, and credit fortified, by eminent success\r\nin his continental speculation, he easily accomplished what perhaps his\r\nabsence alone rendered difficult, and set out for Scotland to exact\r\njustice from Rashleigh Osbaldistone, as well as to put order to his\r\naffairs in that country. My father's arrival in full credit, and with the\r\nample means of supporting his engagements honourably, as well as\r\nbenefiting his correspondents in future, was a stunning blow to MacVittie\r\nand Company, who had conceived his star set for ever. Highly incensed at\r\nthe usage his confidential clerk and agent had received at their hands,\r\nMr. Osbaldistone refused every tender of apology and accommodation; and\r\nhaving settled the balance of their account, announced to them that, with\r\nall its numerous contingent advantages, that leaf of their ledger was\r\nclosed for ever.\r\n\r\nWhile he enjoyed this triumph over false friends, he was not a little\r\nalarmed on my account. Owen, good man, had not supposed it possible that\r\na journey of fifty or sixty miles, which may be made with so much ease\r\nand safety in any direction from London, could be attended with any\r\nparticular danger. But he caught alarm, by sympathy, from my father, to\r\nwhom the country, and the lawless character of its inhabitants, were\r\nbetter known.\r\n\r\nThese apprehensions were raised to agony, when, a few hours before I\r\narrived, Andrew Fairservice made his appearance, with a dismal and\r\nexaggerated account of the uncertain state in which he had left me. The\r\nnobleman with whose troops he had been a sort of prisoner, had, after\r\nexamination, not only dismissed him, but furnished him with the means of\r\nreturning rapidly to Glasgow, in order to announce to my friends my\r\nprecarious and unpleasant situation.\r\n\r\nAndrew was one of those persons who have no objection to the sort of\r\ntemporary attention and woeful importance which attaches itself to the\r\nbearer of bad tidings, and had therefore by no means smoothed down his\r\ntale in the telling, especially as the rich London merchant himself\r\nproved unexpectedly one of the auditors. He went at great length into an\r\naccount of the dangers I had escaped, chiefly, as he insinuated, by means\r\nof his own experience, exertion, and sagacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was to come of me now, when my better angel, in his (Andrew's)\r\nperson, was removed from my side, it was,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9csad and sair to\r\nconjecture; that the Bailie was nae better than just naebody at a pinch,\r\nor something waur, for he was a conceited body--and Andrew hated\r\nconceit--but certainly, atween the pistols and the carabines of the\r\ntroopers, that rappit aff the tane after the tother as fast as hail, and\r\nthe dirks and claymores o' the Hielanders, and the deep waters and weils\r\no' the Avondow, it was to be thought there wad be a puir account of the\r\nyoung gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis statement would have driven Owen to despair, had he been alone and\r\nunsupported; but my father's perfect knowledge of mankind enabled him\r\neasily to appreciate the character of Andrew, and the real amount of his\r\nintelligence. Stripped of all exaggeration, however, it was alarming\r\nenough to a parent. He determined to set out in person to obtain my\r\nliberty by ransom or negotiation, and was busied with Owen till a late\r\nhour, in order to get through some necessary correspondence, and devolve\r\non the latter some business which should be transacted during his\r\nabsence; and thus it chanced that I found them watchers.\r\n\r\nIt was late ere we separated to rest, and, too impatient long to endure\r\nrepose, I was stirring early the next morning. Andrew gave his attendance\r\nat my levee, as in duty bound, and, instead of the scarecrow figure to\r\nwhich he had been reduced at Aberfoil, now appeared in the attire of an\r\nundertaker, a goodly suit, namely, of the deepest mourning. It was not\r\ntill after one or two queries, which the rascal affected as long as he\r\ncould to misunderstand, that I found out he \xe2\x80\x9chad thought it but decent to\r\nput on mourning, on account of my inexpressible loss; and as the broker\r\nat whose shop he had equipped himself, declined to receive the goods\r\nagain, and as his own garments had been destroyed or carried off in my\r\nhonour's service, doubtless I and my honourable father, whom Providence\r\nhad blessed wi' the means, wadna suffer a puir lad to sit down wi' the\r\nloss; a stand o' claes was nae great matter to an Osbaldistone (be\r\npraised for't!), especially to an old and attached servant o' the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs there was something of justice in Andrew's plea of loss in my service,\r\nhis finesse succeeded; and he came by a good suit of mourning, with a\r\nbeaver and all things conforming, as the exterior signs of woe for a\r\nmaster who was alive and merry.\r\n\r\nMy father's first care, when he arose, was to visit Mr. Jarvie, for whose\r\nkindness he entertained the most grateful sentiments, which he expressed\r\nin very few, but manly and nervous terms. He explained the altered state\r\nof his affairs, and offered the Bailie, on such terms as could not but be\r\nboth advantageous and acceptable, that part in his concerns which had\r\nbeen hitherto managed by MacVittie and Company. The Bailie heartily\r\ncongratulated my father and Owen on the changed posture of their affairs,\r\nand, without affecting to disclaim that he had done his best to serve\r\nthem, when matters looked otherwise, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe had only just acted as\r\nhe wad be done by--that, as to the extension of their correspondence, he\r\nfrankly accepted it with thanks. Had MacVittie's folk behaved like honest\r\nmen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9che wad hae liked ill to hae come in ahint them, and out\r\nafore them this gate. But it's otherwise, and they maun e'en stand the\r\nloss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bailie then pulled me by the sleeve into a corner, and, after again\r\ncordially wishing me joy, proceeded, in rather an embarrassed tone--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwad heartily wish, Maister Francis, there suld be as little said as\r\npossible about the queer things we saw up yonder awa. There's nae gude,\r\nunless ane were judicially examinate, to say onything about that awfu'\r\njob o' Morris--and the members o' the council wadna think it creditable\r\nin ane of their body to be fighting wi' a wheen Hielandmen, and singeing\r\ntheir plaidens--And abune a', though I am a decent sponsible man, when I\r\nam on my right end, I canna but think I maun hae made a queer figure\r\nwithout my hat and my periwig, hinging by the middle like bawdrons, or a\r\ncloak flung ower a cloak-pin. Bailie Grahame wad hae an unco hair in my\r\nneck an he got that tale by the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not suppress a smile when I recollected the Bailie's situation,\r\nalthough I certainly thought it no laughing matter at the time. The\r\ngood-natured merchant was a little confused, but smiled also when he\r\nshook his head--\xe2\x80\x9cI see how it is--I see how it is. But say naething about\r\nit--there's a gude callant; and charge that lang-tongued, conceited,\r\nupsetting serving man o' yours, to sae naething neither. I wadna for ever\r\nsae muckle that even the lassock Mattie ken'd onything about it. I wad\r\nnever hear an end o't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was obviously relieved from his impending fears of ridicule, when I\r\ntold him it was my father's intention to leave Glasgow almost\r\nimmediately. Indeed he had now no motive for remaining, since the most\r\nvaluable part of the papers carried off by Rashleigh had been recovered.\r\nFor that portion which he had converted into cash and expended in his own\r\nor on political intrigues, there was no mode of recovering it but by a\r\nsuit at law, which was forthwith commenced, and proceeded, as our\r\nlaw-agents assured us, with all deliberate speed.\r\n\r\nWe spent, accordingly, one hospitable day with the Bailie, and took leave\r\nof him, as this narrative now does. He continued to grow in wealth,\r\nhonour, and credit, and actually rose to the highest civic honours in his\r\nnative city. About two years after the period I have mentioned, he tired\r\nof his bachelor life, and promoted Mattie from her wheel by the kitchen\r\nfire to the upper end of his table, in the character of Mrs. Jarvie.\r\nBailie Grahame, the MacVitties, and others (for all men have their\r\nenemies, especially in the council of a royal burgh), ridiculed this\r\ntransformation. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jarvie, \xe2\x80\x9clet them say their say. I'll\r\nne'er fash mysell, nor lose my liking for sae feckless a matter as a nine\r\ndays' clash. My honest father the deacon had a byword,\r\n\r\n                       Brent brow and lily skin,\r\n                       A loving heart, and a leal within,\r\n                      Is better than gowd or gentle kin.\r\n\r\nBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d as he always concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cMattie was nae ordinary lassock-quean;\r\nshe was akin to the Laird o' Limmerfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether it was owing to her descent or her good gifts, I do not presume\r\nto decide; but Mattie behaved excellently in her exaltation, and relieved\r\nthe apprehensions of some of the Bailie's friends, who had deemed his\r\nexperiment somewhat hazardous. I do not know that there was any other\r\nincident of his quiet and useful life worthy of being particularly\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTIETH.\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cCome ye hither my 'six' good sons,\r\n                       Gallant men I trow ye be,\r\n                  How many of you, my children dear,\r\n                  Will stand by that good Earl and me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cFive\xe2\x80\x9d of them did answer make--\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cFive\xe2\x80\x9d of them spoke hastily,\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cO father, till the day we die,\r\n                  We'll stand by that good Earl and thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                    The Rising in the North.\r\n\r\nOn the morning when we were to depart from Glasgow, Andrew Fairservice\r\nbounced into my apartment like a madman, jumping up and down, and\r\nsinging, with more vehemence than tune,\r\n\r\n                The kiln's on fire--the kiln's on fire--\r\n                The kiln's on fire--she's a' in a lowe.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty I prevailed on him to cease his confounded clamour,\r\nand explain to me what the matter was. He was pleased to inform me, as if\r\nhe had been bringing the finest news imaginable, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Hielands were\r\nclean broken out, every man o' them, and that Rob Roy, and a' his\r\nbreekless bands, wad be down upon Glasgow or twenty-four hours o' the\r\nclock gaed round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou rascal! You must be drunk or mad; and if\r\nthere is any truth in your news, is it a singing matter, you scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrunk or mad? nae doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Andrew, dauntlessly; \xe2\x80\x9cane's aye drunk\r\nor mad if he tells what grit folks dinna like to hear--Sing? Od, the\r\nclans will make us sing on the wrang side o' our mouth, if we are sae\r\ndrunk or mad as to bide their coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose in great haste, and found my father and Owen also on foot, and in\r\nconsiderable alarm.\r\n\r\nAndrew's news proved but too true in the main. The great rebellion which\r\nagitated Britain in the year 1715 had already broken out, by the\r\nunfortunate Earl of Mar's setting up the standard of the Stuart family in\r\nan ill-omened hour, to the ruin of many honourable families, both in\r\nEngland and Scotland. The treachery of some of the Jacobite agents\r\n(Rashleigh among the rest), and the arrest of others, had made George the\r\nFirst's Government acquainted with the extensive ramifications of a\r\nconspiracy long prepared, and which at last exploded prematurely, and in\r\na part of the kingdom too distant to have any vital effect upon the\r\ncountry, which, however, was plunged into much confusion.\r\n\r\nThis great public event served to confirm and elucidate the obscure\r\nexplanations I had received from MacGregor; and I could easily see why\r\nthe westland clans, who were brought against him, should have waived\r\ntheir private quarrel, in consideration that they were all shortly to be\r\nengaged in the same public cause. It was a more melancholy reflection to\r\nmy mind, that Diana Vernon was the wife of one of those who were most\r\nactive in turning the world upside down, and that she was herself exposed\r\nto all the privations and perils of her husband's hazardous trade.\r\n\r\nWe held an immediate consultation on the measures we were to adopt in\r\nthis crisis, and acquiesced in my father's plan, that we should instantly\r\nget the necessary passports, and make the best of our way to London. I\r\nacquainted my father with my wish to offer my personal service to the\r\nGovernment in any volunteer corps, several being already spoken of. He\r\nreadily acquiesced in my proposal; for though he disliked war as a\r\nprofession, yet, upon principle, no man would have exposed his life more\r\nwillingly in defence of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nWe travelled in haste and in peril through Dumfriesshire and the\r\nneighbouring counties of England. In this quarter, gentlemen of the Tory\r\ninterest were already in motion, mustering men and horses, while the\r\nWhigs assembled themselves in the principal towns, armed the inhabitants,\r\nand prepared for civil war. We narrowly escaped being stopped on more\r\noccasions than one, and were often compelled to take circuitous routes to\r\navoid the points where forces were assembling.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached London, we immediately associated with those bankers and\r\neminent merchants who agreed to support the credit of Government, and to\r\nmeet that run upon the funds, on which the conspirators had greatly\r\nfounded their hopes of furthering their undertaking, by rendering the\r\nGovernment, as it were, bankrupt. My father was chosen one of the members\r\nof this formidable body of the monied interest, as all had the greatest\r\nconfidence in his zeal, skill, and activity. He was also the organ by\r\nwhich they communicated with Government, and contrived, from funds\r\nbelonging to his own house, or over which he had command, to find\r\npurchasers for a quantity of the national stock, which was suddenly flung\r\ninto the market at a depreciated price when the rebellion broke out. I\r\nwas not idle myself, but obtained a commission, and levied, at my\r\nfather's expense, about two hundred men, with whom I joined General\r\nCarpenter's army.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion, in the meantime, had extended itself to England. The\r\nunfortunate Earl of Derwentwater had taken arms in the cause, along with\r\nGeneral Foster. My poor uncle, Sir Hildebrand, whose estate was reduced\r\nto almost nothing by his own carelessness and the expense and debauchery\r\nof his sons and household, was easily persuaded to join that unfortunate\r\nstandard. Before doing so, however, he exhibited a degree of precaution\r\nof which no one could have suspected him--he made his will!\r\n\r\nBy this document he devised his estates at Osbaldistone Hall, and so\r\nforth, to his sons successively, and their male heirs, until he came to\r\nRashleigh, whom, on account of the turn he had lately taken in politics,\r\nhe detested with all his might,--he cut him off with a shilling, and\r\nsettled the estate on me as his next heir. I had always been rather a\r\nfavourite of the old gentleman; but it is probable that, confident in the\r\nnumber of gigantic youths who now armed around him, he considered the\r\ndestination as likely to remain a dead letter, which he inserted chiefly\r\nto show his displeasure at Rashleigh's treachery, both public and\r\ndomestic. There was an article, by which he, bequeathed to the niece of\r\nhis late wife, Diana Vernon, now Lady Diana Vernon Beauchamp, some\r\ndiamonds belonging to her late aunt, and a great silver ewer, having the\r\narms of Vernon and Osbaldistone quarterly engraven upon it.\r\n\r\nBut Heaven had decreed a more speedy extinction of his numerous and\r\nhealthy lineage, than, most probably, he himself had reckoned on. In the\r\nvery first muster of the conspirators, at a place called Green-Rigg,\r\nThorncliff Osbaldistone quarrelled about precedence with a gentleman of\r\nthe Northumbrian border, to the full as fierce and intractable as\r\nhimself. In spite of all remonstrances, they gave their commander a\r\nspecimen of how far their discipline might be relied upon, by fighting it\r\nout with their rapiers, and my kinsman was killed on the spot. His death\r\nwas a great loss to Sir Hildebrand, for, notwithstanding his infernal\r\ntemper, he had a grain or two of more sense than belonged to the rest of\r\nthe brotherhood, Rashleigh always excepted.\r\n\r\nPerceval, the sot, died also in his calling. He had a wager with another\r\ngentleman (who, from his exploits in that line, had acquired the\r\nformidable epithet of Brandy Swalewell), which should drink the largest\r\ncup of strong liquor when King James was proclaimed by the insurgents at\r\nMorpeth. The exploit was something enormous. I forget the exact quantity\r\nof brandy which Percie swallowed, but it occasioned a fever, of which he\r\nexpired at the end of three days, with the word, _water, water,_\r\nperpetually on his tongue.\r\n\r\nDickon broke his neck near Warrington Bridge, in an attempt to show off a\r\nfoundered blood-mare which he wished to palm upon a Manchester merchant\r\nwho had joined the insurgents. He pushed the animal at a five-barred\r\ngate; she fell in the leap, and the unfortunate jockey lost his life.\r\n\r\nWilfred the fool, as sometimes befalls, had the best fortune of the\r\nfamily. He was slain at Proud Preston, in Lancashire, on the day that\r\nGeneral Carpenter attacked the barricades, fighting with great bravery,\r\nthough I have heard he was never able exactly to comprehend the cause of\r\nquarrel, and did not uniformly remember on which king's side he was\r\nengaged. John also behaved very boldly in the same engagement, and\r\nreceived several wounds, of which he was not happy enough to die on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nOld Sir Hildebrand, entirely brokenhearted by these successive losses,\r\nbecame, by the next day's surrender, one of the unhappy prisoners, and\r\nwas lodged in Newgate with his wounded son John.\r\n\r\nI was now released from my military duty, and lost no time, therefore, in\r\nendeavouring to relieve the distresses of these new relations. My\r\nfather's interest with Government, and the general compassion excited by\r\na parent who had sustained the successive loss of so many sons within so\r\nshort a time, would have prevented my uncle and cousin from being brought\r\nto trial for high treason. But their doom was given forth from a greater\r\ntribunal. John died of his wounds in Newgate, recommending to me in his\r\nlast breath, a cast of hawks which he had at the Hall, and a black\r\nspaniel bitch called Lucy.\r\n\r\nMy poor uncle seemed beaten down to the very earth by his family\r\ncalamities, and the circumstances in which he unexpectedly found himself.\r\nHe said little, but seemed grateful for such attentions as circumstances\r\npermitted me to show him. I did not witness his meeting with my father\r\nfor the first time for so many years, and under circumstances so\r\nmelancholy; but, judging from my father's extreme depression of spirits,\r\nit must have been melancholy in the last degree. Sir Hildebrand spoke\r\nwith great bitterness against Rashleigh, now his only surviving child;\r\nlaid upon him the ruin of his house, and the deaths of all his brethren,\r\nand declared, that neither he nor they would have plunged into political\r\nintrigue, but for that very member of his family, who had been the first\r\nto desert them. He once or twice mentioned Diana, always with great\r\naffection; and once he said, while I sate by his bedside--\xe2\x80\x9cNevoy, since\r\nThorncliff and all of them are dead, I am sorry you cannot have her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression affected me much at the time; for it was a usual custom of\r\nthe poor old baronet's, when joyously setting forth upon the morning's\r\nchase, to distinguish Thorncliff, who was a favourite, while he summoned\r\nthe rest more generally; and the loud jolly tone in which he used to\r\nhollo, \xe2\x80\x9cCall Thornie--call all of them,\xe2\x80\x9d contrasted sadly with the\r\nwoebegone and self-abandoning note in which he uttered the disconsolate\r\nwords which I have above quoted. He mentioned the contents of his will,\r\nand supplied me with an authenticated copy;--the original he had\r\ndeposited with my old acquaintance Mr. Justice Inglewood, who, dreaded by\r\nno one, and confided in by all as a kind of neutral person, had become,\r\nfor aught I know, the depositary of half the wills of the fighting men of\r\nboth factions in the county of Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of my uncle's last hours were spent in the discharge of\r\nthe religious duties of his church, in which he was directed by the\r\nchaplain of the Sardinian ambassador, for whom, with some difficulty, we\r\nobtained permission to visit him. I could not ascertain by my own\r\nobservation, or through the medical attendants, that Sir Hildebrand\r\nOsbaldistone died of any formed complaint bearing a name in the science\r\nof medicine. He seemed to me completely worn out and broken down by\r\nfatigue of body and distress of mind, and rather ceased to exist, than\r\ndied of any positive struggle,--just as a vessel, buffeted and tossed by\r\na succession of tempestuous gales, her timbers overstrained, and her\r\njoints loosened, will sometimes spring a leak and founder, when there are\r\nno apparent causes for her destruction.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable circumstance that my father, after the last duties\r\nwere performed to his brother, appeared suddenly to imbibe a strong\r\nanxiety that I should act upon the will, and represent his father's\r\nhouse, which had hitherto seemed to be the thing in the world which had\r\nleast charms for him. But formerly, he had been like the fox in the\r\nfable, contemning what was beyond his reach; and, moreover, I doubt not\r\nthat the excessive dislike which he entertained against Rashleigh (now\r\nSir Rashleigh) Osbaldistone, who loudly threatened to attack his father\r\nSir Hildebrand's will and settlement, corroborated my father's desire to\r\nmaintain it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had been most unjustly disinherited,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cby his own\r\nfather--his brother's will had repaired the disgrace, if not the injury,\r\nby leaving the wreck of his property to Frank, the natural heir, and he\r\nwas determined the bequest should take effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Rashleigh was not altogether a contemptible personage as\r\nan opponent. The information he had given to Government was critically\r\nwell-timed, and his extreme plausibility, with the extent of his\r\nintelligence, and the artful manner in which he contrived to assume both\r\nmerit and influence, had, to a certain extent, procured him patrons among\r\nMinisters. We were already in the full tide of litigation with him on the\r\nsubject of his pillaging the firm of Osbaldistone and Tresham; and,\r\njudging from the progress we made in that comparatively simple lawsuit,\r\nthere was a chance that this second course of litigation might be drawn\r\nout beyond the period of all our natural lives.\r\n\r\nTo avert these delays as much as possible, my father, by the advice of\r\nhis counsel learned in the law, paid off and vested in my person the\r\nrights to certain large mortgages affecting Osbaldistone Hall. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, the opportunity to convert a great share of the large profits\r\nwhich accrued from the rapid rise of the funds upon the suppression of\r\nthe rebellion, and the experience he had so lately had of the perils of\r\ncommerce, encouraged him to realise, in this manner, a considerable part\r\nof his property. At any rate, it so chanced, that, instead of commanding\r\nme to the desk, as I fully expected, having intimated my willingness to\r\ncomply with his wishes, however they might destine me, I received his\r\ndirections to go down to Osbaldistone Hall, and take possession of it as\r\nthe heir and representative of the family. I was directed to apply to\r\nSquire Inglewood for the copy of my uncle's will deposited with him, and\r\ntake all necessary measures to secure that possession which sages say\r\nmakes nine points of the law.\r\n\r\nAt another time I should have been delighted with this change of\r\ndestination. But now Osbaldistone Hall was accompanied with many painful\r\nrecollections. Still, however, I thought, that in that neighbourhood only\r\nI was likely to acquire some information respecting the fate of Diana\r\nVernon. I had every reason to fear it must be far different from what I\r\ncould have wished it. But I could obtain no precise information on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that I endeavoured, by such acts of kindness as their\r\nsituation admitted, to conciliate the confidence of some distant\r\nrelations who were among the prisoners in Newgate. A pride which I could\r\nnot condemn, and a natural suspicion of the Whig Frank Osbaldistone,\r\ncousin to the double-distilled traitor Rashleigh, closed every heart and\r\ntongue, and I only received thanks, cold and extorted, in exchange for\r\nsuch benefits as I had power to offer. The arm of the law was also\r\ngradually abridging the numbers of those whom I endeavoured to serve, and\r\nthe hearts of the survivors became gradually more contracted towards all\r\nwhom they conceived to be concerned with the existing Government. As they\r\nwere led gradually, and by detachments, to execution, those who survived\r\nlost interest in mankind, and the desire of communicating with them. I\r\nshall long remember what one of them, Ned Shafton by name, replied to my\r\nanxious inquiry, whether there was any indulgence I could procure him?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Frank Osbaldistone, I must suppose you mean me kindly, and therefore\r\nI thank you. But, by G--, men cannot be fattened like poultry, when they\r\nsee their neighbours carried off day by day to the place of execution,\r\nand know that their own necks are to be twisted round in their turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, therefore, I was glad to escape from London, from\r\nNewgate, and from the scenes which both exhibited, to breathe the free\r\nair of Northumberland. Andrew Fairservice had continued in my service\r\nmore from my father's pleasure than my own. At present there seemed a\r\nprospect that his local acquaintance with Osbaldistone Hall and its\r\nvicinity might be useful; and, of course, he accompanied me on my\r\njourney, and I enjoyed the prospect of getting rid of him, by\r\nestablishing him in his old quarters. I cannot conceive how he could\r\nprevail upon my father to interest himself in him, unless it were by the\r\nart, which he possessed in no inconsiderable degree, of affecting an\r\nextreme attachment to his master; which theoretical attachment he made\r\ncompatible in practice with playing all manner of tricks without scruple,\r\nproviding only against his master being cheated by any one but himself.\r\n\r\nWe performed our journey to the North without any remarkable adventure,\r\nand we found the country, so lately agitated by rebellion, now peaceful\r\nand in good order. The nearer we approached to Osbaldistone Hall, the\r\nmore did my heart sink at the thought of entering that deserted mansion;\r\nso that, in order to postpone the evil day, I resolved first to make my\r\nvisit at Mr. Justice Inglewood's.\r\n\r\nThat venerable person had been much disturbed with thoughts of what he\r\nhad been, and what he now was; and natural recollections of the past had\r\ninterfered considerably with the active duty which in his present\r\nsituation might have been expected from him. He was fortunate, however,\r\nin one respect; he had got rid of his clerk Jobson, who had finally left\r\nhim in dudgeon at his inactivity, and become legal assistant to a certain\r\nSquire Standish, who had lately commenced operations in those parts as a\r\njustice, with a zeal for King George and the Protestant succession,\r\nwhich, very different from the feelings of his old patron, Mr. Jobson had\r\nmore occasion to restrain within the bounds of the law, than to stimulate\r\nto exertion.\r\n\r\nOld Justice Inglewood received me with great courtesy, and readily\r\nexhibited my uncle's will, which seemed to be without a flaw. He was for\r\nsome time in obvious distress, how he should speak and act in my\r\npresence; but when he found, that though a supporter of the present\r\nGovernment upon principle, I was disposed to think with pity on those who\r\nhad opposed it on a mistaken feeling of loyalty and duty, his discourse\r\nbecame a very diverting medley of what he had done, and what he had left\r\nundone,--the pains he had taken to prevent some squires from joining, and\r\nto wink at the escape of others, who had been so unlucky as to engage in\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\nWe were _tete-a'-tete,_ and several bumpers had been quaffed by the\r\nJustice's special desire, when, on a sudden, he requested me to fill a\r\n_bona fide_ brimmer to the health of poor dear Die Vernon, the rose of\r\nthe wilderness, the heath-bell of Cheviot, and the blossom that's\r\ntransplanted to an infernal convent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not Miss Vernon married, then?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, in great astonishment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought his Excellency\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh! his Excellency and his Lordship's all a humbug now, you\r\nknow--mere St. Germains titles--Earl of Beauchamp, and ambassador\r\nplenipotentiary from France, when the Duke Regent of Orleans scarce knew\r\nthat he lived, I dare say. But you must have seen old Sir Frederick\r\nVernon at the Hall, when he played the part of Father Vaughan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens! then Vaughan was Miss Vernon's father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure he was,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Justice coolly;--\xe2\x80\x9cthere's no use in\r\nkeeping the secret now, for he must be out of the country by this\r\ntime--otherwise, no doubt, it would be my duty to apprehend him.--Come,\r\noff with your bumper to my dear lost Die!\r\n\r\n                 And let her health go round, around, around,\r\n                     And let her health go round;\r\n                 For though your stocking be of silk,\r\n                 Your knees near kiss the ground, aground, aground.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* This pithy verse occurs, it is believed, in Shadwell's play of Bury\r\nFair.\r\n\r\nI was unable, as the reader may easily conceive, to join in the Justice's\r\njollity. My head swam with the shock I had received. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Miss Vernon's father was living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not our Government's fault that he is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Inglewood, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthe devil a man there is whose head would have brought more money. He was\r\ncondemned to death for Fenwick's plot, and was thought to have had some\r\nhand in the Knightsbridge affair, in King William's time; and as he had\r\nmarried in Scotland a relation of the house of Breadalbane, he possessed\r\ngreat influence with all their chiefs. There was a talk of his being\r\ndemanded to be given up at the peace of Ryswick, but he shammed ill, and\r\nhis death was given publicly out in the French papers. But when he came\r\nback here on the old score, we old cavaliers knew him well,--that is to\r\nsay, I knew him, not as being a cavalier myself, but no information being\r\nlodged against the poor gentleman, and my memory being shortened by\r\nfrequent attacks of the gout, I could not have sworn to him, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he, then, not known at Osbaldistone Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo none but to his daughter, the old knight, and Rashleigh, who had got\r\nat that secret as he did at every one else, and held it like a twisted\r\ncord about poor Die's neck. I have seen her one hundred times she would\r\nhave spit at him, if it had not been fear for her father, whose life\r\nwould not have been worth five minutes' purchase if he had been\r\ndiscovered to the Government.--But don't mistake me, Mr. Osbaldistone; I\r\nsay the Government is a good, a gracious, and a just Government; and if\r\nit has hanged one-half of the rebels, poor things, all will acknowledge\r\nthey would not have been touched had they staid peaceably at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaiving the discussion of these political questions, I brought back Mr.\r\nInglewood to his subject, and I found that Diana, having positively\r\nrefused to marry any of the Osbaldistone family, and expressed her\r\nparticular detestation of Rashleigh, he had from that time begun to cool\r\nin zeal for the cause of the Pretender; to which, as the youngest of six\r\nbrethren, and bold, artful, and able, he had hitherto looked forward as\r\nthe means of making his fortune. Probably the compulsion with which he\r\nhad been forced to render up the spoils which he had abstracted from my\r\nfather's counting-house by the united authority of Sir Frederick Vernon\r\nand the Scottish Chiefs, had determined his resolution to advance his\r\nprogress by changing his opinions and betraying his trust. Perhaps\r\nalso--for few men were better judges where his interest was concerned--he\r\nconsidered their means and talents to be, as they afterwards proved,\r\ngreatly inadequate to the important task of overthrowing an established\r\nGovernment. Sir Frederick Vernon, or, as he was called among the\r\nJacobites, his Excellency Viscount Beauchamp, had, with his daughter,\r\nsome difficulty in escaping the consequences of Rashleigh's information.\r\nHere Mr. Inglewood's information was at fault; but he did not doubt,\r\nsince we had not heard of Sir Frederick being in the hands of the\r\nGovernment, he must be by this time abroad, where, agreeably to the cruel\r\nbond he had entered into with his brother-in-law, Diana, since she had\r\ndeclined to select a husband out of the Osbaldistone family, must be\r\nconfined to a convent. The original cause of this singular agreement Mr.\r\nInglewood could not perfectly explain; but he understood it was a family\r\ncompact, entered into for the purpose of securing to Sir Frederick the\r\nrents of the remnant of his large estates, which had been vested in the\r\nOsbaldistone family by some legal manoeuvre; in short, a family compact,\r\nin which, like many of those undertaken at that time of day, the feelings\r\nof the principal parties interested were no more regarded than if they\r\nhad been a part of the live-stock upon the lands.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell,--such is the waywardness of the human heart,--whether this\r\nintelligence gave me joy or sorrow. It seemed to me, that, in the\r\nknowledge that Miss Vernon was eternally divided from me, not by marriage\r\nwith another, but by seclusion in a convent, in order to fulfil an absurd\r\nbargain of this kind, my regret for her loss was aggravated rather than\r\ndiminished. I became dull, low-spirited, absent, and unable to support\r\nthe task of conversing with Justice Inglewood, who in his turn yawned,\r\nand proposed to retire early. I took leave of him overnight, determining\r\nthe next day, before breakfast, to ride over to Osbaldistone Hall.\r\n\r\nMr. Inglewood acquiesced in my proposal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I made my appearance there before I was known to be in the country,\r\nthe more especially as Sir Rashleigh Osbaldistone was now, he understood,\r\nat Mr. Jobson's house, hatching some mischief, doubtless. They were fit\r\ncompany,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cfor each other, Sir Rashleigh having lost all right\r\nto mingle in the society of men of honour; but it was hardly possible two\r\nsuch d--d rascals should collogue together without mischief to honest\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe concluded, by earnestly recommending a toast and tankard, and an\r\nattack upon his venison pasty, before I set out in the morning, just to\r\nbreak the cold air on the words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.\r\n\r\n                   His master's gone, and no one now\r\n                       Dwells in the halls of Ivor;\r\n                   Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead,\r\n                       He is the sole survivor.\r\n                                         Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nThere are few more melancholy sensations than those with which we regard\r\nscenes of past pleasure when altered and deserted. In my ride to\r\nOsbaldistone Hall, I passed the same objects which I had seen in company\r\nwith Miss Vernon on the day of our memorable ride from Inglewood Place.\r\nHer spirit seemed to keep me company on the way; and when I approached\r\nthe spot where I had first seen her, I almost listened for the cry of the\r\nhounds and the notes of the horn, and strained my eye on the vacant\r\nspace, as if to descry the fair huntress again descend like an apparition\r\nfrom the hill. But all was silent, and all was solitary. When I reached\r\nthe Hall, the closed doors and windows, the grass-grown pavement, the\r\ncourts, which were now so silent, presented a strong contrast to the gay\r\nand bustling scene I had so often seen them exhibit, when the merry\r\nhunters were going forth to their morning sport, or returning to the\r\ndaily festival. The joyous bark of the fox-hounds as they were uncoupled,\r\nthe cries of the huntsmen, the clang of the horses' hoofs, the loud laugh\r\nof the old knight at the head of his strong and numerous descendants,\r\nwere all silenced now and for ever.\r\n\r\nWhile I gazed round the scene of solitude and emptiness, I was\r\ninexpressibly affected, even by recollecting those whom, when alive, I\r\nhad no reason to regard with affection. But the thought that so many\r\nyouths of goodly presence, warm with life, health, and confidence, were\r\nwithin so short a time cold in the grave, by various, yet all violent and\r\nunexpected modes of death, afforded a picture of mortality at which the\r\nmind trembled. It was little consolation to me, that I returned a\r\nproprietor to the halls which I had left almost like a fugitive. My mind\r\nwas not habituated to regard the scenes around as my property, and I felt\r\nmyself an usurper, at least an intruding stranger, and could hardly\r\ndivest myself of the idea, that some of the bulky forms of my deceased\r\nkinsmen were, like the gigantic spectres of a romance, to appear in the\r\ngateway, and dispute my entrance.\r\n\r\nWhile I was engaged in these sad thoughts, my follower Andrew, whose\r\nfeelings were of a very different nature, exerted himself in thundering\r\nalternately on every door in the building, calling, at the same time, for\r\nadmittance, in a tone so loud as to intimate, that _he,_ at least, was\r\nfully sensible of his newly acquired importance, as squire of the body to\r\nthe new lord of the manor. At length, timidly and reluctantly, Anthony\r\nSyddall, my uncle's aged butler and major-domo, presented himself at a\r\nlower window, well fenced with iron bars, and inquired our business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are come to tak your charge aff your hand, my auld friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAndrew Fairservice; \xe2\x80\x9cye may gie up your keys as sune as ye like--ilka dog\r\nhas his day. I'll tak the plate and napery aff your hand. Ye hae had your\r\nain time o't, Mr. Syddall; but ilka bean has its black, and ilka path has\r\nits puddle; and it will just set you henceforth to sit at the board-end,\r\nas weel as it did Andrew lang syne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChecking with some difficulty the forwardness of my follower, I explained\r\nto Syddall the nature of my right, and the title I had to demand\r\nadmittance into the Hall, as into my own property. The old man seemed\r\nmuch agitated and distressed, and testified manifest reluctance to give\r\nme entrance, although it was couched in a humble and submissive tone. I\r\nallowed for the agitation of natural feelings, which really did the old\r\nman honour; but continued peremptory in my demand of admittance,\r\nexplaining to him that his refusal would oblige me to apply for Mr.\r\nInglewood's warrant, and a constable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are come from Mr. Justice Inglewood's this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, to\r\nenforce the menace;--\xe2\x80\x9cand I saw Archie Rutledge, the constable, as I came\r\nup by;--the country's no to be lawless as it has been, Mr. Syddall,\r\nletting rebels and papists gang on as they best listed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe threat of the law sounded dreadful in the old man's ears, conscious\r\nas he was of the suspicion under which he himself lay, from his religion\r\nand his devotion to Sir Hildebrand and his sons. He undid, with fear and\r\ntrembling, one of the postern entrances, which was secured with many a\r\nbolt and bar, and humbly hoped that I would excuse him for fidelity in\r\nthe discharge of his duty.--I reassured him, and told him I had the\r\nbetter opinion of him for his caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSae have not I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cSyddall is an auld sneck-drawer; he wadna\r\nbe looking as white as a sheet, and his knees knocking thegither, unless\r\nit were for something mair than he's like to tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord forgive you, Mr. Fairservice,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the butler, \xe2\x80\x9cto say such\r\nthings of an old friend and fellow-servant!--Where\xe2\x80\x9d--following me humbly\r\nalong the passage--\xe2\x80\x9cwhere would it be your honour's pleasure to have a\r\nfire lighted? I fear me you will find the house very dull and dreary--But\r\nperhaps you mean to ride back to Inglewood Place to dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight a fire in the library,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the library!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man;--\xe2\x80\x9cnobody has sat there this many\r\na day, and the room smokes, for the daws have built in the chimney this\r\nspring, and there were no young men about the Hall to pull them down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur ain reekes better than other folk's fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cHis honour\r\nlikes the library;--he's nane o' your Papishers, that delight in blinded\r\nignorance, Mr. Syddall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery reluctantly as it appeared to me, the butler led the way to the\r\nlibrary, and, contrary to what he had given me to expect, the interior of\r\nthe apartment looked as if it had been lately arranged, and made more\r\ncomfortable than usual. There was a fire in the grate, which burned\r\nclearly, notwithstanding what Syddall had reported of the vent. Taking up\r\nthe tongs, as if to arrange the wood, but rather perhaps to conceal his\r\nown confusion, the butler observed, \xe2\x80\x9cit was burning clear now, but had\r\nsmoked woundily in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWishing to be alone, till I recovered myself from the first painful\r\nsensations which everything around me recalled, I desired old Syddall to\r\ncall the land-steward, who lived at about a quarter of a mile from the\r\nHall. He departed with obvious reluctance. I next ordered Andrew to\r\nprocure the attendance of a couple of stout fellows upon whom he could\r\nrely, the population around being Papists, and Sir Rashleigh, who was\r\ncapable of any desperate enterprise, being in the neighbourhood. Andrew\r\nFairservice undertook this task with great cheerfulness, and promised to\r\nbring me up from Trinlay-Knowe, \xe2\x80\x9ctwa true-blue Presbyterians like\r\nhimself, that would face and out-face baith the Pope, the Devil, and the\r\nPretender--and blythe will I be o' their company mysell, for the very\r\nlast night that I was at Osbaldistone Hall, the blight be on ilka blossom\r\nin my bit yard, if I didna see that very picture\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to the\r\nfull-length portrait of Miss Vernon's grandfather) \xe2\x80\x9cwalking by moonlight\r\nin the garden! I tauld your honour I was fleyed wi' a bogle that night,\r\nbut ye wadna listen to me--I aye thought there was witchcraft and\r\ndeevilry amang the Papishers, but I ne'er saw't wi' bodily een till that\r\nawfu' night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring the fellows you talk of; and see\r\nthey have more sense than yourself, and are not frightened at their own\r\nshadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hae been counted as gude a man as my neighbours ere now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew,\r\npetulantly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I dinna pretend to deal wi' evil spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d And so he\r\nmade his exit, as Wardlaw the land-steward made his appearance.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of sense and honesty, without whose careful management my\r\nuncle would have found it difficult to have maintained himself a\r\nhousekeeper so long as he did. He examined the nature of my right of\r\npossession carefully, and admitted it candidly. To any one else the\r\nsuccession would have been a poor one, so much was the land encumbered\r\nwith debt and mortgage. Most of these, however, were already vested in my\r\nfather's person, and he was in a train of acquiring the rest; his large\r\ngains by the recent rise of the funds having made it a matter of ease and\r\nconvenience for him to pay off the debt which affected his patrimony.\r\n\r\nI transacted much necessary business with Mr. Wardlaw, and detained him\r\nto dine with me. We preferred taking our repast in the library, although\r\nSyddall strongly recommended our removing to the stone-hall, which he had\r\nput in order for the occasion. Meantime Andrew made his appearance with\r\nhis true-blue recruits, whom he recommended in the highest terms, as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csober decent men, weel founded in doctrinal points, and, above all, as\r\nbold as lions.\xe2\x80\x9d I ordered them something to drink, and they left the\r\nroom. I observed old Syddall shake his head as they went out, and\r\ninsisted upon knowing the reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI maybe cannot expect,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your honour should put confidence\r\nin what I say, but it is Heaven's truth for all that--Ambrose Wingfield\r\nis as honest a man as lives, but if there is a false knave in the\r\ncountry, it is his brother Lancie;--the whole country knows him to be a\r\nspy for Clerk Jobson on the poor gentlemen that have been in trouble--But\r\nhe's a dissenter, and I suppose that's enough now-a-days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving thus far given vent to his feelings,--to which, however, I was\r\nlittle disposed to pay attention,--and having placed the wine on the\r\ntable, the old butler left the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. Wardlaw having remained with me until the evening was somewhat\r\nadvanced, at length bundled up his papers, and removed himself to his own\r\nhabitation, leaving me in that confused state of mind in which we can\r\nhardly say whether we desire company or solitude. I had not, however, the\r\nchoice betwixt them; for I was left alone in the room of all others most\r\ncalculated to inspire me with melancholy reflections.\r\n\r\nAs twilight was darkening the apartment, Andrew had the sagacity to\r\nadvance his head at the door,--not to ask if I wished for lights, but to\r\nrecommend them as a measure of precaution against the bogles which still\r\nhaunted his imagination. I rejected his proffer somewhat peevishly,\r\ntrimmed the wood-fire, and placing myself in one of the large leathern\r\nchairs which flanked the old Gothic chimney, I watched unconsciously the\r\nbickering of the blaze which I had fostered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this,\xe2\x80\x9d said I alone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis the progress and the issue of human wishes! Nursed by the merest\r\ntrifles, they are first kindled by fancy--nay, are fed upon the vapour of\r\nhope, till they consume the substance which they inflame; and man, and\r\nhis hopes, passions, and desires, sink into a worthless heap of embers\r\nand ashes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a deep sigh from the opposite side of the room, which seemed to\r\nreply to my reflections. I started up in amazement--Diana Vernon stood\r\nbefore me, resting on the arm of a figure so strongly resembling that of\r\nthe portrait so often mentioned, that I looked hastily at the frame,\r\nexpecting to see it empty. My first idea was, either that I had gone\r\nsuddenly distracted, or that the spirits of the dead had arisen and been\r\nplaced before me. A second glance convinced me of my being in my senses,\r\nand that the forms which stood before me were real and substantial. It\r\nwas Diana herself, though paler and thinner than her former self; and it\r\nwas no tenant of the grave who stood beside her, but Vaughan, or rather\r\nSir Frederick Vernon, in a dress made to imitate that of his ancestor, to\r\nwhose picture his countenance possessed a family resemblance. He was the\r\nfirst that spoke, for Diana kept her eyes fast fixed on the ground, and\r\nastonishment actually riveted my tongue to the roof of my mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are your suppliants, Mr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand we claim the\r\nrefuge and protection of your roof till we can pursue a journey where\r\ndungeons and death gape for me at every step.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d I articulated with great difficulty--\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vernon cannot\r\nsuppose--you, sir, cannot believe, that I have forgot your interference\r\nin my difficulties, or that I am capable of betraying any one, much less\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Frederick; \xe2\x80\x9cyet it is with the most inexpressible\r\nreluctance that I impose on you a confidence, disagreeable\r\nperhaps--certainly dangerous--and which I would have specially wished\r\nto have conferred on some one else. But my fate, which has chased me\r\nthrough a life of perils and escapes, is now pressing me hard, and I\r\nhave no alternative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened, and the voice of the officious Andrew was\r\nheard--\xe2\x80\x9cA'm bringin' in the caunles--Ye can light them gin ye like--Can\r\ndo is easy carried about wi' ane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ran to the door, which, as I hoped, I reached in time to prevent his\r\nobserving who were in the apartment, I turned him out with hasty\r\nviolence, shut the door after him, and locked it--then instantly\r\nremembering his two companions below, knowing his talkative humour, and\r\nrecollecting Syddall's remark, that one of them was supposed to be a spy,\r\nI followed him as fast as I could to the servants' hall, in which they\r\nwere assembled. Andrew's tongue was loud as I opened the door, but my\r\nunexpected appearance silenced him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, you fool?\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cyou stare and look\r\nwild, as if you had seen a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN--n--no--nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew.--\xe2\x80\x9cbut your worship was pleased to be\r\nhasty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you disturbed me out of a sound sleep, you fool. Syddall tells\r\nme he cannot find beds for these good fellows tonight, and Mr. Wardlaw\r\nthinks there will be no occasion to detain them. Here is a crown-piece\r\nfor them to drink my health, and thanks for their good-will. You will\r\nleave the Hall immediately, my good lads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men thanked me for my bounty, took the silver, and withdrew,\r\napparently unsuspicious and contented. I watched their departure until I\r\nwas sure they could have no further intercourse that night with honest\r\nAndrew. And so instantly had I followed on his heels, that I thought he\r\ncould not have had time to speak two words with them before I interrupted\r\nhim. But it is wonderful what mischief may be done by only two words. On\r\nthis occasion they cost two lives.\r\n\r\nHaving made these arrangements, the best which occurred to me upon the\r\npressure of the moment, to secure privacy for my guests, I returned to\r\nreport my proceedings, and added, that I had desired Syddall to answer\r\nevery summons, concluding that it was by his connivance they had been\r\nsecreted in the Hall. Diana raised her eyes to thank me for the caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou now understand my mystery,\xe2\x80\x9d she said;--\xe2\x80\x9cyou know, doubtless, how\r\nnear and dear that relative is, who has so often found shelter here; and\r\nwill be no longer surprised that Rashleigh, having such a secret at his\r\ncommand, should rule me with a rod of iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it was their intention to trouble me with their\r\npresence as short a time as was possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI entreated the fugitives to waive every consideration but what affected\r\ntheir safety, and to rely on my utmost exertions to promote it. This led\r\nto an explanation of the circumstances under which they stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always suspected Rashleigh Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Frederick; \xe2\x80\x9cbut his\r\nconduct towards my unprotected child, which with difficulty I wrung from\r\nher, and his treachery in your father's affairs, made me hate and despise\r\nhim. In our last interview I concealed not my sentiments, as I should in\r\nprudence have attempted to do; and in resentment of the scorn with which\r\nI treated him, he added treachery and apostasy to his catalogue of\r\ncrimes. I at that time fondly hoped that his defection would be of little\r\nconsequence. The Earl of Mar had a gallant army in Scotland, and Lord\r\nDerwentwater, with Forster, Kenmure, Winterton, and others, were\r\nassembling forces on the Border. As my connections with these English\r\nnobility and gentry were extensive, it was judged proper that I should\r\naccompany a detachment of Highlanders, who, under Brigadier MacIntosh of\r\nBorlum, crossed the Firth of Forth, traversed the low country of\r\nScotland, and united themselves on the Borders with the English\r\ninsurgents. My daughter accompanied me through the perils and fatigues of\r\na march so long and difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she will never leave her dear father!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Vernon,\r\nclinging fondly to his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had hardly joined our English friends, when I became sensible that our\r\ncause was lost. Our numbers diminished instead of increasing, nor were we\r\njoined by any except of our own persuasion. The Tories of the High Church\r\nremained in general undecided, and at length we were cooped up by a\r\nsuperior force in the little town of Preston. We defended ourselves\r\nresolutely for one day. On the next, the hearts of our leaders failed,\r\nand they resolved to surrender at discretion. To yield myself up on such\r\nterms, were to have laid my head on the block. About twenty or thirty\r\ngentlemen were of my mind: we mounted our horses, and placed my daughter,\r\nwho insisted on sharing my fate, in the centre of our little party. My\r\ncompanions, struck with her courage and filial piety, declared that they\r\nwould die rather than leave her behind. We rode in a body down a street\r\ncalled Fishergate, which leads to a marshy ground or meadow, extending to\r\nthe river Ribble, through which one of our party promised to show us a\r\ngood ford. This marsh had not been strongly invested by the enemy, so\r\nthat we had only an affair with a patrol of Honeywood's dragoons, whom we\r\ndispersed and cut to pieces. We crossed the river, gained the high road\r\nto Liverpool, and then dispersed to seek several places of concealment\r\nand safety. My fortune led me to Wales, where there are many gentlemen of\r\nmy religious and political opinions. I could not, however, find a safe\r\nopportunity of escaping by sea, and found myself obliged again to draw\r\ntowards the North. A well-tried friend has appointed to meet me in this\r\nneighbourhood, and guide me to a seaport on the Solway, where a sloop is\r\nprepared to carry me from my native country for ever. As Osbaldistone\r\nHall was for the present uninhabited, and under the charge of old\r\nSyddall, who had been our confidant on former occasions, we drew to it as\r\nto a place of known and secure refuge. I resumed a dress which had been\r\nused with good effect to scare the superstitious rustics, or domestics,\r\nwho chanced at any time to see me; and we expected from time to time to\r\nhear by Syddall of the arrival of our friendly guide, when your sudden\r\ncoming hither, and occupying this apartment, laid us under the necessity\r\nof submitting to your mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus ended Sir Fredericks story, whose tale sounded to me like one told\r\nin a vision; and I could hardly bring myself to believe that I saw his\r\ndaughter's form once more before me in flesh and blood, though with\r\ndiminished beauty and sunk spirits. The buoyant vivacity with which she\r\nhad resisted every touch of adversity, had now assumed the air of\r\ncomposed and submissive, but dauntless resolution and constancy. Her\r\nfather, though aware and jealous of the effect of her praises on my mind,\r\ncould not forbear expatiating upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has endured trials,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich might have dignified the\r\nhistory of a martyr;--she has faced danger and death in various\r\nshapes;--she has undergone toil and privation, from which men of the\r\nstrongest frame would have shrunk;--she has spent the day in darkness,\r\nand the night in vigil, and has never breathed a murmur of weakness or\r\ncomplaint. In a word, Mr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is a worthy\r\noffering to that God, to whom\xe2\x80\x9d (crossing himself) \xe2\x80\x9cI shall dedicate her,\r\nas all that is left dear or precious to Frederick Vernon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence after these words, of which I well understood the\r\nmournful import. The father of Diana was still as anxious to destroy my\r\nhopes of being united to her now as he had shown himself during our brief\r\nmeeting in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cintrude no farther on Mr.\r\nOsbaldistone's time, since we have acquainted him with the circumstances\r\nof the miserable guests who claim his protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI requested them to stay, and offered myself to leave the apartment. Sir\r\nFrederick observed, that my doing so could not but excite my attendant's\r\nsuspicion; and that the place of their retreat was in every respect\r\ncommodious, and furnished by Syddall with all they could possibly want.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might perhaps have even contrived to remain there, concealed from\r\nyour observation; but it would have been unjust to decline the most\r\nabsolute reliance on your honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done me but justice,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.--\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, Sir Frederick, I am\r\nbut little known; but Miss Vernon, I am sure, will bear me witness that\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not want my daughter's evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, politely, but yet with\r\nan air calculated to prevent my addressing myself to Diana, \xe2\x80\x9csince I am\r\nprepared to believe all that is worthy of Mr. Francis Osbaldistone.\r\nPermit us now to retire; we must take repose when we can, since we are\r\nabsolutely uncertain when we may be called upon to renew our perilous\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew his daughter's arm within his, and with a profound reverence,\r\ndisappeared with her behind the tapestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.\r\n\r\n              But now the hand of fate is on the curtain,\r\n                     And gives the scene to light.\r\n                                         Don Sebastian.\r\n\r\nI felt stunned and chilled as they retired. Imagination, dwelling on an\r\nabsent object of affection, paints her not only in the fairest light, but\r\nin that in which we most desire to behold her. I had thought of Diana as\r\nshe was, when her parting tear dropped on my cheek--when her parting\r\ntoken, received from the wife of MacGregor, augured her wish to convey\r\ninto exile and conventual seclusion the remembrance of my affection. I\r\nsaw her; and her cold passive manner, expressive of little except\r\ncomposed melancholy, disappointed, and, in some degree, almost offended\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIn the egotism of my feelings, I accused her of indifference--of\r\ninsensibility. I upbraided her father with pride--with cruelty--with\r\nfanaticism,--forgetting that both were sacrificing their interest, and\r\nDiana her inclination, to the discharge of what they regarded as their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Vernon was a rigid Catholic, who thought the path of\r\nsalvation too narrow to be trodden by an heretic; and Diana, to whom her\r\nfather's safety had been for many years the principal and moving spring\r\nof thoughts, hopes, and actions, felt that she had discharged her duty in\r\nresigning to his will, not alone her property in the world, but the\r\ndearest affections of her heart. But it was not surprising that I could\r\nnot, at such a moment, fully appreciate these honourable motives; yet my\r\nspleen sought no ignoble means of discharging itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am contemned, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, when left to run over the tenor of Sir\r\nFrederick's communications--\xe2\x80\x9cI am contemned, and thought unworthy even to\r\nexchange words with her. Be it so; they shall not at least prevent me\r\nfrom watching over her safety. Here will I remain as an outpost, and,\r\nwhile under my roof at least, no danger shall threaten her, if it be such\r\nas the arm of one determined man can avert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI summoned Syddall to the library. He came, but came attended by the\r\neternal Andrew, who, dreaming of great things in consequence of my taking\r\npossession of the Hall and the annexed estates, was resolved to lose\r\nnothing for want of keeping himself in view; and, as often happens to men\r\nwho entertain selfish objects, overshot his mark, and rendered his\r\nattentions tedious and inconvenient.\r\n\r\nHis unrequired presence prevented me from speaking freely to Syddall, and\r\nI dared not send him away for fear of increasing such suspicions as he\r\nmight entertain from his former abrupt dismissal from the library. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall sleep here, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, giving them directions to wheel nearer to\r\nthe fire an old-fashioned day-bed, or settee. \xe2\x80\x9cI have much to do, and\r\nshall go late to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSyddall, who seemed to understand my look, offered to procure me the\r\naccommodation of a mattress and some bedding. I accepted his offer,\r\ndismissed my attendant, lighted a pair of candles, and desired that I\r\nmight not be disturbed till seven in the ensuing morning.\r\n\r\nThe domestics retired, leaving me to my painful and ill-arranged\r\nreflections, until nature, worn out, should require some repose.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured forcibly to abstract my mind from the singular\r\ncircumstances in which I found myself placed. Feelings which I had\r\ngallantly combated while the exciting object was remote, were now\r\nexasperated by my immediate neighbourhood to her whom I was so soon to\r\npart with for ever. Her name was written in every book which I attempted\r\nto peruse; and her image forced itself on me in whatever train of thought\r\nI strove to engage myself. It was like the officious slave of Prior's\r\nSolomon,--\r\n\r\n                 Abra was ready ere I named her name,\r\n                 And when I called another, Abra came.\r\n\r\nI alternately gave way to these thoughts, and struggled against them,\r\nsometimes yielding to a mood of melting tenderness of sorrow which was\r\nscarce natural to me, sometimes arming myself with the hurt pride of one\r\nwho had experienced what he esteemed unmerited rejection. I paced the\r\nlibrary until I had chafed myself into a temporary fever. I then threw\r\nmyself on the couch, and endeavoured to dispose myself to sleep;--but it\r\nwas in vain that I used every effort to compose myself--that I lay\r\nwithout movement of finger or of muscle, as still as if I had been\r\nalready a corpse--that I endeavoured to divert or banish disquieting\r\nthoughts, by fixing my mind on some act of repetition or arithmetical\r\nprocess. My blood throbbed, to my feverish apprehension, in pulsations\r\nwhich resembled the deep and regular strokes of a distant fulling-mill,\r\nand tingled in my veins like streams of liquid fire.\r\n\r\nAt length I arose, opened the window, and stood by it for some time in\r\nthe clear moonlight, receiving, in part at least, that refreshment and\r\ndissipation of ideas from the clear and calm scene, without which they\r\nhad become beyond the command of my own volition. I resumed my place on\r\nthe couch--with a heart, Heaven knows, not lighter but firmer, and more\r\nresolved for endurance. In a short time a slumber crept over my senses;\r\nstill, however, though my senses slumbered, my soul was awake to the\r\npainful feelings of my situation, and my dreams were of mental anguish\r\nand external objects of terror.\r\n\r\nI remember a strange agony, under which I conceived myself and Diana in\r\nthe power of MacGregor's wife, and about to be precipitated from a rock\r\ninto the lake; the signal was to be the discharge of a cannon, fired by\r\nSir Frederick Vernon, who, in the dress of a Cardinal, officiated at the\r\nceremony. Nothing could be more lively than the impression which I\r\nreceived of this imaginary scene. I could paint, even at this moment, the\r\nmute and courageous submission expressed in Diana's features--the wild\r\nand distorted faces of the executioners, who crowded around us with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmopping and mowing;\xe2\x80\x9d grimaces ever changing, and each more hideous than\r\nthat which preceded. I saw the rigid and inflexible fanaticism painted in\r\nthe face of the father--I saw him lift the fatal match--the deadly signal\r\nexploded--It was repeated again and again and again, in rival thunders,\r\nby the echoes of the surrounding cliffs, and I awoke from fancied horror\r\nto real apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe sounds in my dream were not ideal. They reverberated on my waking\r\nears, but it was two or three minutes ere I could collect myself so as\r\ndistinctly to understand that they proceeded from a violent knocking at\r\nthe gate. I leaped from my couch in great apprehension, took my sword\r\nunder my arm, and hastened to forbid the admission of any one. But my\r\nroute was necessarily circuitous, because the library looked not upon the\r\nquadrangle, but into the gardens. When I had reached a staircase, the\r\nwindows of which opened upon the entrance court, I heard the feeble and\r\nintimidated tones of Syddall expostulating with rough voices, which\r\ndemanded admittance, by the warrant of Justice Standish, and in the\r\nKing's name, and threatened the old domestic with the heaviest penal\r\nconsequences if he refused instant obedience. Ere they had ceased, I\r\nheard, to my unspeakable provocation, the voice of Andrew bidding Syddall\r\nstand aside, and let him open the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they come in King George's name, we have naething to fear--we hae\r\nspent baith bluid and gowd for him--We dinna need to darn ourselves like\r\nsome folks, Mr. Syddall--we are neither Papists nor Jacobites, I trow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in vain I accelerated my pace down stairs; I heard bolt after bolt\r\nwithdrawn by the officious scoundrel, while all the time he was boasting\r\nhis own and his master's loyalty to King George; and I could easily\r\ncalculate that the party must enter before I could arrive at the door to\r\nreplace the bars. Devoting the back of Andrew Fairservice to the cudgel\r\nso soon as I should have time to pay him his deserts, I ran back to the\r\nlibrary, barricaded the door as I best could, and hastened to that by\r\nwhich Diana and her father entered, and begged for instant admittance.\r\nDiana herself undid the door. She was ready dressed, and betrayed neither\r\nperturbation nor fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanger is so familiar to us,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are always prepared to\r\nmeet it. My father is already up--he is in Rashleigh's apartment. We will\r\nescape into the garden, and thence by the postern-gate (I have the key\r\nfrom Syddall in case of need.) into the wood--I know its dingles better\r\nthan any one now alive. Keep them a few minutes in play. And, dear, dear\r\nFrank, once more fare-thee-well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe vanished like a meteor to join her father, and the intruders were\r\nrapping violently, and attempting to force the library door by the time I\r\nhad returned into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou robber dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, wilfully mistaking the purpose of their\r\ndisturbance, \xe2\x80\x9cif you do not instantly quit the house I will fire my\r\nblunderbuss through the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire a fule's bauble!\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Fairservice; \xe2\x80\x9cit's Mr. Clerk Jobson,\r\nwith a legal warrant\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo search for, take, and apprehend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of that execrable\r\npettifogger, \xe2\x80\x9cthe bodies of certain persons in my warrant named, charged\r\nof high treason under the 13th of King William, chapter third.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the violence on the door was renewed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am rising, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI, desirous to gain as much time as possible--\xe2\x80\x9ccommit no violence--give\r\nme leave to look at your warrant, and, if it is formal and legal, I shall\r\nnot oppose it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod save great George our King!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI tauld ye that ye\r\nwould find nae Jacobites here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpinning out the time as much as possible, I was at length compelled to\r\nopen the door, which they would otherwise have forced.\r\n\r\nMr. Jobson entered, with several assistants, among whom I discovered the\r\nyounger Wingfield, to whom, doubtless, he was obliged for his\r\ninformation, and exhibited his warrant, directed not only against\r\nFrederick Vernon, an attainted traitor, but also against Diana Vernon,\r\nspinster, and Francis Osbaldistone, gentleman, accused of misprision of\r\ntreason. It was a case in which resistance would have been madness; I\r\ntherefore, after capitulating for a few minutes' delay, surrendered\r\nmyself a prisoner.\r\n\r\nI had next the mortification to see Jobson go straight to the chamber of\r\nMiss Vernon, and I learned that from thence, without hesitation or\r\ndifficulty, he went to the room where Sir Frederick had slept. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hare\r\nhas stolen away,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brute, \xe2\x80\x9cbut her form is warm--the greyhounds\r\nwill have her by the haunches yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA scream from the garden announced that he prophesied too truly. In the\r\ncourse of five minutes, Rashleigh entered the library with Sir Frederick\r\nVernon and his daughter as prisoners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fox,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cknew his old earth, but he forgot it could be\r\nstopped by a careful huntsman.--I had not forgot the garden-gate, Sir\r\nFrederick--or, if that title suits you better, most noble Lord\r\nBeauchamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Frederick, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art a detestable villain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI better deserved the name, Sir Knight, or my Lord, when, under the\r\ndirection of an able tutor, I sought to introduce civil war into the\r\nbosom of a peaceful country. But I have done my best,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking\r\nupwards, \xe2\x80\x9cto atone for my errors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could hold no longer. I had designed to watch their proceedings in\r\nsilence, but I felt that I must speak or die. \xe2\x80\x9cIf hell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9chas one\r\ncomplexion more hideous than another, it is where villany is masked by\r\nhypocrisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! my gentle cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, holding a candle towards me, and\r\nsurveying me from head to foot; \xe2\x80\x9cright welcome to Osbaldistone Hall!--I\r\ncan forgive your spleen--It is hard to lose an estate and a mistress in\r\none night; for we shall take possession of this poor manor-house in the\r\nname of the lawful heir, Sir Rashleigh Osbaldistone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Rashleigh braved it out in this manner, I could see that he put a\r\nstrong force upon his feelings, both of anger and shame. But his state of\r\nmind was more obvious when Diana Vernon addressed him. \xe2\x80\x9cRashleigh,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI pity you--for, deep as the evil is which you have laboured to do\r\nme, and the evil you have actually done, I cannot hate you so much as I\r\nscorn and pity you. What you have now done may be the work of an hour,\r\nbut will furnish you with reflection for your life--of what nature I\r\nleave to your own conscience, which will not slumber for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh strode once or twice through the room, came up to the\r\nside-table, on which wine was still standing, and poured out a large\r\nglass with a trembling hand; but when he saw that we observed his tremor,\r\nhe suppressed it by a strong effort, and, looking at us with fixed and\r\ndaring composure, carried the bumper to his head without spilling a drop.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my father's old burgundy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking to Jobson; \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad\r\nthere is some of it left.--You will get proper persons to take care of\r\nold butler, and that foolish Scotch rascal. Meanwhile we will convey\r\nthese persons to a more proper place of custody. I have provided the old\r\nfamily coach for your convenience,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I am not ignorant\r\nthat even the lady could brave the night-air on foot or on horseback,\r\nwere the errand more to her mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrew wrung his hands.--\xe2\x80\x9cI only said that my master was surely speaking\r\nto a ghaist in the library--and the villain Lancie to betray an auld\r\nfriend, that sang aff the same Psalm-book wi' him every Sabbath for\r\ntwenty years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was turned out of the house, together with Syddall, without being\r\nallowed to conclude his lamentation. His expulsion, however, led to some\r\nsingular consequences. Resolving, according to his own story, to go down\r\nfor the night where Mother Simpson would give him a lodging for old\r\nacquaintance' sake, he had just got clear of the avenue, and into the old\r\nwood, as it was called, though it was now used as a pasture-ground rather\r\nthan woodland, when he suddenly lighted on a drove of Scotch cattle,\r\nwhich were lying there to repose themselves after the day's journey. At\r\nthis Andrew was in no way surprised, it being the well-known custom of\r\nhis countrymen, who take care of those droves, to quarter themselves\r\nafter night upon the best unenclosed grass-ground they can find, and\r\ndepart before day-break to escape paying for their night's lodgings. But\r\nhe was both surprised and startled, when a Highlander, springing up,\r\naccused him of disturbing the cattle, and refused him to pass forward\r\ntill he had spoken to his master. The mountaineer conducted Andrew into a\r\nthicket, where he found three or four more of his countrymen. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAndrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw sune they were ower mony men for the drove; and from the\r\nquestions they put to me, I judged they had other tow on their rock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey questioned him closely about all that had passed at Osbaldistone\r\nHall, and seemed surprised and concerned at the report he made to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd troth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI tauld them a' I ken'd; for dirks and pistols\r\nwere what I could never refuse information to in a' my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey talked in whispers among themselves, and at length collected their\r\ncattle together, and drove them close up to the entrance of the avenue,\r\nwhich might be half a mile distant from the house. They proceeded to drag\r\ntogether some felled trees which lay in the vicinity, so as to make a\r\ntemporary barricade across the road, about fifteen yards beyond the\r\navenue. It was now near daybreak, and there was a pale eastern gleam\r\nmingled with the fading moonlight, so that objects could be discovered\r\nwith some distinctness. The lumbering sound of a coach drawn by four\r\nhorses, and escorted by six men on horseback, was heard coming up the\r\navenue. The Highlanders listened attentively. The carriage contained Mr.\r\nJobson and his unfortunate prisoners. The escort consisted of Rashleigh,\r\nand of several horsemen, peace-officers and their assistants. So soon as\r\nwe had passed the gate at the head of the avenue, it was shut behind the\r\ncavalcade by a Highland-man, stationed there for that purpose. At the\r\nsame time the carriage was impeded in its farther progress by the cattle,\r\namongst which we were involved, and by the barricade in front. Two of the\r\nescort dismounted to remove the felled trees, which they might think were\r\nleft there by accident or carelessness. The others began with their whips\r\nto drive the cattle from the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho dare abuse our cattle?\xe2\x80\x9d said a rough voice.--\xe2\x80\x9cShoot him, Angus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRashleigh instantly called out--\xe2\x80\x9cA rescue! a rescue!\xe2\x80\x9d and, firing a\r\npistol, wounded the man who spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Claymore!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried the leader of the Highlanders, and a scuffle\r\ninstantly commenced. The officers of the law, surprised at so sudden an\r\nattack, and not usually possessing the most desperate bravery, made but\r\nan imperfect defence, considering the superiority of their numbers. Some\r\nattempted to ride back to the Hall, but on a pistol being fired from\r\nbehind the gate, they conceived themselves surrounded, and at length\r\ngalloped of in different directions. Rashleigh, meanwhile, had\r\ndismounted, and on foot had maintained a desperate and single-handed\r\nconflict with the leader of the band. The window of the carriage, on my\r\nside, permitted me to witness it. At length Rashleigh dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you ask forgiveness for the sake of God, King James, and auld\r\nfriendship?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice which I knew right well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rashleigh, firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, traitor, die in your treason!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted MacGregor, and plunged his\r\nsword in his prostrate antagonist.\r\n\r\nIn the next moment he was at the carriage door--handed out Miss Vernon,\r\nassisted her father and me to alight, and dragging out the attorney, head\r\nforemost, threw him under the wheel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Osbaldistone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have nothing to\r\nfear--I must look after those who have--Your friends will soon be in\r\nsafety--Farewell, and forget not the MacGregor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe whistled--his band gathered round him, and, hurrying Diana and her\r\nfather along with him, they were almost instantly lost in the glades of\r\nthe forest. The coachman and postilion had abandoned their horses, and\r\nfled at the first discharge of firearms; but the animals, stopped by the\r\nbarricade, remained perfectly still; and well for Jobson that they did\r\nso, for the slightest motion would have dragged the wheel over his body.\r\nMy first object was to relieve him, for such was the rascal's terror that\r\nhe never could have risen by his own exertions. I next commanded him to\r\nobserve, that I had neither taken part in the rescue, nor availed myself\r\nof it to make my escape, and enjoined him to go down to the Hall, and\r\ncall some of his party, who had been left there, to assist the wounded.--\r\nBut Jobson's fears had so mastered and controlled every faculty of his\r\nmind, that he was totally incapable of moving. I now resolved to go\r\nmyself, but in my way I stumbled over the body of a man, as I thought,\r\ndead or dying. It was, however, Andrew Fairservice, as well and whole as\r\never he was in his life, who had only taken this recumbent posture to\r\navoid the slashes, stabs, and pistol-balls, which for a moment or two\r\nwere flying in various directions. I was so glad to find him, that I did\r\nnot inquire how he came thither, but instantly commanded his assistance.\r\n\r\nRashleigh was our first object. He groaned when I approached him, as much\r\nthrough spite as through pain, and shut his eyes, as if determined, like\r\nIago, to speak no word more. We lifted him into the carriage, and\r\nperformed the same good office to another wounded man of his party, who\r\nhad been left on the field. I then with difficulty made Jobson understand\r\nthat he must enter the coach also, and support Sir Rashleigh upon the\r\nseat. He obeyed, but with an air as if he but half comprehended my\r\nmeaning. Andrew and I turned the horses' heads round, and opening the\r\ngate of the avenue, led them slowly back to Osbaldistone Hall.\r\n\r\nSome fugitives had already reached the Hall by circuitous routes, and\r\nalarmed its garrison by the news that Sir Rashleigh, Clerk Jobson, and\r\nall their escort, save they who escaped to tell the tale, had been cut to\r\npieces at the head of the avenue by a whole regiment of wild Highlanders.\r\nWhen we reached the mansion, therefore, we heard such a buzz as arises\r\nwhen bees are alarmed, and mustering in their hives. Mr. Jobson, however,\r\nwho had now in some measure come to his senses, found voice enough to\r\nmake himself known. He was the more anxious to be released from the\r\ncarriage, as one of his companions (the peace-officer) had, to his\r\ninexpressible terror, expired by his side with a hideous groan.\r\n\r\nSir Rashleigh Osbaldistone was still alive, but so dreadfully wounded\r\nthat the bottom of the coach was filled with his blood, and long traces\r\nof it left from the entrance-door into the stone-hall, where he was\r\nplaced in a chair, some attempting to stop the bleeding with cloths,\r\nwhile others called for a surgeon, and no one seemed willing to go to\r\nfetch one. \xe2\x80\x9cTorment me not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wounded man--\xe2\x80\x9cI know no assistance\r\ncan avail me--I am a dying man.\xe2\x80\x9d He raised himself in his chair, though\r\nthe damps and chill of death were already on his brow, and spoke with a\r\nfirmness which seemed beyond his strength. \xe2\x80\x9cCousin Francis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdraw near to me.\xe2\x80\x9d I approached him as he requested.--\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you only to\r\nknow that the pangs of death do not alter I one iota of my feelings\r\ntowards you. I hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, the expression of rage throwing a\r\nhideous glare into the eyes which were soon to be closed for ever--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhate you with a hatred as intense, now while I lie bleeding and dying\r\nbefore you, as if my foot trode on your neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given you no cause, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied,--\xe2\x80\x9cand for your own sake I\r\ncould wish your mind in a better temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_ given me cause,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cIn love, in ambition, in the\r\npaths of interest, you have crossed and blighted me at every turn. I was\r\nborn to be the honour of my father's house--I have been its disgrace--and\r\nall owing to you. My very patrimony has become yours--Take it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand may the curse of a dying man cleave to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Death of Rashleigh--338]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a moment after he had uttered this frightful wish, he fell back in the\r\nchair; his eyes became glazed, his limbs stiffened, but the grin and\r\nglare of mortal hatred survived even the last gasp of life. I will dwell\r\nno longer on so painful a picture, nor say any more of the death of\r\nRashleigh, than that it gave me access to my rights of inheritance\r\nwithout farther challenge, and that Jobson found himself compelled to\r\nallow, that the ridiculous charge of misprision of high treason was got\r\nup on an affidavit which he made with the sole purpose of favouring\r\nRashleigh's views, and removing me from Osbaldistone Hall. The rascal's\r\nname was struck off the list of attorneys, and he was reduced to poverty\r\nand contempt.\r\n\r\nI returned to London when I had put my affairs in order at Osbaldistone\r\nHall, and felt happy to escape from a place which suggested so many\r\npainful recollections. My anxiety was now acute to learn the fate of\r\nDiana and her father. A French gentleman who came to London on commercial\r\nbusiness, was intrusted with a letter to me from Miss Vernon, which put\r\nmy mind at rest respecting their safety.\r\n\r\nIt gave me to understand that the opportune appearance of MacGregor and\r\nhis party was not fortuitous. The Scottish nobles and gentry engaged in\r\nthe insurrection, as well as those of England, were particularly anxious\r\nto further the escape of Sir Frederick Vernon, who, as an old and trusted\r\nagent of the house of Stuart, was possessed of matter enough to have\r\nruined half Scotland. Rob Roy, of whose sagacity and courage they had\r\nknown so many proofs, was the person whom they pitched upon to assist his\r\nescape, and the place of meeting was fixed at Osbaldistone Hall. You have\r\nalready heard how nearly the plan had been disconcerted by the unhappy\r\nRashleigh. It succeeded, however, perfectly; for when once Sir Frederick\r\nand his daughter were again at large, they found horses prepared for\r\nthem, and, by MacGregor's knowledge of the country--for every part of\r\nScotland, and of the north of England, was familiar to him--were\r\nconducted to the western sea-coast, and safely embarked for France. The\r\nsame gentleman told me that Sir Frederick was not expected to survive for\r\nmany months a lingering disease, the consequence of late hardships and\r\nprivations. His daughter was placed in a convent, and although it was her\r\nfather's wish she should take the veil, he was understood to refer the\r\nmatter entirely to her own inclinations.\r\n\r\nWhen these news reached me, I frankly told the state of my affections to\r\nmy father, who was not a little startled at the idea of my marrying a\r\nRoman Catholic. But he was very desirous to see me \xe2\x80\x9csettled in life,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nhe called it; and he was sensible that, in joining him with heart and\r\nhand in his commercial labours, I had sacrificed my own inclinations.\r\nAfter a brief hesitation, and several questions asked and answered to his\r\nsatisfaction, he broke out with--\xe2\x80\x9cI little thought a son of mine should\r\nhave been Lord of Osbaldistone Manor, and far less that he should go to a\r\nFrench convent for a spouse. But so dutiful a daughter cannot but prove a\r\ngood wife. You have worked at the desk to please me, Frank; it is but\r\nfair you should wive to please yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow I sped in my wooing, Will Tresham, I need not tell you. You know,\r\ntoo, how long and happily I lived with Diana. You know how I lamented\r\nher; but you do not--cannot know, how much she deserved her husband's\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nI have no more of romantic adventure to tell, nor, indeed, anything to\r\ncommunicate farther, since the latter incidents of my life are so well\r\nknown to one who has shared, with the most friendly sympathy, the joys,\r\nas well as the sorrows, by which its scenes have been chequered. I often\r\nvisited Scotland, but never again saw the bold Highlander who had such an\r\ninfluence on the early events of my life. I learned, however, from time\r\nto time, that he continued to maintain his ground among the mountains of\r\nLoch Lomond, in despite of his powerful enemies, and that he even\r\nobtained, to a certain degree, the connivance of Government to his\r\nself-elected office of protector of the Lennox, in virtue of which he\r\nlevied black-mail with as much regularity as the proprietors did their\r\nordinary rents. It seemed impossible that his life should have concluded\r\nwithout a violent end. Nevertheless he died in old age and by a peaceful\r\ndeath, some time about the year 1733, and is still remembered in his\r\ncountry as the Robin Hood of Scotland--the dread of the wealthy, but the\r\nfriend of the poor--and possessed of many qualities, both of head and\r\nheart, which would have graced a less equivocal profession than that to\r\nwhich his fate condemned him.\r\n\r\nOld Andrew Fairservice used to say, that \xe2\x80\x9cThere were many things ower bad\r\nfor blessing, and ower gude for banning, like Rob Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Here the original manuscript ends somewhat abruptly. I have reason to\r\nthink that what followed related to private a affairs._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the Appendix to the Introduction to Rob Roy\r\ncontains two curious letters respecting the arrest of Mr. Grahame of\r\nKillearn by that daring freebooter, while levying the Duke of Montrose's\r\nrents. These were taken from scroll copies in the possession of his Grace\r\nthe present Duke, who kindly permitted the use of them in the present\r\npublication.--The Novel had but just passed through the press, when the\r\nRight Honourable Mr. Peel--whose important state avocations do not avert\r\nhis attention from the interests of literature--transmitted to the author\r\ncopies of the original letters and enclosure, of which he possessed only\r\nthe rough draught. The originals were discovered in the State Paper\r\nOffice, by the indefatigable researches of Mr. Lemon, who is daily\r\nthrowing more light on that valuable collection of records. From the\r\ndocuments with which the Author has been thus kindly favoured, he is\r\nenabled to fill up the addresses which were wanting in the scrolls. That\r\nof the 21st Nov. 1716 is addressed to Lord Viscount Townshend, and is\r\naccompanied by one of the same date to Robert Pringle, Esquire,\r\nUnder-Secretary of State, which is here inserted as relative to so\r\ncurious an incident:--\r\n\r\n_Letter from the Duke of Montrose, to Robert Pringle, Esq.,\r\nUnder-Secretary to Lord Viscount Townshend._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSr,_Glasgow,_ 21 _Nov._ 1716.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaveing had so many dispatches to make this night, I hope ye'l excuse me\r\nthat I make use of another hand to give yow a short account of the\r\noccasion of this express, by which I have written to my Ld. Duke of\r\nRoxburgh, and my Lord Townshend, which I hope ye'l gett carefully\r\ndeleivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Graham, younger of Killearn, being on Munday last in Menteith att a\r\ncountry house, collecting my rents, was about nine o'clock that same\r\nnight surprised by Rob Roy with a party of his men in arms, who haveing\r\nsurrounded the house and secured the avenues, presented their guns in at\r\nthe windows, while he himself entered the room with some others with cokt\r\npistolls, and seased Killearn with all his money, books, papers, and\r\nbonds, and carryed all away with him to the hills, at the same time\r\nordering Killearn to write a letter to me (of which ye have the copy\r\ninclosed), proposeing a very honourable treaty to me. I must say this\r\nstory was as surprising to me as it was insolent; and it must bring a\r\nvery great concern upon me, that this gentleman, my near relation, should\r\nbe brought to suffer all the barbaritys and crueltys, which revenge and\r\nmallice may suggest to these miscreants, for his haveing acted a\r\nfaithfull part in the service of the Government, and his affection to me\r\nin my concerns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not be more particular to you, since I know that my Letter to my\r\nLord Townshend will come into your hands, so shall only now give you the\r\nassurances of my being, with great sincerity,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSr, yr most humble servant,\r\n(Signed)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMontrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI long exceedingly for a return of my former dispatches to the\r\nSecretary's about Methven and Colll Urquhart, and my wife's cousins,\r\nBalnamoon and Phinaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg yow'll give my humble service to Mr. Secretary Methven, and\r\ntell him that I must refer him to what I have written to My Lord\r\nTownshend in this affair of Rob Roy, believing it was needless to trouble\r\nboth with letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExamined,\r\nRobt. Lemon,\r\n_Deputy Keeper of State Papers._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE PAPER OFFICE,\r\n_Nov._ 4, 1829\r\n\r\nNote.--The enclosure referred to in the preceding letter is another copy\r\nof the letter which Mr. Grahame of Killearn was compelled by Rob Roy to\r\nwrite to the Duke of Montrose, and is exactly the same as the one\r\nenclosed in his Grace's letter to Lord Townshend, dated November 21st,\r\n1716.\r\nR. L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last letter in the Appendix No. II. (28th November), acquainting the\r\nGovernment with Killearn's being set at liberty, is also addressed to the\r\nUnder-Secretary of State, Mr. Pringle.\r\n\r\nThe Author may also here remark, that immediately previous to the\r\ninsurrection of 1715, he perceives, from some notes of information given\r\nto Government, that Rob Roy appears to have been much employed and\r\ntrusted by the Jacobite party, even in the very delicate task of\r\ntransporting specie to the Earl of Breadalbane, though it might have\r\nsomewhat resembled trusting Don Raphael and Ambrose de Lamela with the\r\nchurch treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO ROB ROY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote A.--The Grey Stone of MacGregor.\r\n\r\nI have been informed that, at no very remote period, it was proposed to\r\ntake this large stone, which marks the grave of Dugald Ciar Mhor, and\r\nconvert it to the purpose of the lintel of a window, the threshold of a\r\ndoor, or some such mean use. A man of the clan MacGregor, who was\r\nsomewhat deranged, took fire at this insult; and when the workmen came to\r\nremove the stone, planted himself upon it, with a broad axe in his hand,\r\nswearing he would dash out the brains of any one who should disturb the\r\nmonument. Athletic in person, and insane enough to be totally regardless\r\nof consequences, it was thought best to give way to his humour; and the\r\npoor madman kept sentinel on the stone day and night, till the proposal\r\nof removing it was entirely dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote B.--Dugald Ciar Mhor.\r\n\r\nThe above is the account which I find in a manuscript history of the clan\r\nMacGregor, of which I was indulged with a perusal by Donald MacGregor,\r\nEsq., late Major of the 33d regiment, where great pains have been taken\r\nto collect traditions and written documents concerning the family. But an\r\nancient and constant tradition, preserved among the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry, and particularly those of the clan MacFarlane, relieves Dugald\r\nCiar Mhor of the guilt of murdering the youths, and lays the blame on a\r\ncertain Donald or Duncan Lean, who performed the act of cruelty, with the\r\nassistance of a gillie who attended him, named Charlioch, or Charlie.\r\nThey say that the homicides dared not again join their clan, but that\r\nthey resided in a wild and solitary state as outlaws, in an unfrequented\r\npart of the MacFarlanes' territory. Here they lived for some time\r\nundisturbed, till they committed an act of brutal violence on two\r\ndefenceless women, a mother and daughter of the MacFarlane clan. In\r\nrevenge of this atrocity, the MacFarlanes hunted them down, and shot\r\nthem. It is said that the younger ruffian, Charlioch, might have escaped,\r\nbeing remarkably swift of foot. But his crime became his punishment, for\r\nthe female whom he had outraged had defended herself desperately, and had\r\nstabbed him with his own dirk in the thigh. He was lame from the wound,\r\nand was the more easily overtaken and killed.\r\n\r\nI always inclined to think this last the true edition of the story, and\r\nthat the guilt was transferred to Dugald Ciar Mhor, as a man of higher\r\nname, but I have learned that Dugald was in truth dead several years\r\nbefore the battle--my authority being his representative, Mr. Gregorson\r\nof Ardtornish. [See also note to introduction, \xe2\x80\x9cLegend of Montrose,\xe2\x80\x9d vol.\r\nvi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote C.--The Loch Lomond Expedition.\r\n\r\nThe Loch Lomond expedition was judged worthy to form a separate pamphlet,\r\nwhich I have not seen; but, as quoted by the historian Rae, it must be\r\ndelectable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the morrow, being Thursday the 13th, they went on their expedition,\r\nand about noon came to Inversnaid, the place of danger, where the Paisley\r\nmen and those of Dumbarton, and several of the other companies, to the\r\nnumber of an hundred men, with the greatest intrepidity leapt on shore,\r\ngot up to the top of the mountains, and stood a considerable time,\r\nbeating their drums all the while; but no enemy appearing, they went in\r\nquest of their boats, which the rebels had seized, and having casually\r\nlighted on some ropes and oars hid among the shrubs, at length they found\r\nthe boats drawn up a good way on the land, which they hurled down to the\r\nloch. Such of them as were not damaged they carried off with them, and\r\nsuch as were, they sank and hewed to pieces. That same night they\r\nreturned to Luss, and thence next day to Dumbarton, from whence they had\r\nat first set out, bringing along with them the whole boats they found in\r\ntheir way on either side of the loch, and in the creeks of the isles, and\r\nmooring them under the cannon of the castle. During this expedition, the\r\npinnaces discharging their patararoes, and the men their small-arms, made\r\nsuch a thundering noise, through the multiplied rebounding echoes of the\r\nvast mountains on both sides of the loch, that the MacGregors were cowed\r\nand frighted away to the rest of the rebels who were encamped at Strath\r\nFillan.\xe2\x80\x9d--_Rae's History of the Rebellion,_ 4to, p. 287.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote D.--Author's Expedition against the MacLarens.\r\n\r\nThe Author is uncertain whether it is worth while to mention, that he had\r\na personal opportunity of observing, even in his own time, that the\r\nking's writ did not pass quite current in the Brass of Balquhidder. There\r\nwere very considerable debts due by Stewart of Appin (chiefly to the\r\nauthor's family), which were likely to be lost to the creditors, if they\r\ncould not be made available out of this same farm of Invernenty, the\r\nscene of the murder done upon MacLaren.\r\n\r\nHis family, consisting of several strapping deer-stalkers, still\r\npossessed the farm, by virtue of a long lease, for a trifling rent. There\r\nwas no chance of any one buying it with such an encumbrance, and a\r\ntransaction was entered into by the MacLarens, who, being desirous to\r\nemigrate to America, agreed to sell their lease to the creditors for\r\nL500, and to remove at the next term of Whitsunday. But whether they\r\nrepented their bargain, or desired to make a better, or whether from a\r\nmere point of honour, the MacLarens declared they would not permit a\r\nsummons of removal to be executed against them, which was necessary for\r\nthe legal completion of the bargain. And such was the general impression\r\nthat they were men capable of resisting the legal execution of warning by\r\nvery effectual means, no king's messenger would execute the summons\r\nwithout the support of a military force. An escort of a sergeant and six\r\nmen was obtained from a Highland regiment lying in Stirling; and the\r\nAuthor, then a writer's apprentice, equivalent to the honourable\r\nsituation of an attorney's clerk, was invested with the superintendence\r\nof the expedition, with directions to see that the messenger discharged\r\nhis duty fully, and that the gallant sergeant did not exceed his part by\r\ncommitting violence or plunder. And thus it happened, oddly enough, that\r\nthe Author first entered the romantic scenery of Loch Katrine, of which\r\nhe may perhaps say he has somewhat extended the reputation, riding in all\r\nthe dignity of danger, with a front and rear guard, and loaded arms. The\r\nsergeant was absolutely a Highland Sergeant Kite, full of stories of Rob\r\nRoy and of himself, and a very good companion. We experienced no\r\ninterruption whatever, and when we came to Invernenty, found the house\r\ndeserted. We took up our quarters for the night, and used some of the\r\nvictuals which we found there. On the morning we returned as unmolested\r\nas we came.\r\n\r\nThe MacLarens, who probably never thought of any serious opposition,\r\nreceived their money and went to America, where, having had some slight\r\nshare in removing them from their _paupera regna,_ I sincerely hope they\r\nprospered.\r\n\r\nThe rent of Invernenty instantly rose from L10 to L70 or L80; and when\r\nsold, the farm was purchased (I think by the late Laird of MacNab) at a\r\nprice higher in proportion than what even the modern rent authorised the\r\nparties interested to hope for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote E.--Allan Breck Stewart.\r\n\r\nAllan Breck Stewart was a man likely in such a matter to keep his word.\r\nJames Drummond MacGregor and he, like Katherine and Petruchio, were well\r\nmatched \xe2\x80\x9cfor a couple of quiet ones.\xe2\x80\x9d Allan Breck lived till the\r\nbeginning of the French Revolution. About 1789, a friend of mine, then\r\nresiding at Paris, was invited to see some procession which was supposed\r\nlikely to interest him, from the windows of an apartment occupied by a\r\nScottish Benedictine priest. He found, sitting by the fire, a tall, thin,\r\nraw-boned, grim-looking, old man, with the petit croix of St. Louis. His\r\nvisage was strongly marked by the irregular projections of the\r\ncheek-bones and chin. His eyes were grey. His grizzled hair exhibited\r\nmarks of having been red, and his complexion was weather-beaten, and\r\nremarkably freckled. Some civilities in French passed between the old man\r\nand my friend, in the course of which they talked of the streets and\r\nsquares of Paris, till at length the old soldier, for such he seemed, and\r\nsuch he was, said with a sigh, in a sharp Highland accent, \xe2\x80\x9cDeil ane o'\r\nthem a' is worth the Hie Street of Edinburgh!\xe2\x80\x9d On inquiry, this admirer\r\nof Auld Reekie, which he was never to see again, proved to be Allan Breck\r\nStewart. He lived decently on his little pension, and had, in no\r\nsubsequent period of his life, shown anything of the savage mood in which\r\nhe is generally believed to have assassinated the enemy and oppressor, as\r\nhe supposed him, of his family and clan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote F.--The Abbess of Wilton.\r\n\r\nThe nunnery of Wilton was granted to the Earl of Pembroke upon its\r\ndissolution, by the magisterial authority of Henry VIII., or his son\r\nEdward VI. On the accession of Queen Mary, of Catholic memory, the Earl\r\nfound it necessary to reinstate the Abbess and her fair recluses, which\r\nhe did with many expressions of his remorse, kneeling humbly to the\r\nvestals, and inducting them into the convent and possessions from which\r\nhe had expelled them. With the accession of Elizabeth, the accommodating\r\nEarl again resumed his Protestant faith, and a second time drove the nuns\r\nfrom their sanctuary. The remonstrances of the Abbess, who reminded him\r\nof his penitent expressions on the former occasion, could wring from him\r\nno other answer than that in the text--\xe2\x80\x9cGo spin, you jade!--Go spin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote G.--Mons Meg.\r\n\r\nMons Meg was a large old-fashioned piece of ordnance, a great favourite\r\nwith the Scottish common people; she was fabricated at Mons, in Flanders,\r\nin the reign of James IV. or V. of Scotland. This gun figures frequently\r\nin the public accounts of the time, where we find charges for grease, to\r\ngrease Meg's mouth withal (to increase, as every schoolboy knows, the\r\nloudness of the report), ribands to deck her carriage, and pipes to play\r\nbefore her when she was brought from the Castle to accompany the Scottish\r\narmy on any distant expedition. After the Union, there was much popular\r\napprehension that the Regalia of Scotland, and the subordinate Palladium,\r\nMons Meg, would be carried to England to complete the odious surrender of\r\nnational independence. The Regalia, sequestered from the sight of the\r\npublic, were generally supposed to have been abstracted in this manner.\r\nAs for Mons Meg, she remained in the Castle of Edinburgh, till, by order\r\nof the Board of Ordnance, she was actually removed to Woolwich about\r\n1757. The Regalia, by his Majesty's special command, have been brought\r\nforth from their place of concealment in 1818, and exposed to the view of\r\nthe people, by whom they must be looked upon with deep associations; and,\r\nin this very winter of 1828-9, Mons Meg has been restored to the country,\r\nwhere that, which in every other place or situation was a mere mass of\r\nrusty iron, becomes once more a curious monument of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote H.---Fairy Superstition.\r\n\r\nThe lakes and precipices amidst which the Avon-Dhu, or River Forth, has\r\nits birth, are still, according to popular tradition, haunted by the\r\nElfin people, the most peculiar, but most pleasing, of the creations of\r\nCeltic superstitions. The opinions entertained about these beings are\r\nmuch the same with those of the Irish, so exquisitely well narrated by\r\nMr. Crofton Croker. An eminently beautiful little conical hill, near the\r\neastern extremity of the valley of Aberfoil, is supposed to be one of\r\ntheir peculiar haunts, and is the scene which awakens, in Andrew\r\nFairservice, the terror of their power. It is remarkable, that two\r\nsuccessive clergymen of this parish of Aberfoil have employed themselves\r\nin writing about this fairy superstition. The eldest of these was Robert\r\nKirke, a man of some talents, who translated the Psalms into Gaelic\r\nverse. He had formerly been minister at the neighbouring parish of\r\nBalquhidder, and died at Aberfoil in 1688, at the early age of forty-two.\r\n\r\nHe was author of the Secret Commonwealth, which was printed after his\r\ndeath in 1691--(an edition which I have never seen)--and was reprinted in\r\nEdinburgh, 1815. This is a work concerning the fairy people, in whose\r\nexistence Mr. Kirke appears to have been a devout believer. He describes\r\nthem with the usual powers and qualities ascribed to such beings in\r\nHighland tradition.\r\n\r\nBut what is sufficiently singular, the Rev. Robert Kirke, author of the\r\nsaid treatise, is believed himself to have been taken away by the\r\nfairies,--in revenge, perhaps, for having let in too much light upon the\r\nsecrets of their commonwealth. We learn this catastrophe from the\r\ninformation of his successor, the late amiable and learned Dr. Patrick\r\nGrahame, also minister at Aberfoil, who, in his Sketches of Perthshire,\r\nhas not forgotten to touch upon the _Daoine Schie,_ or men of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Robert Kirke was, it seems, walking upon a little eminence to\r\nthe west of the present manse, which is still held a _Dun Shie,_ or fairy\r\nmound, when he sunk down, in what seemed to mortals a fit, and was\r\nsupposed to be dead. This, however, was not his real fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Kirke was the near relation of Graham of Duchray, the ancestor of\r\nthe present General Graham Stirling. Shortly after his funeral, he\r\nappeared, in the dress in which he had sunk down, to a medical relation\r\nof his own, and of Duchray. 'Go,' said he to him, 'to my cousin Duchray,\r\nand tell him that I am not dead. I fell down in a swoon, and was carried\r\ninto Fairyland, where I now am. Tell him, that when he and my friends are\r\nassembled at the baptism of my child (for he had left his wife pregnant),\r\nI will appear in the room, and that if he throws the knife which he holds\r\nin his hand over my head, I will be released and restored to human\r\nsociety.' The man, it seems, neglected, for some time, to deliver the\r\nmessage. Mr. Kirke appeared to him a second time, threatening to haunt\r\nhim night and day till he executed his commission, which at length he\r\ndid. The time of the baptism arrived. They were seated at table; the\r\nfigure of Mr. Kirke entered, but the Laird of Duchray, by some\r\nunaccountable fatality, neglected to perform the prescribed ceremony. Mr.\r\nKirke retired by another door, and was seen no wore. It is firmly\r\nbelieved that he is, at this day, in Fairyland.\xe2\x80\x9d--(_Sketches of\r\nPerthshire,_ p. 254.)\r\n\r\n[The treatise by Robert Kirke, here mentioned, was written in the year\r\n1691, but not printed till 1815.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote I.--Clachan of Aberfoil.\r\n\r\nI do not know how this might stand in Mr. Osbaldistone's day, but I can\r\nassure the reader, whose curiosity may lead him to visit the scenes of\r\nthese romantic adventures, that the Clachan of Aberfoil now affords a\r\nvery comfortable little inn. If he chances to be a Scottish antiquary, it\r\nwill be an additional recommendation to him, that he will find himself in\r\nthe vicinity of the Rev. Dr. Patrick Grahame, minister of the gospel at\r\nAberfoil, whose urbanity in communicating information on the subject of\r\nnational antiquities, is scarce exceeded even by the stores of legendary\r\nlore which he has accumulated.--_Original Note._ The respectable\r\nclergyman alluded to has been dead for some years.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
