He was a fellow of a little over thirty, of medium height, and\r\nof pleasant exterior. Unfortunately, in his dark-grey eyes there was an\r\nabsence of any definite idea, and in his other features a total lack of\r\nconcentration. Suddenly a thought would wander across his face with\r\nthe freedom of a bird, flutter for a moment in his eyes, settle on his\r\nhalf-opened lips, and remain momentarily lurking in the lines of his\r\nforehead. Then it would disappear, and once more his face would glow\r\nwith a radiant _insouciance_ which extended even to his attitude and the\r\nfolds of his night-robe. At other times his glance would darken as with\r\nweariness or _ennui_. Yet neither the one nor the other expression could\r\naltogether banish from his countenance that gentleness which was the\r\nruling, the fundamental, characteristic, not only of his features, but\r\nalso of the spirit which lay beneath them. That spirit shone in\r\nhis eyes, in his smile, and in his every movement of hand and head. On\r\nglancing casually at Oblomov a cold, a superficially observant person\r\nwould have said, \xe2\x80\x9cEvidently he is good-natured, but a simpleton;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n whereas a person of greater penetration and sympathy than the first\r\nwould have prolonged his glance, and then gone on his way thoughtfully,\r\nand with a smile as though he were pleased with something.\r\n\r\n     *  One of the principal streets of Petrograd.\r\n\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s face was neither reddy nor dull nor pale, but of an indefinite\r\nhue. At all events, that was the impression which it gave--possibly\r\nbecause, through insufficiency of exercise, or through want of fresh\r\nair, or through a lack of both, he was wrinkled beyond his years. In\r\ngeneral, to judge from the extreme whiteness of his bare neck, his\r\nsmall, puffy hands, and his soft shoulders, one would conclude that\r\nhe possessed an effeminate body. Even when excited, his actions were\r\ngoverned by an unvarying gentleness, added to a lassitude that was not\r\ndevoid of a certain peculiar grace. On the other hand, should depression\r\nof spirits show itself in his face, His glance would grow dull, and\r\nhis brow furrowed, as doubt, despondency, and apprehension fell\r\nto contending with one another. Yet this crisis of emotion seldom\r\ncrystallized into the form of a definite idea--still less into that of\r\na fixed resolve. Almost always such emotion evaporated in a sigh, and\r\nshaded off into a sort of apathetic lethargy.\r\n\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s indoor costume corresponded exactly with the quiet outlines\r\nof his face and the effeminacy of his form. The costume in question\r\nconsisted of a dressing-gown of some Persian material--a real Eastern\r\ndressing-gown--a garment that was devoid both of tassels and velvet\r\nfacings and a waist, yet so roomy that Oblomov might have wrapped\r\nhimself in it once or twice over. Also, in accordance with the immutable\r\ncustom of Asia, its sleeves widened steadily from knuckles to shoulder.\r\nTrue, it was a dressing-gown which had lost its pristine freshness, and\r\nhad, in places, exchanged its natural, original sheen for one acquired\r\nby hard wear; yet still it retained both the clarity of its Oriental\r\ncolouring and the soundness of its texture. In Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s eyes It was a\r\ngarment possessed of a myriad invaluable qualities, for it was so soft\r\nand pliable that, when wearing it, the body was unaware of its presence,\r\nand, like an obedient slave, it answered even to the slightest movement.\r\nNeither waistcoat nor cravat did Oblomov wear when indoors, since he\r\nloved freedom and space. For the same reason his slippers were long,\r\nsoft, and broad, to the end that, whenever he lowered his legs from the\r\nbed to the floor without looking at what he was doing, his feet might\r\nfit into the slippers at once.\r\n\r\nWith Oblomov, lying in bed was neither a necessity (as in the case of an\r\ninvalid or of a man who stands badly in need of sleep ) nor an accident\r\n(as in the case of a man who is feeling worn out) nor a gratification\r\n(as in the case of a man who is purely lazy). Rather, it represented his\r\nnormal condition. Whenever he was at home--and almost always he was at\r\nhome--he would spend his time in lying on his back. Likewise he used but\r\nthe one room--which was combined to serve both as bedroom, as study, and\r\nas reception-room--in which we have just discovered him. True, two other\r\nrooms lay at his disposal, but seldom did he look into them save on\r\nmornings (which did not comprise by any means every morning) when his\r\nold valet happened to be sweeping out the study. The furniture in them\r\nstood perennially covered over, and never were the blinds drawn up.\r\n\r\nAt first sight the room in which Oblomov was lying was a well-fitted\r\none. In it there stood a writing-table of redwood, a couple of sofas,\r\nupholstered in some silken material, and a handsome screen that was\r\nembroidered with birds and fruits unknown to Nature.\r\n\r\nAlso the room contained silken curtains, a few mats, some pictures,\r\nbronzes, and pieces of china, and a multitude of other pretty trifles.\r\nYet even the most cursory glance from the experienced eye of a man\r\nof taste would have detected no more than a tendency to observe _les\r\nconvenances_ while escaping their actual observance. Without doubt that\r\nwas all that Oblomov had thought of when furnishing his study. Taste of\r\na really refined nature would never have remained satisfied with\r\nsuch ponderous, ungainly redwood chairs, with such rickety whatnots.\r\nMoreover, the back of one of the sofas had sagged, and, here and there,\r\nthe wood had come away from the glue. Much the same thing was to be seen\r\nin the case of the pictures, the vases, and certain other trifles of\r\nthe apartment. Nevertheless, its master was accustomed to regard its\r\nappurtenances with the cold, detached eye of one who would ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nhas dared to bring this stuff here?\xe2\x80\x9d The same indifference on his part,\r\nadded to, perhaps, an even greater indifference on the part of his\r\nservant, Zakhar, caused the study, when contemplated with attention, to\r\nstrike the beholder with an impression of all-prevailing carelessness\r\nand neglect. On the walls and around the pictures there hung cobwebs\r\ncoated with dust; the mirrors, instead of reflecting, would more\r\nusefully have served as tablets for recording memoranda; every mat was\r\nfreely spotted with stains; on the sofa there lay a forgotten towel, and\r\non the table (as on most mornings) a plate, a salt-cellar, a half-eaten\r\ncrust of bread, and some scattered crumbs--all of which had failed to\r\nbe cleared away after last night\xe2\x80\x99s supper. Indeed, were it not for the\r\nplate, for a recently smoked pipe that was propped against the bed, and\r\nfor the recumbent form of Oblomov himself, one might have imagined that\r\nthe place contained not a single living soul, so dusty and discoloured\r\ndid everything look, and so lacking were any active traces of the\r\npresence of a human being. True, on the whatnots there were two or three\r\nopen books, while a newspaper was tossing about, and the bureau bore\r\non its top an inkstand and a few pens; but the pages at which the books\r\nwere lying open were covered with dust and beginning to turn yellow\r\n(thus proving that they had long been tossed aside), the date of the\r\nnewspaper belonged to the previous year, and from the inkstand, whenever\r\na pen happened to be dipped therein, there arose, with a frightened\r\nbuzz, only a derelict fly.\r\n\r\nOn this particular morning Oblomov had (contrary to his usual custom)\r\nawakened at the early hour of eight. Somehow he looked perturbed;\r\nanxiety, regret, and vexation kept chasing one another across his\r\nfeatures. Evidently he had fallen a prey to some inward struggle, and\r\nhad not yet been able to summon his wits to the rescue. The fact of the\r\nmatter was that, overnight, he had received from the _starosta_ * of\r\nhis country estate an exceedingly unpleasant letter. We all know what\r\ndisagreeable things a _starosta_ can say in his letters--how he can\r\ntell of bad harvests, of arrears of debt, of diminished incomes, and so\r\nforth; and though this particular official had been inditing precisely\r\nsimilar epistles during the past three years, his latest communication\r\nhad affected its recipient as powerfully as though Oblomov had received\r\nan unlooked-for blow. Yet, to do Oblomov justice, he had always bestowed\r\na certain care upon his affairs. Indeed, no sooner had he received the\r\n_starosta\xe2\x80\x99s_ first disturbing letter (he had done so three years ago)\r\nthan he had set about devising a plan for changing and improving the\r\nadministration of his property. Yet to this day the plan in question\r\nremained not fully thought out, although long ago he had recognized the\r\nnecessity of doing something actually decisive.\r\n\r\n     *  Overseer or steward.\r\n\r\nConsequently, on awakening, he resolved to rise, to perform his\r\nablutions, and his tea consumed, to consider matters, to jot down a few\r\nnotes, and, in general, to tackle the affair properly. Yet for\r\nanother halfhour he lay prone under the torture of this resolve; until\r\neventually he decided that such tackling could best be done after tea,\r\nand that, as usual, he would drink that tea in bed--the more so since a\r\nrecumbent position could not prove a hindrance to thought.\r\n\r\nTherefore he did as he had decided; and when the tea had been consumed\r\nhe raised himself upon his elbow and arrived within an ace of getting\r\nout of bed. In fact, glancing at his slippers, he even began to extend a\r\nfoot in their direction, but presently withdrew it.\r\n\r\nHalf-past ten struck, and Oblomov gave himself a shake. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d he said vexedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all conscience \xe2\x80\x99tis time that I were\r\ndoing something! Would I could make up my mind to--to------\xe2\x80\x9d He broke\r\noff with a shout of \xe2\x80\x9cZakhar!\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon there entered an elderly man\r\nin a grey suit and brass buttons--a man who sported beneath a perfectly\r\nbald pate a pair of long, bushy, grizzled whiskers that would have\r\nsufficed to fit out three ordinary men with beards. His clothes, it is\r\ntrue, were cut according to a country pattern, but he cherished them as\r\na faint reminder of his former livery, as the one surviving token of the\r\ndignity of the house of Oblomov. The house of Oblomov was one which\r\nhad once been wealthy and distinguished, but which, of late years, had\r\nundergone impoverishment and diminution, until finally it had become\r\nlost among a crowd of noble houses of more recent creation.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Oblomov remained too plunged in thought to notice\r\nZakhar\xe2\x80\x99s presence; but at length the valet coughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou called me just now, _barin_?\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n     *  \xe2\x80\x9cMaster\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csir\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called you, you say? Well, I cannot remember why I did so. Return to\r\nyour room until I _have_ remembered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakliar retired, and Oblomov spent another quarter of an hour in\r\nthinking over the accursed letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lain here long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d at last he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, I\r\n_must_ rise.... But suppose I were to read the letter through carefully\r\nand _then_ to rise? Zakhar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar re-entered, and Oblomov straightway sank into a reverie. For a\r\nminute or two the valet stood eyeing his master with covert resentment.\r\nThen he moved towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, _barin_, you have nothing to say to me. Why should I stand\r\nhere for nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Have your legs become so shrunken that you cannot stand for a\r\nmoment or two? I am worried about something, so you _must_ wait. You\r\nhave just been lying down in your room, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you? Please search for\r\nthe letter which arrived from the _starosta_ last night. What have you\r\ndone with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter? _I_ have seen no letter,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Zakhar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you took it from the postman yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I did, but how am I to know where you have since placed it?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nvalet fussed about among the papers and other things on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know anything,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked his master. \xe2\x80\x9cLook in that basket\r\nthere. Or possibly the letter has fallen behind the sofa? By the way,\r\nthe back of that sofa has not yet been mended. Tell the joiner to\r\ncome at once. It was you that broke the thing, yet you never give it a\r\nthought!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did _not_ break it,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Zakhar. \xe2\x80\x9cIt broke of itself. It\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lasted for ever. It was bound to crack some day.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nwas a point which Oblomov did not care to contest. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you found the\r\nletter yet?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--several letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are not what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see no others,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Zakhar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d was Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s impatient reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI will get up and search\r\nfor the letter myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar retired to his room again, but had scarcely rested his hands\r\nagainst his pallet before stretching himself out, when once more there\r\ncame a peremptory shout of \xe2\x80\x9cZakhar! Zakhar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the valet as a third time he made for the study.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I be tormented in this fashion? I would rather be dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy handkerchief!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and very quickly, too! You\r\n_might_ have guessed that that is what I am wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar displayed no particular surprise or offence at this reproachful\r\ncommand. Probably he thought both the command and the reproach natural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows where the handkerchief is?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered as he made a tour of\r\nthe room and felt each chair (although he could not but have perceived\r\nthat on them there was nothing whatsoever lying). \xe2\x80\x9cYou lose everything,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added, opening the door into the parlour in order to see whether the\r\nhandkerchief might not be lurking _there_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis _here_ you must\r\nsearch. I have not been into those other rooms since the year before\r\nlast. Be quick, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no handkerchief,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zakhar, spreading out his hands and\r\npeering into every corner. \xe2\x80\x9c_There_ it is!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly he croaked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis just underneath you. I can see its end sticking out. You have\r\nbeen lying on it all the time, yet you actually ask me to find it!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhobbled away without waiting for an answer. For a moment or two Oblomov\r\nwas taken aback, but soon found another means of putting his valet in\r\nthe wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice way to do your cleaning!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of dust and dirt,\r\nto be sure! Look at those corners! You never bestir yourself at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I never bestir myself,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Zakhar offendedly, \xe2\x80\x9cat least I do\r\nmy best, and don\xe2\x80\x99t spare myself, for I dust and sweep almost every day.\r\nEverything looks clean and bright enough for a wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cBe off to your room again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat he had provoked Zakhar to engage in this conversation was a fact\r\nwhich gave him small pleasure. The truth was he had forgotten that, once\r\na delicate subject is touched upon, one cannot well avoid a fuss. Though\r\nhe wished his rooms to be kept clean, he wished this task to be carried\r\nout invisibly, and apart from himself; whereas, whenever Zakhar\r\nwas called upon to do even the least sweeping or dusting, he made a\r\ngrievance of it.\r\n\r\nAfter Zakhar had retired to his den Oblomov relapsed into thought,\r\nuntil, a few minutes later, the clock sounded a halfhour of some sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov in horror. \xe2\x80\x9cSoon the time will be eleven,\r\nyet I am not yet up and washed! Zakhar! Zakhar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre my washing things ready?\xe2\x80\x9d his master inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they have been ready a long time. Why do you not get up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why didn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ tell _me_ that the things are ready? Had you done\r\nthat, I should have risen long ago. Go along, and I will follow you;\r\nbut at the moment I must sit down and write a letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar left the room. Presently he reappeared with a much-bescribbled,\r\ngreasy account-book and a bundle of papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are going to write anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you would like\r\nto check these accounts at the same time? Some money is due to be paid\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat accounts? What money?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oblomov petulantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe accounts sent in by the butcher, the greengrocer, the laundress,\r\nand the baker. All are wanting their money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways money and worry!\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not give me the\r\naccounts at intervals instead of in a batch like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause each time you have sent me away, and then put matters off until\r\nthe morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _these_ accounts can wait until the morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they cannot, for the creditors are pressing, and say they are going\r\nto allow you nothing more on credit. To-day is the first of the month,\r\nyou must remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Fresh cares, fresh worries!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you\r\nstanding there? Lay the table, and I will rise, wash, and look into the\r\nwhole business. Is the water yet ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov raised himself and grunted as though he really intended to get\r\nout of bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zakhar, \xe2\x80\x9cwhilst you were still asleep the manager\r\nof the building sent the _dvornik_ * to say that soon you must quit the\r\nflat, since he wants it for some one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     *  Porter or doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. We must go. Why worry me about it? This is the third\r\ntime you have done so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they keep worrying _me_ about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell them that we intend to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar departed again, and Oblomov resumed his reverie. How long he\r\nwould have remained in this state of indecision it is impossible to say\r\nhad not a ring at the doorbell resounded through the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one has called, yet I am not yet up!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Oblomov as he\r\nslipped into his dressing-gown. \xe2\x80\x9cWho can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLying down again, he gazed furiously towards the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere entered a young fellow of about twenty-five. Beaming with health\r\nand irreproachably dressed to a degree which dazzled the eye with its\r\nimmaculateness of linen and gorgeousness of jewellery, he was a figure\r\ncalculated to excite envy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Volkov!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd good morning to you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the radiant gentleman, approaching\r\nthe bed and looking about him for a spot whereon to deposit a hat.\r\nHowever, perceiving only dust, he retained his headgear in his hand.\r\nNext he drew aside the skirts of his coat (preparatory to sitting down),\r\nbut a hasty inspection of the nearest chair convinced him that he had\r\nfar better remain standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are not yet up?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why on earth are you wearing a\r\n_nightshirt?_ They have quite gone out of fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis not a nightshirt, it is a dressinggown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov, nestling\r\nlovingly into the ample folds of the garment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s. Do you think this frock-coat a nice one?\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nturned himself round and round for Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s inspection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid! Made with excellent taste!\xe2\x80\x9d was the verdict. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly why is it\r\nso broad behind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better to ride in it. It is a riding-coat. I ordered it for to-day\r\nfor the reason that this is the first of May and I am to go to the\r\nEkaterinhov * with Gorunov. He has just got his promotion, and we intend\r\nto cut a dash on the strength of it. He has a roan horse--all the horses\r\nin his regiment are roans--and I a black. How are _you_ going-in a\r\ncarriage or on foot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy neither method,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? To-day is the first of May, and you are not going to the\r\nEkaterinhov? Why, _every one_ will be there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite every one,\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov lazily remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _must_ go, though. Sophia Nikolaevna and Lydia will be occupying\r\ntwo of the seats in our carriage, but the seat facing them will be\r\nvacant. Come with us, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not intend to occupy the vacant seat. What sort of a figure\r\nshould _I_ cut on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if you like, Mischa Gorunov shall lend you a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what is the fellow thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov as though to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow come you and the Gorunov family to be so friendly with one\r\nanother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your word of honour not to repeat what I may tell you, and I\r\nwill explain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerewith I give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I am in love with Lydia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid! Have you been in love with her long? She seems a charming\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in love with her for three weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Volkov, with a\r\nsigh. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mischa, for his part, is in love with Dashenka.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Dashenka?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You do not know Dashenka? Why, the whole town is raving over\r\nher dancing. To-night I am going to the Opera with Mischa, and he is to\r\nthrow her a bouquet. Well, I must be off to buy the necessary camelias\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back, then, and take lunch with me. I should like to have a talk\r\nwith you, for I have just experienced two misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, I fear, for I am lunching with Prince Tiumenev. All the\r\nGorunova--yes, and Lydia, too--are to be there. What a cheerful house\r\nit is! And so is Tiumenev\xe2\x80\x99s country place. I have heard that it is to be\r\nthe scene of numberless dances and tableaux this summer. Are you likely\r\nto be one of the guests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--I think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hospitality the Prince dispenses! This winter his guests averaged\r\nfifty, and sometimes a hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow wearisome the whole thing must have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Wearisome? Why, the more the merrier. Lydia, too, used to be\r\nthere--though in those days I never so much as noticed her. In fact,\r\nnever once did I do so until one day I found myself \xe2\x80\x98vainly trying\r\nto forget her, vainly pitting reason in the lists with love.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Volkov\r\nhummed the concluding words, and seated himself carelessly upon a chair.\r\nAlmost instantly he leaped to his feet again, and blushed the dust from\r\nhis trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat quantities of dirt you keep everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nZakhar\xe2\x80\x99s fault, not mine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now I must be off, as it is absolutely necessary that I should\r\nbuy those camelias for Mischa\xe2\x80\x99s bouquet. _Au revoir!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and have tea after the opera, and tell me all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is impossible, for I am promised to supper at the Musinskis\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nIt is their reception day, you know. However, meet me there, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npresent you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is toward at the Musinskis\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, indeed? Why, entertainment in a house where you hear all the\r\nnews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike everything else, it would bore me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go and call upon the Mezdrovs, where the talk centres upon one\r\ntopic, and one topic alone--the arts. Of nothing else will you hear but\r\nthe Venetian School. Beethoven, Bach, Leonardo da Vinci, and so forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of them boring subjects!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov with a yawn. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of\r\npedants the Mezdrovs must be! Do you never get tired of running about\r\nfrom house to house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired? Why should I? Every morning  like to go out and learn the news,\r\nthank God, my official duties never require my actual presence, save\r\ntwice a week, when they consist of lunching with and doing the civil to\r\nthe General. * After that I proceed to call upon any people upon whom\r\nI have not called for a long while. Next there will be some new\r\nactress--whether at the Russian theatre or at the French. Besides,\r\nalways there is the Opera, to which I am a subscriber. Furthermore, I am\r\nin love, and Mischa is about to enjoy a month\xe2\x80\x99s leave from his regiment,\r\nand the summer is on the point of beginning, and Mischa and I intend to\r\nretire to his country house for a change of air. We shall have plenty of\r\nsport there, since he possesses excellent neighbours and they give _bals\r\nchamp\xc3\xaatres_. Also I shall be able to escort Lydia for walks through\r\nthe woods, and to row her about in a boat, and to pluck flowers for her\r\nbenefit. At the present moment I must leave you. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     *  In this case the term \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral\xe2\x80\x9d denotes a civil grade\r\n     corresponding to the military rank of the same title.\r\n\r\nRising, he endeavoured to look at himself in a dust-coated mirror; after\r\nwhich he departed--though returning once more to show his friend the\r\nnewest thing in Parisian gloves and an Easter card which Prince Tiumenev\r\nhad recently sent him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a life!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Oblomov, with a shrug of his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ngood can a man get out of it? It is merely a squandering and a wasting\r\nof his all. Of course, an _occasional_ look into a theatre is not a\r\nbad thing, nor is being in love--for Lydia is a delightful girl, and\r\npursuits like plucking flowers with her and rowing her about in a boat\r\neven I should enjoy; but to have to be in ten different places every\r\nday, as Volkov has----!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned over on his back and congratulated himself that _he_ at least\r\ncherished no vain social aspirations. \xe2\x80\x99Twas better to lie where he was\r\nand to preserve both his nerves and his human dignity....\r\n\r\nAnother ring at the doorbell interrupted his reflections. This time the\r\nvisitor turned out to be a gentleman in a dark frock-coat with crested\r\nbuttons whose most prominent features were a clean-shaven chin, a pair\r\nof black whiskers around a haggard (but quiet and sensible) face, and a\r\nthoughtful smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, Sudbinski!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day to _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a long time since I\r\nlast saw you, but you know what this devilish Civil Service means. Look\r\nat that bagful of reports which I have brought with me! And not only\r\nthat, but I have had to leave word at the office that a messenger will\r\nfind me here should I be wanted. Never do I get a single moment to\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you were on the way to your office? How come you to be going so\r\nlate? Your usual hour used to be nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _used_ to be nine, but now I go at twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see: you have recently been made the head of a department. Since\r\nwhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince Easter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sudbinski, with a meaning nod. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what a\r\nlot of work! It is terrible! From eight to twelve in the morning I am\r\nslaving at home; from twelve to five at the Chancellory; and all the\r\nevening at home again. I have quite lost touch with my acquaintances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and lunch with me to-day, and we will drink to your promotion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to-day I am lunching with the Vice-Director, as well as have\r\na report to prepare by Thursday. You see, one _cannot_ rely upon\r\nprovincial advices, but must verify every return personally. Are you\r\ngoing to the Ekaterinhov to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for I am not very well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov, knitting his brows.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, like yourself, I have some work to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sudbinski; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is a fine day, and the only\r\nday on which I myself can hope for a little rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what news have you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a good deal-of a sort. We are required no longer to write at the\r\nend of our official letters \xe2\x80\x98Your humble servant,\xe2\x80\x99 but merely \xe2\x80\x98Accept\r\nthe assurance of my profound respect.\xe2\x80\x99 Also we have been told that we\r\nare to cease to make out formal documents in duplicate. Likewise,\r\nour office has just been allotted three new tables and a couple of\r\nconfidential clerks. Lastly, the Commission has now concluded its\r\nsittings. _There\xe2\x80\x99s_ a budget of news for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what of our old comrades?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at present, except that Svinkin has lost his case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think that you work from eight to twelve, and from twelve to\r\nfive, and again in the evening! Dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what should I do if I were _not_ in the Service?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nSudbinski.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would just read and write on your own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not given to every one to be a _litt\xc3\xa9rateur_. For example,\r\nyou yourself write nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for I have some property on my hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov with a sigh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am working out a new system for it; I am going to introduce\r\nreforms of various kinds. The affair worries me terribly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for my part, I _must_ work, in order to make a little money.\r\nBesides, I am to be married this coming autumn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! And to whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mademoiselle Murashina. Do you remember their country villa, next to\r\nmine? I think you came to tea with me and met her there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have no recollection of it. Is she pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, charming. Suppose, one day, we go to lunch with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a pause; \xe2\x80\x9conly----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about next week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Next week let it be. But at the moment I have no suitable\r\nclothes. Is your _fianc\xc3\xaae_ a financial catch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for her father is a State councillor, and intends to give her ten\r\nthousand roubles, as well as to let us have half his official house (a\r\nhouse of twelve rooms--the whole being furnished, heated, and lighted at\r\nthe public expense); so we ought to do very well. Herewith I invite you\r\nto be my best man at the wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more the doorbell rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sudbinski. \xe2\x80\x9cI am annoyed that, as I surmise, I should\r\nbe wanted at the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen stay where you are,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cI desire your advice, for two\r\nmisfortunes have just befallen me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I had better come and see you another day.\xe2\x80\x9d And Sudbinski took\r\nhis leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlunged up to the ears in work, good \xe2\x80\x98friend!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Oblomov as he\r\nwatched him depart. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and blind and deaf and dumb to everything else\r\nin the world! _Yet by going into society and at the same time,\r\nbusying yourself about your affairs you will yet__win distinction, and\r\npromotion. Such is what they call \xe2\x80\x98a career\xe2\x80\x99! Yet of how_ little use\r\nis a man like that! His intellect, his will, his feelings--what do they\r\navail him? So many luxuries is what they are--nothing more. Such an\r\nindividual lives out his little span without achieving a single thing\r\nworth mentioning; and meanwhile he works in an office from morning till\r\nnight--yes, from morning till night, poor wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly a modicum of quiet satisfaction was to be derived from the\r\nthought that from nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock until three, and from eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock until\r\nnine on the following day, he, Oblomov, could remain lying prone on\r\na sofa instead of having to trot about with reports and to inscribe\r\nmultitudes of documents. Yes, he preferred, rather, leisure for the\r\nindulgence of his feelings and imagination. Plunged in a philosophical\r\nreverie, he overlooked the fact that by his bedside there was standing a\r\nman whose lean, dark face was almost covered with a pair of whiskers,\r\na moustache, and an imperial. Also the new-comer\xe2\x80\x99s dress was studied in\r\nits negligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Oblomov,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Penkin,\xe2\x80\x9d was the response. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to show you a\r\nletter which I have just received from my _starnsta_. Whence have you\r\nsprung?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the newsagent\xe2\x80\x99s, near by. I went to see if the papers are yet out.\r\nHave you read my latest article?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you ought to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it about?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov asked with a faint yawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout trade, about the emancipation of women, about the beautiful\r\nApril days with which we have been favoured, and about the newly formed\r\nfire-brigade. How come you not to have read that article? In it you will\r\nsee portrayed the whole of our daily life. Over and above anything else,\r\nyou will read therein an argument in favour of the present realistic:\r\ntendency in literature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you no other work on hand?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a good deal. I write two newspaper articles a week, besides\r\nreviewing a number of books. In addition, I have just finished a tale of\r\nmy own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is _it_ about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt tells how, in a certain town, the governor used to beat the citizens\r\nwith his own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe realistic tendency, right enough!\xe2\x80\x9d commented Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the delighted _litt\xc3\xa9rateur_. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my tale (which is\r\nnovel and daring in its idea) a traveller witnesses a beating of this\r\nkind, seeks an interview with the governor of the province, and lays\r\nbefore him a complaint. At once the said governor of the province orders\r\nan official who happens to be proceeding to that town for the purpose of\r\nconducting another investigation to inquire also into the truth of\r\nthe complaint just laid, and likewise to collect evidence as to the\r\ncharacter and behaviour of the local administrator. The official in\r\nquestion calls together the local citizens, on the pretext of a trade\r\nconference, and incidentally sounds them concerning the other matter.\r\nAnd what do you suppose they do? They merely smile, present their\r\ncompliments, and load the governor of the town with praises! Thereafter\r\nthe official makes extraneous inquiries, and is informed that the said\r\ncitizens are rogues who trade in rotten merchandise, give underweight,\r\ncheat the Treasury, and indulge in wholesale immorality; wherefore the\r\nbeatings have been a just retribution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you intend the assaults committed by the governor to figure in the\r\nstory as the _fatum_ of the old tragedians?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Penkin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have great quickness of apprehension, and\r\nought yourself to tackle the writing of stories. Yes, it has always been\r\nmy idea to expose the arbitrariness of our local governors, the decline\r\nof morality among the masses, the faulty organization existing among our\r\nsubordinate officials, and the necessity of drastic, but legal, measures\r\nto counterbalance these evils. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a novel idea for a story, is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; and to me who read so little a _peculiarly_ novel one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, I have never once seen you with a book in your hand.\r\nNevertheless, I beseech you to read a poem which, I may say, is shortly\r\nto appear. It is called \xe2\x80\x98The Love of a Blackmailer for a Fallen Woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe identity ol the author I am not at liberty to disclose--at all\r\nevents _yet_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray give me an idea of this poem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt exposes, as you will see, the whole mechanism of the social\r\nmovement--but a mechanism that is painted only in poetic colours. Each\r\nspring of that engine is touched upon, and each degree of the social\r\nscale held up to the light. We see summoned to the bar, as it were, a\r\nweak, but vicious, lord, with a swarm of blackmailers who are engaged\r\nin cheating him. Also various categories of fallen women are\r\ndissected--French women, German women, and others; the whole being done\r\nwith vivid and striking verisimilitude. Certain extracts from the poem\r\nhave come to my ears, and I may say that the author is a great man--one\r\nhears in him the notes both of Dante and of Shakespeare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whence has he originated?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov, leaning forward in\r\nastonishment; but Penkin, perceiving that he had now said too much,\r\nmerely repeated that Oblomov must read the poem, and judge for himself.\r\nThis Oblomov declined to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Penkin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing will make a great stir and be much\r\ntalked about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well: _let_ people talk. \xe2\x80\x99Tis all some folks have to do. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\ntheir _m\xc3\xa9tier_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, read it yourself, for curiosity\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I not seen in books!\xe2\x80\x9d commented the other. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely folk must\r\nwrite such things merely to amuse themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; even as I do. At the same time, what truth, what verisimilitude,\r\ndo you not find in books! How powerfully some of them move one through\r\nthe vivid portraiture which they contain! Whomsoever these authors\r\ntake--a _tchinovnik_, * an officer, or a blackmailer--they paint them as\r\nliving creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     *  Government official.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what have those authors to worry about, seeing that if, as you say,\r\none chooses to take a given model for amusement\xe2\x80\x99s sake, the picture is\r\nsure to succeed? Yet no: real life is _not_ to be described like that.\r\nIn a system of that kind there is no understanding or sympathy, nor a\r\nparticle of what we call humanity. \xe2\x80\x99Tis all self-conceit--no more.\r\nFolk describe thieves and fallen women as though they were apprehending\r\nthem in the streets and taking them to prison. Never in the tales of\r\nsuch writers is the note of \xe2\x80\x98hidden tears\xe2\x80\x99 to be detected--only that of\r\ngross, manifest malice and love of ridicule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what more would you have? You yourself have said (and very aptly\r\nso) that seething venom, a taste for bilious incitement to vice, and a\r\nsneering contempt for the fallen are the only ingredients needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not the only ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov, firing up. \xe2\x80\x9cPicture a thief or a\r\nfallen woman or a cheated fool, if you like, but do not forget the rest\r\nof mankind. What about humanity, pray? Writers like yourself try to\r\nwrite only with the head. What? Do you suppose the intellect can work\r\nseparately from the heart? Why, the intellect needs _love_ to fertilize\r\nit. Rather, stretch out your hand to the fallen and raise him weep over\r\nhim if he is lost beyond recall, but in no case make sport of him, for\r\nhe is one to whom there should be extended only compassion. See in him\r\nyourself, and act accordingly. That done, I will read you, and bow\r\nmy head before you. But in the writings of the school of which I have\r\nspoken, what art, what poetical colouring, are you able to discover?\r\nShould you elect to paint debauchery and the mire, at least do so\r\nwithout making any claim to poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You bid me depict nature--roses, nightingales, a winter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmorning, and all that sort of thing--when things like _these_ are\r\nseething and whirling around us? Nay, we need, rather, the bare\r\nphysiology of society. No longer are love songs required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me man, and man alone.\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, having given me him,\r\ndo you try to love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What?_ To love the usurer, the hypocrite, the peculating and stupid\r\nofficial? Why should I do that? \xe2\x80\x99tis evident you have had little\r\nexperience of literature! Such fellows want punishing--want turning out\r\nof the civic circle and the community.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the civic circle and the community,\xe2\x80\x99 you say?\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated\r\nOblomov with a gasp as he rose and stood before Penkin. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\ntantamount to saying that once in that faulty vessel there dwelt the\r\nsupreme element--that, ruined though the man may be, he is still a human\r\nbeing, as even are you and I. Turn him out, indeed! _How_ are you going\r\nto turn him out of the circle of humanity, out of the bosom of Nature,\r\nout of the mercy of God?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov came near to shouting as he said this,\r\nand his eyes were blazing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow excited you have grown!\xe2\x80\x9d said Penkin in astonishment; whereupon\r\neven Oblomov realized that he had gone too far. He pulled himself up,\r\nyawned slightly, and stretched himself out sluggishly upon the sofa. For\r\na while silence reigned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of books do you mostly read?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Penkin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBooks of travel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you read the poem when it has come out?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Penkin. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nso, I will bring you a copy of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor my story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov signified assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. Now I must be off to press,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Penkin. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nknow why I came to see you to-day? I came because I wanted to propose\r\nto you a visit to the Ekaterinhov. I have a conveyance of my own and,\r\ninasmuch as, to-morrow, I must write an article on current events, I\r\nthought we might jointly look over my notes on the subject, and you\r\nmight advise me as to any point omitted. We should enjoy the expedition,\r\nI think. Let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov with a frown, covering himself with\r\nthe bedclothes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you might come and lunch with me to-day, and _then_\r\ntalk. I have just experienced a couple of misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! The whole of our staff is to lunch at St. George\xe2\x80\x99s, * I fear,\r\nand then to go on to the festival. Also, at night I have my article to\r\nwrite, and the printer must receive the manuscript by daylight at the\r\nlatest. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     *  A smart restaurant in Petrograd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98At night I have my article to write,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d mused Oblomov after his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s departure. \xe2\x80\x9cThen when does he sleep? However, he is making some\r\nfive thousand roubles a year, so his work is so much bread and butter\r\nto him. Yet to think of being continually engaged in writing, in wasting\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s intellect upon trifles, in changing one\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, in offering\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s brain and one\xe2\x80\x99s imagination for sale, in doing violence to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown nature, in giving way to ebullitions of enthusiasm--and the whole\r\nwithout a single moment\xe2\x80\x99s rest, or the calling of a single halt! Yes,\r\nto think of being forced to go on writing, writing, like the wheel of\r\na machine--writing to-morrow, writing the day after, writing though the\r\nsummer is approaching and holidays keep passing one by! Does he _never_\r\nstop to draw breath, the poor wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov glanced at the table,\r\nwhere everything lay undisturbed, and the ink had become dried up, and\r\nnot a pen was to be seen; and as he looked he rejoiced to think that\r\n_he_ was lying there as careless as a newborn baby--not worrying at all,\r\nnor seeking to offer anything for sale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what of the _starosta\xe2\x80\x99s_ letter and the notice to quit?\xe2\x80\x9d Yes,\r\nsuddenly he had remembered these things; and once more he became\r\nabsorbed in thought.\r\n\r\nAgain the doorbell rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is every one seeking me out today?\xe2\x80\x9d he wondered as he waited to\r\nsee who next should enter. This time the new-comer proved to be a man of\r\nuncertain age--of the age when it is difficult to guess the exact number\r\nof years. Also, he was neither handsome nor ugly, neither tall nor\r\nshort, neither fair nor dark. In short, he was a man whom Nature had\r\ndowered with no sharp-cut, distinguishing features, whether good or bad,\r\nmental or physical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov as he greeted him. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it is you, Alexiev? Whence are\r\nyou come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell the truth. I had not thought to call upon you to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe visitor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut by chance I met Ovchinin, and he carried me off to his\r\nquarters, whither I, in my turn, have now come to convey _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo convey me to, to----?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Ovchinin\xe2\x80\x99s. Already Alianov, Pchailo, and Kolhniagin are there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why have they collected together? And what do they want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOvchinin desires you to lunch with him, and then to accompany him and\r\nthe rest of us to the Ekaterinhov. Likewise he has instructed me to\r\nwarn you to hire a conveyance. Come, get up! \xe2\x80\x99Tis fully time you were\r\ndressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to dress? I have not yet washed myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do so at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that Alexiev fell to pacing the room. Presently he halted before a\r\npicture which he had seen a thousand times before; then he glanced once\r\nor twice out of the window, took from a whatnot an article of some sort,\r\nturned it over in his hands, looked at it from every point of view, and\r\nreplaced the same. That done, he resumed his pacing and whistling--the\r\nwhole being designed to avoid hindering Oblomov from rising and\r\nperforming his ablutions. Ten minutes passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alexiev suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, why are you still in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you. Is it _really_ necessary that I should get up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is necessary, for they are waiting for us. Besides, you\r\nsaid that you would like to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go where? I have no such desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this moment you said we would go and lunch at Ovchinin\xe2\x80\x99s, and then\r\nproceed to the Ekatennhov!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I cannot. It would mean my going out into the damp. Besides, rain\r\nis coming on. The courtyard looks quite dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a matter of fact, not a single cloud is in the sky, and the\r\ncourtyard looks dark only because you never have your windows washed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, have I yet told you of my\r\nmisfortunes--of the letter from my _starosta_, and of the notice given\r\nme to quit this flat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Alexiev. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe document not being immediately forthcoming, Zakhar was summoned to\r\nsearch for it; and after it had been discovered beneath the counterpane\r\nOblomov read it to his friend--though passing over certain greetings,\r\nadded to inquiries as to the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s health. The gist of the epistle\r\nwas that the bulk of the crops on Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s estate were likely to fail\r\nfor want of rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alexiev. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must never give way to despair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would _you_ do in my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should first of all consider matters. Never ought one to come to a\r\nhasty decision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrumpling the letter in his hands, Oblomov leaned forward with his elbows\r\non his knees, and remained in that posture for a considerable time--his\r\nbrain flooded with disturbing reflections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Schtoltz would come!\xe2\x80\x9d at length he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has written\r\nthat he is about to do so, but God knows what has happened to him! _He_\r\ncould solve the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the doorbell rang with such vehemence that both men started,\r\nand Zakhar came hurrying out of his pantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe next moment there entered the room a tall, loosely built man who\r\nevidently did not believe in refinement of costume, nor was in any way\r\nashamed of the fact. This was Mikhei Andreievitch Tarantiev, a native\r\nof the same district as Oblomov. Though an individual of rough, sullen\r\nmien, and of rather an overbearing manner, he did not lack a certain\r\nkeen ruggedness of wit; nor could any one be a better judge of mundane\r\nquestions in general, nor a better resolver of tangled juridical\r\nproblems (though usually he behaved rudely to the person who had sought\r\nhis advice on these matters). Nevertheless, his abilities stopped short\r\nat a talent for verbal exposition; and no sooner was he called upon to\r\ntransmit a theory into action than his whole bearing underwent a change,\r\nand in every case he discovered practical difficulties in the way of\r\nwhat he conceived to be the best course to take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said brusquely as he extended a hairy hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndo you mean by lying in bed like a log? Presently it will be twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, yet you are sprawling about on your back!\xe2\x80\x9d The other\r\nforestalled him by hurriedly slipping his feet into his slippers, or the\r\nnew-comer would have pulled him out of bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just about to rise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I know how you rise--how you go rolling about until lunch-time!\r\nZakhar, come and help your master to dress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar entered and glared at Tarantiev. Raising himself on his elbow,\r\nOblomov stepped from the bed like a man who is thoroughly worn out, and,\r\ndropping into an arm-chair, sat there without moving, Meanwhile Zakhar\r\npomaded, parted, and combed his master\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and then asked him if he\r\ndesired to wash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wait a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! So _you_ are here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tarantiev suddenly as he turned to\r\nAlexiev. \xe2\x80\x9cI had not seen you. By the way, what a swine is that kinsman\r\nof yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ kinsman?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Alexiev with a stare. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not possess a\r\nsingle relative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean Athanasiev. Surely he is a relative of yours? I _know_ he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Alexiev, not Athanasiev,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I repeat that\r\nI do not possess a single relative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is just like you an ugly man, as well as (like yourself, again)\r\na man of the name of Vassili Nikolaitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless he is no kinsman of mine. Besides, my first names are Ivan\r\nand Alexeitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is exactly _like_ you, and a swine besides. You can tell him\r\nthat when next you meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI neither possess his acquaintance nor have ever set eyes upon him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Alexiev, opening his snuffbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a pinch,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Tarantiev. \xe2\x80\x9cYou use the plain stuff, and not\r\nthe French, do you? Why not use the French? Never have I seen a swine\r\nlike that relative of yours. On one occasion I borrowed of him fifty\r\nroubles. That was two years ago. And fifty roubles are not a very\r\nlarge sum, are they? They are a sum which he might well have forgotten,\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Yes, he very well might. But as a matter of fact, he\r\nremembered it. Not a month had passed before he took to saying, whenever\r\nhe met me: \xe2\x80\x98How about that debt?\xe2\x80\x99 I assure you I found him a perfect\r\nnuisance! And only yesterday he walked into our office, and said to me:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I expect you have just received your salary, and are therefore in a\r\nposition to repay me?\xe2\x80\x99 Well, I handed him over my salary, even though\r\nhe had come there for the express purpose of shaming me in public. I\r\nhad much ado not to put him out of the door. \xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow, you need the\r\nmoney, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 As though I had _not_ needed it! Am I such a rich man\r\nthat I should quietly let him pouch fifty roubles? Oblomov, hand me a\r\ncigar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cigars are in that box there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov, pointing to a whatnot.\r\nHe was still posed in his usual lazy but becoming attitude--he was still\r\ntaking no notice whatever of what was being done or said around him, but\r\ncontemplating his small white hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a rubbishy weed!\xe2\x80\x9d Tarantiev remarked, after sending out a puff of\r\ntobacco smoke and inhaling another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have come too early in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Oblomov with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am boring you, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I was merely making a remark. Usually you arrive at lunch-time, but\r\nto-day you have come an hour beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come an hour beforehand because I wish to find out what there\r\nis likely to be to eat at dinner. As a rule you provide such rubbishy\r\nstuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go into the kitchen and inquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTaramiev departed for the purpose,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are to have beef and veal,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, on returning. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, friend\r\nOblomov, though a landowner, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the smallest notion how to\r\nlive. Your _m\xc3\xa9nage_ is the _m\xc3\xa9nage_ of a tradesman. Have you bought that\r\nMadeira yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov, scarcely noticing what had been said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better inquire of Zakhar. At all events there will be some sort\r\nof wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? The rubbishy old stuff which you bought of a German dealer? You\r\nought to go to the English Store for your wines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Please send to the Store for some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney first, please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov fumbled in a cashbox, and produced therefrom a ten-rouble, note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadeira costs seven roubles the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are ten\r\nroubles. You will be given change at the Store.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTarantiev hastened to cram the note into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikewise, do you feel like hiring a conveyance and going to the\r\nEkaterinhov today?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cIf so, you might take me with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have met with two misfortunes,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, I\r\nam to be turned out of this fiat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid your rent, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is _not_ the reason. I always pay in advance. Tell me what had\r\nbetter be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho made _me_ your adviser? Do you think I give advice for nothing? Ask\r\n_him_, rather\xe2\x80\x9d--and Tarantiev pointed to Alexiev--\xe2\x80\x9cor else that kinsman\r\nof his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Tell me what I ought to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should advise you to move to another flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have said that myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the flat of a friend of mine in the Veaborg Quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nTarantiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? To a flat in the Veaborg Quarter? In winter the whole district is\r\noverrun with wolves!\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n     * The Veaborg Quarter is one of the most outlying suburbs of\r\n     Petrograd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, at times they come there from the Neva Islands, but my friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse has high walls to it, and, in addition, she and her family and a\r\nbachelor brother are nice people, and not like that fellow over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He pointed to Alexiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has all this to do with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell\r\nyou I am _not_ going to move there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fool!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tarantiev. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that house you would be much\r\nquieter and more comfortable than you are here, and you would pay less,\r\nand you would have larger quarters. Besides, it is a more respectable\r\nplace than this. Here one has to sit at a dirty table on which the\r\npepper-pot is empty, the vinegar bottle the same, the knives are not\r\nclean, the tablecloth is falling to pieces, and dust, dust, dust, lies\r\neverywhere. Give me my cab-fare, and I will go and secure you the flat\r\nat once. Then you can move into it to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d Tarantiev started to\r\nleave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I am _not_ going to the Veaborg\r\nQuarter. Pray exercise your wits in contriving how I may remain where I\r\nam. Moreover, I have a still more important affair on hand. That is to\r\nsay, I have just received from my _starosta_ a letter concerning which I\r\nshould be glad of your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he searched for the document, found it after some difficulty,\r\nand read it aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you hear what the _starosta_ says as to drought and a failure of the\r\ncrops? What ought I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prime necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tarantiev, \xe2\x80\x9cis complete quiet for you.\r\nThat you would get at the house of the friend of whom I have just\r\nspoken; and I could come to see you every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what about this affair of the\r\n_starosta?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _starosta_ is lying. He is a thief and a rogue. Why, I know an\r\nestate, only fifty versts from yours, where the harvest of last year was\r\nso good that it cleared the owner completely of debt. That being so,\r\nwhy have the crops on _your_ estate threatened to fail? Clearly the\r\n_starosta_ is a robber. If I were there I\xe2\x80\x99d teach him! Do you suppose\r\nthis letter to be a natural, an honest one? No, no more than we\r\ncan suppose that that sheep\xe2\x80\x99s head over there he pointed to Alexiev\r\nagain--\xe2\x80\x9cis capable of writing an honest letter, or his kinsman either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom am I to appoint in the _starosta\xe2\x80\x99s_ place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother man might prove even worse than he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou yourself had better go to the estate, and stay there for the\r\nsummer, and then move into my friend\xe2\x80\x99s house. _I_ will see that her\r\nrooms shall be ready for you--yes, I will see to it at once. Personally,\r\nI should have sold that property of yours, and bought another. Hand it\r\nover to me, and I will very soon make the folk there aware that I am\r\nalive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe upshot of it was that Oblomov accorded a half-hearted consent to\r\nTarantiev\xe2\x80\x99s procuring him a new lodging, and also to his writing to the\r\ngovernor of the district where his (Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s) property was situated.\r\nAfter that Tarantiev departed, stating that he would return to dinner at\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nWith Tarantiev\xe2\x80\x99s departure a calm of ten minutes reigned in the\r\napartment. Oblomov was feeling greatly upset, both by the _starostas_\r\nletter and by the prospect of the impending removal. Also, the\r\ntumultuous Tarantiev had thoroughly tired him out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not sit down and write the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alexiev. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nwish I will clean the inkstand for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClean it, and the Lord bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me write the\r\nletter alone, and then you shall fair-copy it after dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Alexiev. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now I must be off, or I shall be\r\ndelaying the Ekaterinhov party. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov did not heed him, but, sinking back into a recumbent position in\r\nthe armchair, relapsed into a state of meditative lethargy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nZakhar, after closing the dour successively behind Tarantiev and\r\nAlexiev, stood expecting to receive a summons from his master, inasmuch\r\nas he had overheard the fact that the latter had undertaken to write a\r\nletter. But in Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s study all remained silent as the tomb. Zakhar\r\npeeped through the chink of the door, and perceived that his master was\r\nlying prone on the sofa, with his head resting on the palm of his hand.\r\nThe valet entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you lain down again?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not disturb me: cannot you see that I am reading?\xe2\x80\x9d was Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabrupt reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but you ought to wash, and then to write that letter,\xe2\x80\x9d urged\r\nZakhar, determined not to be shaken on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose I ought. I will do so presently. Just now I am engaged\r\nin thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, he _did_ read a page of the book which was lying\r\nopen--a page which had turned yellow with a month\xe2\x80\x99s exposure. That done,\r\nhe laid it down and yawned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow it all wearies me!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, stretching, and then drawing\r\nup, his legs. Glancing at the ceiling as once more he relapsed into a\r\nvoluptuous state of coma, he said to himself with momentary sternness:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--business first.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he rolled over, and clasped his hands behind\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nAs he lay there he thought of his plans for improving his property.\r\nSwiftly he passed in review certain grave and fundamental schemes\r\naffecting his plough-land and its taxation; after which he elaborated a\r\nnew and stricter course to be taken against laziness and vagrancy on the\r\npart of the peasantry, and then passed to sundry ideas for ordering his\r\nown life in the country.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he became engrossed in a design for a new house. Eagerly\r\nhe lingered over a probable disposition of the rooms, and fixed in\r\nhis mind the dimensions of the dining-room and the billiard-room, and\r\ndetermined which way the windows of his study must face. Indeed, he even\r\ngave a thought to the furniture and to the carpets. Next, he designed\r\na wing for the building, calculated the number of guests whom that\r\nwing would accommodate, and set aside proper sites for the stables, the\r\ncoachhouses, and the servants\xe2\x80\x99 quarters. Finally he turned his attention\r\nto the garden. The old lime and oak-trees should all be left as they\r\nwere, but the apple-trees and pear-trees should be done away with, and\r\nsucceeded by acacias. Also, he gave a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration to the idea\r\nof a park, but, after calculating the cost of its upkeep, came to the\r\nconclusion that such a luxury would prove too expensive--wherefore he\r\npassed to the designing of orangeries and aviaries.\r\n\r\nSo vividly did these attractive visions of the future development of\r\nhis estate flit before his eyes that he came to fancy himself already\r\nsettled there, and engaged in witnessing the result of several years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworking of his schemes.\r\n\r\nOn a fair summer\xe2\x80\x99s evening he seemed to be sitting at a tea-table on the\r\nterrace of Oblomovka--sitting under a canopy of leafy shade which the\r\nsun was powerless to penetrate. From a long pipe in his hand he was\r\nlazily inhaling smoke, and revelling both in the delightful view which\r\nstretched beyond the circle of the trees and in the coolness and the\r\nquiet of his surroundings. In the distance some fields were turning to\r\ngold as the sun, setting behind a familiar birch-grove, tinged to red\r\nthe mirror-like surface of the lake. From the fields a mist had risen,\r\nfor the chill of evening was falling, and dusk approaching apace. To\r\nhis ears, at intervals, came the clatter of peasantry as they returned\r\nhomewards, and at the entrance gates the servants of the establishment\r\nwere sitting at ease, while from their vicinity came the sound of\r\nechoing voices and laughter, the playing of _balalaiki_, * and the\r\nchattering of girls as they pursued the sport of _goriclki_. ** Around\r\nhim, also, his little ones were frisking at times climbing on to his\r\nknee and hanging about his neck; while behind the _samovar_ *** was\r\nseated the real ruler of all that his eyes were beholding his divinity,\r\na woman, his _wife!_... And in the dining-room--a room at once elegant\r\nand simply appointed--a cheerful fire was glowing, and Zakhar, now\r\npromoted to the dignity of a major-domo, and adorned with whiskers\r\nturned wholly grey, was laying a large, round table to a pleasant\r\naccompanying tinkle of crystal and silver as he arranged, here a\r\ndecanter and there a fork.\r\n\r\n     * Three-stringed, lute-like instruments.\r\n\r\n     **  A sort of catch-as catch-can.\r\n\r\n     ***  Tea-urn.\r\n\r\nPresently the dreamer saw his wife and himself sit down to a bountiful\r\nsupper. Yes, and with them was Schtoltz, the comrade of his youth, his\r\nunchanging friend, with other well-known faces. Lastly, he could see the\r\ninmates of the house retiring to rest....\r\n\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s features blushed with delight at the vision. So clear, so\r\nvivid, so poetical was it all that for a moment he lay with his face\r\nburied in the sofa cushions. Suddenly there had come upon him a dim\r\nlonging for love and quiet happiness; suddenly he had become athirst for\r\nthe fields and the hills of his native place, for his home, for a wife,\r\nfor children....\r\n\r\nAfter lying face downwards for a moment or two, he turned upon his back.\r\nHis features were alight with generous emotion, and for the time being\r\nhe was--_happy_.\r\n\r\nAgain the charming seductiveness of sleep-waking enfolded him in its\r\nembrace. He pictured to himself a small colony of friends who should\r\ncome and settle in the villages and farms within a radius of fifteen\r\nor twenty versts of his country house. Every day they should visit\r\none another\xe2\x80\x99s houses--whether to dine or to sup or to dance; until\r\neverywhere around him he would be able to see only bright faces framed\r\nin sunny days--faces which should be ever free of care and wrinkles,\r\nand round, and merry, and ruddy, and double-chinned, and of unfailing\r\nappetite. In all his neighbourhood there should be constant\r\nsummertide, constant gaiety, unfailing good fare, the joys of perennial\r\nlassitude.... \xe2\x80\x9cMy God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in the fullness of his delight:\r\nand with that he awoke. Once more to his ears came the cries of hawkers\r\nin the courtyard as they vended coal, sand, and potatoes; once more he\r\ncould hear some one begging for subscriptions to build a church; once\r\nmore from a neighbouring building which was in course of erection there\r\nstreamed a babel of workmen\xe2\x80\x99s shouts, mingled with the clatter of tools.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed with a sense of pain. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is real life! What ugliness\r\nthere is in the roar of the capital! When shall I attain the life of\r\nparadise--the life for which I yearn? Shall I ever see my own fields, my\r\nown forests? Would that at this moment I were lying on the grass under\r\na tree, and gazing upwards at the sun through the boughs, and trying to\r\ncount the birds which come and go over my head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut what about the plans for improving the estate? And what about the\r\n_starosta_ and the flat? Once again these things knocked at his memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered them. \xe2\x80\x9c_Seichass_--presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he rose to a sitting posture on the sofa, lowered his legs to\r\nthe level of his slippers, and slipped the latter on to his feet; after\r\nwhich he sat still for a little while. At length he attained a wholly\r\nerect posture, and remained meditating for a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZakhar! Zakhar!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted as he eyed the table and the inkstand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant you to, to----\xe2\x80\x9d Further he failed to get, but mutely pointed to the\r\ninkstand, and then relapsed into thought.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell rang, and a little man with a bald head entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov exclaimed as he extended one hand towards his\r\nguest, and with the other one drew forward a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat chance brings\r\nyou here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chance that, since all of you decline to be ill, and never send for\r\nme, I am forced to come of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor jestingly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nno,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a more serious tone. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, I had to visit a\r\nneighbour of yours on the upper floor, and thought I might as well take\r\nyou on the way. How are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov shook his head despondently. \xe2\x80\x9cPoorly, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\njust been thinking of consulting you. My stomach will scarcely digest\r\nanything, there is a pain in the pit of it, and my breath comes with\r\ndifficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your wrist,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. He closed his eyes and felt the\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you a cough?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--at night-time, but more especially while I am at supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm! And does your heart throb at all, or your head ache?\xe2\x80\x9d He then\r\nadded other questions, bowed his bald pate, and subsided into profound\r\nmeditation. At length he straightened himself with a jerk, and said with\r\nan air of decision--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three years more, of this room, of lying about, of eating rich,\r\nheavy foods, and you will have a stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what ought I to do, doctor? Tell me, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely what other people do--namely, go abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, doctor, but how am I to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you not? Does money prevent you, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; money is the reason,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov, gladly catching at\r\nthe excuse, which was the most natural one that could possibly have been\r\ndevised. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here--just read what my _slarosta_ writes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, but that is no business of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9c_My_\r\nbusiness is to inform you that you must change your mode of life, and\r\nalso your place of residence. You must have fresh air--you must have\r\nsomething to do. Go to Kissingen or to Ems, and remain there during June\r\nand July, whilst you drink the waters. Then go on to Switzerland, or to\r\nthe Tyrol, and partake of the local grape cure. That you can do during\r\nSeptember and October.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the devil take the Tyrol!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Oblomov under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext, transfer yourself to some dry place like Egypt, and put away from\r\nyou all cares and worries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cI only wish that _starostas_\xe2\x80\x99 letters like\r\nthis one reached you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso you must do no thinking whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thinking, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--you must impose upon the brain no exertion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about my plans for my estate? I am not a log, if you will\r\npardon my saying so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well. I have merely been warning you. Likewise, you must\r\navoid emotion of every kind, for that sort of thing is sure to militate\r\nagainst a successful cure. Try, rather, to divert yourself with riding,\r\nwith dancing, with moderate exercise in the open air, and with pleasant\r\nconversation--more especially conversation with the opposite sex.\r\nThese things are designed to make your heart beat more lightly, and to\r\nexperience none but agreeable emotions. Again, you must lay aside all\r\nreading and writing. Rent a villa which faces south and lies embowered\r\nin flowers, and surround yourself also with an atmosphere of music and\r\nwomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I eat at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly; but avoid all animal and farinaceous food, as well as\r\nanything which may be served cold. Eat only light soups and vegetables.\r\nEven in _this_ great care will need to be exercised, for cholera, I may\r\ntell you, is about. Walk eight hours out of every twenty-four; go in for\r\nshooting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cgo to Paris for the winter, where,\r\nsurrounded by a whirlpool of gaiety, you will best be able to distract\r\nyour mind from your habitual brooding. Cultivate, theatres, balls,\r\nmasquerades, the streets, society friends, noise, and laughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oblomov, with ill-concealed impatience. The\r\ndoctor reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; also get the benefit of sea air,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCross over to England,\r\nor else go for a voyage to America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith chat he rose to take his leave. \xe2\x80\x9cShould you carry out these\r\ninstructions to the letter----\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Of _course_ I shall carry them out!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov bitterly as\r\nhe accompanied the physician to the door.\r\n\r\nThe doctor having departed, Oblomov threw himself back into an\r\narm-chair, clasped his hands behind his head, and remained sitting in\r\nan almost unthinking heap. Roused by Zakhar to consider once more the\r\nquestion of changing his quarters, he engaged in a long and heated\r\nconversation with the valet. Eventually he dismissed the man to his den,\r\nbut could not dismiss from his own mind certain comparisons which Zakhar\r\nhad drawn between his master\xe2\x80\x99s life and the life of ordinary people.\r\nHow strange that suddenly there should have dawned in him thoughts\r\nconcerning human fate and destiny! All at once he found his mind drawing\r\na parallel between that destiny and his own existence; all at once\r\nquestions of life arose before his vision, like owls in an ancient ruin\r\nflushed from sleep by a stray ray of sunlight. Somehow he felt pained\r\nand grieved at his arrested development, at the check which had taken\r\nplace in his moral growth, at the weight which appeared to be pressing\r\nupon his every faculty. Also gnawing at his heart there was a sense of\r\nenvy that others should be living a life so full and free, while all the\r\ntime the narrow, pitiful little pathway of his own existence was being\r\nblocked by a great boulder. And in his hesitating soul there arose a\r\ntorturing consciousness that many sides of his nature had never yet been\r\nstirred, that others had never even been touched, and that not one of\r\nthem had attained complete formation. Yet with this there went an aching\r\nsuspicion that, buried in his being, as in a tomb, there still remained\r\na moribund element of sweetness and light, and that it was an element\r\nwhich, though hidden in his personality, as a nugget lies lurking in the\r\nbowels of the earth, might once have become minted into sterling coin.\r\nBut the treasure was now overlaid with rubbish--was now thickly littered\r\nover with dust. \xe2\x80\x99Twas as though some one had stolen from him, and\r\nbesmirched, the store of gifts with which life and the world had dowered\r\nhim; so that always he would be prevented from entering life\xe2\x80\x99s field\r\nand sailing across it with the aid of intellect and of will. Yes, at the\r\nvery start a secret enemy had laid a heavy hand upon him and diverted\r\nhim from the road of human destiny. And now he seemed to be powerless to\r\nleave the swamps and wilds in favour of that road. All around him was\r\na forest, and ever the recesses ox his soul were growing dimmer and\r\ndarker, and the path more and more tangled, while the consciousness\r\nof his condition kept awaking within him less and less frequently--to\r\narouse only for a fleecing moment his slumbering faculties. Brain\r\nand volition alike had become paralysed, and, to all appearances,\r\nirrevocably--the events of his life had become whittled down to\r\nmicroscopical proportions. Yet even with them he was powerless to\r\ncope--he was powerless to pass from one of them to another. Consequently\r\nthey bandied him to and fro like the waves of the ocean. Never was he\r\nable to oppose to any event elasticity of will; never was he able to\r\nconceive, as the result of any event, a reasoned-out impulse. Yet\r\nto confess this, even to himself, always cost him a bitter pang:\r\nhis fruitless regrets for lost opportunities, coupled with burning\r\nreproaches of conscience, always pricked him like needles, and led him\r\nto strive to put away such reproaches and to discover a scapegoat....\r\n\r\nOnce again Oblomov sank asleep; and as he slept he dreamed of a\r\ndifferent period, of different people, of a different place from the\r\npresent. Let us follow him thither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves transported to a land where neither sea nor mountains\r\nnor crags nor precipices nor lonely forests exist--where, in short,\r\nthere exists nothing grand or wild or immense.\r\n\r\nOf what advantage, indeed, is the grand, the immense? The ocean\r\ndepresses the soul of man, and at the sight of its boundless expanse of\r\nbillows--an expanse whereon the weary eye is allowed no resting-place\r\nfrom the uniformity of the picture--the heart of man grows troubled\r\nwithin him, and he derives no solace from the roaring and mad rolling\r\nof the waves. Ever since the world began, those waves have sung the same\r\ndim, enigmatical song. Ever since the world began, they have voiced\r\nbut the querulous lament of a monster which, everlastingly doomed to\r\ntorment, utters a chorus of shrill, malicious cries. On the shores of\r\nthe sea no bird warbles; only the silent gulls, like lost spirits, fit\r\nwearily along its margin, or circle over its surface. In the presence of\r\nthat turmoil of nature the roar even of the wildest beast sounds weak,\r\nand the voice of man becomes wholly overwhelmed. Yes, beside it man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nform looks so small and fragile that it is swallowed up amid the myriad\r\ndetails of the gigantic picture. That alone may be why contemplation\r\nof the ocean depresses man\xe2\x80\x99s soul. During periods, also, of calm and\r\nimmobility his spirit derives no comfort from the spectacle; for in the\r\nscarcely perceptible oscillation of the watery mass he sees ever the\r\nslumbering, incomprehensible force, which, until recently, has been\r\nmocking his proud will and, as it were, submerging his boldest schemes,\r\nhis most dearly cherished labours and endeavours.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, mountains and gorges were not created to afford man\r\nencouragement, inasmuch as, with their terrible, menacing aspect, they\r\nseem to him the fangs and talons of some gigantic wild beast--of a beast\r\nwhich is reaching forth in an effort to devour him. Too vividly they\r\nremind him of his own frail build; too painfully they cause him to go\r\nin fear for his life. And over the summits of those crags and precipices\r\nthe heavens look so remote and unattainable that they seem to have\r\nbecome removed out of the ken of humanity.\r\n\r\nNot so that peaceful corner of the earth upon which our hero, in his\r\nslumber, opened his eyes. There, on the contrary, the heavens seemed\r\nto hug the earth--not in order that they might the better aim their\r\nthunderbolts, but in order that they might the closer enfold it in\r\na loving embrace. In fact, they hovered low in order that, like a\r\nsheltering, paternal roof, they might guard this chosen corner of the\r\nearth from every adversity. Meanwhile the sun shone warm and bright\r\nduring half the year, and, withdrawing, did so so slowly and reluctantly\r\nthat it seemed ever to be turning back for one more look at the beloved\r\nspot, as though wishing to give it one more bright, warm day before the\r\napproaching weather of autumn. Also the hills of that spot were no\r\nmore than reduced models of the terrible mountains which, in other\r\nlocalities, rear themselves to affright the imagination. Rather, they\r\nresembled the gentle slopes down which one may roll in sport, or where\r\none may sit and gaze dreamily at the declining sun Below them, toying\r\nand frisking, ran a stream. In one place it discharged itself into a\r\nbroad pool, in another it hurried along in a narrow thread, in a third\r\nit slackened its pace to a sudden mood of reverie, and, barely gliding\r\nover the stones, threw out on either side small rivulets whereof the\r\ngentle burbling seemed to invite sleep. Everywhere the vicinity of\r\nthis corner of the earth presented a series of landscape studies and\r\ncheerful, smiling vistas. The sandy, shelving bank of the stream, a\r\nsmall copse which descended from the summit of that bank to the water,\r\na winding ravine of which the depths were penetrated by a rill, a\r\nplantation of birch-trees--all these things seemed purposely to be\r\nfitted into one another, and to have been drawn by the hand of a master.\r\nBoth the troubled heart and the heart which has never known care might\r\nhave yearned to hide themselves in this forgotten corner of the world,\r\nand to live its life of ineffable happiness. Everything promised a\r\nquiet existence which should last until the grey hairs were come, and\r\nthereafter a death so gradual as almost to resemble the approach of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThere the yearly round fulfils itself in a regular, serene order. As the\r\ncalendar ordains, spring comes in in March, when turbid rivulets begin\r\nto run from the hills, and the earth, thawing, steams with tepid vapour.\r\nThen the peasant, doffing his sheepskin, goes out in shirtsleeves alone,\r\nand shades his eyes with\xe2\x80\x99 his hand as gladly he shrugs his shoulders and\r\ndrinks his fill of the gleaming sunlight. Then, with a shaft in either\r\nhand, he draws forth the cart which has been lying bottom upwards,\r\nunder the tiltshed, or examines and sounds with his foot the plough\r\nwhich has been reposing in the penthouse. All this is in preparation for\r\nthe usual routine of toil, since in that region spring sees no return\r\nof sudden snowstorms to heap the fields and crack the branches. On the\r\nother hand, Winter, like a cold, unapproachable beauty, retains her\r\ncharacter until the lawful season of thaw has arrived. Never does\r\nshe mock one with unexpected softenings of the air; never does she\r\ntriple-harness the earth with unheard-of degrees of frost. Everything\r\nproceeds according to rote--according to a generally prescribed order of\r\nnature. Although, in November, there begin snow and frost which, towards\r\nthe festival of Epiphany, increase to the point of freezing to an icicle\r\nthe beard of the peasant who has stepped out of his hut for a breath of\r\nfresh air, the sensitive nose can, by February, detect the kindly odour\r\nof approaching spring.\r\n\r\nNext, the summer is peculiarly ravishing. Only in that particular spot\r\ncan one find that fresh, dry perfume which is the scent neither of\r\nlaurel nor of lemon, but of mingled wormwood, pine, and cherry-blossom.\r\nOnly there, also, can one find those bright days when the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays\r\nare warm, but never scorching, and the sky remains cloudless for three\r\nmouths on end. As the bright days draw on they lengthen, week by week;\r\nand during that period the evenings are hot and the nights stifling,\r\nwhile the stars twinkle in the heavens with the welcoming mien of\r\nfriends. And when rain at length arrives, how beneficent is its coming!\r\nBoisterously, richly, merrily it spates forth, like the large, hot\r\ntears of a man unexpectedly relieved of care; and as soon as ever it has\r\npassed the sun appears with a new smile of love, to dry the fields and\r\nthe hillocks, and to cause all the countryside to assume an answering\r\nsmile of delight. How gladly, too, the peasant greets the rain! \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ngood rain washes us, and the sun will dry us again,\xe2\x80\x9d is his saying as\r\nhe exposes his face to the tepid downpour and lets it play upon his\r\nshoulders and back. Moreover, in that region thunder is never terrible,\r\nbut, rather, benevolent, and always occurs at one particular season\r\n(generally on Saint Elias\xe2\x80\x99 Day, in order that the people\xe2\x80\x99s established\r\ntradition may be fulfilled * ). Also it would appear that, every year,\r\nboth the number and the intensity of the peals remain the same--as\r\nthough for each year the heavenly treasury had allotted a given measure\r\nof electricity. But of terrible and destructive storms that country can\r\nshew no record.\r\n\r\n     * Namely, that, should thunder occur on that day, the whole\r\n     of the ensuing year will be prosperous, since the peals\r\n     represent the saint\xe2\x80\x99s passage to heaven.\r\n\r\nNor has the country whereof I am speaking ever been visited with the\r\nEgyptian or other plagues. Never has any member of its population beheld\r\na dire manifestation of Heaven, nor a thunderbolt, nor an unlooked-for\r\ndarkness; nor do venomous vermin abide there, and the locust comes not\r\nthither, and lions, tigers, bears, and wolves are unknown ( owing to the\r\nfact that the country contains no fastnesses for them to dwell in). In\r\nshort, over the fields and around the village wander only lowing cattle,\r\nbleating sheep, and cackling poultry.\r\n\r\nYet none but God knows whether a poet or a visionary would find\r\nhimself satisfied with the natural features of this peaceful spot. Such\r\ngentlemen, we know, love to gaze upon the moon, and to listen to.\r\nthe strains of nightingales; they love to see Luna clothe herself in\r\ncoquettish, aureate cloud, and then glide mysteriously through the\r\nboughs of trees, and send forth clusters of silver beams to delight the\r\neyes of her worshippers\xe2\x80\x99! But in this country of Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s dream no one\r\nknows such a moon; there Luna\xe2\x80\x99s features, as she looks down upon the\r\nvillages and the fields, resembles, rather, a polished, cheery copper\r\nbasin, and in vain would the poet fasten ravished eyes upon her, for she\r\nwould return his gaze with the same indifference as that with which a\r\nround-faced rustic beauty meets the eloquent, passionate glances of a\r\ntown gallant.\r\n\r\nNor has a nightingale ever been heard in that country--perchance for the\r\nreason that the region contains no shaded arbours or gardens of roses.\r\nBut what an abundance of quails it can show!--so much so that in summer,\r\nwhen the harvest is in course of being gathered, urchins can catch them\r\neven in their hands! Yet it must not be supposed that thereafter the\r\nquails furnish a gastronomic dainty. Such an outrage would be repugnant\r\nto the moral sense of the inhabitants, since the quail is a bird, and\r\ntherefore legally prohibited from being used for food. Consequently it\r\nlives but to delight the popular ear with its song, and in almost every\r\nhouse there hangs beneath the eaves a wicker cage wherein a member of\r\nthat feathered species sits penned.\r\n\r\nEven the general aspect of this modest, unaffected spot would fail to\r\nplease the poet or the visionary. Never would it be theirs to behold\r\na scene in which all nature--woodland, lake, cotter\xe2\x80\x99s hut, and sandy\r\nhillside--is burning with a purplish glow, while sharply defined against\r\na purple background may be seen moving along a sandy, winding road,\r\na cavalcade of countrymen in attendance upon some great lady who is\r\njourneying towards a ruined castle--a castle where they will find\r\nawaiting them the telling of legends concerning the Wars of the Roses,\r\nthe eating of wild goats for supper, and the singing of ballads to the\r\nlute by a young English damsel--a scene of Scottish or Swiss flavour of\r\nthe kind which has been made familiar to our imagination by the pen of\r\nSir Waiter Scott.\r\n\r\nOf this there is nothing in our country.\r\n\r\nHow quiet and dreamy are the three or four villages which constitute\r\nthat restful region! They lie not far from one another, and seem to have\r\nbeen thrown into their respective positions by some giant hand, and ever\r\nsince to have maintained those positions. In particular, one hut stands\r\non the edge of a ravine, with one-half its bulk projecting over the\r\ndeclivity, but supported on three props. Within it some three or four\r\ngenerations have spent happy, peaceful lives; for though it looks\r\nscarcely large enough to house a chicken, it is none the less tenanted\r\nby a well-to-do peasant and his wife. Onisim Suslov is the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, and he cannot stand upright in his abode. The veranda actually\r\noverhangs the ravine, and to reach it one has with one hand to grasp\r\nthe herbage, and, with the other, the gable before setting foot upon the\r\nstructure itself. Another of the huts is, as it were, gummed to the side\r\nof a hill, like a swallow\xe2\x80\x99s nest, while three others stand close beside\r\nit, and two are situated at the bottom of the ravine.\r\n\r\nIn the village all is quiet. The doors of its solitary little dwellings\r\nstand open, but not a soul is to be seen. Only the flies circle and buzz\r\nin clusters. Were you to enter one of the huts, you would call aloud in\r\nvain, for your only answer would be the deathlike silence, except that\r\nhere and there you might hear the gasping of an invalid or the deep\r\ncough of some old woman who is living out her days upon the stove.\r\nAlso, there might appear from behind the fence a long-haired, barefooted\r\nyoungster of three, clad only in a shirt, who would gaze mutely at the\r\nnew-comer, and then timidly hide himself again.\r\n\r\nThe same deep silence, the same deep peace, lies also upon the fields.\r\nOnly somewhere over the distant soil there can be seen moving, like\r\nan ant, a sunburnt ploughman. Occasionally he leans upon his plough to\r\nclear his forehead of the sweat. Even the manners of that region are\r\npossessed of a still restfulness which nothing can disturb. Never has a\r\nrobbery or a murder or a similar happening been known there; never have\r\nthe inhabitants succumbed to strong passions, or experienced hazardous\r\nadventures. Indeed, what passions, what adventures would have the power\r\nto move them? No man has ever strayed beyond his own circle, for the\r\nlocal inhabitants dwell far from other men, and both the nearest village\r\nand the nearest country town lie distant from twenty-five to thirty\r\nversts.\r\n\r\nTrue, at given seasons the peasants cart their grain to the river wharf\r\nwhich lies nearest to them, and once a year, also, they attend a\r\nfair; but they maintain no relations beyond these. In fact, all their\r\ninterests are centred in themselves. True, they know that eighty versts\r\naway there stands the provincial capital; but few of them have ever\r\njourneyed thither. Also they know that beyond it stand Saratov and\r\nNizhni Novgorod--likewise they have heard that such places as Moscow and\r\nPetrograd exist, and that on the farther side of them dwell folk who\r\nare known as Germans and French; but beyond that point there begins\r\nfor them, as it did for the ancients, a mysterious world of unknown\r\ncountries which are peopled with monsters and two-headed giants, and\r\nbounded on the outer side by a void of mist, and, again, by the colossal\r\nfish which bears the world on its bark. Moreover, since this peaceful\r\ncorner of the universe is almost inaccessible, there filters thither but\r\nfew items of news concerning the great white universe. * Indeed, even\r\ntraders in rustic wares who live twenty versts away know no more than\r\nthey do. Likewise, it never enters into their heads to compare their lot\r\nwith those of other men--to inquire whether other men are rich or poor,\r\ncomfortable or in need, for these peasants live in the fortunate belief\r\nthat no circumstances could ever be different to their own--that all\r\nother folk must surely be living even as they are, and that to live in\r\nany other fashion would be a sin. Were you to assure them that others\r\nplough, sow, reap, or sell their produce in any way than that which\r\nobtains in this particular spot, the inhabitants would not believe you.\r\nThat being so, how could any element of vexation or disturbance ever\r\ncome nigh them? True, they resemble the rest of humanity in that they\r\nhave their cares and weaknesses and obligations of lax-payment and fits\r\nof laziness and lethargy; but these press upon them but lightly, and\r\noccasion no real stirring of the blood. Indeed, during the past five\r\nyears not a single soul of that local population of hundreds has died\r\neither a violent death or a natural. Even should a mar or a woman\r\nexpire of old age or a senile disease, it is not long before the rest\r\nhave got ever their astonishment at the unusual occurrence. In the same\r\nway, after the trader Tarass had come near to steaming himself to death\r\nin his hut, and had had to be revived with cold water, the affair caused\r\nscarcely any stir in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n     * As distinguished from the black universe, the unknown.\r\n\r\nOf crimes, one only--that of theft of produce from market gardens--is\r\nat all prevalent. Also, once two pigs and a chicken mysteriously\r\ndisappeared. True, the latter event threw the district into something\r\nof a turmoil, but was unanimously ascribed to a pedlar who, the previous\r\nevening, had passed through the district on his way to a fair. In\r\ngeneral, such untoward incidents are of the greatest rarity.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a ditch in a paddock near the bridge once there was found\r\nlying a man--apparently a member of a party which had just traversed the\r\nneighbourhood _en route_ for the country town. Some boys were the first\r\nto notice him, and at once they came running home with a horrifying tale\r\nof a great serpent or werewolf which was crouching in a hole. To this\r\nthey added a statement that the said creature had pursued them, and come\r\nnear to devouring Kuzka. From far and near the peasants armed themselves\r\nwith hatchets and pitchforks, and proceeded to the ditch _en masse_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither away?\xe2\x80\x9d the old men said reprovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad? What do you\r\nwant to do? Leave things alone, and no harm will come of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless the peasants set forth, and, when about a hundred paces\r\nfrom the spot, began to adjure the monster in varying terms. But no\r\nanswer was returned. Next, after halting a moment, the party advanced a\r\nlittle further. The man seemed still to be lying in the ditch, with\r\nhis head resting against a fence, while beside him lay a satchel and\r\na cudgel (on the latter of which was slung a pair of boots). Yet the\r\npeasants could not summon up the necessary courage to approach him or to\r\ntouch him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi, friend!\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted--one scratching his head and another the back\r\nof his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing there? Who are you? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe traveller made as though to raise his head a little, but failed.\r\nEvidently he was ill or tired out. Then a peasant ventured to touch him\r\nwith a pitchfork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with him, don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the rest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do we know what he is, seeing that he refuses to speak? Leave him\r\nalone, friends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we had better go away,\xe2\x80\x9d added certain others. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has _he_ to do\r\nwith us? Harm might come of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo all returned to the village, and told the elder men that, lying in a\r\nditch, there was a strange man who would not speak, and whose identity\r\nwas known only to God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he does not belong to these parts, leave him alone,\xe2\x80\x9d advised the\r\nelders from the spot where, with hands on knees, they were sitting\r\nresting on a bank. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, leave him to himself. \xe2\x80\x99Tis no use _your_\r\ngoing there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the corner of the world whither Oblomov passed in his\r\nsleep. Of the three or four scattered villages in the region, one was\r\nnamed Sosnovka, and a second Vavilovka--the two being distant from one\r\nanother about a verst. Together they constituted Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s hereditary\r\nestate, and bore the joint title of Oblomovka. In Sosnovka stood the\r\nmanor-house and the farm, while five versts from the village there lay\r\nthe hamlet of Verklevo--once the property of the Oblomovs, but long\r\nsince passed into other hands. The same hamlet had attached to it\r\na number of outlying huts. As a whole, Verklevo belonged to a rich\r\nlandowner, a constant absentee, and the estate was managed by a German\r\nbailiff. There you have the geography of this remote corner of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOblomov dreamed that, aged seven, he awoke in his little cot at home. He\r\nfelt merry and full of life. What a goodly, handsome, plump youngster he\r\nwas, with cheeks of such rotundity that, however desperately any other\r\nyoung scamp might have tried to rival them by inflation of his own, no\r\ncompetitor could possibly have succeeded. Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s nurse had long\r\nbeen waiting for him to awake, and now she began to draw on for him his\r\nstockings. This he refused to allow her to do; which end he attained by\r\nfrisking and kicking, while she tried to catch hold of his leg, and the\r\npair laughed joyously together. Finally, she lifted him on to her lap,\r\nand washed him, and combed his hair; after which she conducted him to\r\nhis mother. On seeing his long-dead parent, the sleeping Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s form\r\ntrembled with delight and affection, and from under his unconscious\r\neyelids there stole and remained two burning tears....\r\n\r\nUpon him his mother showered affectionate kisses, and gazed at him with\r\ntender solicitude to see whether his eyes were clear and healthy. Did he\r\nin any way ail? she inquired. Had he (tiffs to his nurse) slept quietly,\r\nor had he lain awake all night? Had he had any dreams? Had he been\r\nat all feverish? Lastly, she took him by the hand, and led him to the\r\nsacred _ikon_. Kneeling with one arm around his form, she prompted him\r\nin the words of the prayers, while the boy repeated them with scanty\r\nattention, since he preferred, rather, to turn his eyes to the windows,\r\nwhence the freshness and scent of a lilac-tree was flooding the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go for a walk to-day, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied hastily, but kept her gaze fixed upon the\r\n_ikon_, and hurriedly concluded the sacred formula. Yet into the words\r\nof that formula her very soul was projected, whereas the little one\r\nrepeated them only in nonchalant fashion.\r\n\r\nThe prayer over, they went to greet his father, and then to take morning\r\ntea. Beside the table Oblomov could see seated the aunt of eighty\r\nwho had always lived with them. Never did she cease to grumble at the\r\nancient serving-maid who, her head trembling with senility, stood behind\r\nher chair to wait upon her. Also there were present three old maiden\r\nladies who were distant relatives of his father\xe2\x80\x99s; a weak-minded\r\ngentleman named Chekmenev, who, the brother-in-law of Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\r\nwas the owner of seven serfs, and happened to be staying with Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparents; and certain other old men and women. The latter, the domestic\r\nstaff and retinue of the Oblomov family, caught hold of the little Ilya\r\nIlyitch, and started to heap him with caresses and attentions--so\r\nmuch so that he had much ado to wipe away the traces of these unsought\r\nkisses. Then there began the feeding of the child with rolls, biscuits,\r\nand cream; after which his mother bestowed upon him another embrace,\r\nand sent him out to walk round the garden and the courtyard and the\r\nlake--accompanying her farewell with particular instructions to the\r\nnurse that never must she leave the child alone for a single moment, nor\r\nyet must she allow him to approach the horses, the dogs, or the goat,\r\nnor yet must she take him far from home. Above all things, never must\r\nthe nurse suffer him to approach the ravine, which was the most dreaded\r\nspot in the neighbourhood, and bore an evil reputation. Once there had\r\nbeen found there a dog which confessed itself a mad one, inasmuch as it\r\nhad run headlong from folk who chased it with hatchets and pitchforks,\r\nand had disappeared behind a neighbouring hill. Likewise to the ravine\r\ncarrion was carted, while robbers and wolves and various other creatures\r\nwhich never existed in the world at all were supposed to dwell there.\r\n\r\nBut to these warnings of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s the child paid little heed.\r\nAlready he was outside, in the courtyard. With gleeful surprise (as\r\nthough for the first time in his life) he went the round of his parents\xe2\x80\x99\r\nestablishment, with its gates sagging outwards, its dinted roof\r\nwhere lichen grew, its tottering veranda, its various annexes and\r\noutbuildings, and its overgrown garden. Also he yearned to ascend to the\r\nhanging gallery which girdled the house, that thence he might see the\r\nriver; but the gallery was now in decay, and scarcely able to hold\r\ntogether, so that none but the servants trod it, and at no time did\r\nthe gentry walk there. Heedless of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s warnings, however, the\r\nlittle Oblomov was on the point of making for its seductive steps when\r\nthe nurse showed herself on the veranda, and caught hold of him. Next,\r\nhe rushed from her towards the hay-loft, with the intention of scaling\r\nits steep ladder; and just had she time to destroy successive schemes\r\nof ascending to the pigeon-cote, of penetrating to the cattle-yard,\r\nand--Heaven preserve us all!--of making his way to the ravine!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the child!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9c_Will_ you be quiet, then,\r\nyoung sir? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, the whole\r\nday, as well as every day and every night, was spent by her in similar\r\nalarums and excursions, in alternations of torture and relief on the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s account, in terror because he had fallen and broken his nose,\r\nin gratification at his warm, childish caresses, and in dim anxiety\r\nconcerning his ultimate future. Only these and like emotions made her\r\nold heart beat and her old blood grow warm; only these retained in her\r\nthe drowsy life which, but for them, would long ago have flickered out.\r\n\r\nYet the child was not always mischievous. Sometimes he would grow\r\nsuddenly quiet as, sitting beside her, he gazed fixedly before him with\r\nhis childish intellect taking in the various phenomena which presented\r\nthemselves to his vision. Such phenomena were sinking fast into his\r\nmind, to grow and ripen there even as it grew and ripened.\r\n\r\nThe morning was a splendid one, and the air still fresh, since the sun\r\nhad not yet attained much height. From the house, from the trees, from\r\nthe dovecote, and from the gallery there streamed long shadows which\r\nformed, in the garden and in the orchard, cool corners which invited\r\nmeditation and sleep. Only in the distance a rye-held was glowing with\r\nflame, and the river sparkling and flashing in the rays of the sun until\r\nactually it hurt the eyes to look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it so dark in one place and bright in another?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it soon be bright everywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That is because the sun has come out to meet the moon, and at\r\ntimes keeps frowning because he cannot catch sight of her. By and by he\r\n_will_ catch sight of her. Then he will send out his light once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The child pondered, and gazed at the scene around him. Before him he\r\ncould see Antip driving the watercart, with another Antip, ten times\r\nas large as the real one, accompanying him, and the barrel of the cart\r\nlooking as large as a house, and the horse\xe2\x80\x99s shadow covering the whole\r\nof the pond. Then the shadows seemed to take two strides across the\r\npond, and then to move behind the hill, though the figure of Antip\r\nhad not yet left the courtyard. In his turn the child took a couple of\r\nstrides, and then a third, to see if he too would end by disappearing\r\nbehind the hill, which he had a great longing to ascend, for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining what had become of the horse. Consequently he set on\r\ntowards the gates but only to hear his mother calling from a window--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNurse, nurse, do you not see that the boy has just run out into\r\nthe sunshine? Pray bring him back into the shade, or he will get a\r\nsunstroke, and be ill, and sick, and unable to eat! Besides, he might\r\nrun down into the ravine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the naughty darling!\xe2\x80\x9d the nurse muttered to herself as she dragged\r\nhim back on to the veranda. The child looked about him with the keen,\r\nobservant glance of a \xe2\x80\x9cgrown-up\xe2\x80\x9d who is debating how best a morning\r\ncan be spent. Not a trifle, not a circumstance, escaped the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquisitive attention, so that insensibly the picture of his home life\r\nengraved itself upon his mind, and his sensitive intellect nourished\r\nitself on living examples, and involuntarily modelled its programme of\r\nlife on the life which surrounded it.\r\n\r\nNever at any time could it be said that the _morning_ was wasted in the\r\nOblomovs\xe2\x80\x99 establishment. The sound of knives in the kitchen, as they\r\nminced cutlets and vegetables, reached even to the village; while from\r\nthe servants\xe2\x80\x99 quarters came the hum of a spindle, coupled with the thin,\r\nlow voice of an old woman--but a voice so low that with difficulty could\r\none distinguish whether she were weeping, or whether she were merely\r\nimprovising to herself a mournful \xe2\x80\x9csong without words.\xe2\x80\x9d Also, on Antip\r\nreturning with the watercart, there would advance to meet it, with\r\npails, cans, and pitchers, a number of maidservants and grooms, while\r\nfrom the storehouse an old woman would produce a vessel of meal and a\r\npile of eggs, and carry them to the kitchen. There, on the cook suddenly\r\nthrowing some water out of the window, the cat Arapka--which, with eyes\r\nfixed upon the view, had spent the morning in agitating the tip of her\r\ntail and licking herself--came in for a splashing.\r\n\r\nThe head of the family, too, was not idle, for he spent the morning in\r\nsitting by the window and following with his eyes everything which took\r\nplace in the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Ignashka, what have you there, you rascal?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to a man who\r\nhappened to cross the open space.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome knives to be sharpened in the scullery,\xe2\x80\x9d the man replied, without\r\nlooking at his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. Mind you sharpen them properly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext, the master stopped one of the maidservants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are _you_ going?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the cellar to get some milk for the table,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, shading her\r\neyes with her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d he pronounced. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd see that you don\xe2\x80\x99t spill any. You,\r\nZakharka--where are _you_ off to once more? This is the third time\r\nI have seen you gadding about. Go back to your place in the hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Whereupon Zakharka returned to her day-dreams at the post mentioned.\r\nAgain, as soon as the cows returned from pasture, old Oblomov was always\r\nthere to see that they were properly watered. Also, when, from his post\r\nat the window, he chanced to observe the yard-dog chasing one of the\r\nhens he hastened to take the necessary measures against a recurrence of\r\nsuch conduct. In the same way, his wife was fully employed. For three\r\nhours she discussed with Averka, the tailor, the best ways and means\r\nof converting a waistcoat of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s into a jacket for her\r\nson--herself drawing the requisite lines in chalk, and seeing to it that\r\nAverka should pilfer not a morsel of the cloth. Thereafter she passed\r\nto the maids\xe2\x80\x99 room, where she parcelled cut to each damsel the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportion of lacemaking; whence she departed to summon one of her personal\r\nmaids to attend her in the garden, for the purpose of seeing how the\r\napples were swelling, which of them had fallen or were turning ripe,\r\nwhich trees wanted grafting or pruning, and so forth. But her chief care\r\nwas the kitchen and the dinner. Concerning the latter she consulted the\r\nentire household, including the aged aunt. Each member of the family\r\nproposed a special dish, and the sum of these proposals was taken into\r\nconsideration, adjudicated upon in detail, and adopted or rejected\r\naccording to the final decision of the mistress. From time to time,\r\nalso, a maid was dispatched to the culinary regions to remind the cook\r\nof this, or to tell her to add that, or to instruct her to change the\r\nother, while conveying to her sugar, honey, and wine for flavouring, and\r\nalso seeing to it that the said cook was using everything which had been\r\nmeasured out. In fact, the supervision of food was the first and the\r\nprincipal domestic preoccupation of Oblomovka.\r\n\r\nWhat calves were not fattened for the year\xe2\x80\x99s festivals! What poultry was\r\nnot reared! What forethought and care and skill were not devoted to the\r\nconsumption of comestibles! Game fowls and pullets were set apart solely\r\nfor birthdays and other solemn occasions; wherefore they were\r\nstuffed with nuts. For the same reason geese were caught several days\r\nbeforehand, and hung up in bags until wanted, in order that, being\r\nrestrained from exercise, they might put on the more fat. And what a\r\nroasting and a pickling and a baking would sometimes take place, and\r\nwhat mead and _kvass_ * were there not brewed, and what pies were there\r\nnot compounded!\r\n\r\n     *  A liquor made from fermented bread crusts or fruit.\r\n\r\nUntil noon, therefore, everything at Oblomovka was in a state of bustle\r\nand commotion. Life was indeed full and antlike and in evidence! Even on\r\nSundays and holidays these labour-loving ants did not desist from their\r\ntoil, for on such days the clatter of knives in the kitchen sounded\r\nlouder and more rapid than ever, a maid made several journeys from the\r\nstoreroom to the kitchen with double quantities of meal and eggs, and in\r\nthe poultry-run an added amount of cackling and of bloodshed took place.\r\nLikewise, on such days there was baked a gigantic pie, which was eaten\r\nby the gentry on the same and the following days, and by the maids on\r\nthe third and fourth; after which, should it survive to the fifth clay,\r\nthe last stale remnants, devoid of stuffing, were given, as a special\r\nfavour, to Antip, who, crossing himself, undauntedly attacked the\r\nrock-hard fragments--though it was in the thought that it had recently\r\nbeen the gentry\xe2\x80\x99s pie rather than in the pie itself that he took most\r\ndelight; even as an archaeologist rejoices to drink even the poorest\r\nwine from the shell of a thousand-year-old vessel.\r\n\r\nAll this the boy noted with his childish, ever-watchful mind. He\r\nperceived that, after mornings thus usefully and busily spent, there\r\nensued noon and dinner. On the present occasion noontide was sultry, and\r\nnot a cloud was in the sky. Indeed, the sun seemed to be standing still\r\nto scorch the grass, and the ah to have ceased to circulate--to be\r\nhanging without the slightest movement. Neither from tree nor lake could\r\nthe faintest rustle be heard, and over the village and the countryside\r\nthere hung an unbroken stillness, as though everything in them were\r\ndead. Only from afar could a human voice be distinguished, while, some\r\ntwenty _sazhens_ * away, the drone of a flying beetle, with the snoring\r\nof some one who had sunk into the thick herbage to enjoy a refreshing\r\nsleep, came gently to the ear. Even the house was possessed by a silence\r\nas of death, for the hour of post-prandial slumber had arrived. The\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s father, mother, and aged grandaunt, with their attendants, could\r\nbe seen disposed in various corners; and, should any one not possess a\r\nparticular corner, he or she repaired either to the hay-loft or to the\r\ngarden or to a cool resting-place among the growing hay or, with face\r\nprotected from the flies with a handkerchief, to a spot where the\r\nscorching heat would assist digestion after the enormous dinner. Even\r\nthe gardener stretched himself out beneath a bush by the side of his\r\nplot, and the coachman in the stable.\r\n\r\n     *  The zazhen = six English feet.\r\n\r\nLittle Oblomov proceeded to peep into the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, where the\r\ninmates were sleeping as though slumber had become an epidemic. On the\r\nbenches, on the floor, and on the threshold they slept, while their\r\nchildren crawled about the courtyard and fashioned mud pies. Indeed, the\r\nvery dogs had crawled into their kennels, since there was no longer\r\nany one to bark at. In short, one might have traversed the entire\r\nestablishment without meeting a single soul; and everything in it could\r\nwith ease have been stolen, and removed in carts from the courtyard,\r\nsince no one would have been there to prevent the deed. The prevailing\r\nlethargy was all-consuming, all-conquering--a true image of death;\r\nseeing that, but for the fact that from various corners there came\r\nsnores in different notes and keys, every one seemed wholly to have\r\ndeparted this life. Only at rare intervals would some one raise his head\r\nwith a start, gaze around him with vacant eyes, and then turn over to\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the child accompanied his nurse for a second airing out of\r\ndoors. Yet, despite her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions and her own resolves,\r\nthe old woman could not altogether resist the general call of sleep,\r\nand began to fall a victim to the all-prevalent malady of Oblomovka. At\r\nfirst she kept a vigilant eye upon her little charge, and, chiding him\r\nfor his waywardness, never let him stray from her side; but presently,\r\nafter giving him strict instructions not to go beyond the gates, nor\r\nto interfere with the goat, nor to climb either the dovecote or the\r\ngallery, she settled herself in a shady spot, with the ostensible\r\nintention of at once knitting a stocking and of watching over young\r\nOblomov. Next she took to checking him only in lazy fashion, as her head\r\nnodded and she said to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cLook you, he will certainly climb those\r\nstairs to the gallery, or else\xe2\x80\x9d--her eyes had almost closed--\xe2\x80\x9che will\r\nrun down into the ravine.\xe2\x80\x9d With that her head sank forward, and the\r\nstocking slipped from her hands. In a second her open mouth had emitted\r\na gentle snore, and the boy had disappeared from her vision.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this was the moment which the youngster had been\r\nimpatiently awaiting, for it marked the beginning of an independent\r\nexistence, and he was now alone in the wide, wide world. On tiptoe he\r\nleft the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s side, and, peeping cautiously at the other slumberers,\r\nkept stopping to throw a second glance at any one who chanced to stir,\r\nor to spit, or to snuffle in his sleep. At last, with a tremor of joy\r\nin his heart, he made for the gallery, ascended the creaking stairs at\r\na run, scaled also the dovecote, explored the recesses of the garden,\r\nlistened to the buzzing of beetles, and followed with his eyes their\r\nflight through the air. Next, on hearing a chirping sound in the grass,\r\nhe sought and captured the disturber of the public peace, in the shape\r\nof a dragon-fly, whose wings he proceeded to tear off, and whose body to\r\nimpale upon a straw, in order that he might see how, thus hampered, the\r\ncreature would contrive to fly. Afterwards, fearing almost to breathe,\r\nhe watched a spider suck blood from a captured fly, while the wretched\r\nvictim struggled and buzzed in the spider\xe2\x80\x99s claws. Finally the tragedy\r\nwas brought to an end by the boy slaying both torturer and tortured.\r\nNext, he repaired to the moat to search for sundry small roots which he\r\nknew of; which found, he peeled them, and then devoured the same with\r\nrelish, in the make-believe that they were the apples and preserves\r\nwhich his mamma was accustomed to give him. This item exhausted, he hied\r\nhim through the entrance gates--his object in so doing being to reach\r\na birch copse which looked to him so close at hand that, should he take\r\nthe direct route, and not the circuitous high-road (that is to\r\nsay, should he walk straight across the moat, and through the osier\r\nplantation), he would be able to attain his goal in five minutes.\r\nBut, alas! he felt afraid, for he had heard tales of wood goblins, of\r\nbrigands, and of fearsome wild beasts. Next, the spirit moved him to\r\nmake for the ravine, which lay a hundred paces from the garden; so,\r\nrunning to the edge of the declivity, and puckering his eyes, he gazed\r\ninto its depths as into Vulcan\xe2\x80\x99s crater. Suddenly to his mind recurred\r\nall the tales and traditions concerning the spot; and terror seized him.\r\nand, half-dead, half-alive, he rushed back and threw himself into his\r\nnurse\xe2\x80\x99s arms. Awakened, she sprang up, straightened the cap on her head,\r\narranged her grey curls with one finger, and pretended never to have\r\nbeen to sleep at all. Glancing suspiciously at the little Ilya, and\r\nthen at the gentry\xe2\x80\x99s windows, she began with tremulous hands to work the\r\nknitting needles of the stocking which had been lying in her lap.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the heat had decreased, and everything in nature had revived\r\na little since the sun was fast declining towards the forest. Gradually\r\nthe stillness indoors also began to be broken. Here and there a door\r\ncreaked, footsteps could be heard crossing the yard, and some one\r\nsneezed in the hay-loft. Soon from the kitchen a man came hurrying under\r\nthe weight of a huge _samovar_, and the entire household then assembled\r\nfor tea--one man with his face flushed and his eyes still dim, another\r\nman with red marks on his cheek and temple, a third speaking in a\r\nvoice not his own for drowsiness, and all of them snuffling, wheezing,\r\nyawning, scratching their heads, and stretching themselves in a\r\nsemiwaking condition. It seemed that dinner and sleep had combined to\r\narouse an unquenchable thirst which parched the throat, for even dozens\r\nof cupfuls of tea could not assuage it, and, amid a chorus of sighs and\r\ngrunts, resort had to be made to bilberry wine, to perry, to _kvass_,\r\nand even to more medicinal methods of moistening this avidity of gullet.\r\nThe company sought relief from thirst as from a Heaven-sent plague,\r\nand all felt as exhausted as though they were travelling in the Arabian\r\ndesert, and could nowhere find a spring.\r\n\r\nBy his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side the child gazed at the strange faces around him,\r\nand listened to the drowsy, drawling talk. Yet the spectacle delighted\r\nhim, and he found each stray word interesting.\r\n\r\nAfter tea every one took up some minor occupation or another. One man\r\nrepaired to the riverside, and strolled along the brink--kicking pebbles\r\ninto the water as he did so. Another took a seat in a window, and\r\nfollowed with his eyes each passing occurrence. Should a cat cross the\r\ncourtyard, or a jackdaw fly by, the watcher scanned both the one and the\r\nother, and turned his head to right and to left in order to do so. In\r\nthe same way will dogs spend whole days at a window--their heads thrust\r\ninto the sunlight, and their gaze taking stock of every passer-by.\r\n\r\nThe mother took little Ilya\xe2\x80\x99s head in her hands, drew it down into her\r\nlap, and combed his hair with a gentle caress as, inviting her maids to\r\nadmire him, she talked concerning his future, and preordained for\r\nhim the hero\xe2\x80\x99s part in some splendid epic. For their part, the maids\r\nforetold for him mountains of gold.\r\n\r\nAt length dusk began to draw in. Once more the fire crackled in the\r\nkitchen, and the clatter of knives became audible. Supper was being\r\nprepared. Meanwhile the rest of the servants gathered at the entrance\r\ngates, and thence came sounds of laughter, and of music, and of the\r\nplaying of _gorielki_. The sun had sunk behind the forest, yet still was\r\nsending forth rays in a fiery, faintly warm streak which, as it passed\r\nover the surface of the treetops, touched to gold the tips of the pines.\r\nFinally these rays successively expired, until only a solitary beam\r\ncould be seen fixed, needle-like, in a cluster of boughs before going\r\nto join its comrades. Objects then began to lose their outline, and the\r\nscene to become blurred in, first greyness, then a blank almost of total\r\nobscurity. The songs of birds grew fainter, then ceased altogether, save\r\nfor one persistent singer which, as though disagreeing with its fellows,\r\ncontinued to break the silence with intermittent warbling. Presently it\r\ntoo took to uttering its song at rarer intervals, ana to whistling with\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmore feeble insistence; until finally it breathed a last soft-drawn\r\nnote, gave a flutter or two which gently stirred the foliage around it,\r\nand--fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter that all was silent, save that some crickets were chirping in\r\nchorus and against one another. A mist was rising from the earth, and\r\nspreading over lake and river. Like everything else, the latter had sunk\r\nto rest; and though something caused it to splash for a last time, the\r\nwater instantly resumed its absolute immobility. In the air a dampness\r\ncould be detected, and the air itself could be felt growing warmer and\r\nwarmer. Amid it the trees looked like groups of monsters; and when,\r\nsuddenly, something cracked in the weird depths of the forest, it might\r\nhave been thought that one of those monsters had been shifting its\r\nposition, and with its foot had snapped a dry bough in doing so.\r\nOverhead, the first star could be seen glowing like a living eye, while\r\nin the windows of the house were a few twinkling lights. The hour of\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x99s most solemn, all-embracing silence had arrived--the hour when\r\nthe creative brain can work at its best, and when poetic thought seethes\r\nmost ardently, and when the heart flames with the greatest heat of\r\npassion or with the greatest poignancy of grief--the hour when the\r\ncruel soul ripens to a maximum of strength and composure as it meditates\r\nevil--the hour when, at Oblomovka, every one settled down to a night of\r\nprofound, calm restfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go for a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Ilya to his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the child!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9c_How_ could we go for a walk? It is\r\nnow damp, and you would get your little feet wet. Besides, we should\r\nfind it dreadful out of doors, for at this hour the wood goblin is\r\nabroad, and he carries off little boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what place does he carry them, and what is he like, and where does\r\nhe live?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child; whereupon the mother gave full rein to her\r\nunbridled fancy. As she did so the child listened with blinking\r\neyes; until at length, on sleep completely overcoming him, the nurse\r\napproached, took him from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s lap, and bore him to bed, with\r\nhis head hanging over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother day is over, praise be to God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the inmates of Oblomovka\r\nas, yawning, they made the sign of the cross and then retired to rest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell spent it has been, and God send that to-morrow be like it. Glory,\r\nO Lord, to Thee this night! Glory, O Lord, to Thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov dreamed a second dream. On a long winter\xe2\x80\x99s evening he was\r\npressing close to his nurse, and she was whispering of some unknown\r\ncountry where neither cold nor darkness were known, and where miracles\r\ntook place, and where rivers ran honey and milk, and where no one did\r\nanything the year round, and where only good boys like Ilya Ilyitch\r\nhimself walked day by day in company with maidens such as neither tongue\r\nnor pen could hope to describe. Also (the nurse said) there dwelt there\r\na kind witch who sometimes revealed herself to mortals in the shape of a\r\npikefish; and this witch singled out as her especial favourite a quiet,\r\ninoffensive boor who formerly had been the butt of his fellows, and,\r\nfor some unknown reason, heaped him with her bounty, so that always he\r\npossessed plenty to eat, and clothes ever ready to wear, and ended by\r\nmarrying a marvellous beauty whose name was Militrissa Kirbitievna.\r\n\r\nThe nurse related the story, and the child, with alert eyes and ears,\r\nhung upon her words. So artfully did the nurse or tradition eliminate\r\nfrom the story all resemblance to everyday life that the boy\xe2\x80\x99s keen\r\nintellect and imagination, fired by the device, remained enthralled\r\nuntil, in later years, he had come even to man\xe2\x80\x99s estate. As a matter of\r\nfact, the tale which the nurse thus lovingly related was the legend of\r\nthe fool Emel--that clever, biting satire upon our forefathers and, it\r\nmay be, also upon ourselves. True, in proportion as he grew up, little\r\nOblomov came to learn that no such things as rivers of honey and milk,\r\nor even such persons as kind witches, really existed; yet, though\r\nhe came to smile at his nurse\xe2\x80\x99s stories, that smile was never wholly\r\nsincere, since always it would be accompanied by a sigh. For him the\r\nlegend confounded itself with life, and, unconsciously, he found himself\r\nregretting that the legend differed from life, and that life differed\r\nfrom the legend. Involuntarily he would dream of Militrissa Kirbitievna,\r\nand feel attracted towards the country whereof nothing was known except\r\nthat folk there went for walks, and were free from sorrow and care.\r\nNever could he rid himself of a longing to spend his days in lying upon\r\nthe stove (even as the favourite of the legend had done), and to be\r\ndressed in ready-made, unearned clothes, and to eat at the expense of a\r\nbenevolent witch. To the same story had his father and his grandfather\r\nlistened as, shaped according to the stereotyped version current\r\nthroughout antiquity, it had issued from the mouths of male and female\r\nnurses through the long course of ages and of generations.\r\n\r\nThen Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s nurse proceeded to draw another picture for the\r\nimagination of her charge. That is to say, she told him of the exploits\r\nof the Russian Achilleses and Ulysseses, and of the manner in which\r\nthose heroes had been used to wander about Russia, and to kill and slay;\r\nand of how once they had disputed as to which of them could best drain a\r\nbeaker of wine at a draught. Also, she told the boy of cruel robbers,\r\nof sleeping princesses, and of cities and peoples which had been turned\r\ninto stone. Lastly, she passed to Russian demonology, to dead folk, to\r\nmonsters, and to werewolves. With a simplicity, yet a sincerity, worthy\r\nof Homer, with a lifelike similitude of detail and a power of clear-cut\r\nrelief that might have vied with the great Greek poet\xe2\x80\x99s, she fired\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s intellect and imagination to a love for that Iliad which our\r\nheroes founded during the dim ages when man had not yet become adapted\r\nto the sundry perils and mysteries of nature and of life--when still\r\nhe trembled before werewolves and wood demons, and sought refuge with\r\nprotectors like Alesha Popovitch from the calamities which surrounded\r\nhim--when air and water and forest and held alike were under the\r\ncontinued sway of the supernatural. Truly, the life of a mortal of those\r\ndays must have been full of fear and trembling, seeing that, should he\r\nbut cross his threshold, he stood in danger of being devoured by a wild\r\nbeast, or of having his throat cut by a brigand, or of being despoiled\r\nof his all by a Tartar, or of disappearing from human ken without trace\r\nleft! Again, celestial portents would be seen in the shape cf pillars\r\nand balls of fire, while over a freshly made grave a light would glow,\r\nand some one would seem to be walking through the forest with a lantern,\r\nand laughing horribly, and flashing bright eyes amid the gloom: And in\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s own personality much that passed his understanding would also take\r\nshape and materialize. No matter how long or how righteously a man might\r\nhave lived, he would suddenly start babbling, or shout aloud in a voice\r\nnot his own, or go wandering o\xe2\x80\x99 nights in a trance, or involuntarily\r\nbegin beating and assaulting his fellows. And just at the moment when\r\nsuch things happened a hen would crow like a cock, and a raven would\r\ncroak from the gable! Consequently feeble mankind, peering tremblingly\r\nat life, sought in its own imagination, its own nature, a key to the\r\nmysteries which surrounded it: and it may be that the immobility, the\r\ninertia, the absence of all active passion or incident or peril which\r\nsuch a retired existence imposed upon man led him to create, in the\r\nmidst of the world of nature, another and an impossible world, in which\r\nhe found comfort and relief for his idle intellect, explanations of\r\nthe more ordinary\xe2\x80\x99 sequences of events, and extraneous solutions\r\nof extraordinary phenomena. In fact, our poor forefathers lived by\r\ninstinct. Neither wholly giving rein to nor wholly restraining their\r\nvolition, they found themselves either na\xc3\xafvely surprised at or overcome\r\nwith terror by the evils and the misfortunes which befell them, and\r\nresorted for the causes of these things to the dim, dumb hieroglyphics\r\nof nature. In their opinion, death might come of carrying a corpse\r\nfrom a house head foremost instead of with feet in front, and a fire be\r\ncaused by the fact of a dog having howled, three nights running, beneath\r\na window. Hence always they were at pains to remove a dead person feet\r\nforemost--though continuing to eat the same quantity of food as before,\r\nand to sleep on the bare ground; while, with regard to a howling dog,\r\nalways they drove away the animal with blows--though continuing to\r\nscatter sparks broadcast over tinder-dry floors.\r\n\r\nTo this day the Russian, though surrounded by a stern, unimaginative\r\nworld of reality, loves to believe the seductive talcs of antiquity. And\r\nlong will it be before he will have been weaned from that belief.\r\nIn the same way, as little Oblomov listened to his nurse\xe2\x80\x99s legends\r\nconcerning the Golden Fleece, the great Cassowary Bird, and the cells\r\nand secret dungeons of the Enchanted Castle, he became more and more\r\nfired to the idea that he too was destined to become the hero of doughty\r\ndeeds. Tale succeeded to tale, and the nurse pursued her narrative with\r\nsuch ardour and vividness and attractiveness of description that at\r\ntimes her breath choked in her throat. For she too half-believed the\r\nlegends which she related; so that, during the telling of them, her eyes\r\nwould shoot fire, her head shake with excitement, and her voice attain\r\nan unwonted pitch, while the child, overcome with mysterious horror,\r\nwould press closer and closer to her side, and have tears in his eyes.\r\nWhether the narrative treated of dead men rising from the tomb at\r\nmidnight, or of victims languishing in slavery to a monster, or of a\r\nbear with a wooden leg which went roaming the villages and farms in\r\nsearch of the natural limb which had been chopped from its body, the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s hair bristled with fear, his childish imagination alternately\r\nseethed and froze, and he experienced the harassing, the sickly\r\nsweet, process of having his nerves played upon like the strings of\r\nan instrument. When his nurse repeated the words of the bear, \xe2\x80\x9cCreak,\r\ncreak, wooden leg! I have visited every village and farm, and have\r\nfound all the women asleep save one, who is now sitting on my back, and\r\nsearing my flesh, and weaving my coat into cloth;\xe2\x80\x9d when, also, the bear\r\nentered the right hut, and was just getting ready to pounce upon the\r\ntrue ravisher of his natural leg--why, then the boy could stand it no\r\nlonger, but, trembling and whimpering, flung himself into his nurse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms with tears of terror--yet also with a laugh of joy to think that\r\n_he_ was not in the clutches of the bear, but sitting on the stove couch\r\nbeside his old guardian. Full of strange phantoms was his mind, and\r\nfear and grief had sunk deep (and, possibly, for ever) into his soul.\r\nMournfully he gazed about him, and saw that everything in life was\r\ncharged with evil and misfortune. And as he did so he would keep\r\nthinking of the magic country where neither cruelty nor noise nor grief\r\nexisted, and where Militrissa Kirbitievna lived, and where folk were fed\r\nand clothed for nothing....\r\n\r\nNot only over the Oblomovkan children, but also over the Oblomovkan\r\nadults, did this legend exercise a lifelong sway. Every one in the\r\nhouse and the village alike--from the _barin_ and his wife down to the\r\nblacksmith Tarass--became a trifle nervous as evening drew on, seeing\r\nthat at that hour every tree became transformed into a giant, and every\r\nbush into a robbers\xe2\x80\x99 den. The rattle of a shutter, the howl of the wind\r\nin the chimney, caused these folk to turn pale. At Epiphany-tide not a\r\nman or a woman of them would go out of doors after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night;\r\nand never during the season of Easter would any one venture o\xe2\x80\x99 nights\r\ninto the stable, lest there he should be confronted by the _domovoi_, by\r\nthe horse demon.\r\n\r\nAt Oblomovka _everything_ was believed in--including even ghosts and\r\nwerewolves. Had you informed an inmate of the place that a haycock was\r\nwalking about in the fields, he would have believed it. Had you spread\r\nabroad a rumour that (say) a certain sheep was not a sheep at all, but\r\nsomething else, or that Martha or Stepanida had become turned into a\r\nwitch, the company would thenceforth have walked in terror both of the\r\nsheep and of the maidservant. Never would their heads have thought it\r\nnecessary to inquire _why_ the sheep had ceased to be a sheep, or\r\n_why_ Martha or Stepanida had become turned into a witch. Rather these\r\ncredulous folk would have thrown themselves upon any doubter--so strong\r\nwas Oblomovka\xe2\x80\x99s belief in supernatural phenomena.\r\n\r\nLater, little Oblomov came to see that the world is ordered on a simple\r\nplan, and that dead folk never rise from the tomb, and that no sooner\r\ndo giants appear than they are clapped into booths, as robbers are cast\r\ninto prison: yet, though his actual belief in such marvels vanished,\r\nthere remained behind a sediment of terror and of unaccountable sadness.\r\nNothing was to be apprehended from monsters--that he knew full well; but\r\nalways he stood in awe of something which seemed to be awaiting him\r\nat every step; and, if left alone in a dark room, or if fated to catch\r\nsight of a corpse, he would tremble with that sense of oppressive\r\nforeboding which his infancy had instilled into his very being.\r\nInclined, of a morning, to laugh at his fears, of an evening Lis\r\ncountenance paled again.\r\n\r\nIn the next dream Oblomov saw himself a boy of thirteen or fourteen. By\r\nthis time he was going to school at the village of Verkievo, five\r\nversts from Oblomovka, where an old German named Schtoltz kept a small\r\neducational establishment for the sons of neighbouring gentry. Schtoltz\r\nhad a son of his own--one Andrei, a boy almost of the same age as\r\nOblomov; while likewise he had been given charge of a boy who did\r\nfew lessons, for the reason that he suffered from scrofula and was\r\naccustomed to spend most of his days with his eyes and ears bandaged,\r\nand weeping quietly because he was not living with his grandmother, but,\r\nrather, in a strange house and amid hardhearted folk who never petted\r\nhim or baked him his favourite pies. These three boys constituted\r\nthe only pupils. As for the tutor himself, he was both capable and\r\nstrict--like most Germans; wherefore Oblomov might have received a good\r\neducation had Oblomovka stood _five hundred_ versts from Verklevo. As\r\nit was, the atmosphere, the mode of life, and the customs of Oblomovka\r\nextended also to Verklevo, and the one place represented a sort of\r\nreplica of the other, until only old Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s establishment stood\r\nclear of the primordial mist of laziness, of simplicity of morals, of\r\ninertia, and of immobility for which Oblomovka was distinguished. With\r\nthe scenes, the incidents, and the morals of that mode of life young\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s mind and heart had become saturated before even he had seen\r\nhis first book. Who knows how early the growth of the intellectual germ\r\nin the youthful brain begins? Can we, in that youthful consciousness,\r\nfollow the growth of first impressions and ideas? Possibly, even before\r\na child has learnt to speak, or even to walk, or even to do more than to\r\nlook at things with the dumb, fixed gaze which his elders call\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdull,\xe2\x80\x9d it has already discerned and envisaged the meaning, the\r\ninter-connection, of such phenomena as encompass its sphere--and that\r\nthough the child is still powerless to communicate the fact, whether to\r\nitself or to others.\r\n\r\nThus for a long time past young Oblomov may have remarked and understood\r\nwhat was being said and done in his presence; for a long time past he\r\nmay have understood why his father, in plush breeches and a wadded,\r\ncinnamon-coloured coat, walked to and fro with his hands behind his\r\nback, and took snuff, and sneezed, while his mother passed from coffee\r\nto tea, and from tea to dinner, in the daily round, and his father\r\nalways refused to believe how many sheaves had been cut and reaped, but\r\nwas for ever looking out for derelictions of duty, and, a handkerchief\r\nin his hand, holding forth on the subject of irregularities, and turning\r\nthe whole place upside down. Briefly, for a long time past the boy may\r\nhave decided in his mind that that, and no other, order of life was the\r\nright one. For how else could he have decided? In what manner did the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgrown-ups\xe2\x80\x9d of Oblomovka live? God only knows whether they ever asked\r\nthemselves for what purpose life had been given them. Did they, at all\r\nevents, return themselves any answer to that question? No, no answer at\r\nall, since the whole thing seemed to them at once simple and clear. Had\r\nthey, then, never heard of a hard life wherein people walk with anxious\r\nhearts, and roam the face of the earth, and devote their existence\r\nto everlasting toil? No, the good folk of Oblomovka had no belief in\r\ndisturbing the mind; they never adopted as their mode of life a round\r\nof ceaseless aspirations somewhither, and towards an indefinite end. In\r\nfact, they feared the distraction of passion as they did fire; and\r\nas, in other spheres, men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies burn with the volcanic\r\nviolence of inward and spiritual flame, so the souls of the denizens of\r\nOblomovka lay plunged in an undisturbed inertia which possessed their\r\nease-loving organisms to the core. Consequently, life did not stamp\r\nthem, as it stamped others, with premature wrinkles; nor did it deal\r\nout to them any morally destructive blows or misfortunes. These\r\ngood-humoured folk looked upon life as, rather, an idyll of peace\r\nand inactivity--though an idyll occasionally broken by such untoward\r\nincidents as sicknesses, losses, quarrels, and rare bouts of labour.\r\nThat labour they endured as a punishment formerly imposed upon their\r\nforefathers also; yet they never loved it, and invariably escaped its\r\nincidence whenever they found it possible so to do. Such an avoidance\r\nthey considered permissible, for never did they worry themselves with\r\nvague moral or intellectual questions. In this manner they flourished in\r\nconstant health and cheerfulness: for which reason most of them lived\r\nto a green old age. Men of forty would look like youths, and old men,\r\ninstead of battling with the approach of a hard and painful end, lived\r\nto the utmost possible limit, and then died, as it were, unawares, and\r\nwith a gentle chilling of the frame, and an imperceptible drawing of the\r\nclosing breath. No wonder that in these days folk say that the people\r\nused to be more robust!\r\n\r\nYes, it _was_ more robust, for the reason that in those days parents did\r\nnot hurry to explain to a boy the meaning of life, and to prepare him\r\nfor life as for something at once difficult and solemn. No, they did\r\nnot weary a child with books which would cloud his head with questions\r\nlikely to devour the heart and the intellect, and to shorten existence.\r\nRather, the standard of life was furnished him and taught him by parents\r\nwho had received it ready-made from _their_ parents, together with a\r\ntestamentary injunction to preserve the integrity, the inviolability\r\nof that standard as they would have done that of the Vestal flame. As\r\nthings were done in the time of Oblomovkan fathers and grandfathers,\r\nso were they done in the time of the present Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s tenure of the\r\nestate. Of what needed he to think? Concerning what needed he to trouble\r\nhis head? What needed he to learn? What ends needed he to compass? The\r\nOblomovs required nothing--their life flowed like a peaceful river, and\r\nall that they had to do was to sit on the bank of that river, and to\r\nobserve the inevitable phenomena which, successively, and unsought,\r\npresented themselves to the eyes of each observer.\r\n\r\nBefore the vision of the steeping Oblomov there next uprose a series of\r\nliving pictures of the three chief acts of Oblomovkan life, as played\r\nin the presence of his family, of his relatives, and of his\r\nfriends--namely, the three acts of birth, of marriage, and of death.\r\nThis was succeeded by a varied procession of minor incidents of\r\nlife, whether grave or gay--of baptisms, birthdays, family festivals,\r\nShrovetides, Easters, Convivial feasts, family gatherings, welcomes,\r\nfarewells, and occasions of official congratulation or condolence.\r\nThese passed before Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s vision with solemn exactitude, and also he\r\nbeheld the bearing of familiar faces at these ceremonies, according as\r\nthey were affected by vanity or by care. No matter what the festival\r\nmight be--whether a betrothal or a solemn wedding or a name-day--every\r\npossible social rule had to be consulted, and no mistake made as to\r\nwhere each person was to sit, what presents, and to what value, ought\r\nto be given, who was to walk with whom at the ceremony, and what signals\r\nhad best be made during its course.\r\n\r\nDo you think, then, that goodly children would not result from such\r\nformal unitings? For answer you would need but to look at the rosy,\r\nheavy little cupids which the mothers of the place carried or led by\r\nthe hand. Every one of those mothers would have insisted that their\r\nlittle ones were the plumpest, the whitest, and the healthiest children\r\npossible. Another local custom was to make a lark-pie as soon as spring\r\ncame in. Without it spring would not have been spring at all, for\r\nobservances of this kind comprised the whole life, the whole scientific\r\nknowledge, of the inhabitants, all of whose joys and sorrows were bound\r\nup with Oblomovka, and whose hearts beat high at the anticipation\r\nof such local rites and feasts and ceremonies. Yet no sooner had they\r\nchristened, married, or buried an individual than they forgot both the\r\nlatter and his (or her) fate, and relapsed into their usual apathy until\r\naroused by a new occasion--by a baptism, a wedding, or other happening\r\nof the kind. Directly a child was born the parents made it their\r\nfirst care to perform over the little one every ceremony prescribed\r\nby decorum, and then to follow up the christening with a banquet.\r\nThereafter the child\xe2\x80\x99s bringing up began according to a system dictated\r\nby the mother and the nurse for his healthy development, and for his\r\nprotection from cold, from the evil eye, and from sundry other inimical\r\ninfluences. Indeed, no pains were spared to keep the youngster in good\r\nappetite and spirits. Also as soon as he was able to fend for himself,\r\nand a nurse had become a superfluity, his mother would be seized with a\r\ndesire to procure for him a helpmeet as strong and as ruddy as himself;\r\nwhereupon there would ensue a further epoch of rites and feastings,\r\nuntil eventually a marriage had been arranged. Always this consummation\r\nrepresented the epitome of life\xe2\x80\x99s incidents, and as soon as it was\r\nreached there began a repetition of births, rites, and banquets, until,\r\nfinally, a funeral ceremony interrupted the festivities--though not\r\nfor long, since other faces would appear to succeed the old ones, and\r\nchildren would become youths and maidens, and plight their troth to\r\none another, and marry one another, and produce individuals similar to\r\nthemselves. Thus life stretched out in a continuous, uniform chain which\r\nbroke off imperceptibly only when the tomb had been reached.\r\n\r\nTime, the rare times when other cares overtook the good folk of\r\nOblomovka, but always they faced the situation with stoical immobility,\r\nand the said cares, after circling over their heads, flew away like\r\nbirds which, having sought to cling to a smooth, perpendicular wall,\r\nfind that they are fluttering their wings in vain against the stubborn\r\nstone, and therefore spread those pinions and depart. For instance, on\r\none occasion a portion of the gallery around the house fell upon, and\r\nburied under its ruins, a hencoop full of poultry, as well as, in doing\r\nso, narrowly missed a serving-woman who happened to be sitting near the\r\nspot with her husband. At once the establishment was in an uproar. Every\r\none came running to the scene, under the impression that not only the\r\nhencoop, but also the _barinia_ and little Ilya, were lying under the\r\n_debris_. Every one held up his or her hands in horror, and fell to\r\nblaming every one else for not having foreseen the catastrophe. Every\r\none expressed surprise that the gallery had fallen, and also surprise\r\nthat it had not fallen long ago. Upon that there ensued a clamour and a\r\ndiscussion as to how things could best be put right; after which, with\r\nsighs of regret for the poultry, the company slowly dispersed, while\r\nstrictly forbidding little Ilya to approach the rums. Three weeks later\r\nAndrushka, Petrushka, and Vassika were ordered to chop the planks\r\nand the remainder of the balustrade in pieces, and then to remove the\r\nfragments to the outbuildings, lest the road should become obstructed;\r\nand in the outbuildings those fragments tossed about until the following\r\nspring. Every time that the elder Oblomov saw them from the window\r\nhe fell to thinking, what had best be done with them. Summoning the\r\ncarpenter, he took counsel with the man as to whether he had better\r\nbuild a new gallery or pull down what was left of the old one; until\r\nfinally he dismissed his subordinate with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wait a\r\nlittle until I have considered the matter further.\xe2\x80\x9d The same thing went\r\non until, one day, either Vassika or Motika reported to the _barin_ that\r\nthat morning, while he (Vassika or Motika) had been climbing over the\r\nremains of the old gallery, the corners of it had come away from the\r\nwalls, and more of the structure had fallen; whereupon the carpenter was\r\nsummoned to a final consultation, and the upshot was that some of the\r\nold fragments were used to prop the remaining portions of the gallery.\r\nSure enough, by the close of the month this had been done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that gallery looks as good as new,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said to his wife.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how splendidly Thedot has re-erected the beams! They resemble the\r\npillars which the Governor has just had fitted to his house. The job has\r\nbeen well done, and will last for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere some one reminded him that it would be as well also to have the\r\ngates rehung and the veranda repaired, since the holes in the steps to\r\nthe latter were affording access, not only to the cats, but also to the\r\npigs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, it _ought_ to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said the _barin_ thoughtfully.\r\nThen he went out to look at the veranda. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly the thing is\r\nbreaking up,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued as he see-sawed one of the planks like a\r\ncradle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been loose ever since the veranda was made,\xe2\x80\x9d some one\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the _barin_. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are loose only because the floor has\r\nnot been mended for sixteen years. It was done then by Luka. He _was_ a\r\ncarpenter, if you like! Now he is dead, may God rest his soul! Workmen\r\nare not as clever as they used to be--they merely spoil things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom that old Oblomov turned his attention to something else; and to\r\nthis day--so report has it--the veranda is rickety, though not actually\r\nfallen to pieces. Certainly Luka _must_ have been a good workman!\r\n\r\nHowever, to do the master and the mistress justice, they were capable of\r\nbeing shaken out of their apathy, even to the point of growing angry and\r\nheated, should any failure or misfortune occur. How, they would inquire,\r\ncould such and such a matter have come to be overlooked or neglected? At\r\nonce due measures must be taken. Perhaps this would be relative to\r\nthe fact that the footbridge over the moat needed mending, or that the\r\ngarden fence called for repairs at a spot where the planking was lying\r\nflat upon the ground and allowing the cattle to enter and spoil the\r\nshrubs. Indeed, so solicitous was the _barin_ for his property that\r\nonce, when walking in the garden, he, with his own hands, and with\r\nmany grunts and groans, lifted up a length of fencing, and ordered the\r\ngardener to fix a couple of props to the same; and to this activity on\r\nthe part of the proprietor was due the fact that the said fence remained\r\nupright during the whole of the remainder of the summer--until once more\r\na winter snowstorm laid it low. Also, when Antip, with his horse and\r\nwater-cart, fell through the bridge into the moat three new planks were\r\ninserted into the structure! Indeed, Antip had not recovered from his\r\nbruising before the bridge was looking almost as good as new! And even\r\nwhen the garden fence collapsed a second time the cows and the goats\r\ndid not reap very much advantage from the event. True, they managed to\r\ndevour a few currant-bushes, and also to strip a dozen lime-trees; but\r\nbefore they could begin also upon the apple-trees an order was issued\r\nthat the fence should be properly dug in and reditched. But this was\r\nonly after two cows and a goat had been caught redhanded. You should\r\nhave seen the distension of their stomachs with the generous fare!...\r\n\r\nOnce more Oblomov dreamed that he was in the great, dark drawing-room at\r\nhome. The long winter\xe2\x80\x99s evening was closing in, and his mother, seated\r\non the sofa and engaged in quietly knitting a boy\xe2\x80\x99s stocking, was\r\nyawning occasionally, and scratching her head with a knitting-needle.\r\nBeside her were two maids--their heads bent over their work as\r\nindustriously they fashioned a holiday garment either for young Ilya\r\nor for his father or for themselves. Meanwhile the _barin_, with hands\r\nclasped behind his back, was pacing cheerfully to and fro, or seating\r\nhimself on a chair for a moment or two before resuming his walk. Ever\r\nand anon, too, he would take a pinch of snuff, sneeze, and then take\r\nanother pinch. As for light, it came from a single tallow candle, and\r\neven the said candle was a luxury permitted only on autumn and winter\r\nevenings; for in summer every one contrived to rise and to go to bed by\r\ndaylight, so that candles might be saved altogether. This was a practice\r\nwhich had arisen partly from custom and partly from economy. Of every\r\ncommodity not produced at home, but requiring, rather, to be bought, the\r\ngood folk of Oblomovka were extremely parsimonious; so that, although\r\nthey would willingly slaughter a fine gamefowl or a dozen young pullets\r\nfor a guest\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment, not a raisin too much would be put into\r\na pudding, and every face would whiten if the said guest should pour\r\nhimself out a second glassful of wine. Very seldom, however, did such\r\n_contretemps_ occur: only the most abandoned of wretches would have\r\ndone things like those--and guests of that kidney never obtained even\r\nadmittance to Oblomovka. Local manners required that, what though twice\r\nor thrice invited to partake of a given dish or a given bottle of wine,\r\nthe guest should _not_ do so, since he was supposed to be aware that\r\neven the first invitation had conveyed a secret prayer that he would\r\nkindly abstain from the dish or bottle of wine after merely tasting\r\nof the same. Nor were two candles lit for every guest, since candles\r\nrequired to be bought in the town, and therefore, like all other\r\npurchased articles, were kept under lock and key by the lady of the\r\nhouse, and, with the candle-ends, were counted before being stored away.\r\n\r\nIn short, Oblomovka disliked disbursing hard cash; so much so that,\r\nhowever much a given article might be required, the money for it would\r\nbe handed out with reluctance, however insignificant the sum. As for any\r\n_considerable_ outlay, it was accompanied with groans, lamentations, and\r\nhigh words, since the Oblomovkans would suffer any kind of misfortune\r\nrather than part with their coin. For this reason the sofa in the\r\ndrawing-room had long been in rags, and the leather on the _barin\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\narm-chair leather only by courtesy, since most of its cord and rope\r\nstuffing was now exposed, and only a single strip of the original\r\ncovering clung to the back of the chair--the rest having, during the\r\npast five years, become split into strips, and fallen away. For the same\r\nreason the entrance gates had sagged, and the veranda become rickety.\r\nNevertheless, to pay out, say, from two to five hundred roubles for a\r\ngiven purpose, however necessary that purpose might be, seemed to the\r\ninhabitants of the establishment something almost approaching suicide.\r\nIn fact, on hearing that a young landowner of the neighbourhood had\r\ngone to Moscow and there paid three hundred roubles for a dozen shirts,\r\ntwenty-five for a pair of boots, and forty for a waistcoat (it was on\r\nthe occasion of the landowner\xe2\x80\x99s marriage), old Oblomov crossed himself,\r\nand exclaimed with an expression of horror:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat young man ought to be clapped into prison!\xe2\x80\x9d In general, the\r\nOblomovkans paid no heed to politico-economic axioms concerning the\r\nnecessity of swift, brisk circulation of capital, or concerning the\r\nactive production and exchange of commodities. In the simplicity of\r\ntheir souls they considered that the best theory, as well as the best\r\npractice, with regard to capital was to hoard it.\r\n\r\nOn chairs in the drawing-room there would be seated snoring, in\r\ndifferent attitudes, the gentry and customary intimates of the house.\r\nFor the most part a profound silence would reign among them, for they\r\nsaw one another every day, and their respective stores of intellectual\r\nwealth had long been tapped and explored, while news from without\r\narrived but scantily. Indeed, amid the stillness the only sound to be\r\nheard would be that of old Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s heavy, workaday slippers, the dull\r\nbeat of the clock in its case, and the snapping of thread as one or\r\nanother of the sewing party bit or broke off a piece. Perhaps after half\r\nan hour of this one of those present would yawn--then make the sign of\r\nthe cross over the lips, and murmur: \xe2\x80\x9cLord, pardon me!\xe2\x80\x9d Next, some one\r\nwould follow suit, and then a third, until the infectious desire to\r\nventilate the lungs had gone the round of the company. Next, old Oblomov\r\nwould approach the window, look through it, and say with a touch of\r\nsurprise: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, yet already it is dark in the courtyard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d some one would answer, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis always dark by this time. The\r\nlong evenings are beginning to draw in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spring, contrariwise, the company would fall to expressing surprise\r\nand gratification at the thought that the long _days_ were approaching.\r\nYet, had you inquired what the long days meant to them, they could not\r\npossibly have told you! After this episode silence would resume its\r\nsway, until, perhaps, in snuffing the candle, some one would chance to\r\nextinguish it. Upon that every one would give a start, and one of the\r\ncompany would be sure to ejaculate:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn unexpected guest is making his way in our direction.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact,\r\nit was not an uncommon phenomenon for the incident to give rise to a\r\nlengthy conversation.\r\n\r\nTime, at Oblomovka, was reckoned mostly by festivals, by the seasons\r\nof the year, and by various family and domestic events--no reference\r\nwhatsoever being made, to months or to the days of a month. This may\r\nhave partly arisen from the fact that none but old Oblomov were capable\r\nof distinguishing between the names of the months and the dates in a\r\ngiven month.\r\n\r\nPresently the head of the family would relapse into meditation, while\r\nlittle Ilya, lolling behind his mother\xe2\x80\x99s back, would also be sunk in\r\ndreams, and at times actually dozing. Suddenly old Oblomov would (to\r\ntake a typical incident) halt in the middle of his pacing, and clap his\r\nhand anxiously to the tip of his nose; whereupon there would ensue some\r\nsuch dialogue as the following:\r\n\r\n_The master of the house:_ What on earth is the matter with me? See!\r\nSome one must have passed away, for the tip of my nose is itching!\r\n\r\n_His wife:_ Good Lord! Why should any one have passed away because\r\nthe _tip_ of your nose is sore? Some one has passed away only when the\r\n_bridge_ of one\xe2\x80\x99s nose is hurting one. What a forgetful man you are, to\r\nbe sure! Were you to say a thing like that before strangers, you would\r\nmake us blush for you.\r\n\r\n_The master of the house:_ But _every_ part of my nose is hurting me?\r\n\r\n_His wife:_ Pain at the side of it means news to come; in the eyebrows,\r\nsorrow; in the forehead, a greeting; on the right side, a man; on the\r\nleft side, a woman; in the ears, rain; in the lips, a kiss; in the\r\nwhiskers, a present of something to eat; in the elbow, a new place to\r\nsleep in; and in the sole of the foot, a journey.\r\n\r\nAnd so forth, and so forth.\r\n\r\nLastly, when nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock had struck there would follow supper; after\r\nwhich the company would disperse to rest, and sleep would once more\r\nreign over the care-free heads of the Oblomovkans.\r\n\r\nIn his dream Oblomov saw not only an evening spent in this manner, but\r\nwhole weeks and months and years of such evening\xe2\x80\x99s. Never did anything\r\noccur to interrupt the uniformity of that life, nor were the Oblomovkans\r\nin any way wearied by it, since they could conceive no other existence,\r\nand would have turned from any other with distaste. Had there been\r\nimported into that existence any change due to circumstances, they would\r\nhave regretted the fact, and felt troubled by the thought that to-morrow\r\nwas not going to be precisely as to-day. What wanted _they_ with the\r\ndiversity, the changes, the incidents, for which others yearned? \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nothers drink of that cup,\xe2\x80\x9d said they; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for us Oblomovkans--no\r\nsuch thing. Let others live as they please.\xe2\x80\x9d Incident--even pleasing\r\nincident--they considered to bring disturbance and fuss and worry and\r\ncommotion in its train, so that one could not sit quietly in one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseat and just talk and eat one\xe2\x80\x99s meals. Therefore, as decade succeeded\r\ndecade, the Oblomovkans dozed and yawned, and indulged in good-humoured\r\nlaughter at rustic jests, and assembled in corners to relate of what\r\nthey had dreamed during the previous night. Had their dreams been\r\nunpleasant, the company at once became thoughtful and nervous, and\r\nrefrained from jesting. On the other hand, had their dreams been of\r\na prophetic nature, at once the company grew cheerful or despondent,\r\naccording as the visions had promised sorrow or joy. Lastly, had\r\ntheir dreams called for the consideration of some portent, the company\r\nproceeded to take such active measures as might be necessary to deal\r\nwith the situation. Also, every one indulged in card-playing, games of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfools,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth; while, as for the womenfolk, they would discuss\r\nthe neighbourhood, and pry not only into its family life and social\r\ngaiety, but also into its secret ends and desires. About these they\r\nwould dispute, and then pass censure upon various persons (more\r\nparticularly upon unfaithful husbands), and relate details of birthdays,\r\nchristenings, namedays, and dinner parties, with the lists of the\r\ninvited and non-invited guests. Likewise they would show one another\r\nvarious articles of their wardrobes, and the hostess would proudly vaunt\r\nthe merits of her sheets, her knitted garments, and her lace of home\r\nmanufacture. Yet at length even these things would begin to pall;\r\nwhereupon coffee, tea, and cakes would be served, and a silence, broken\r\nonly by desultory remarks, ensue.\r\n\r\nOf course, also, there were certain rare occasions when these methods\r\nof spending the time were interrupted by such happenings as the entire\r\nhousehold falling ill of a fever, or some member of it either tripping\r\nover a stake in the dark or falling out of the hayloft or being struck\r\non the head by a beam which had slipped from the roof. Yet, as I say,\r\nsuch events were rare, and when they occurred, every known and tried\r\ndomestic remedy was brought into play. The injured spot was rubbed\r\nwith ointment, a dose of holy water was administered, a prayer was\r\nmuttered--and all was well. On the other hand, a winter headache * was\r\nquite a common phenomenon and in that case the household would retire\r\nto bed, groans and sighs would resound. One person would wrap a cucumber\r\npoultice and insert cranberries in his ears. A third walk about with\r\nnothing on but his shirt conscious, roll about the room at regular\r\nperiods of once or twice a month. This happened, for the reason that the\r\nOblomovkans did not like to allow any superfluous heat to escape by\r\nthe chimney, but covered the stoves when the flames were rising high.\r\nConsequently upon no single stove-couch or stove could a hand be laid\r\nwithout danger of that hand being blistered.\r\n\r\n     *   Due to the fumes of the charcoal used for heating\r\n     purposes.\r\n\r\nOnly once was the monotony of Oblomovkan life broken by a wholly\r\nunexpected circumstance. The household, exhausted by the labours of\r\ndinner, had assembled for tea, when there entered a local peasant who\r\nhad just been making an expedition to the town. Thrusting his hand into\r\nhis bosom, he with difficulty produced a much-creased letter, addressed\r\nto the master of the house. Every one sat thunderstruck, and even the\r\nmaster himself changed countenance. Not an eye was there which did not\r\ndart glances at the missive. Not a nose was there which was not strained\r\nin its direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow unlooked for!\xe2\x80\x9d at length said the mistress of the household as she\r\nrecovered herself. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom can the letter have come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Oblomov took it, and turned it over in his hands, as though at a\r\nloss what to do with the epistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get it from?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired of the peasant. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who gave\r\nit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got it at the inn where I put up,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cTwice did folk\r\ncome from the post-office to inquire if any peasantry from Oblomovka\r\nwere there, since a letter was awaiting the _barin_. The first time they\r\ncame, I kept quiet, and the postman took the letter away; but afterwards\r\nthe deacon of Verklevo saw me, and they came and gave me the letter, and\r\nmade me pay five kopecks for it. I asked them what I was to do with the\r\nletter, and they said that I was to hand it to your Honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen at first you refused it?\xe2\x80\x99 the mistress remarked sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I refused it. What should _we_ want with letters? _We_ have no\r\nneed for them, nor had I any orders to take charge of such things. So I\r\nwas afraid to touch it. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you go too fast with that thing,\xe2\x80\x99 I said\r\nto myself. Yet how the postman abused me! He would have complained to\r\nthe authorities had I left the letter where it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the lady of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd from whom can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Oblomov meditatively as he studied\r\nthe address. \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow I seem to know the handwriting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon that the missive fell to being passed from one person to another;\r\nand much guessing and discussion began. Finally the company had to own\r\nitself nonplussed. The master of the house ordered his spectacles to be\r\nfetched, and quite an hour and a half were consumed in searching for the\r\nsame; but at length be put them on, and then bethought him of opening\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, hastily, arresting his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\nbreak the seal. Who knows what the letter may contain? It may portend\r\nsomething dreadful, some misfortune. To what have we not come nowadays?\r\nTo-morrow, or the day after, will be soon enough. The letter will not\r\nwalk away of itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the letter was placed under lock and key, and tea passed round.\r\nIn fact, the document would have lain there for a year, had it not\r\nconstituted a phenomenon so unusual as to continue to excite the\r\nOblomovkans\xe2\x80\x99 curiosity. Both after tea and on the following day the talk\r\nwas of nothing else. At length things could no longer be borne, and on\r\nthe fourth day, the company being assembled, the seal was diffidently\r\nbroken, and old Oblomov glanced at the signature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRadistchev!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo the message is from Philip Matveitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Ah! From _him_, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d resounded on all sides. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think that he\r\nis actually alive! Glory be to God! And what does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon that old Oblomov started to read the letter aloud. It seemed that\r\nPhilip Matveitch desired him to forward the recipe for a certain beer\r\nwhich was brewed at Oblomovka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen send it, send it,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the chorus. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and also write him\r\nan answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo weeks elapsed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally we _must_ write that note,\xe2\x80\x9d old Oblomov kept repeating. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nis the recipe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it still has to be looked for.\r\nWait a little. Why need we hurry? Should God be good, we shall soon be\r\nhaving another festival, and eating flesh again. Let us write _then_. I\r\ntell you, the recipe won\xe2\x80\x99t run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I daresay it would be better to write when we have reached the\r\nfestival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSure enough, the said festival arrived, and again there was talk of the\r\nletter. In fact, old Oblomov did in truth get himself ready to write it.\r\nHe shut himself up in his study, he put on his spectacles, and he sat\r\ndown to the table. Everything in the house was profoundly quiet, since\r\norders had been issued that the establishment was not to stamp upon\r\nthe floor, nor, indeed, to make a noise of any kind. \xe2\x80\x9cThe _barin_ is\r\nwriting,\xe2\x80\x9d was said in much the same tone of respectful awe that might\r\nhave been used had a dead person been lying in the house.\r\n\r\nHardly had old Oblomov inscribed the words \xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir\xe2\x80\x9d--slowly and\r\ncrookedly, and with a shaking hand, and as cautiously, as though he had\r\nbeen engaged in a dangerous task--when there entered to him his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have searched and searched,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut can find no recipe.\r\nNevertheless the bedroom wardrobe still remains to be ransacked, so\r\n_how_ can you write the letter now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ought to go by the next post,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will it cost to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Oblomov produced an ancient calendar. \xe2\x80\x9cForty kopecks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You are going to throw away _forty kopecks_ on such a trifle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had far better wait until we are sending other things\r\nalso to the town. Let the peasants know about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _might_ be better,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed old Oblomov, tapping his pen against\r\nthe table. With that he replaced the pen in the inkstand, and took off\r\nhis spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _might_ be better,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\r\n\r\nAnd to this day no one knows how long Philip Matveitch had to wait for\r\nthat recipe.\r\n\r\nAlso, there were times when old Oblomov actually took a book in his\r\nhands. What book it might be he did not care, for he felt no actual\r\ncraving to read; he looked upon literature as a mere luxury which could\r\neasily be indulged in, or be done without, even as one might have\r\na picture on one\xe2\x80\x99s wall, or one might not--one might go out for an\r\noccasional walk, or one might not. Hence, as I say, he was indifferent\r\nto the identity of a book, since he looked upon such articles as mere\r\ninstruments of distraction from _ennui_ and lack of employment. Also,\r\nhe always adopted towards authors that half-contemptuous attitude which\r\nused to be maintained by gentry of the _ancien r\xc3\xa9gime_; for, like\r\nmany of his day, he considered a writer of books to be a roisterer, a\r\nne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-well, a drunkard, a sort of merry-andrew. Also, he would read\r\naloud items of intelligence from journals three years old--such items\r\nas, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is reported from The Hague that, on returning to the Palace from\r\na short drive, the King gazed at the assembled onlookers through\r\nhis spectacles,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAt Vienna such and such an Ambassador has just\r\npresented his Letter of Credentials.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, there was a day when he read aloud the intelligence that a\r\ncertain work by a foreign writer had just been translated into Russian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only reason why they go in for translating such things,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\na small landowner who happened to be present, \xe2\x80\x9cis that they may wheedle\r\nmore money out of us _dvorian\xc3\xa9_.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n     *  Squires, or gentry\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the little Ilya was engaged in journeying backwards and\r\nforwards to Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s school every Monday, when he awoke, he felt\r\novercome with depression, should he happen to hear Vassika\xe2\x80\x99s rapping\r\nvoice shout aloud from the veranda: \xe2\x80\x9cAntipka, harness the piebald, as\r\nthe young _barin_ has to drive over to the German\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, then Ilya\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart would tremble, and he would repair sadly to his mother, who would\r\nknow why he did so, and begin to gild the pill, while secretly sighing\r\nto herself at the thought that she was to be parted from the lad for a\r\nwhole week. Indeed, on such mornings he could scarcely be given enough\r\nto eat, and scarcely could a sufficiency of buns and cakes and pies and\r\nsweetmeats be made to take with him (the said sufficiency being based\r\nupon an assumption that at the German\xe2\x80\x99s the pupils fared far from\r\nrichly).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne couldn\xe2\x80\x99t overeat oneself there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Oblomovkans. \xe2\x80\x9cFor dinner\r\none gets nothing but soup, roast, and cabbage, for tea only cold meat,\r\nand for supper _morgen fri_.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n     *  German black pudding.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were Mondays when he did _not_ hear Vassika\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nordering the piebald to be harnessed, and when his mother met him with\r\na smile and the pleasant tidings, that he was not to go to school that\r\nday, since the following Thursday would be a holiday, and it was not\r\nworth while for him to make the journey to and fro for a stay only of\r\nthree days. At other times he would be informed that that week was\r\nthe Week of Kindred, * and that therefore cake-baking, and not\r\nbook-learning, would be the order of the day. Or on a Monday morning his\r\nmother would glance at him, and say: \xe2\x80\x9cYour eyes look dull to-day. Are\r\nyou _sure_ that you are well?\xe2\x80\x9d Then she would shake her head dubiously,\r\nand though the crafty youngster would be in perfect health, he would\r\nhold his tongue on the subject. Thereafter she would continue: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nstay at home this week, for God knows what might happen to you at that\r\nother place.\xe2\x80\x9d And in her decision she would be confirmed by the whole\r\nof the rest of the household. True, these fond parents were not blind\r\nto the value of education; it was that they realized only its _external_\r\nvalue. That is to say, they could not look beyond the fact that\r\neducation enabled folk to get on in the world so far as the acquisition\r\nof rank, crosses, and money was concerned. Certain evil rumours had\r\narisen regarding the necessity, of learning not only one\xe2\x80\x99s letters, but\r\nalso various branches of science which until now had remained unknown to\r\nthe world of Oblomovka; but, as I say, the good folk of that place had\r\nonly the dimmest, the remotest, comprehension of any _internal_ demand\r\nfor education, and therefore desired to secure for their little Ilya\r\nonly certain showy advantages, and no more--to wit, a fine uniform, and\r\nthe getting of him into the Civil Service (his mother even foresaw him\r\nbecome a provincial governor!). Yet this, they thought, ought to be\r\nattained at as little cost as possible, and by means of a covert evasion\r\nof the various rocks and barriers which lay strewn about the path of\r\nenlightenment. Yes, those rocks and barriers, they said, must be walked\r\naround, not scaled; learning must be assimilated lightly, and not at the\r\ncost of exhaustion both of body and mind. In their view the process\r\nneed be continued only until the little Ilya had obtained some sort of a\r\ncertificate to the effect that he had been through \xe2\x80\x9ca course of the arts\r\nand sciences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     * Week of the Dead.\r\n\r\nBut to this Oblomovkan system old Schtoltz was wholly opposed; and\r\nprobably his German persistency would have carried the day, had he not\r\nhad to contend with difficulties even in his own camp. That is to say,\r\nhis son was accustomed to spoil young Oblomov by doing his exercises for\r\nhim, and prompting him in his translations. Also, young Oblomov could\r\nclearly discern the differences between his home life and life at\r\nschool. At home, no sooner would he have awakened than he would find\r\nZakhar standing by his bed. Even as the nurse had done, Zakhar would\r\ndraw on for the lad his stockings, and put on his boots; and if Master\r\nIlya--now become a boy of fourteen--did not altogether approve of\r\nZakhar\xe2\x80\x99s performances he would nudge the valet on the nose with his toe.\r\nMoreover, should the boy at any time want anything, he had three or\r\nfour servants to hasten to do his bidding; and in this fashion he never\r\nlearnt what it was to do a single thing for himself. Yet in the end his\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 fond solicitude wearied him for at no time could he even\r\ncross the courtyard, or descend the staircase, without hearing himself\r\nfollowed by shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, Ilya?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you\r\ndo that?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYou will fall and hurt yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d Thus, pampered like an\r\nexotic plant in a greenhouse, he grew up slowly and drowsily, and in\r\na way which turned his energies inwards, and gradually caused them to\r\nwither.\r\n\r\nYet on rare occasions he would still awake as fresh and vigorous and\r\ncheerful as ever; he would awake feeling that an imp of mischief was\r\negging him on to climb the roof, or to go and roll in a field, or to\r\nrush round the meadow where the hay was being cut, or to perch himself\r\non the top of a fence, or to start teasing the farm dogs--in short, to\r\ntake to running hither and thither and everywhere.\r\n\r\nAt length the thing was no longer to be borne; no longer could he resist\r\nthe imp\xe2\x80\x99s prompting. One winter\xe2\x80\x99s morning, capless, he leaped from\r\nthe veranda into the courtyard, and thence through the entrance gates.\r\nThereafter, rolling a snowball hastily in his hands, he darted towards\r\na crowd of boys. The fresh air cut his face, the frost nipped his ears,\r\nhis mouth and throat felt choked with cold, but in his breast there was\r\na great joy. He rushed forward as fast as his legs could carry him, he\r\nshouted and he laughed. In two seconds he was in the thick of the\r\nboys. One snowball he threw--it achieved a miss; a second snowball he\r\nthrew--it achieved the same; and just as he was seizing a third his face\r\nbecame converted into one large clot of snow. He fell, and, being unused\r\nto falling, hurt himself; yet still he laughed merrily, though the tears\r\nhad sprung to his eyes. Behind the knot of youngsters ran two dogs,\r\npulling at their clothes; for, as every one knows, dogs cannot with\r\nequanimity see a human being running. Thus the whole gang sped through\r\nthe village--a noisy, shouting, barking crew. At length the lads were\r\ncaught, and justice was meted out--to one on the head, to a second on\r\nthe ears, to a third on the rump. Also, the fathers of the culprits were\r\nthreatened with retribution. As for the young _barin_, he was hastily\r\nthrust into a snatched-up greatcoat, then into his father\xe2\x80\x99s sheepskin,\r\nand, lastly, into a couple of quilts; after which he was borne homeward\r\nin triumph. The entire household had expected to behold him arrive in a\r\nmoribund condition; and indescribable was his parents\xe2\x80\x99 delight on seeing\r\nhim carried in both alive and unharmed..Yes, they gave thanks to God,\r\nthey dosed the boy with mint and elderberry wine and raspberry syrup,\r\nand they kept him three days in bed--although the one thing that would\r\nhave done him any good would have been to have let him go out again and\r\nplay in the snow!\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nEntering quietly, Zakhar tried to arouse the sleeper, but failed.\r\nSuddenly a loud laugh proceeded from the neighbourhood of the door.\r\nOblomov started up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchtoltz! Schtoltz!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried rapturously as he threw himself upon the\r\nnewcomer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOften Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s old school friend had endeavoured--though in vain--to\r\nwean his comrade from the state of inertia in which he (Oblomov) was\r\nplunged. The pair were discussing the same subject in Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce upon a time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schtoltz, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember you a slim, lively young\r\nfellow. Have you forgotten our joint readings of Rousseau, Schiller,\r\nGoethe, and Byron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I forgotten them?\xe2\x80\x9d re-echoed Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. How could I forget\r\nthem? How I used to dream over those books, and to whisper to myself\r\nmy hopes for the future, and to make plans of all sorts!--though I kept\r\nthem from you for fear lest you would laugh at them. But that expired\r\nat Verklevo; and never since has it been repeated. What is the reason,\r\nI would ask? Never have I gone through any great mental tempest or\r\nupheaval, my conscience is as clear as a mirror, and no adverse stroke\r\nof fortune has occurred to destroy my self-conceit. Yet for some reason\r\nor another I have gone to pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Andrei, at no\r\npoint in my life have I been touched with a fire which could either save\r\nme or destroy me. I have lived a life different from that of others.\r\nWith me it has not been a morning dawn which, gradually broadening to\r\na sultry, bustling noon, has faded, imperceptibly, naturally, into\r\neventide. No, I _began_ life with a quenching of the light of day, and,\r\nfrom the first moment that I realized myself, realized also that I\r\nwas on the wane. I realized that fact as I sat at my desk in the\r\nchancellory, as I read, as I consorted with friends, as I squandered\r\nmy means upon Minia, as I lounged on the Nevski Prospect, as I attended\r\nreceptions where I was welcomed as an eligible _parti_, as I wasted\r\nmy life and brains in fluctuating between town and country. Even my\r\nself-conceit--upon what was it flung away? Upon figuring in clothes made\r\nby a good tailor, upon gaining the _entr\xc3\xa9e_ to well-known houses, upon\r\nhaving my hand shaken by Prince P------! Yet self-conceit ought to\r\nbe the very salt of life. Whither is mine gone? Either I have never\r\nunderstood the life of which I speak or it was never suited to me. Oh,\r\nthat I had never known or seen it, that no one had ever pointed it out\r\nto me! For yourself, you entered and left my orbit like a bright, swift\r\ncomet; and when you were gone I forgot everything, and began to fade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Schtoltz listened to Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s words there was no trace of a\r\ncontemptuous smile on his features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Oblomov, \xe2\x80\x9cyou said that my face had lost its\r\nfreshness and colour. Yes, that is so. I am like a ragged, cast-off\r\ngarment--though less from the fact that during the past twelve years\r\nthere has lain within me a light that has ever been seeking an outlet,\r\nbut has been doomed to illumine only its own prison. Now, therefore,\r\nunable to gain its freedom, it is becoming altogether extinguished. Am I\r\nalone in this, however? Look around you. The name of the tribe to which\r\nI belong is legion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I intend to take you travelling with me,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nSchtoltz, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will start to-morrow. It must be done now or\r\nnever.\xe2\x80\x9d With that he went to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow or never.\xe2\x80\x9d Somehow to Oblomov the words seemed a sort of threat. He\r\napproached his dusty writing-table, and took up a pen. Of ink there\r\nwas none, nor yet a single scrap of writing-paper. Mechanically and\r\nat random he traced some letters in the dust with his finger. There\r\nresulted the word _Oblomovstchina_. * He obliterated it with a quick\r\nmovement of his sleeve. Often in his dreams had he seen the word\r\nwritten in letters of fire on the ceiling, even as once Belshazzar saw\r\ncharacters traced on the wall of his banqueting-room. \xe2\x80\x9cNow or never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Oblomov listened to this last despairing call of his reason and his\r\nenergy, and, weighing; in the balance what little volition still\r\nremained to him, considered to what end he could best devote that sorry\r\nfragment. Which was he to do? To go forward or to stand still? To go\r\nforward would mean divesting, not only his shoulders, but also his\r\nintellect, his soul, of his dressing-gown; it would mean sweeping away,\r\nnot only from his chamber walls, but also from his eyes, the dust and\r\nthe cobwebs. Yet how was he to take the first step necessary? Where was\r\nhe to begin? He remembered Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x9cGo to Oblomovka, and there\r\nlearn what sowing and grinding mean, and why the peasant is poor or\r\nrich. Walk the fields, attend the local elections, visit the mills, and\r\nlinger by the river wharves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     *  The disease of Oblomovka. See later.\r\n\r\nYes, that was what Schtoltz had said. But it would mean going forward,\r\nand going forward unceasingly. In that case farewell to they poetic\r\nideal of life! Such a course would connote work in a smithery rather\r\nthan life: it would entail a continual round of heat and of clatter.\r\nWhat would be the good of it? Would it not be better to stand still?\r\nTo stand still would merely mean occasionally putting on a shirt inside\r\nout, dinners with Tarantiev, thinking as little as possible of anything,\r\nleaving \xe2\x80\x9cA Voyage to Africa\xe2\x80\x9d unread to the end, and attaining a peaceful\r\nold age in the fiat of which Tarantiev had spoken. \xe2\x80\x9cNow or never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be or not to be.\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov rose from his chair, but, failing at once\r\nto insert his foot into a slipper, sat down again.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later Schtoltz departed for, England, after exacting from\r\nOblomov a pledge to join him later in Paris. Oblomov even went to the\r\nlength of procuring a passport, ordering an expensive travelling coat,\r\nand purchasing a cap. The furniture of the flat was to be removed to the\r\nquarters of Tarantiev\xe2\x80\x99s crony in the Veaborg Quarter, and stored in the\r\nthree rooms until its owner\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nA month went by--three months; yet Oblomov still did not start.\r\nSchtoltz, who had reached Paris long ago, continued to send him letter\r\nafter letter, but they remained unanswered. Why so? Was it because\r\nthe ink in the inkstand had become dried up and no writing-paper was\r\navailable? No; both ink, pens, and paper were present in abundance.\r\nIndeed, more than once Oblomov sat down to write, and did so fluently,\r\nand, at times, as expressively and eloquently as he had done in the\r\ndays when, with Schtoltz, he had dreamed of the strenuous life, and\r\nof traveling. Likewise he had taken to rising at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning, and to reading, and to carrying books about with him. Also,\r\nhis face had lost its look of dreaminess, weariness, _ennui_--there\r\nwas colour in his cheek, a sparkle in his eye, and an air almost of\r\nadventurousness--at least, almost of self-assurance--about his whole\r\nbearing. Lastly, no longer was the dressing-gown to be seen, for\r\nTarantiev had carried it off to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s flat, along with the rest\r\nof Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s effects. Thus Oblomov wore better clothes than had been his\r\nwont, and even sang cheerfully as he moved about. Why so? The reason\r\nwas that there had come into his life two friends of Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s, in the\r\nshape of a pretty girl named Olga Sergievna Ilyinitch and her aunt. On\r\nhis first visit to them he was overcome with constraint. \xe2\x80\x9cHow gladly I\r\nwould take off my gloves!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how hot the room\r\nis! And how unused to this sort of thing I have grown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, she _will_ keep looking at me,\xe2\x80\x9d was his further reflection\r\nas diffidently he scanned his clothes. He even wiped his face with his\r\nhandkerchief, lest a smut should have settled on his nose. Also, he\r\ntouched his tie, to make sure that its folds had not come undone, as had\r\nsometimes happened with him. But no--all was as it should be. Yet she\r\nwould persist in regarding him attentively. Next, a footman tendered\r\nhim a cup of tea, with a plate of biscuits. He tried to subdue his\r\nnervousness, and to unbend; but in the act of unbending he seized such a\r\nhandful of cracknels, biscuits, and sugared buns that the girl tittered\r\nand the rest of those present gazed at the pile with unconcealed\r\ninterest. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God, she is still looking at me!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth am I to do with all these biscuits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout looking, he could tell that Olga had risen from her seat and\r\nmoved to another corner. This helped to relieve his breast of a certain\r\namount of weight. None the less she continued to contemplate him, in\r\norder to see what he would do with the confectionery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably I had best eat them as quickly as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; with\r\nwhich he fell to hurriedly selecting one after another. Luckily all were\r\nof the sort which melts in the mouth. When only two of them remained he\r\nheaved a sigh of relief, and decided to glance towards the corner where\r\nhe knew Olga to be seated. Horrors! She was standing by a bust, with one\r\nhand resting on its pedestal, and her eyes closely observing him! Nay,\r\nshe had even come out of her corner to get a closer view of him! Without\r\ndoubt she must have noted his awkwardness with the biscuits!\r\n\r\nTrue, at supper she sat at the other end or the table, and ate and\r\ntalked as though she were in no way concerned with him; yet never once\r\ndid he throw a timid glance in her direction (in the hope that she was\r\nnot looking his way) but straightway he encountered her gaze--a gaze\r\nwhich, though good-humoured, was also charged with curiosity. That was\r\nenough. He hastened to take leave of her aunt, who invited him to come\r\nand dine another day. He bowed, and moved away across the drawing-room\r\nwithout raising his eyes. Presently he encountered a screen, with behind\r\nit, the grand piano. He looked again--and behold, behind the screen was\r\nseated Olga! She was still gazing at him with intent curiosity. Also,\r\nshe seemed to him to be smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly Andrei has often told me that I put on pairs of odd socks,\r\nand my shirt inside out,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected as he drove home. From that\r\nmoment he could not get Olga\xe2\x80\x99s glance out of his head. In bed he lay on\r\nhis back and tried to adopt the most comfortable attitudes; yet still he\r\ncould not sleep....\r\n\r\nOne fine morning Tarantiev came and carried off the rest of Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfurniture; with the result that its owner spent three such days as\r\nhe had never before experienced--days during which he was bedless and\r\nsofa-less, and therefore driven to dine at the house of Olga\xe2\x80\x99s aunt.\r\nSuddenly he noticed that opposite the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house there stood an\r\nuntenanted villa. Consequently he hired it (furnished) at sight, and\r\nwent to live there. Thereafter he spent his whole time with Olga--he\r\nread with her, he culled flowers with her, he walked by the lake and\r\nover the hills with her. Yes, he, Oblomov! How came this about? It came\r\nabout thus.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fateful dinner-party at the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house Oblomov\r\nexperienced the same torture during the meal as he had done on the\r\nprevious occasion. Every word that he spoke he uttered with an acute\r\nsense that over him, like a searchlight, there was hovering that glance,\r\nand that it was burning and irritating him, and that it was stimulating\r\nhis nerves and blood. Surely, on the balcony, he thought, he would be\r\nable, when ensconced behind a cloud of tobacco smoke, to succeed in\r\nmomentarily concealing himself from that silent, that insistent gaze?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself as he rocked himself to and\r\nfro. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is sheer torture! Have I made myself ridiculous? At no one\r\nelse would she dare to stare as she does at me. I suppose it is because\r\nI am quieter than the rest. However, I will make an agreement with her.\r\nI will tell her, in so many words, that her eyes are dragging my very\r\nsoul out of my body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she appeared on the threshold of the balcony. He handed her a\r\nchair, and she took a seat beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you so very _ennuy\xc3\xa9?_\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ennuy\xc3\xa9_, yes--but not much so. I have pursuits of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh? Schtoltz tells me that you are engaged in drawing up a scheme of\r\nsome sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I want to live upon my estate, and am making a few preparations\r\nfor doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are going abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly--as soon as ever Schtoltz is ready to accompany me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you be very glad to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. A smile wras hovering on her face, and illuminating\r\nher eyes, and gradually spreading over her cheeks. Only her lips\r\nremained as pressed together as usual. He lacked the spirit to continue\r\nhis lies calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I--I am rather a lazy person,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, but----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt vexed to think that _she_ should have extracted from\r\nhim a confession of his lethargy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I\r\n_afraid_ of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLazy?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed with a scarcely perceptible touch of archness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? A man be lazy? That passes my comprehension.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it?\xe2\x80\x9d was his inward comment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all simple enough. I\r\nhave taken to sitting at home more and more, and therefore Schtoltz\r\nthinks that I----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I expect you write a great deal?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you read\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x9d Somehow her gaze seemed very intent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I cannot say that I have.\xe2\x80\x9d The words burst from him in a sudden\r\nfear lest she should see fit: to put him through a course of literary\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, laughing. Then he too laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that you were going to crossquestion me about some novel or\r\nanother,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, you see, I never read such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you thought wrong. I was only going to ask you about a few books\r\nof travel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her quickly. Her lips were still compressed, but the rest\r\nof her face was smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be very, careful with her,\xe2\x80\x9d he refleted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _do_ you read?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with seeming curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happens that I am particularly fond of books of travel,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTravels in Africa, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d There was quiet demureness in the\r\ntone. He reddened at the not wholly unreasonable conjecture that she was\r\naware not only of _what_ he read but of _how_ he read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you also musical?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, in order to relieve him of\r\nhis embarrassment. At this moment Schtoltz (who had now returned from\r\nabroad) appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, Ilya!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI have told Olga Sergievna that you adore music,\r\nand that to-night she must sing something--\xe2\x80\x98Casta Diva,\xe2\x80\x99 for example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you speak for me at all?\xe2\x80\x9d protested Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cI am by no means\r\nan adorer of music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the man is offended! I introduce him\r\nas a person of taste, and here is he stumbling over himself to destroy\r\nhis good reputation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only declining the r\xc3\xb4le of connoisseur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\ntoo difficult and risky a r\xc3\xb4le. Sometimes I can listen with pleasure to\r\na cracked barrel-organ, and its tunes stick in my memory; while at other\r\ntimes I leave the Opera before the piece is half over. It all depends\r\nupon the mood in which I am. In fact, there are moments when I could\r\nclose my ears even to Mozart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is clear that you _do_ love music,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olga.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing him something,\xe2\x80\x9d requested Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose that Monsieur Oblomov were, at this very moment, to be\r\nfeeling inclined to close his ears?\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I ought to utter some compliment or another,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot do so, and I would not, even if I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d was Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s na\xc3\xafve rejoinder, \xe2\x80\x9cthings would be so awkward\r\nfor me if I were to find that you sing badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven as, the other day, you found things awkward with the biscuits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she retorted before she could stop herself. The next moment she reddened\r\nas though she would have given worlds to have been able to recall her\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought not to have said that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov had been unprepared, and was quite taken aback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a cruel advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--only a small revenge (and an unpremeditated one) for your failure to\r\nhave had a compliment ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps I will have one ready when I have heard you sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You wish me to sing, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; _he_ wishes it.\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov pointed to Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what of yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov shook his head deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not wish for what I have not yet experienced,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very rude, Ilya,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cSee what comes of lolling\r\nabout at home and confining your efforts to having your socks put on for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov quickly, and without giving him time to\r\nfinish. \xe2\x80\x9cI should find it no trouble to say: \xe2\x80\x98I shall be most glad, most\r\ndelighted, to hear you sing, for of course you sing perfectly.\xe2\x80\x99 So,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98it will afford me the very greatest possible pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\ndo you really think it necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least you might express a desire that I should sing--if only out of\r\ncuriosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare not do so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not an actress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it shall be for _you_ that I will sing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile you, Ilya,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9ccan be getting your compliment ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvening was closing in, and the lamp had been lit. Moonlike, it cast\r\nthrough the ivy-covered trellis a light so dim that the dusk still\r\nveiled the outlines of Olga\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure--it still shrouded them,\r\nas it were, in crepe; while the soft, strong voice, vibrating with\r\nnervous tension, came ringing through the darkness with a note of\r\nmystery. At Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s prompting she sang several arias and romances,\r\nof which some expressed suffering, with a vague forecast of joy, while\r\nothers expressed joy, coupled with a lurking germ of sorrow.\r\n\r\nAs Oblomov listened he could scarcely restrain his tears or the cry of\r\necstasy that was almost bursting from his soul. In fact, he would have\r\nundertaken the tour abroad if thereby he could have remained where he\r\nwas at that moment, and _then_ gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I pleased you to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired of Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk, rather, Oblomov,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cConfess now, Ilya: how long is it\r\nsince you felt as you are feeling at this moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet he might have felt like that this morning if \xe2\x80\x98a cracked\r\nbarrel-organ\xe2\x80\x99 had happened to pass his window,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Olga--but so\r\nkindly as to rob the words of their sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never keeps his windows open,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cConsequently, he\r\ncould not possibly hear what is going on outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night Oblomov was powerless to sleep. He paced the room in a mood\r\nof thoughtful despondency, and at dawn left the house to roam the city,\r\nwith his head and his heart full of God only knows what feelings and\r\nreflections!\r\n\r\nThree days later he called again at the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olga, \xe2\x80\x9cto feel thoroughly at home here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen pray do not look at me as you are doing now, and as you have\r\nalways done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstantly her glance lost its usual expression or curiosity, and became\r\nwholly softened to kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you mind my looking at you so much?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. Somehow your gaze seems to draw from me everything that\r\nI would rather people did not learn--you least of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so? You are a friend of Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s, and he is a friend of mine, and\r\ntherefore----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd therefore there is no reason why you should know as much about me\r\nas he does,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there _is_ no reason. But at least there is a _possibility_ that I\r\nmay do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes---- thanks to his talkativeness! Indeed a poor service!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you, then, any secrets to conceal--or even crimes?\xe2\x80\x9d With a little\r\nlaugh she edged away from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to put on odd socks _is_ a grave crime,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked with demure\r\ntimidity. Oblomov seized his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will _not_ stand this!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYet you want me to feel at home\r\nhere! As for Schtoltz, I detest him! _He_ told you about the socks, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me this once, and I will try to look at\r\nyou in quite a different way. As a matter of fact, \xe2\x80\x99tis _you_ who are\r\nlooking at _me_ in rather an odd fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrue enough, he was gazing into her kindly, grey-blue eyes--he was doing\r\nso simply because he could not help it--and thinking to himself that\r\nnever in all the world had he seen a maiden so beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething seems to pass from her into myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\r\nsomething is making my heart beat and boil. My God, what a joy to the\r\neye she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe important question,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis how to preserve you from\r\nfeeling _ennuy\xc3\xa9_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do that by singing to me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I was expecting that compliment!\xe2\x80\x9d The words came from her in a\r\nsudden burst as of pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, had you not uttered that\r\ngasp after I had finished singing the other evening, I should never have\r\nslept all night--I should have cried my very eyes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. I merely know that that time I sang as I had never done\r\nbefore. Do not ask me to sing now, however--I could not do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless she did sing to him again; and, ah! what did that song not\r\nvoice? It seemed to be charged with her very soul.\r\n\r\nAs she finished, his face was shining with the happiness of a spirit\r\nwhich has been moved to its utmost depths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you look at me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet she knew why he was doing so, and a modest touch of triumph that\r\nshe could so greatly have affected him filled her soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at yourself in the mirror,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will see that\r\nyour eyes are shining, and that--yes, really!--they have tears in them.\r\nHow deeply you must feel music!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--it is not music that I am feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied slowly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut--but\r\n_love!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her glance met his, and instantly she saw that he had uttered the word\r\nin spite of himself, that the word had got him in its power, and that\r\nthe word had voiced the truth.\r\n\r\nRecovering himself, he picked up his hat, and left the room. When he\r\nhad gone she remained standing like a statue by the piano--her eyes cast\r\ndown, and her breast rising and falling tumultuously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFrom that time forth she lived in him alone, while he, for his part,\r\nracked his brains to avoid incurring the loss of her esteem. Whenever\r\nshe detected in his soul--and she could probe that soul very deeply--the\r\nleast trace of its former characteristics, she would work for him to\r\nheap himself with reproaches for his lethargy and fear of life. Just\r\nas he was about to yawn, as he was actually opening his mouth for the\r\npurpose, her astonished glance would transfix him, and cause his mouth\r\nto snap with a click which jarred his teeth. Still more did he hasten\r\nto resume his alacrity whenever he perceived that his lassitude was\r\ncommunicating itself to her, and threatening to render her cold\r\nand contemptuous. Instantly he would undergo a revival of strenuous\r\nactivity; and then the shadow between them would disappear, and mutual\r\nsympathy once more beat in strong, clear accord. Yet this solicitude on\r\nhis part had not, as yet, its origin in the magic ring of love. Indeed,\r\nthe effect of his charmed toils was negative rather than positive. True,\r\nhe no longer slept all day--on the contrary, he rode, read, walked, and\r\neven thought of resuming his writing and his agricultural schemes;\r\nyet the ultimate direction, the inmost significance, of his life\r\nstill remained confined to the sphere of good intentions. Particularly\r\ndisturbing did he find it whenever Olga plied him with some particular\r\nquestion or another, and demanded of him, as of a professor, full\r\nsatisfaction of her curiosity. This occurred frequently, and arose not\r\nout of pedantry on her part, but out of a desire to know the right and\r\nthe wrong of things.\r\n\r\nAt times a given question would absorb her even to the point of\r\nforgetting her consideration for Oblomov. For instance, on one occasion,\r\nwhen she had besought his opinion concerning double stars, and he\r\nwas incautious enough to refer her to Herschel, he was dispatched to\r\npurchase the great authority\xe2\x80\x99s book, and commanded to read it through,\r\nand to explain the same to her full satisfaction. On another occasion he\r\nwas rash enough to let slip a word or two concerning various schools\r\nof painting; wherefore he had to undergo another week\xe2\x80\x99s reading and\r\nexplaining, and also to pay sundry visits to the Hermitage Museum. In\r\nthe end how he trembled whenever she asked him a question!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not say something?\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to him. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely it cannot\r\nbe that the subject wearies you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but how I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d he would reply, as though awakening from a\r\ntrance; to which she would retort--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really? But that is not what I have just asked you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he said to her--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCannot you see what is taking place in me? To me, speaking is a\r\ndifficulty. Give me your hand, give me your hand! There seems to be\r\nsomething hindering me, something weighing me down. It is a something\r\nthat is like the great rock which oppresses a man during deep sorrow.\r\nAnd, strangely enough, the effect of it is the same whether I happen\r\nto be sad or gay. Somehow my breath seems to hurt me as I draw it,\r\nand occasionally I come near to weeping. Yet, like a man overcome with\r\ngrief, I feel that I should be lightened and relieved if I could weep.\r\nWhat, think you, is amiss with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a smile of happiness which nothing could disturb.\r\nEvidently no weight was pressing upon _her_ heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn love?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not like the term for myself. I like you:\r\nthat is better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I like you\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he re-echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut a mother or a father or a nurse or\r\neven a dog may be _liked_: the phrase may be used as a garment, even as\r\ncan, can--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven as can an old dressing-gown,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested with a smile.\r\nPresently she added--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether I am actually in love with you or not I hardly know. Perhaps\r\nit is a stage that has not yet arrived. All I know is that I have\r\nnever liked father or mother or nurse or dog as I like you. I feel lost\r\nwithout you. To be parted from you for a short while makes me sorry; to\r\nbe parted from you for a long while makes me sad; and, were you to die,\r\nI should wear mourning for the rest of my life, and never again be able\r\nto smile. To me such love is life, and life is----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs a duty, an obligation. Consequently love also is a duty. God has\r\nsent me that duty, and has bid me perform it.\xe2\x80\x9d As she spoke she raised\r\nher eyes to heaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can have inspired her with these ideas?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov thought to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither through experience nor through trial nor through \xe2\x80\x98fire\r\nand smoke\xe2\x80\x99 can she have attained this clear, simple conception of life\r\nand of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, since there is joy in life, is there also suffering?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThat lies beyond my experience as much as\r\nit lies beyond my understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how well _I_ understand it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat glances you throw at me sometimes! Even my\r\naunt has noticed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can there be joy in love if it never brings one moments of\r\necstatic delight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a glance at the scene around her. \xe2\x80\x9cIs not all\r\n_this_ so much ecstatic delight?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him, smiled, and gave\r\nhim her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat presently I shall not\r\nbe sorry when you take your leave? Do you think that I shall not go to\r\nbed the earlier in order that I may the sooner fall asleep, and cheat\r\nthe wearisome night, and be able to see you again in the morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The light in Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s face had become brighter and brighter with each\r\nsuccessive question, and his gaze more and more suffused with radiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNext morning, however, he rose pale and sombre. There were traces of\r\nsleeplessness on his features, wrinkles on his brow, and a lack of fire\r\nand eagerness in his eyes. Once upon a time he would have sunk back\r\nupon the pillow after drinking his tea, but now he had grown out of the\r\nhabit, and contented himself with resting his elbow where his head\r\nhad just been lying. Something in him was working strongly; but that\r\nsomething was not love. True, Olga\xe2\x80\x99s image was still before him, but\r\nonly at a distance, and in a mist, and shorn of its rays, like that of\r\nsome stranger. With aching eyes he gazed at it for a moment or two, and\r\nthen sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo live as God wills, and not as oneself wills, is a wise rule,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured. \xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless------\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClearly that is so,\xe2\x80\x9d presently he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise, one would fall\r\ninto a chaos of contradictions such as no human mind, however daring and\r\nprofound, could hope to resolve. Yesterday one has wished, to-day one\r\nattains the madly longed-for object, and tomorrow one will blush to\r\nthink that one ever desired it. Therefore one will fall to cursing life.\r\nAnd all because of a proud, independent striding through existence and\r\na wilful \xe2\x80\x98I will\xe2\x80\x99! No; rather does one need to feel one\xe2\x80\x99s way, to close\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, to avoid becoming either intoxicated with happiness or\r\ninclined to repine because it has escaped one. Yes, _that_ is life. Who\r\nwas it first pictured life as happiness and gratification? The fool!\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Life is a duty,\xe2\x80\x99 says Olga. \xe2\x80\x98Life is a grave obligation which must be\r\nfulfilled as such.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He heaved a profound sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I cannot visit Olga to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes are now open, and\r\nI see my duty before me. Better part with her _now_, while it is still\r\npossible, than later, when I shall have sworn to part with her no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow had this mood of his come about? What wind had suddenly affected\r\nhim? How had it brought with it these clouds? Wherefore was he now for\r\nassuming such a grievous yoke? Only last night he had looked into Olga\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoul, and seen there a radiant world and a smiling destiny; only\r\nlast night he had read both her horoscope and his own. What had since\r\nhappened?\r\n\r\nFrequently, in summer, one goes to sleep while the weather is still\r\nand cloudless, and the stars are glimmering softly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful the\r\ncountryside will look to-morrow under the bright beams of morning!\xe2\x80\x9d one\r\nthinks to oneself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how glad one will be to dive into the depths of\r\nthe forest and seek refuge from the heat!\xe2\x80\x9d Then suddenly one awakes to\r\nthe beating of rain, to the sight of grey, mournful clouds, to a sense\r\nof cold and damp.\r\n\r\nIn Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s breast the poison was working swiftly and vigorously. In\r\nthought he reviewed his life, and for the hundredth time felt his heart\r\nache with repentance and regret for what he had lost. He kept picturing\r\nto himself what, by now, he would have been had he strode boldly ahead,\r\nand lived a fuller and a broader life, and exerted his faculties; whence\r\nhe passed to the question of his present condition, and of the means\r\nwhereby Olga had contrived to become fond of him, and of the reason why\r\nshe still was so. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she not making a mistake?\xe2\x80\x9d was a thought which\r\nsuddenly flashed through his mind like lightning; and as it did so the\r\nlightning seemed to strike his heart, and to shatter it. He groaned with\r\nthe pain. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she _is_ making a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept saying again and\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cShe merely loves me as she works embroidery on canvas. In a\r\nquiet, leisurely manner a pattern has evolved itself, and she has turned\r\nit over, and admired it. Soon she will lay it aside, and forget all\r\nabout it. Yes, her present affection is a mere _making ready_ to fall in\r\nlove, a mere experiment of which I am the subject, for the reason that\r\nI chanced to be the first subject to come to hand.\xe2\x80\x9d So he collated the\r\ncircumstances, and compared them. Never would she have noticed him\r\nat all, had not Schtoltz pointed him out, and infected her young.\r\nimpressionable heart with sympathy for his (Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s) position, and\r\ntherefore implanted in her a desire to see if possibly she could shake\r\nthat dreamy soul from its lethargy before leaving it once more to its\r\nown devices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is how the case stands,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself with an access of\r\nrevulsion. He rose and lit a candle with a trembling hand. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\njust that and nothing more. Her heart was ready to accept love--it was\r\ntensely awaiting it--and I happened to fall in her way, and at the same\r\ntime to fall into a blunder. Only would some one else need to arrive for\r\nher to renounce that blunder. As soon as ever she saw that some one else\r\nshe would turn from me with horror. In fact, I am stealing what belongs\r\nto another; I am no better than a thief. My God, to think that I should\r\nhave been so blind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGlancing into the mirror, he saw himself pale, dull, and sallow.\r\nInvoluntarily he pictured to his mind those handsome young fellows who\r\nwould one day come her way. Suddenly she would take fire, glance at him,\r\nand--burst out laughing! A second time he glanced into the mirror. No,\r\nhe was _not_ the type with which women could fall in love! He flung\r\nhimself down upon the bed, and buried his face in the pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Olga!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd may you always be happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave orders that he was to be reported as \xe2\x80\x9cnot at home\xe2\x80\x9d to any one\r\nwho might call from the Ilyinskis\xe2\x80\x99 house. Then he sat down to write Olga\r\na letter. He wrote it swiftly. In fact, the pen flew over the pages.\r\nAnd when he had finished the missive he was surprised to find that his\r\nspirits felt cheered, and his mind easier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably because I have put into what I have\r\njust written the whole sorrow of my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext, he dispatched the letter by the hand of Zakhar, and, leaving the\r\nhouse, turned into the park, and seated himself on the grass. Among the\r\nturf-shoots ants were scurrying hither and thither, and jostling one\r\nanother, and parting again. From above, the scene looked like the\r\ncommotion in a human market-place--it showed the same bustle, the same\r\ncongestion, the same swarm of population. Here and there, too, a bumble\r\nbee buzzed over a flower, and then crept into its chalice, while a\r\nknot of flies had glued themselves to a drop of sap on the trunk of a\r\nlime-tree, in the foliage a bird was repeating an ever-insistent note\r\n(as though calling to its mate), and a couple of butterflies were\r\ntumbling through the air in a giddy, fluttering, intricate movement\r\nwhich resembled a waltz. Everywhere from the herbage strong scents could\r\nbe detected arising; everywhere there could be beard a ceaseless chirping\r\nand twittering.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he saw Olga approaching. Walking very quietly, she was wiping\r\nher eyes with a handkerchief as she did so. He had not expected those\r\ntears. Somehow they seemed to sear his heart. He rose and ran to meet\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOlga, Olga!\xe2\x80\x9d were his first tender words.\r\n\r\nShe started, looked at him with an air of astonishment, and turned away.\r\nHe followed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are weeping?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and\xe2\x80\x99 is _you_ have made me do so,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, while her form\r\nshook with sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is beyond your power to comfort me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat miserable letter!\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated, suddenly becoming full of\r\nremorse.\r\n\r\nFor answer she opened a basket which she was carrying, took from it the\r\nletter, and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sight of it will only make me weep more\r\nbitterly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stuffed it silently into his pocket, and, with head bent, seated\r\nhimself beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me credit for good intentions,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged. \xe2\x80\x9cIn any case the letter\r\nwas evidence only of my care for your happiness--of the fact that I\r\nwas thinking of it in advance, and was ready to sacrifice myself on its\r\naccount. Do you think that I wrote the message callously--that inwardly\r\nI was not shedding tears the whole time? Why should I have acted as I\r\ndid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that you wished to\r\nsurprise me here, and to see whether I was weeping, and how bitterly.\r\nHad you _really_ meant the letter as you say, you would be making\r\npreparations to go abroad instead of meeting me as you are now doing.\r\nLast night you wanted my \xe2\x80\x98I love you\xe2\x80\x99; to-day you want to see my tears;\r\nand to-morrow, I daresay, you will be wishing that I were dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you wrong me like that? Believe me, I would give half my life\r\nto see smiles on your face instead of tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--now that you have seen a woman weeping on your account. But no;\r\nyou have no heart. You say that you had no desire to make me weep. Had\r\nthat been so, you would not have acted as you have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what ought I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me beg your\r\npardon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; only children beg pardon, or persons who have jostled some one in a\r\ncrowd. Moreover, even when granted, such pardon is worth nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if the letter should be true, and your affection for me all a\r\nmistake?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are _afraid_, then?--you are afraid of falling into a well?--you\r\nare afraid lest some day I should hurt you by ceasing to be fond of\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould I could sink into the ground!\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. The pain was\r\nincreasing in proportion as he divined Olga\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose you were to weary of love,\r\neven as you have wearied of books, of work, and of the world in general?\r\nSuppose that, fearing no rival, you were to go to sleep by my side (as\r\nyou do on your sofa at home), and that my voice were to become powerless\r\nto wake you? Suppose that your present swelling of heart were to pass\r\naway, and your dressing-gown come to acquire more value in your eyes\r\nthan myself? Often and often do such questions prevent my sleeping;\r\nyet I do not, on that account, trouble _you_ with conjectures as to the\r\nfuture. Always I hope for better things, for, with me, happiness\r\nhas cast out fear. Only for one thing have I long been sitting and\r\nwaiting--namely, for happiness; until at length I had come to believe\r\nthat I had found it.... Even if I _have_ made a mistake, at least\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x9d--and she laid her hand upon her heart--\xe2\x80\x9cdoes not convict me of\r\nguilt. God knows that I never desired such a fate! And I had been so\r\nhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen be happy again,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Rather, go you whither you have always been wishing to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wiser than I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, twisting a sprig of acacia\r\nbetween his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am simpler and more daring than you. What are you afraid of? Do\r\nyou _really_ think that I should cease to love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith you by my side I fear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWith you by my side\r\nnothing terrible can fall to my lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s face beamed as he walked home. His blood was boiling, and\r\na light was shining in his eyes. He entered his room--and at once, the\r\nradiance disappeared as his eyes, full of disgusted astonishment, became\r\nglued to one particular spot. That particular spot was the arm-chair,\r\nwherein was snugly ensconced Tarantiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it I _never_ find you here?\xe2\x80\x9d the visitor asked sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are\r\nyou _always_ gadding about? That old fool Zakhar has quite got out of\r\nhand. I asked him for a morsel of food and a glass of _vodka_, and he\r\nrefused me both!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been for a walk in the park,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov coldly. For the\r\nmoment he had forgotten the murky atmosphere wherein he had spent so\r\nmuch of his life. And now, in a twinkling, Tarantiev had brought him\r\ntumbling from the clouds! His immediate, thought was that the visitor\r\nmight insist on remaining to dinner, and so prevent him from paying his\r\nvisit to Olga and her aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not come and take a look at that flat?\xe2\x80\x9d went on Tarantiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there is no need,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov, avoiding his interlocutor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye. \xe2\x80\x9cI have decided not to move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to move?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tarantiev threateningly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot when I have hired\r\nthe place for you, and you have signed the lease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis led Oblomov to remember that, on the very day of his removal from\r\ntown to the country villa, he had signed, without previously perusing\r\nit, a document which his present visitor had submitted to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not want the flat. I am going\r\nabroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you are _not_,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Tarantiev coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is more,\r\nthe sooner you hand over to me a half-year\xe2\x80\x99s rent, the better. Your new\r\nlandlady does not care for such tricks to be played upon her. I have\r\npaid the money on your behalf, and I require to be repaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you contrive to get the money from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has nothing to do with you. As a matter of fact, I had an old debt\r\nrepaid me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA better flat you could not find in all the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless I do not want it. It lies too far from--from----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom where? From the centre of the city?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov forbore to specify what he meant, but merely remarked that he\r\nshould not be dining at home that evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen hand me over the rent, and the devil take you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nTarantiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI possess no money at all. As it is, I shall have to borrow some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, repay me at least my cab fare,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nonly three roubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the cabman? Why has he charged you so much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dismissed him long ago. I may add that the fare home is another three\r\nroubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the coach you could travel for half a rouble.\xe2\x80\x9d However, Oblomov\r\ntendered Tarantiev four roubles, which the man at once pocketed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, I have expended some seven roubles on your account,\xe2\x80\x9d went on\r\nTarantiev. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, you might as well advance me something towards the\r\nprice of a dinner. Roadside inns are dear. As a rule they fleece one of\r\nfive roubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilently Oblomov handed him another rouble, in the hope that the man\r\nwould now depart; but Tarantiev was not to be so easily shaken off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd also you might order Zakhar to bring me a snack _now_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you intended to dine at an inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to _dine_, but at the moment the time is two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov issued the necessary orders. On receiving them, Zakhar looked\r\ndarkly at Tarantiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no food ready,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x99. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso, where are my master\xe2\x80\x99s shirt\r\nand jacket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShirt and jacket? Why, I gave them back to you long ago. I stuffed them\r\ninto your own hands, and you bundled them away into a corner. Yet you\r\ncome asking me where they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, what about a floorbrush and two cups which you carried off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n persisted Zakhar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFloorbrush? What floorbrush?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Tarantiev. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and get me\r\nsomething to eat, you old fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not a single morsel in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zakhar; \xe2\x80\x9cand also there\r\nis nobody to cook it.\xe2\x80\x9d With which he withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tarantiev locked about him, and, perceiving Oblomov to be possessed\r\nboth of a hat and a cap, attempted unsuccessfully to borrow the former\r\nfor the remainder of the summer, and then took his leave.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone Oblomov sat plunged in thought. He recognized that his\r\nbright, cloudless holiday of love was over, and that workaday love had\r\nnow become the order of the day, and that already it was so completely\r\nentering into his life\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary tendencies that things were beginning\r\nto lose their rainbow colours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cthis morning may have seen the extinction of\r\nthe last roseate ray of love\xe2\x80\x99s festival--so that henceforth my life\r\nis to be warmed rather than lighted. Yes, life will swallow up love,\r\nalthough secretly it will remain moved by its powerful springs, and its\r\nmanifestations be of an invariably simple, everyday nature. Yes, the\r\npoem is fading, and stem prose is to follow--to follow with a drab\r\nseries of incidents which shall comprise a marriage ceremony, a journey\r\nto Oblomovka, the building of a house, an application to the local\r\ncouncil, the laying out of roads, an endless transaction of business\r\nwith peasants, a number of improvements, harvests, and so forth, the\r\nfrequent spectacle of the bailiff\xe2\x80\x99s anxious face, elections to the\r\ncouncil of nobles, and sundry sittings on the local bench,\xe2\x80\x9d Somewhere\r\nhe could see Olga beaming upon him, and singing _Casta Diva_, and then\r\ngiving him a hasty kiss before he went forth to work, or to the town,\r\nor to interview the bailiff. Guests would call (a no very comforting\r\nprospect!), and they would talk about the wine which each happened to be\r\nbrewing in his vats, and about the number of _arshins_ * of cloth which\r\neach happened to have rendered to the Treasury. What would this amount\r\nto? What was it he was promising for himself? Was it life? Whether\r\nlife or not, it would have to be lived as though it, and it alone,\r\nconstituted existence. At least it would be an existence that would find\r\nfavour with Schtoltz!\r\n\r\n     * Ells.\r\n\r\nBut the actual wedding ceremony--that, at all events, would represent\r\nthe poetry of life, its nascent, its just opening flower? He pictured\r\nhimself leading Olga to the altar. On her head there would\xe2\x80\x99 be a wreath\r\nof orange-blossoms, and to her gown a long train, and the crowd would\r\nwhisper in amazement. Shyly, and with gently heaving bosom and brow\r\nbent forward in gracious pride, she would give him her hand in complete\r\nunconsciousness that the eyes of all were fixed upon her. Then, a bright\r\nsmile would show itself on her face, the tears would begin to well,\r\nand for a moment or two the furrow on her forehead would twitch with\r\nthought. Then, when they had arrived home and the guests had all\r\ndeparted, she, yes, she--clad still in her gorgeous raiment--would throw\r\nherself upon his breast as she had done that morning!\r\n\r\nUnable any longer to keep his fancies to himself, he went with them to\r\nOlga. She listened to him with a smile; but when he jumped up with the\r\nintention of informing also her aunt she frowned with such decision that\r\nhe halted in awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word to any one!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe right moment is not yet come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ought we to do first, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go to the registrar, and to sign the record.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter marriage to go and live at Oblomovka, and to see what can be done\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not be able to do that, for the house is in ruins, and a new\r\none must first be built.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where are we to live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must take a flat in town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you had better go at once and see about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d was Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cOlga wishes for ever to be on the\r\nmove. Apparently she cares nothing about dreaming over the poetical\r\nphases of life, or losing herself in reveries. She is like Schtoltz. It\r\nwould seem as though the two had conspired to live life at top speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLate that August rain set in, and, one day, Oblomov saw a vanload of\r\nthe Ilyinskis\xe2\x80\x99 furniture come past his windows. To remain in his country\r\nvilla, now that the park was desolate and the shutters hung closed over\r\nthe Ilyinskis\xe2\x80\x99 windows, seemed to him impossible. At length he removed\r\nto the rooms which had been recommended him by Tarantiev, until such\r\ntime as he should be able to find for himself a new flat. He took hasty\r\nmeals at restaurants, and spent most of his evenings with Olga.\r\n\r\nBut the long autumn evenings in town were not like the long, bright days\r\namid fields and woods.\r\n\r\nHere he could not visit Olga three times a day, nor send her notes by\r\nZakhar, seeing that she was five versts away. Thus the polled poem of\r\nthe late summer seemed somehow to have halted, or to be moving more\r\nslowly, as though it contained less substance than of yore.\r\n\r\nSometimes they would keep silence for quite half an hour at a time,\r\nwhile she busied herself with her needlework, and he busied himself in\r\na chaos of thoughts which ranged beyond the immediate present. Only\r\nat intervals would he gaze at her and tremble with passion; only at\r\nintervals would she throw him a fleeting glance, and smile as she\r\ncaught the rays of tender humility, of silent happiness, which his eyes\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\nYet on the sixth day, when Olga invited him to meet her at a certain\r\nshop, and to escort her homeward on foot, he found his position begin to\r\ngrow a trille awkward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you knew how difficult things are!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. She returned no\r\nanswer, but sighed.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion she said to him--\xe2\x80\x9cUntil we have arranged everything\r\nwe cannot possibly tell my aunt. Nor must we see so much of one another.\r\nYou had better come to dinner only on Sundays and Wednesdays. Also, we\r\nmight meet at the theatre occasionally, if I first give you notice that\r\nwe are going to be there. Also, as soon as a fine day should occur I\r\nmean to go for a walk in the Summer Gardens, * and you might come to\r\nmeet me. The scene will remind us of our park in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d She added\r\nthis last with a quiver of emotion.\r\n\r\n     *  A public park in Petrograd\r\n\r\nHe kissed her hand in silence, and parted from her until Sunday. She\r\nfollowed him with her eyes--then sat down to immerse herself in a wave\r\nof sound at the piano. But something in her was weeping, and the notes\r\nseemed to be weeping in sympathy. She tried to sing, but no song would\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Oblomov was lolling on the sofa and playing with\r\none of his slippers--now picking it up from the door with his toe, now\r\ndropping it again. To him entered Zakhar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov indifferently. Zakhar said nothing, but eyed\r\nhim with a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you yet found for yourself another flat?\xe2\x80\x9d Zakhar countered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet. Why should you want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I suppose the wedding will be taking place soon after\r\nChristmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wedding? What wedding?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov suddenly leaped up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what wedding--your own,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Zakhar with assurance, as\r\nthough he were speaking of an event long since arranged for. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\ngoing to be married, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI to be married? To whom?\xe2\x80\x9d And Oblomov glared at the valet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mademoiselle Ilyinski----\xe2\x80\x9d Almost before the man could finish his\r\nwords Oblomov had darted forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho put _that_ idea into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a carefully suppressed\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord bless its all and protect us!\xe2\x80\x9d Zakhar ejaculated, backing\r\ntowards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWho told me about it? Why, the Ilyinskis\xe2\x80\x99 servants,\r\nthis very summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d hissed Oblomov as he shook a warning finger at the old man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember--henceforth let me hear not a word about it!\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to\r\nthe door, and Zakhar left the room--filling the flat with his sighs as\r\nhe did so.\r\n\r\nSomehow Oblomov could not recover his composure, but remained gazing at\r\nthe spot which Zakhar had just vacated. Then he clasped his hands behind\r\nhis head, and reseated himself in the arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall and the kitchen are talking!\xe2\x80\x9d was his insistent\r\nreflection. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has come to this, that Zakhar can actually dare to ask\r\nme when the wedding is to be! Yes, and that though even Olga\xe2\x80\x99s aunt has\r\nnot an inkling of the truth! What would she think of it if she knew? The\r\nwedding, that most poetical moment in the life of a lover, that crown\r\nof all his happiness--why, lacqueys and grooms are talking of it even\r\nthough nothing is yet decided upon! No answer has come from the estate,\r\nmy registry certificate is a blank, and a new flat still remains to be\r\nfound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he fell to analysing that poetical phase from which the colour\r\nhad faded with Zakhar\xe2\x80\x99s mention of the same. Oblomov was beginning to\r\nsee the other face of the medal. He tossed and turned from side to side,\r\nlay flat on his back, leaped up and took a stride or two, and ended by\r\nsinking back into a reclining position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow come folk to know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cOlga has kept silence,\r\nand I too have breathed not a word. So much for stolen meetings at dawn\r\nand sunset, for passionate glances, for the wizardry of song! Ah, those\r\npoems of love! Never do they end save in disaster. One should go beneath\r\nthe wedding canopy before one attempts to swim in an atmosphere of\r\nroses. To think that before any preparations have been made--before even\r\nan answer has come, from the estate, or I have obtained either money\r\nor a flat--I should have to go to her aunt, and to say: \xe2\x80\x98This is my\r\nbetrothed!\xe2\x80\x99 At all costs must I put a stop to these rumours. Marriage!\r\nWhat _is_ marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled as he remembered his recent poetical idealization of the\r\nceremony--the long train to the gown, the orange-blossoms, the whispers\r\nof the crowd. Somehow the colours had now changed; the crowd now\r\ncomprised also the uncouth, the slovenly Zakhar and the whole staff\r\nof the Ilyinskis\xe2\x80\x99 servants\xe2\x80\x99 ball. Also, he could see a long line of\r\ncarriages and a sea of strange, coldly inquisitive faces. The scene was\r\nreplete with glimmering, deadly weariness.\r\n\r\nSummoning Zakhar to his presence, he again asked him how he had dared to\r\nspread such rumours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor do you know what marriage means?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of his valet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that a lot of idle lacqueys and women and children start\r\nchattering in kitchens and shops and the market-place. A given\r\nindividual ceases to be known as Ilya Ilyitch or Peter Petrovitch, and\r\nhenceforth ranks only as the _zhenich._ * Yesterday no one would have\r\nnoticed him, but by to-morrow every one will be staring at him as though\r\nhe were a notorious rascal. Neither at the theatre nor in the street\r\nwill folk let him pass without whispering, \xe2\x80\x98Here comes the _zhenich_!\r\nAnd every day other folk will call upon him with their faces reduced\r\nto an even greater state of imbecility than distinguishes yours at\r\nthis moment--all in order that they may, vie with one another in saying\r\nimbecile things. That is how such an affair begins. And early each\r\nmorning the zhenich must go to see his betrothed in lemon-coloured\r\ngloves--never at any time may he look untidy or weary; and always he\r\nmust eat and drink what is customary under the circumstances, in order\r\nthat his sustenance may appear to comprise principally bouquets and air.\r\n_That_ is the programme which is supposed to continue fully for three\r\nor four months! How could _I go_ through such an ordeal? Meanwhile you,\r\nZakhar, would have had to run backwards and forwards between my place\r\nand my betrothed\xe2\x80\x99s, as well as to keep making a round of the tailors\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nthe bootmakers\xe2\x80\x99, and the cabinetmakers\xe2\x80\x99 establishments, owing to the\r\nfact that I myself could not have been in every spot at once. And soon\r\nthe whole town would have come to hear of it. \xe2\x80\x98Have you yet heard the\r\nnews?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oblomov is going to be married!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Really? To whom? And what is\r\nshe like? And when is the ceremony to be?\xe2\x80\x99 Talk, talk, talk! Besides,\r\nhow could I have afforded the necessary expenses? You know how much\r\nmoney I possess. Have I yet found another flat? And am I not owing a\r\nthousand roubles for this one? And would not the hire of fresh quarters\r\nhave cost me three thousand roubles more, considering the extra rooms\r\nwhich would have been required? And would there not have been the cost\r\nof a carriage, and of a cook, and so forth? How could I possibly have\r\npaid for it all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     *  Bridegroom to-be.\r\n\r\nOblomov checked himself abruptly. He felt horrified to think of the\r\nthreatening, the uncomfortable, vision which his imagination had\r\nconjured up. The roses, the orange-blossoms, the glitter and show, the\r\nwhispers of the crowd--all these had faded into the background. His fond\r\ndreams, his peace of mind alike were gone. He could not eat or sleep,\r\nand everything had assumed an air of gloom and despondency. In seeking\r\nto overawe Zakhar, he had ended by frightening also himself, for he had\r\nstumbled upon the practical view of marriage, and come to perceive that,\r\ndespite nuptial poetry, marriage constitutes an official, a very real\r\nstep towards a serious assumption of new and insistent obligations.\r\nUnable, therefore, to make up his mind as to what he should say to Olga\r\nwhen he next met her, he decided to defer his visit until the following\r\nWednesday. Having arrived at this decision, he felt easier.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Zakhar entered the room with a letter from Olga.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot wait until Wednesday,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel so lost through these\r\nlong absences from your side that I shall look to see you in the Summer\r\nGardens at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot go,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself. The next moment he comforted\r\nhimself with the reflection that very likely, her aunt, or some other\r\nlady, would be with her; in which case he would have a chance of\r\nconcealing his nervousness.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he reached the Gardens when he saw her approaching. She was\r\nveiled, and at first he did not recognize her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow glad I am that you have come!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid you\r\nwould not do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pressed his hand, and looked at him with an air so frank, so full of\r\njoy at having stolen this moment from Fate, that he felt envious of\r\nher, and regretful that he could not share in her lighthearted mood.\r\nHer whole face bespoke a childish confidence in the future, in her\r\nhappiness, and in him. Truly she was very charming!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you look so gloomy?\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you\r\nsay nothing? I had thought you would be overjoyed to see me whereas I\r\nfind you gone to sleep again! Wake up, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am both well and happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to say--fearful lest things\r\nshould attain the point of her guessing what was really in his mind.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am disturbed that you should have come alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather, it is for _me_ to be disturbed about that,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou think I ought to have brought my aunt with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Olga.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if I had known that, I would have invited her to come,\xe2\x80\x9d offendedly\r\nshe said as she withdrew her hand from his. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil now I had imagined\r\nthat your greatest happiness in life was to be with me, and with me\r\nalone. Let us go for a row in a boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that she set off towards the river, dragging his unwilling form\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming to our house to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired when they were\r\nsafely settled in their seats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cAlready she has divined my thoughts, and knows\r\nthat I do not want to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning, and for the whole day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe splashed his face playfully with water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow bright and cheerful everything looks!\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked as she gazed\r\nabout her. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us come again to-morrow. This time I shall come straight\r\nfrom home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have not come straight from home to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but from a shop, from a jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov looked alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose your aunt were to find out?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, suppose the Neva were to become dried up, and that this boat\r\nwere to overturn, and that our house were suddenly to fall down, and\r\nthat--that you were suddenly to lose your love for me?\xe2\x80\x9d As she spoke she\r\nsplashed him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Olga,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when they had landed on the bank. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the risk\r\nof vexing and offending you, I ought to tell you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Her tone was impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we ought not to be indulging in these secret meetings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are betrothed to one another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dearest Olga,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, pressing her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore we\r\nare bound to be all the more careful. I would rather be walking with you\r\nalong this avenue _publicly_ than _by stealth_--I would rather see the\r\neyes of passers-by drop respectfully before you than run the risk of\r\nincurring a suspicion that you have so far forgotten your modesty and\r\nyour upbringing as to lose your head and fail in your duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have _not_ forgotten my modesty and my upbringing,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, withdrawing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I know that you have not,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cI was merely thinking of\r\nwhat people _might_ say--of how the world in general _might_ look upon\r\nit all. Pray do not misunderstand me. What I desire is that to the world\r\nyou should seem to be as pure, as irreproachable, as in actual fact you\r\nare. To me your conduct seems solely honourable and modest; but would\r\nevery one believe it to be so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say is right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cConsequently, let us\r\ntell my aunt to-morrow, and obtain her consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov turned pale. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy hurry so?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that, two weeks\r\nago, I myself was urging haste; but at that time I had not thought of\r\nthe necessary preparations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your heart is failing you? That I can see clearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am merely cautious. Even now I see a carriage approaching us.\r\nAre you _sure_ that the people in it are not acquaintances of yours? How\r\nthese things throw one into a fever of perspiration I Let us depart as\r\nquickly as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he set off, almost at a run.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil to-morrow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, until the day after to-morrow. That would be better. Or even until\r\nFriday or Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; you must come to-morrow. Do you hear? What have we not come\r\nto! What a mountain of sorrow are you not threatening to bring upon my\r\nhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to go home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOn arriving at his rooms again, Oblomov never noticed that Zakhar\r\ngave him a cold dinner, or that, after it, he rolled into bed and slept\r\nheavily and insensibly; like a stone. Next day he received a letter in\r\nwhich Olga said that she had spent the whole night weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been unable to sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor angel! Why\r\ndoes she care for me so much? And why am _I_ so fond of _her_? Would we\r\nhad never met! It is all Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s fault. He shed love over us as he\r\nmight have shed a disease. What sort of a life is this? Nothing but\r\nanxiety and emotion! How can it ever lead to peaceful happiness and\r\nrest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSighing deeply, he threw himself upon the sofa--then rose again, and\r\nwent out into the street, as though seeking the normal existence\r\nwhich pursues a daily, gradual course of contemplation of nature, and\r\nconstitutes a series of calm, scarcely perceptible phenomena of family\r\nlife. Of existence as a spacious, a turbulent, a billowing river,\r\nas Schtoltz always conceived it to be, he could form no conception\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Olga that he had taken a slight chill in the Summer\r\nGardens--wherefore he must stay at home for a couple of days; but that\r\nhe hoped soon to be better, and to see her on the following Sunday. In\r\nreply she wrote that he must take the greatest care of himself; that\r\neven on Sunday he must not come should he not be well enough; and that\r\na whole week\xe2\x80\x99s separation would be bearable to her if thereby he were\r\nenabled to avoid risking his health. This excuse for omitting the Sunday\r\nvisit Oblomov gladly seized upon; wherefore he sent back word that, as a\r\nmatter of fact, a few days\xe2\x80\x99 additional convalescence _would_ be no more\r\nthan prudent.\r\n\r\nDay succeeded day throughout the week. He read, he walked about the\r\nstreets, and, occasionally, he looked in upon his landlady for the\r\npurpose of exchanging a couple of words and drinking some of her\r\nexcellent coffee. So comfortable did she make him that he even thought\r\nof giving her a book to read; but when he did so she merely read the\r\nheadings of a chapter or two, and then returned him the volume, saying\r\nthat later she would get her little girl to read the work to her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Olga received unexpected news. This was to the effect that a\r\nlawsuit with regard to her property had ended in her favour, and that\r\nwithin a month\xe2\x80\x99s time she would be able, should she wish, to enter into\r\nactual possession. But of this, and of her other plans for the future,\r\nshe decided not to tell Oblomov, but to spend the present hour in dreams\r\nof the happiness that was to be hers and his when she had seen love\r\ncomplete its revolution in his apathetic soul, and the slothfulness fall\r\nfrom his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThat very day he was to come. Yet three o\xe2\x80\x99clock arrived--four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock--and no Oblomov. By half-past five the beauty and the freshness\r\nof her features had begun to fade. Insensibly her form assumed a\r\ndrooping posture, and as she sat at the table her face was pale. Yet no\r\none noticed this. The rest of the guests consumed the dishes which she\r\nhad prepared for him alone, and carried on a desultory, indifferent\r\nchatter of conversation. Until ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock she vacillated between hope\r\nand despair. Then, on the arrival of that hour, she withdrew to her\r\nroom. At first she showered upon his head all the resentment that was\r\nseething within her. Not a word of mordant sarcasm in her vocabulary\r\nwould she not have devoted to his punishing, had he been present. But\r\nafter a while her mind passed from fierceness to a thought which chilled\r\nit like ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is sick,\xe2\x80\x9d was that thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is lonely and ill, and unable even\r\nto write.\xe2\x80\x9d So much did the idea gam upon her that she passed a sleepless\r\nnight, and rose pale, quiet, and determined. The same morning--it was\r\nMonday--the landlady informed Oblomov that a visitor desired to see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see _me?_ Surely not?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is _she?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOutside. Shall I send her away?\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov was about to assent when\r\nOlga\xe2\x80\x99s maid, Katia, entered the room. Oblomov changed countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ncome you to be here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress is outside,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand has sent me in to bid you go\r\nto her.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no help for it, so he went out, and found Olga alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite well?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has been the matter with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d With that they entered his: study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am better now--the sore throat is almost gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; and as he\r\nspoke he touched the part mentioned, and coughed slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you not come last night?\xe2\x80\x9d She raked him with a glance so\r\nkeen that for the moment he found himself tongue-tied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why have _you_ taken such a step as this?\xe2\x80\x9d he countered. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely\r\nyou know what you are doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe you have been\r\nill at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--I have not,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been deceiving me? Why so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will explain later. Important reasons have kept me away from you for\r\na fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I am afraid of scandal, of people\xe2\x80\x99s tongues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not of the fact that possibly I might pass sleepless nights--that\r\npossibly I might be so anxious as to be unable to rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot think what is passing within me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to his\r\nhead, and then to his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cI am all on edge, all on fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he told her what Zakhar had said to him, and ended with a\r\nstatement that, like herself, he could not sleep, and that in every\r\nglance he saw a question, or a sneer, or a veiled hint at the relations\r\nwhich might be existing between her and himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us decide to tell my aunt this week,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand at once\r\nthis chatter will cease. Had I not known you so well, I should scarcely\r\nhave been able to understand the fact that you can be afraid of\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 gossip, yet not of making me anxious. Really I cannot\r\nunderstand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d presently she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is more in this than meets the\r\neye. Tell me all that is in your mind. What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her--then kissed her hand and sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing during the past week or so?\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted\r\nas she glanced round the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a wretched place you have got!\r\nThe windows are small, and the curtains dirty. Where are your _other_\r\nrooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastened to show her them, in the hope that he might divert her\r\nmind from the question of his late doings; but she only repeated the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been reading,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand writing, and thinking of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you yet read _my_ books?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they? I will\r\ntake them back with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of them happened to be lying on the table. She looked at the page at\r\nwhich it was open, and saw that the page was covered with dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not read them!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed.\r\n\r\nOnce more she looked at the mess and disorder in the room, and then\r\ninquired: \xe2\x80\x9cThen what _have_ you been doing? You have neither been\r\nwriting nor reading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have not had time to do so.. In this place, as soon as one rises,\r\nthe rooms need to be swept, and other interruptions occur afterwards.\r\nNext, when dinner is over----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen dinner is over you need to go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo positive in its assurance was her tone that after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation he replied that her conjecture was correct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to pass the time. You are not here with me, Olga, and life is\r\nwearisome and unbearable without you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer gaze became so stern that he broke off abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Ilya,\xe2\x80\x9d she said very gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember saying in the\r\npark that at length your life had been fired to flame, and that you\r\nbelieved me to be the aim, the ideal, of your life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I _not_ remember it, seeing that it has revolutionized my\r\nwhole existence? Cannot you _see_ how happy I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do _not_ see it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot only have you deceived\r\nme, but also you are letting yourself relapse into your former ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeceived you? I swear to God that, were that so, I would leap into the\r\npit of Hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--if the pit of Hell were just beneath your feet; but, were you to\r\nput off doing so, even for a day or two, you would straightway change\r\nyour mind, and become nervous about the deed--more especially should\r\nZakhar and the rest begin gossiping on the subject! _That_ is not love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have no idea how these cares and distractions have injured my\r\nhealth!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since I have known you, nothing but anxiety\r\nhas been my lot. Yet deprivation of you would cause me to die or to go\r\nout of my mind. Only through you can I breathe or feel or see. Is it,\r\nthen, wonderful that, when you are not with me, I fall ill? Without you\r\neverything is wearisome and distasteful. I feel like a machine, I walk\r\nand act without knowing ever what I am doing. Yes, I am like a machine\r\nwhereof only you are the fuel, the motive power....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone he trod the floor as on air. \xe2\x80\x9cHow clearly she sees\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cHow unerringly from that book of wisdom is she\r\nable to divine her road!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, his life and hers had been bound to come\r\ntogether like two rivers, for she, and only she, was his true guide and\r\ninstructor.\r\n\r\nNext day there arrived a letter from the lawyer on his estate. He read\r\nit through--then let it slip from his fingers to the ground. The gist of\r\nthe document was that his property was greatly involved, and that, if\r\nhe wished matters to be set in order, he must hasten to take up his\r\nresidence on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen marriage is not to be thought of for at least another year,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreflected with dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all I shall need to complete my\r\nplans for the estate, and then to consult an architect, and then, and\r\nthen----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAre you certain that nothing remains to you of your properly--that\r\nthere is no hope of anything?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Olga a few days later.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am certain,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied--then added with a touch of hesitation\r\nin his tone: \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps within a year or so----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin a year or so you may be able to order your life and your\r\naffairs? Reflect a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sighed, for he was fighting a battle with himself, and the battle was\r\nreflected in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember that you and I are no longer children,\r\nand that we are not jesting, and that the matter may affect our whole\r\nlives. Inquire sternly of your conscience, therefore, and tell me (for\r\nI know you, as well as trust you) whether you can stand by me your\r\nlife long, and be to me all that I need? You know me as I know you:\r\nconsequently you understand what it is that I am trying to say.\r\nShould you return me a bold, a considered \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I will cancel a\r\ncertain decision of mine--I will give you my hand, and together we will\r\ngo abroad, or to your estate, or to the Veaborg Quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if you knew how much I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire no protestations of love.--only a brief answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not torture me, Olga,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with weariness in his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen am I right in what I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d was the firm, but significant, reply.\r\n\r\nThere followed a long pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what you would have done had we married?\xe2\x80\x9d at length\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cDay by day you would have relapsed farther and farther into\r\nyour slough. And I? You see what I am--that I am not yet grown old, and\r\nthat I shall never cease to _live_. But you would have taken to waiting\r\nfor Christmas, and then for Shrovetide, and to attending evening\r\nparties, and to dancing, and to thinking of nothing at all. You would\r\nhave retired to rest each night with a sigh of thankfulness that the day\r\nhad passed so quickly; and each morning you would have awakened with a\r\nprayer that to-day might be exactly as yesterday. _That_ would have been\r\nour future. Is it not so? Meanwhile I should have been fading away. Do\r\nyou _really_ think that in such a life you would have been happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to rise and leave the room, but his feet refused their office.\r\nHe tried to say something, but his throat seemed dry, and no sound would\r\ncome. All he could do was to stretch out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nShe too tried to speak, but could not. She too tried to extend her hand,\r\nbut it fell back. Finally, her face contracted painfully, and, sinking\r\nforward upon his shoulder, she burst into a storm of sobbing. It was as\r\nthough all her weapons had slipped from her grasp, and once more she was\r\njust a woman--a woman defenceless in her fight with sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d she said amid her spasms of weeping. He sat\r\nlistening painfully to her sobs, but felt as though he could say\r\nnothing to check them. Sinking into a chair, and burying her face in her\r\nhandkerchief, she wept bitter, burning tears, with her head bowed upon\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOlga,\xe2\x80\x9d at length he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, torture yourself in this way? You love\r\nme, and could never survive a parting. Take me, therefore, as I am, and\r\nlove in me just so much as may be worthy of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout raising her head, she made a gesture of refusal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she forced herself to gasp. \xe2\x80\x9cNor need you fear for me and my\r\ngrief. I know myself. I am merely weeping my heart out, and shall then\r\nweep no more. Do not hinder me, but go. God has punished me. Yet how it\r\nhurts, how it hurts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sobs redoubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose the pain should _not_ pass?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose it should\r\nwreck your health? Tears like these are tears of poison. Olga, darling,\r\ndo not weep. Forget the past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; let me weep. I am weeping not so much for the future as for the\r\npast.\xe2\x80\x9d She could scarcely utter the words. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all so bright--but\r\nnow it is gone! It is not I that am weeping; it is my memory--my memory\r\nof the summer, of the park--that is pouring out its grief. Do you\r\nremember those things? Yes, I am yearning for the avenue, and for the\r\nlilac that you gave me... They had struck their roots into my heart,\r\nand--and the plucking of them up is painful indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her despair she bowed her head, and sobbed again--repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how\r\nit hurts! Oh, how it hurts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose you were to die of this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in sudden alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cOlga,\r\nOlga! Think a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, raising her head, and striving to look at\r\nhim through her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cNot long ago I realized that I was loving in you\r\nonly what I wished you to contain--that it was only the future Oblomov\r\nof my dreams that was so dear to me. Ilya, you are good and honourable\r\nand tender; but you are all this only as is a dove which, with its head\r\nhidden under its wing, wishes to see nothing better. All your life you\r\nwould have sat perched beneath the eaves. But I am different--I wish\r\nfor more than that; though what it is I wish for even I myself could\r\nscarcely say. On the other hand, do you think that _you_ could have\r\ntaught me what that something is, that _you_ could have supplied me with\r\nwhat I lack, that _you_ could have given me all that I----?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s legs were tottering under him. Sinking into a chair, he\r\nwiped his hands and forehead with his handkerchief. The words had been\r\nharsh--they had stung him to the quick. Somehow, too, they had seared\r\nhim inwardly, while outwardly, they had chilled him as with a breath of\r\nfrost. No more could he do than smile the sort of pitiful, deprecating\r\nsmile which may be seen on the face of a beggar who is being rated for\r\nhis sorry clothing--the sort of smile which says: \xe2\x80\x9cI am poor and naked\r\nand hungry. Beat me, therefore--beat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly Olga realized the sting which her words had contained, and\r\nthrew herself impetuously upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said tenderly and with tears in her voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not think what I was saying, for I am almost beside myself. Yes,\r\nforget all that has happened, and let us be as formerly--let all remain\r\nunchanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, as abruptly he rose to his feet and checked her\r\noutburst with a decisive gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cAll _cannot_ remain unchanged. Nor\r\nneed you regret that you have told me the truth. I have well deserved\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe burst into a renewed fit of weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, twisting her tear-soaked handkerchief in her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot bear this any longer. To _me_ at least the past is dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe covered her face, and the sobs poured forth afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy has everything thus come to rack and ruin?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWho has put\r\na curse upon you, Ilya? Why have you done this? You are clever and\r\nkind and good and noble; yet you can wreck our lives in this way! What\r\nnameless evil has undone you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has a name,\xe2\x80\x9d he said almost inaudibly. She looked at him\r\nquestioningly with tear-filled eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat name,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98The Disease of Oblomovka.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning with bowed head, he departed.\r\n\r\nWhither he wandered, or what he did, he never afterwards knew. Late at\r\nnight he returned home. His landlady, hearing his knock, awoke Zakhar,\r\nwho undressed his master, and wrapped him in the old dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes that to be here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov, glancing at the garment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was given it by the landlady to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Zakhar. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has just\r\ncleaned and mended it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSinking into an arm-chair, Oblomov remained there. All around was\r\ngrowing dim and dreamlike. As he sat there with his head resting on\r\nhis hand he neither remarked the dimness nor heard the striking of\r\nthe hours. All his mind was plunged in a chaos of formless, indefinite\r\nthoughts which, like the clouds in the sky, passed aimlessly,\r\ndisconnectedly athwart the surface of his brain. Of none of them could\r\nhe catch the actual substance. His heart felt crushed, and for the\r\nmoment the life in it was in abeyance. Mechanically he gazed in front of\r\nhim without even noticing that day was breaking, or that his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndry cough was once more audible, or that the _dvornik_ was beginning to\r\ncut firewood in the courtyard, or that the usual clatter in the house\r\nhad begun again. At length he went to bed, and fell into a leaden, an\r\nuncomfortable sleep....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day is Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the kindly voice of the landlady, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nhave baked you a pie. Will you not have some?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned no answer, for he was in a high fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFor many a day after his illness Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s mood was one of dull and\r\npainful despondency; but gradually this became replaced with a phase of\r\nmute indifference, in which he would spend hours in watching the snow\r\nfall and listening to the grinding of the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s coffee-mill, to\r\nthe barking of the housedogs as they rattled at their chains, to the\r\ncreaking of Zakhar\xe2\x80\x99s boots, and to the measured tick of the clock\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npendulum. As of old, Agafia Matvievna, his landlady, would come and\r\npropose one or another dish for his delectation; also her children would\r\ncome running to and fro through his rooms. To the landlady he returned\r\nkindly, indifferent answers, and to the youngsters he gave lessons\r\nin reading and waiting, while smiling wearily, involuntarily at their\r\nplayfulness. Little by little he regained his firmer mode of life.\r\n\r\nOne day Schtoltz walked into his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ilya?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a questioning sternness which caused Oblomov\r\nto lower his eyes and remain silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is to be \xe2\x80\x98never\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d went on his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Never\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Do you not remember my saying to you, \xe2\x80\x98Now or never\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d the other returned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not the man I then was. I have now\r\nset my affairs in order, and my plans for improving my estate are nearly\r\nfinished, and I write regularly for two journals, and I have read all\r\nthe books which you left behind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why have you never come to join me abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething prevented me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOlga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov gathered animation at the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard that she had gone abroad with her\r\naunt--that she went there soon after, after----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon after she had recognized her mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the story, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov, scarcely able to conceal his\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the whole of it--even to the point of the sprig of lilac. Do you\r\nnot feel ashamed of yourself, Ilya? Does it not hurt you? Are you not\r\nconsumed with regret and remorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; please do not remind me of it,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Oblomov hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\ngreat was my agony when I perceived the gulf set between us that I fell\r\nill of a fever. Ah, Schtoltz, if you love me, do not torture me, do not\r\nmention her name. Long ago I pointed out to her her mistake, but she\r\nwould not listen to me. Indeed I am not so much to blame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not blaming you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schtoltz gently; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have read your\r\nletter. It is I that am most to blame--then she--then you least of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she? She is in great distress. She weeps, and will not be\r\ncomforted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMingled anguish, sympathy, and alarm showed themselves on Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, rising to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Schtoltz! We must go to her\r\nat once, in order that I may beg her pardon on my knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSchtoltz thought it well to change his tactics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you sit still,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not been telling you\r\nthe exact truth. As a matter of fact, she is well and happy, and bids me\r\ngive you her greeting. Also, she wanted to write to you, but I dissuaded\r\nher on the ground that it would only cause you pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov, almost with tears of joy. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am\r\nso glad, Schtollz! Pray let me embrace you, and then let us drink to her\r\nhappiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you hidden away in this corner?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sehtoltz after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is quiet here--there is no one to disturb me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sehtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, you have here--well,\r\nOblomovka over again, only worse.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced about him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are\r\nyou now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not very well. My breathing is bad, and spots persist in floating\r\nbefore my eyes. Sometimes, too, when I am asleep, some one seems to come\r\nand strike me a blow upon the back and head, so that I leap up with a\r\nstart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Ilya,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schtoltz gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, in all seriousness,\r\nthat if you do not change your mode of life you will soon be seized with\r\ndropsy or a stroke. As for your future, I have no hopes of it at all.\r\nIf Olga, that angel, could not bear you from your swamp on her wings,\r\nneither shall I succeed in doing so. However, to the end I shall stand\r\nby you: and when I say that, I am voicing not only my own wish, but also\r\nthat of Olga. For she desires you not to perish utterly, not to be\r\nburied alive; she desires that at least I shall make an attempt to dig\r\nyou from the tomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she has not forgotten me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov with emotion--adding: \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nthough I were worthy of her remembrance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she has not forgotten you, and, I think, never will. Indeed, she is\r\nnot the sort of person to forget you. Some day you must go and pay her a\r\nvisit in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes--but not now,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Oblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven at this moment I--I----\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it contain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sehtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cLove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, shame and sorrow. Ah, life, life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt disturbs me--it allows me no rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere it to do so, the flame of your candle would soon go out, and you\r\nwould find yourself in darkness. Ah, Ilya, Ilya! Life passes too swiftly\r\nfor it to be spent in slumber. Would, rather, it were a perpetual\r\nfire!--that one could live for hundreds and hundreds of years! _Then_\r\nwhat an immensity of work would one not do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and I are of different types,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ have wings; you\r\ndo not merely exist--you also fly. You have gifts and ambition; you do\r\nnot grow fat; specks do not dance before your eyes; and the back of your\r\nneck does not need to be periodically scratched. In short, my organism\r\nand yours are wholly dissimilar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie, fie! Man was created to order his own being, and even to change\r\nhis own nature; yet, instead, he goes and develops a paunch, and then\r\nsupposes that nature has laid upon him that burden. Once upon a time you\r\ntoo had wings. Now you have laid them aside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cI am powerless, completely powerless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather, you are _determined_ to be powerless. Even during your boyhood\r\nat Oblomovka, and amid the circle of your aunts and nurses and valets,\r\nyou had begun to waste your intellect, and to be unable to put on your\r\nown socks, and so forth. Hence your present inability to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now it is too late\r\nto turn back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what am I to say to Olga on my return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov hung his head in sad and silent meditation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d at length he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOr say that you have not seen me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA year and a half later Oblomov was sitting in his dull, murky rooms. He\r\nhad now grown corpulent, and from his eyes _ennui_ peered forth like a\r\ndisease. At intervals, too, he would rise and pace the room, then lie\r\ndown again, then take a book from the table, read a few lines of it,\r\nyawn, and begin drumming with his fingers upon the table\xe2\x80\x99s surface. As\r\nfor Zakhar, he was more seedy and untidy than ever. The elbows of his\r\ncoat were patched, and he had about him a pinched and hungry air, as\r\nthough his appetite were bad, his sleep poor, and his work three times\r\nas much as it ought to have been. Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-gown also was\r\npatched: yet, carefully though the holes had been mended, the seams were\r\ncoming apart in various places. Likewise the coverlet of the bed was\r\nragged, while the curtains, though clean, were faded and hanging in\r\nstrips.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the landlady entered to announce a visitor, and also to say\r\nthat it was neither Tarantiev nor Alexiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it must be Schtoltz again!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Oblomov, with a sense of\r\nhorror. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he want with me? However, it does not matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Schtoltz when he entered the room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ngrown stout, yet your face is pale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am not well,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow my left leg has lost\r\nall feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz threw at him a keen glance, and then eyed the\r\ndressing-gown, the curtains, and the coverlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov confusedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that never at any time\r\ndo I keep my place tidy. But how is Olga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has not forgotten you. Possibly you will end by forgetting _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never! Never could I forget the time when I was really alive and\r\nliving in Paradise. Where is she, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith her aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--and also with her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she is married? Has she been married long? And is she happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Oblomov had quite sloughed his lethargy. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as though you had\r\nremoved a great burden from my mind. True, when you were last here,\r\nyou assured me that she had forgiven me; but all this time I have been\r\nunable to rest for the gnawing at my heart.... Tell me who the fortunate\r\nman is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho he is?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, cannot you guess, Ilya!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s gaze grew more intent, and for a moment or two his features\r\nstiffened, and every vestige of colour left his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely it is not yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is. I married her last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe agitation faded from Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s expression, and gave place to his\r\nusual apathetic moodiness. For a moment or two he did not raise his\r\neyes; but when he did so they were full of kindly tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Schtoltz!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, embracing his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd dear Olga! May God\r\nbless you both! How pleased I am! Pray tell her so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell her that in all the world there exists not my friend\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s equal.\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz was profoundly moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, tell her, rather, that I was fated to meet her, in order that I\r\nmight set her on the right road. Tell her also that I bless both that\r\nmeeting and the road which she has now taken. To think that that road\r\nmight have been different! As it is, I have nothing to blush for, and\r\nnothing of which to repent. You have relieved my soul of a great burden,\r\nand all within it is bright. I thank you, I thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ tell her what you have said,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\nindeed reason for never forgetting you, for you would have been worthy\r\nof her--yes, worthy of her, you who have a heart as deep as the sea. You\r\nmust come and visit us in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that I am afraid of witnessing your\r\nmarried happiness, or of becoming jealous of her love for you. Yet I\r\nwill not come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen of what are you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf growing envious of you. In your happiness I should see, as in a\r\nmirror, my own bitter, broken life. Yet no life but this do I wish, or\r\nhave it in my power, to live. Do not, therefore, disturb it. Memories\r\nare the height of poetry only when they are memories of happiness. When\r\nthey graze wounds over which scars have formed they become an aching\r\npain. Let us speak of something else. Let me thank you for all the care\r\nand attention which you have devoted to my affairs. Yet never can I\r\nproperly requite you. Seek, rather, requital in your own heart, and\r\nin your happiness with Olga Sergievna. Likewise, forgive me for having\r\nfailed to relieve you of your duties with regard to Oblomovka. It is my\r\nfixed intention to go there before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find great changes occurred in the place. Doubtless you have\r\nread the statements of accounts which I have sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You have _not_ read them?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Schtollz, aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nwhere are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. Wait a little, and I will look for them after dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Ilya, Ilya! Scarcely do I know whether to laugh or to weep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. We will attend to the affair after dinner. First let us\r\neat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the meal Oblomov bestowed high encomiums upon his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looks after everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNever will you see me either\r\nwith unmended socks or with a shirt turned inside out. She supervises\r\nevery detail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ate and drank with great gusto--so much so that Schtoltz contemplated\r\nhim with amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink, dear friend, drink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is splendid _vodka_.\r\nEven Olga could not make _vodka_ or patties or mushroom stews equal to\r\nthese. They are like what we used to have at Oblomovka. No man could be\r\nbetter looked after by a woman than I am by my landlady, Agafia\r\nMatvievna. Nevertheless I, I------\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d prompted Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe her ten thousand roubles on note of hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand roubles? To your landlady? For board and lodging?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped\r\nSchtoltz, horrified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You see, the sum has gone on accumulating, for I live generously,\r\nand the debt includes accounts for peaches, pineapples, and so forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIlya,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schtoltz, \xe2\x80\x9c_what_ is this woman to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is robbing him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is wheedling his all out\r\nof him. Such things are everyday, occurrences, yet I had not guessed\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDesirous of taking Oblomov away with him, he nevertheless found all his\r\nefforts in that direction ineffectual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you once again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn what relation do you stand to your\r\nlandlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Oblomov reddened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you desirous of knowing?\xe2\x80\x9d he countered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, on the score of our old friendship, I think it my duty to give\r\nyou a very serious warning indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA warning against what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA warning against a pit into which you may fall, Now I must be going. I\r\nwill tell Olga that we may expect to see you this summer whether at our\r\nplace or at Oblomovka.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Schtoltz departed.\r\n\r\nNot for some years did he visit the capital again, for Olga\xe2\x80\x99s health\r\nnecessitated a lengthy sojourn in the Crimea. For some reason or other\r\nher recovery after the birth of a child had been slow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow happy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d was her frequent reflection. Yet, no sooner had she\r\npassed her life in admiring review than she would find herself relapsing\r\ninto a meditative mood. What a curious person she was!--a person who,\r\nin proportion as her felicity became more, complete, plunged ever deeper\r\nand deeper into a brooding over the past! Delving mto the recesses of\r\nher own mind, she began to realize that this peaceful existence, this\r\nhalting at various stages of felicity, annoyed her. However, with\r\nan effort of will she shook her soul clear of this despondency, and\r\nquickened her steps through life in a feverish desire to seek noise and\r\nmovement and occupation. Yet the bustle of society brought her small\r\nrelief, and she would retire again into her corner--there to rid her\r\nspirit of the unwonted sense of depression. Then she would go out once\r\nmore, and busy herself with petty household cares which confined her to\r\nthe nursery and the duties of a nurse and a mother, or join her husband\r\nin reading and discussing serious books or poetry. Her main fear was\r\nlest she should fall ill of the disease, the apathetic malady, of\r\nOblomovka. Yet, for all her efforts to slough these phases of torpor and\r\nof spiritual coma, a dream of happiness other than the present used to\r\nsteal upon her, and wrap her in a haze of inertia, and cause her whole\r\nbeing to halt, as for a rest from the exertions of lire. Again, to\r\nthis mood there would succeed a phase of torture and weariness and\r\napprehension--a phase of dull sorrowfulness which kept asking itself\r\ndim, indefinite questions and ceaselessly pondering upon them. And as\r\nshe listened to those questions she would examine herself, yet never\r\ndiscover what it was she yearned for, nor why, at times, she seemed to\r\ntire of her comfortable existence, to demand of it new and unfamiliar\r\nimpressions, and to be gazing ahead in search of something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to herself with a shudder. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthere really anything more that I require, or that I need wish for?\r\nWhither am I travelling? I have no farther to go--my journey is ended.\r\nYet have I _really_ completed my cycle of existence? Is this _really_\r\nall--all?\xe2\x80\x9d Then she would glance timidly around her, and wonder, in\r\ndoubt and trembling, what such whispers of the soul might portend. With\r\nanxious eyes she would scan the earth, the heavens, and the wilds, yet\r\nfind therein no answer, but merely gloom, profundity, and remoteness.\r\nAll nature seemed to be saying the same thing; in nature she could\r\nperceive only a ceaseless, uniform current of life to which there was\r\nneither a beginning nor an ending. Of course, she knew whom she could\r\nconsult concerning these tremors--she knew who could return the needed\r\nanswers to her questionings. But what would those answers import?\r\nWhat if Schtoltz should say that her self-questionings represented the\r\nmurmurings of an unsympathetic, an unwomanly, heart--that his quondam\r\nidol possessed but a _blas\xc3\xa9_, dissatisfied soul from which nothing good\r\nwas to be looked for? Yes, how greatly she might fall in his estimation,\r\nwere he to discover these new and unwonted pangs of hers! Consequently,\r\nwhenever, in spite of her best efforts to conceal the fact, her eyes\r\nlost their velvety softness, and acquired a dry and feverish glitter;\r\nwhenever, too, a heavy cloud overspread her face, and she could not\r\nforce herself to smile, and to talk, and to listen indifferently to the\r\nlatest news in the political world, or to descriptions of interesting\r\nphenomena in some new walk of learning, or to remarks upon some new\r\ncreation of art--well, then she hid herself away, on the plea of\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nYet she felt no desire to give way to tears; she experienced none of\r\nthose sudden alarms which had been hers during the period when her\r\ngirlish nerves had been excited even to the point of self-expression. So\r\nif, while resting on some calm, beautiful evening, there came stealing\r\nupon her, even amid her husband\xe2\x80\x99s talk and caresses, a feeling of\r\nweariness and indifference to everything, she would merely ask herself\r\ndespairingly what it all meant. At one moment she would become, as\r\nit were, turned to stone, and sit silent; at another she would make\r\nfeverish attempts to conceal her strange malady. Finally a headache\r\nwould supervene, and she would retire to rest. Yet all the while it was\r\na difficult matter for her to evade the keen eyes of her husband. This\r\nshe knew well, and therefore prepared herself for conversation with him\r\nas nervously as she would have done for confession to a priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOne evening she and Schtoltz were pacing the poplar avenue in their\r\ngarden. She was suffering from her usual inexplicable lack of energy,\r\nand finding herself able to return but the briefest of answers to what\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nurse tells me that Olinka is troubled\r\nwith a night cough. Ought we not to send for the doctor to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have given her some hot medicine, and am going to keep her\r\nindoors for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Olga dully.\r\n\r\nIn silence they walked to the end of the avenue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you sent no reply to that letter from your friend Sonichka?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the third letter that you have left unanswered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather forget her altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d was Olga\xe2\x80\x99s brief rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are not well?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; nothing is the matter with me. Why should you think\r\notherwise\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are _ennuy\xc3\xa9e?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a tone of assumed cheerfulness--yet a tone in which\r\nthe note of _ennui_ was only too plainly apparent.\r\n\r\nHe led her clear of the shade of the trees, and turned her face to the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. He gazed intently into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would say that you were unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d he commented. \xe2\x80\x9cYour eyes have a\r\nstrange expression in them which I have noticed more than once before.\r\nWhat is the matter with you, Olga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took him by the sleeve and drew him back into the shade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you aware,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with forced gaiety, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am hungry for\r\nsupper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not make a jest of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d she said reproachfully, halting in front of him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I _am_ unhappy--but only from excess of happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d So tender was\r\nher tone, and so caressing the note in her voice, that he bent down and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\nWith that she grew bolder. The jesting supposition that she could be\r\nunhappy inspired her to greater frankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not _ennuy\xc3\xa9e_,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9cnor should I ever be so. You\r\nknow that well, yet you refuse to believe my words. Nor am I ill. It\r\nis merely that, that well, that sometimes a feeling of depression comes\r\nover me. You are a difficult man to conceal things from. Sometimes I\r\nfeel depressed, though I could not say why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid her head upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, what _is_ the reason of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked her gently as he\r\nbent over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet there _must_ be a reason of some sort. If that reason lies neither\r\nin me nor in your surroundings, it must lie in yourself. Sometimes such\r\ndepression is a symptom of ill-health. Are you _sure_ that you are quite\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events I feel so,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cSee for yourself how I\r\neat and walk and sleep and work! Yet every now and then there comes over\r\nme a mood in which life seems to me incomplete.... Do not mind this,\r\nhowever. It is nothing--nothing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me more,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly life is incomplete, but what would\r\nyou add to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI grow afraid lest everything should be\r\nabout to be changed, or to come to an end; while at other times I find\r\nmyself torturing my brain with a stupid wondering as to what more is to\r\nbe expected from the future, this happiness of ours, this life, with its\r\njoys and sorrows\xe2\x80\x9d--she had dropped her voice to a whisper, in a sort\r\nof shame at her own questionings--\xe2\x80\x9cI know to be quite natural; yet\r\nsomething seems still to be drawing me onwards, and to be making\r\nme dissatisfied with my lot. How ashamed I feel of my folly and\r\nfancifulness! But do not notice me: this despondency of mine will soon\r\npass away, and I shall once more become bright and cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pressed herself closer with a timid caress, as though she were\r\nasking pardon for what she termed her \xe2\x80\x9cfolly.\xe2\x80\x9d He questioned her as\r\nto her symptoms as a physician might have done, and, in return, she\r\ndescribed to him her dull self-interrogations, her confusion of soul.\r\nMeanwhile Schtollz paced the avenue with his head on his breast and\r\nhis mind filled with doubt and anxiety--anxiety at the fact that he so\r\nlittle understood his wife. At length she, in her turn, drew him into\r\nthe light of the moon, and gazed inquiringly into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked bashfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you smiling at my\r\nfoolishness? Yes, \xe2\x80\x99tis very foolish, this despondency of mine. Do you\r\nnot think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not speak?\xe2\x80\x9d she urged impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have long been keeping silence,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9calthough always you\r\nhave known how solicitous I am on your account. Permit _me_, therefore,\r\nto keep silence and reflect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, if you do that, I shall feel uneasy. Never ought I to have spoken\r\nout. Pray say _something_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to say?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that a nervous\r\nbreak down is hanging over you. Should that be so, the doctor, not I,\r\nwill have to decide how best you can be treated. I will send for him\r\nto-morrow. In any case, if the mischief is not that, then----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried, shaking his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is over-imagination on your part. You are too full of life and\r\nhitherto been maturing.\xe2\x80\x9d He was speaking rather to himself than to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray utter your thoughts aloud, Andrei,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is over--I am still maturing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said beseechingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot bear it when you go muttering to yourself like that. I have told\r\nyou of my follies, and you merely bow your head and mumble something\r\ninto your beard. In this dark spot such conduct makes me feel\r\nuncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at a loss what to say. You tell me, \xe2\x80\x98Depression comes over me,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand \xe2\x80\x98I find myself troubled with disturbing questions.\xe2\x80\x99 What am I\r\nto make of that? Let us speak on the subject again later, and in\r\nthe meanwhile consider matters. Possibly you require a course of\r\nsea-bathing, or something of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said to yourself: \xe2\x80\x98Hitherto you have been maturing.\xe2\x80\x99 What did\r\nyou mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking that, that----\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke slowly and hesitatingly, as\r\nthough he were distrustful of his own thoughts and ashamed of his own\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, there are moments when symptoms of this kind betoken\r\nthat, if a woman has nothing radically wrong with her health, she has\r\nreached maturity--has arrived at the stage when life\xe2\x80\x99s growth becomes\r\narrested, and there remains for her no further problem to solve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you mean that I am growing old?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can\r\nyou say that? I am still young and strong.\xe2\x80\x9d And she drew herself up as\r\nshe spoke.\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not of the kind that will ever grow\r\nold. True, in old age one\xe2\x80\x99s energies fail, and one ceases to battle with\r\nlife; but that is a very different thing. Provided it be what I take\r\nit to be, your sense of depression and weariness is a sign of vigour.\r\nFrequently the growings of a vivid, excitable intellect transcend\r\nthe limits of everyday existence, and, finding no answer to what that\r\nintellect demands of life, become converted into despondency and a\r\ntemporary dissatisfaction with life. The meaning of it is that the soul\r\nis sorrowful at having to ask life its secret. Perhaps such is the case\r\nwith _you_. If so, you need not term it folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed, but, apparently, with relief at the thought that the danger\r\nwas over, and that she had not fallen in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s estimation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cnor do I spend my time in dreaming,\r\nnor is my life monotonous. What more, then, is there for me to have?\r\nWhat do these questionings portend? They harass me like a sickness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a spur to encourage a weak, groping intellect which has lacked\r\nfull preparation. True, such depression and selfquestionings have\r\ncaused many to lose their senses; but to others they seem mere formless\r\nvisions, a mere fever of the brain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think that just when one\xe2\x80\x99s happiness is full to overflowing, and one\r\nis thoroughly in love with life, there should come upon one a taint of\r\nsorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; such is the payment exacted for the Promethean fire. You must not\r\nonly endure, you must even love and respect, the sorrow and the doubts\r\nand the self-questionings of which you have spoken: for they constitute\r\nthe excess, the luxury, of life, and show themselves most when happiness\r\nis at its zenith, and has alloyed with it no gross desires. Such\r\ntroubles are powerless to spring to birth amid life which is ordinary\r\nand everyday; they cannot touch the individual who is forced to endure\r\nhardship and want. That is why the bulk of the crowd goes on its\r\nway without ever experiencing the cloud of doubt, the pain of\r\nself-questioning. To him or to her, however, who _voluntarily_ goes to\r\nmeet those difficulties they become welcome guests, not a scourge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one can never get even with them. To almost every one they bring\r\nsorrow and indifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but that does not last. Later they serve to shed light upon\r\nlife, for they lead one to the edge of the abyss whence there is no\r\nreturn--then gently force one to turn once more and look upon life. Thus\r\nthey seem to challenge one\xe2\x80\x99s tried faculties in order that the latter\r\nmay be prevented from sinking wholly into inertia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think, also, that one should be disturbed by phantoms at\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d she lamented. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen all is bright, one\xe2\x80\x99s life suddenly becomes\r\novershadowed with some sinister influence. Is there _no_ resource\r\nagainst it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is one. That resource lies in life itself. Without such\r\nphantoms and such questionings life would soon become a wearisome\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what ought I to do? To submit to them, and to wear out my heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cRather, arm yourself with resolution, and patiently,\r\nbut firmly, pursue your way.\xe2\x80\x9d With that he embraced her tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nand I are not Titans; it is not for us to join the Manfreds and the\r\nFausts of this world in going out to do battle with rebellious problems.\r\nRather, let us decline the challenge of such difficulties, bow our\r\nheads, and quietly live through the juncture until such time as life\r\nshall have come to smile again, and happiness be once more ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose they decline to pass us by? Will not our doubts and fears\r\ncontinue to increase?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for we shall accept them as a new verse in life\xe2\x80\x99s poem. In this\r\ncase, however, there is no fear of that. Your trouble is not peculiar to\r\nyou alone; it is an infectious malady common to all humanity, of which a\r\ntouch has visited you with the rest. Invariably does a human being feel\r\nlost when he or she first breaks away from life and finds no support\r\nin place of it. May God send that in the present instance this mood of\r\nyours be what I believe it to be, and not a forerunner of some bodily\r\nillness. That would be worse, for it would be the one thing before which\r\nI should be nerveless and destitute of weapons. Surely that cloud, that\r\ndepression, those doubts, those self-questionings of yours, are not\r\ngoing to deprive us of our happiness, of our------?\xe2\x80\x9d before he could do\r\nso, she had flung herself upon him in a frantic embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing shall _ever_ do that!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured in an access of renewed joy\r\nand confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, neither doubts nor sorrow nor sickness! No, nor\r\nyet--nor yet death itself!\xe2\x80\x9d Never had she seemed to love him as she did\r\nat that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care that Fate does not overhear what you have whispered,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninterposed with a superstitious caution born of tender forethought for\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, take care that it does not rate you ungrateful, for it likes\r\nto have its gifts appreciated at their true worth. Hitherto you have\r\nbeen _learning_ only about life: now you are going also to experience\r\nit. Soon, as life pursues its course, there will come to you fresh\r\nsorrows and travail; and, together, they will force you to look beyond\r\nthe questions of which you have spoken, and therefore you must husband\r\nyour strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSchtoitz uttered these words softly, and almost as though he were\r\nspeaking to himself. And in the words was a note of despondency which\r\nseemed to say that already he could see approaching her \xe2\x80\x9csorrows\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctravail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said nothing--she was too deeply struck with the mournful foreboding\r\nin his tone. Yet she trusted him implicitly--his voice alone inspired\r\nin her belief; and for that very reason his gravity affected her deeply,\r\nand concentrated her thoughts upon herself. Leaning upon him, she paced\r\nthe avenue slowly and mechanically, with her soul awed to a silence\r\nwhich she could not break. Following her husband\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, she was gazing\r\nforward at the vista of life, and trying to discern the point where,\r\naccording to his words, \xe2\x80\x9csorrows and travail\xe2\x80\x9d were awaiting her. And\r\nas she did so she saw arise before her a vision in which there became\r\nrevealed to her a sphere of life that was no longer to be bright and\r\nleisured and protected, that was no longer to be passed amid plenty,\r\nthat was no longer to be spent alone with him. In that sphere she could\r\ndescry only a long sequence of losses and privations, with copious\r\ntears, strict asceticism, involuntary, renunciation of whims born of\r\nhours of ease, and new and unwonted sensations which should call forth\r\nfrom her cries of pain and disappointment. Yes, in that vision she saw\r\nbefore her only sickness, material ruin, the loss of her husband, and...\r\n\r\nShuddering and faltering, she, with a man\xe2\x80\x99s courageous curiosity,\r\ncontinued to gaze at this unfamiliar presentment of life, and timidly to\r\nreview and to estimate her ability to cope with it. Only love, she\r\nsaw, would never fail her--only love would over this new existence keep\r\never-faithful watch and ward. Yet it would be love of a different kind.\r\nFrom it there would be absent all ardent sighs and shining days and\r\nrapturous nights; as the years went on such things would come to seem\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s sport compared with the non-intimate affection which life,\r\nnow grown profound and menacing, would cause her to adopt for her guide.\r\nFrom that life came to her ears no sound of laughter and kisses and\r\ntremulous, soulful intercourse amid groves and flowers, while life and\r\nnature kept high holiday. No, such things were \xe2\x80\x9cwithered and gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The love beheld in that vision was a love which, unfading and\r\nindestructible, expressed itself on the features of husband and wife\r\nonly during seasons of mutual sorrow, and shone forth only in slow,\r\nsilent glances of mutual sympathy, and voiced itself only in a constant,\r\njoint endurance of the trials of life as he and she restrained the\r\ntears, and choked back the sobs, which those trials called forth. With\r\nthat there came stealing into the midst of the doubts and fears which\r\nbeset her other visions--visions remote but clear, inspiring but\r\ndefinite....\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHer husband\xe2\x80\x99s calm, assured reasoning, added to her own implicit\r\nconfidence in him, helped Olga to succeed in shaking off both her\r\nenigmatical, singular misgivings and her visionary, menacing dreams\r\nconcerning the future. Once more, therefore, she strode boldly forward.\r\nTo the night of doubt there succeeded a brilliant morning of maternal\r\nand housewifely duties. On the one hand, there beckoned to her the\r\nflower garden and the meadows; on the other hand there beckoned to her\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s study. No longer did she play with life as with a means\r\nof carefree indulgence. Rather, life had become a season of mysterious,\r\nsystematic waiting, and of getting ready.\r\n\r\nYet once, when Schtoltz happened to mention Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s name, she let fall\r\nher sewing, and sank into a reverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of him?\xe2\x80\x9d later she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCould we not find out how he is through\r\nsome of his friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so, we should find out no more than we know already. Independently\r\nof his friends, I happen to be aware that he is alive and well, and\r\nliving in the same rooms as formerly. But how he is spending his days,\r\nand whether he is morally dead or still there is flickering in him a\r\nlast spark of vitality, it is impossible for an outsider to ascertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not speak like that, Andrei,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olga. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts me to hear you do\r\nso. Were I not afraid, I would go in person to glean news of him.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ntears had risen very near to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext spring we ourselves shall be in Petrograd,\xe2\x80\x9d the husband remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Then_ we will find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not sufficient merely to find out: we ought also to do all we\r\ncan for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready I have done what is possible. When one is with him he is ready\r\nto take any steps desired; but directly one\xe2\x80\x99s back is turned he relapses\r\ninto slumber. \xe2\x80\x99Tis like trying to deal with a drunken man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why turn your back upon him _ever?_ He ought to be treated\r\nfirmly--he ought to, be removed from his rooms and taken away. Were I\r\nto ask him, he would come with us into the country. I feel sure I should\r\nnever get over it if I were to see him sink to rack and ruin. Perhaps my\r\ntears----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight revive him, you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but at least compel him to look around him, and to exchange his\r\nlife for something better. With us he would be out of the mire, and\r\nliving among his equals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you do not love him as you used to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz asked\r\nhalf-jestingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied (and as she did so her grave eyes seemed to\r\nbe gazing back into the past). \xe2\x80\x9cYet in him there is something for which\r\nI have an abiding affection, and to which I shall ever remain true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what that something is?\xe2\x80\x9d She nodded an assent.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nan honourable, trustworthy heart. That heart is the nugget given him\r\nof Nature, and he has carried it unsullied through all his life. Under\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s stress he fell, lost his enthusiasm, and ended by going to\r\nsleep--a broken, disenchanted man who had lost his power to live, but\r\nnot his purity and his intrinsic worth. Never a false note has that\r\nheart sounded; never a particle of mire has there clung to his soul;\r\nnever a specious lie has he heeded; never to the false road has he been\r\nseduced by any possible attraction. Even were a whole ocean of evil and\r\nrascality to come seething about him, and even were the whole world to\r\nbecome infected with poison and be turned upside down, Oblomov would yet\r\nrefuse to bow to the false image, and his soul would remain as clean,\r\nas radiant, and as without spot as ever. That soul is a soul of crystal\r\ntransparency. Of men like him but few exist, so that they shine amid the\r\nmob like pearls. No price could be high enough to purchase his heart.\r\nEverywhere and always that heart would remain true to its trust. It is\r\nto this element in him that you have always remained true; and it is\r\nowing to the same element in him that my task of keeping watch will\r\nnever become a burden. In my day I have known many men with splendid\r\nqualities. Never have I known a man cleaner, brighter, and more simple\r\nthan Oblomov. For many a man have I cherished an affection. Never for\r\na man have I cherished an affection more ardent and lasting than that\r\nwhich I cherish for Oblomov. Once known, his personality is an entity\r\nfor which one\xe2\x80\x99s love could never die.... Is that so? Have I divined\r\naright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said nothing: her eyes were fixed intently upon her work. Ar length\r\nshe arose, ran to her husband, gazed into his eyes for a moment as she\r\nembraced him, and let her head sink forward upon his shoulder. During\r\nthose few moments there had arisen to her memory Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s kindly,\r\npensive face, his tender, deprecating gaze, and the shy, wistful smile\r\nwith which, at their last parting, he had met her reproaches. As she saw\r\nthose things her heart ached with pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never abandon him--you will never let him leave your sight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she asked with her arms around her husband\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never!--not though an abyss should open between us, and a dividing\r\nwall arise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kissed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor shall I ever forget the words which you have just spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the Veaborg Quarter peace and quietness reigned supreme. They\r\nreigned in its unwashed streets, with their wooden sidewalks, and in\r\nits lean gardens amid the nettle-encumbered ditches, where a goat with\r\na ragged cord around its neck was diligently engaged in cropping the\r\nherbage and snatching dull intervals of slumber. At midday, however,\r\nthe high, smart boots of a clerk clattered along a sidewalk, the muslin\r\ncurtain at a window was pulled aside to admit the features of a Civil\r\nService official\xe2\x80\x99s lady, and for a brief moment there showed itself\r\nover a garden fence the fresh young face of a girl--then the face of\r\na companion--then the face which had first appeared, as two maidens\r\nlaughed and tittered during the process cf swinging each other on a\r\ngarden swing.\r\n\r\nAlso in the abode of Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s landlady all was quiet. Had you entered\r\nthe little courtyard, you would have happened upon an idyllic scene. The\r\npoultry would have started running hither and thither in fussy alarm,\r\nand the dogs given tongue in furious accents, while Akulina would have\r\npaused in her pursuit of milking the cow, and the _dvornik_ in his task\r\nof chopping firewood, in order that they might gaze unhampered at the\r\nvisitor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you wish to see?\xe2\x80\x9d the _dvornik_ would have inquired;\r\nand on your mentioning Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s name, or that of the mistress of the\r\nhouse, he would have pointed to the steps of the front door, and then\r\nresumed his task of wood-chopping; whereupon the visitor would have\r\nfollowed the neat, sanded path to the steps (which he would have found\r\ncovered with a plain, clean carpet of some sort), and, reaching for the\r\nbrightly polished knob of the doorbell, would have had the door opened\r\nto him by Anisia, one of the children, the landlady herself, or Zakhar.\r\nEverything in Agafia Matvievna\xe2\x80\x99s establishment smacked of an opulence\r\nand a domestic sufficiency which had been lacking in the days when\r\nshe had shared house with her brother, Tarantiev\xe2\x80\x99s bosom friend.\r\nThe kitchen, the lumber-room, and the pantry were alike fitted with\r\ncupboards full of china, crockery, and household wares of every sort;\r\nwhile in cases were set out Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s plate and articles of silver (long\r\nago redeemed, and never since pledged). In short, the place abounded\r\nin such commodities as are to be found in the abode of every frugal\r\nhousewife. Also, so carefully was everything packed in camphor and other\r\npreservatives that when Agafia Matvievna went to open the doors of the\r\ncupboards she could scarcely stand against the overwhelming perfume of\r\nmingled narcotics which came forth, and had to turn her head aside for\r\na few moments. Hams hung from the ceiling of the storeroom (to avoid\r\ndamage by mice), and, with them, cheeses, loaves-of--sugar, dried fish,\r\nand bags of nuts and preserved mushrooms. On a table stood tubs of\r\nbutter, pots of sour cream, baskets of apples, and God knows what else\r\nbesides, for it would require the pen of a scribe Homer to describe\r\nin full, and in detail, all that had become accumulated in the various\r\ncorners and on the various floors of this little nest of domestic life.\r\nAs for the kitchen, it was a veritable palladium of activity on the part\r\nof the mistress and her efficient assistant, Anisia. Everything was kept\r\nindoors and in its proper place; throughout there prevailed a system of\r\norderliness and cleanliness; and only into one particular nook of the\r\nhouse did a ray of light, a breath of air, the good housewife\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and\r\nthe nimble, all-furbishing hand of the domestic never penetrate. That\r\nnook was Zakhar\xe2\x80\x99s den. Lacking a window, it was so constantly plunged\r\nin darkness that its resemblance to a lair rather than to a human\r\nhabitation was rendered the more complete. Whenever Zakhar surprised in\r\nhis den the mistress of the house (come thither to plan a cleaning or\r\nvarious improvements) he explained to her, in forcible tenns, that it\r\nwas not a woman\xe2\x80\x99s business to sweep out a place where faggots, blacking,\r\nand boots ought to lie, and that it mattered not a jot that clothes\r\nshould be tossed in a heap on the floor, or that the bed in the stove\r\ncorner had become overspread with dust, seeing that it was he, and not\r\nshe, whose function it was to repose upon that bed. As for a besom, a\r\nfew planks, a couple of bricks, the remains of a barrel, and two blocks\r\nof wood which he always kept in his room, he could not, he averred, get\r\non in his domestic duties without them (though why that was so he left\r\nto the imagination). Finally, according to his own statement, neither\r\nthe dust nor the cobwebs in the least inconvenienced him--to which he\r\nbegged to add a reminder that, since he never obtruded his nose into\r\nthe kitchen, he should be the more pleased if he could be left alone by\r\nthose to whom the kitchen was at all times open. Once, when he surprised\r\nAnisia in his sanctum, he threatened her so furiously with uplifted fist\r\nthat the case was referred to the court of superior instance--that is\r\nto say, to Oblomov himself, who walked supinely to the door of the\r\nden, inserted his head therein, scanned the apartment and its contents,\r\nsneezed, and returned mutely to his own quarters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you gained by it all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Zakhar to the mistress and\r\nher myrmidon, who had accompanied Oblomov, in the hope that his\r\nparticipation in the affair would lead to a change of some sort. Then\r\nthe old valet laughed to himself in a way which twisted his eyebrows and\r\nwhiskers askew.\r\n\r\nIn the other rooms of the house, however, everything looked bright and\r\nclean and fresh. The old stuff curtains had disappeared, and the doors\r\nand windows of the drawing-room and the study were hung with blue and\r\ngreen drapery and muslin curtains--the work of Agafia Matvievna\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nhands. Indeed, for days at a time Oblomov, prone upon his sola, had\r\nwatched her bare elbows flicker to and fro as she plied needle and\r\nthread; nor had he once gone to sleep to the sound of thread being\r\nalternately inserted and bitten off, as had been his custom in the old\r\ndays at Oblomovka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of work,\xe2\x80\x9d he had nevertheless said to her at intervals, \xe2\x80\x9cPray\r\ncease your labours for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d she had always replied, \xe2\x80\x9cGod loves those who toil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNor was his coffee prepared for him with less care, attention, and skill\r\nthan had been the case before he had changed his old quarters for his\r\npresent ones. Giblet soup, macaroni with Parmesan cheese, soup concocted\r\nof _kvass_ and herbs, home-fed pullets--all these dishes succeeded one\r\nanother in regular rotation, and by so doing helped to make agreeable\r\nbreaks in the otherwise monotonous routine of the little establishment.\r\nNor did the sun, whenever shining, fail to brighten his room from\r\nmorning till night--thanks to the fact that the market-gardens on either\r\nside of the building prevented that luminary\xe2\x80\x99s rays from being shaded\r\noff by any obstacle. Outside, ducks quacked cheerfully, while, within, a\r\ngeranium, added to a few hyacinths which the children had brought home,\r\nfilled the little apartment with a perfume which mingled pleasantly with\r\nthe smoke of Havana cigars and the scent of the cinnamon or the vanilla\r\nwhich the mistress of the house would be preparing with bare, energetic\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThus Oblomov lived in a sort of gilded cage--a cage within which, as in\r\na diorama, the only changes included alternations of day and night and\r\nof the seasons. Of changes of the disturbing kind which stir up the\r\nsediment from the bottom of life\xe2\x80\x99s bowl--a sediment only too frequently\r\nboth bitter and obnoxious--there were none. Ever since the day when\r\nSchtoltz had cleared him of debt, and Tarantiev and Tarantiev\xe2\x80\x99s friend\r\nhad taken themselves off for good, every adverse element had disappeared\r\nfrom Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s existence, and there surrounded him only good, kind,\r\nsensible folk who had agreed to underpin his existence with theirs, and\r\nto help him not to notice it, nor to feel it, as it pursued its even\r\ncourse. Everything was, as it were, at peace, and of that peace, that\r\ninertia, Oblomov represented the complete, the natural, embodiment and\r\nexpression. After passing in review and considering his mode of life,\r\nhe had sunk deeper and deeper therein, until finally he had come to the\r\nconclusion that he had no farther to go, and nothing farther to\r\nseek, and that the ideal of his life would best be preserved where he\r\nwas--albeit without poetry, without those finer shades wherewith his\r\nimagination had once painted for him a spacious, careless course\r\nof manorial life on his own estate and among his own peasantry and\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nUpon his present mode of life he looked as a continuation of the\r\nOblomovkan existence (only with a different colouring of locality, and,\r\nto a certain extent, of period). Here, as at Oblomovka, he had succeeded\r\nin escaping life, in driving a bargain with it, and ensuring to himself\r\nan inviolable seclusion. Inwardly he congratulated himself on having\r\nleft behind him the irksome, irritating demands and menaces cf mundane\r\nexistence--on having placed a great distance Between himself and the\r\nhorizon where there may be seen flashing the lightning-bolts of keen\r\npleasure, and whence come the thunderpeals of sudden affliction, and\r\nwhere flicker the false hopes and the splendid visions of average\r\nhappiness, and where independence of thought gradually engulfs and\r\ndevours a man, and where passion slays him outright, and where the\r\nintellect fails or triumphs, and where humanity engages in constant\r\nwarfare, and leaves the field of battle in a state of exhaustion and of\r\never-unsatisfied, ever-insatiable desire. Never having experienced the\r\nconsolations to be won in combat, he had none the less renounced them,\r\nand felt at ease only in a remote corner to which action and lighting\r\nand the actual living of life were alike strangers.\r\n\r\nYet moments there were when his imagination stirred within him again,\r\nand when there recurred to his mind forgotten memories and unrealized\r\ndreams, and when he felt in his conscience whispered reproaches for\r\nhaving made of his life so little as he had done. And whenever that\r\noccurred he slept restlessly, awoke at intervals, leaped out of bed,\r\nand shed chill tears of hopelessness over the bright ideal that was now\r\nextinguished for ever. He shed them as folk shed them over a dead friend\r\nwhom with bitter regret they recognize to have been neglected during his\r\nlifetime. Then he would glance at his surroundings, hug to himself\r\nhis present blessings, and grow comforted on noting how quietly, how\r\nrestfully, the sun was rising amid a blaze of glory. Thus he had come to\r\na decision that not only was his life compounded in the best manner for\r\nexpressing the possibilities to which the idealistic-peaceful side of\r\nhuman existence may attain, but also that it had been expressly created\r\nfor and preordained to, that purpose. To others, he reflected, let it\r\nfall to express life\xe2\x80\x99s restless aspects; to others let it be given to\r\nexercise forces of construction and destruction; to each man be allotted\r\nhis true _m\xc3\xa9tier_.\r\n\r\nSuch the philosophy which our Plato of Oblomovka elaborated for the\r\npurpose of lulling himself to sleep amid the problems and the stern\r\ndemands of duty and of destiny. He had been bred and nourished to play\r\nthe part, not of a gladiator in the arena but of a peaceful onlooker\r\nat the struggle. Never could his diffident, lethargic spirit have faced\r\neither the raptures or the blows of life. Hence he expressed only one\r\nof its aspects, and had no mind either to succeed in it, or to change\r\nanything in it, or to repent of his decision. As the years flowed on\r\nboth emotion and repining came to manifest themselves at rarer and rarer\r\nintervals, until, by quiet, imperceptible degrees, he became finally\r\ninterned in the plain, otiose tomb of retirement which he had fashioned\r\nwith his own hands, even as desert anchorites who have turned from\r\nthe world dig for themselves a material sepulchre. Of reorganizing his\r\nestate, and removing thither with his household; he had given up all\r\nthought. The steward whom Schtoltz had placed in charge of Oblomovka\r\nregularly sent him the income therefrom, and the peasantry proffered\r\nhim flour and poultry at Christmastide, and everything on the estate was\r\nprospering.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he ate heartily and much, even as he had done at Oblomovka.\r\nAlso, he walked and worked sluggishly and little--again, as he had done\r\nat Oblomovka. Lastly, in spite of his advancing years, he drank beer and\r\n_vodka \xc3\xa0 raisin_ with complete _insouciance_, and took to sleeping ever\r\nmore and more protractedly after dinner.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a change occurred. One day, after his usual quota of\r\nslumber and day dreams, he tried to rise from the sofa, but failed,\r\nand his tongue refused to obey him. Terrified, he could compass only a\r\ngesture when he tried to call for help. Had he been living with Zakhar\r\nalone, he might have continued to signal for assistance until next\r\nmorning, or have died, and not been found there till the following day;\r\nbut, as it was, the eyes of his landlady had been watching over him like\r\nthe eyes of Providence itself, and it cost her no skill of wit, but only\r\nan instinct of the heart, to divine that all was not well with Oblomov.\r\nNo sooner had the instinct dawned upon her than Anisia was dispatched\r\nin a cab for a doctor, while Agafia Matvievna herself applied ice to the\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x99s head, and extracted from her medicine chest the whole armoury\r\nof smelling-bottles and fomentations which custom and report had\r\ndesignated for use at such a juncture. Even Zakhar managed to get one of\r\nhis boots on, and, thus shod, to fuss around his master in company with\r\nthe doctor, the mistress of the house, and Anisia.\r\n\r\nAt length, blood having been let, Oblomov returned to consciousness, and\r\nwas informed that he had just sustained an apoplectic stroke, and that\r\nhe must adopt a different course of life. Henceforth, _vodka_, beer,\r\nwine, coffee, and rich food were, with certain exceptions, to be\r\nprohibited, while in their place there were prescribed for him daily\r\nexercise and a regular amount of sleep of an exclusively nocturnal\r\nnature. Even then these remedies would have come to nothing but for\r\nAgafia Matvievna\xe2\x80\x99s watchfulness; but she had the wit so to introduce the\r\nsystem that the entire household involuntarily assisted in its working.\r\nThus, partly by, cunning and partly by kindness, she contrived to wean\r\nOblomov from his attractive indulgences in wind, postprandial slumber,\r\nand fish pasties. For instance, as soon as ever he began to doze, either\r\na chair would be unset in an adjoining room, or, of its own volition,\r\nsome old and worthless crockery would begin flying into splinters, or\r\nthe children would start making a noise, and be told, _fortissimo_, to\r\nbe gone. Lastly, should even this not prove effective, her own kindly\r\nvoice would be heard calling to him, in order to ask him some question\r\nor another.\r\n\r\nAlso, the garden path was lengthened, and on it Oblomov accomplished,\r\nmorning and evening, a constitutional of some two hours\xe2\x80\x99 duration. With\r\nhim there would walk the landlady--or, if she could not attend, one of\r\nthe children, or his old friend, the irresponsible and to every man both\r\nhumble and agreeable Alexiev. One morning Oblomov, leaning on the boy\r\nVania\xe2\x80\x99s arm, slowly paced the path. By this time Vania had grown into\r\nalmost a youth, and found it hard to restrict his brisk, rapid step to\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s more tardy gait. As the elder man walked he made little use of\r\none of his legs, which was a trace of the stroke which he had recently\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go indoors now, Vaniushka,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; wherefore they directed\r\ntheir steps towards the door. But to meet them! there issued Agafia\r\nMatvievna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you coming in so early?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarly, indeed? Why, we have paced the path twenty times each way, and\r\nfrom here to the fence is a distance of fifty _sazhens_; wherefore we\r\nhave covered two versts in all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many times do _you_ say you have paced it?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired of\r\nVania.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not lie, but look me straight in the face,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, fixing\r\nhim with her gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been watching you the whole time. Remember\r\nnext Sunday. Possibly I might not let you go to the party that night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have paced the path only\r\n_twelve_ times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were nipping off acacia-leaves\r\nall the time, whereas _I_ was keeping the most careful account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must go and do some more walking,\xe2\x80\x9d decided the landlady.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, the fish soup is not yet ready.\xe2\x80\x9d And she closed the door upon\r\nthe pair.\r\n\r\nOblomov, much against his will, completed another eight pacings of the\r\npath, and then entered the dining-room. On the large round table\r\nthe fish soup was now steaming, and all hastened to take their usual\r\nseats--Oblomov in solitary state on the sofa, the landlady on his right,\r\nand the rest in due sequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will help you to _this_ herring, as it is the fattest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Agafia\r\nMatvievna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, I think that a pie would go well with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! I have forgotten the pies! I meant to make some last night,\r\nbut my memory is all gone to pieces!\xe2\x80\x9d The artful Agafia Matvievna!\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I am afraid that I have forgotten the cutlets and the cabbage.\r\nIn fact, you must not expect very much of a dinner to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\naddressed ostensibly to Alexiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI can eat anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not cook him some pork and peas, or a beef-steak?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nOblomov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _did_ go to the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s for a beefsteak, but there was not a single\r\nmorsel of good beef left. However, I have made Monsieur Alexiev a cherry\r\n_compote_ instead. I know he likes that.\xe2\x80\x9d The truth was that cherry\r\n_compote was not_ bad for Oblomov; wherefore the complacent Alexiev had\r\nno choice but both to eat it and to like it.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner no power on earth could prevent Oblomov from assuming a\r\nrecumbent position; so, to obviate his going to sleep, the landlady\r\nwas accustomed to place beside him his coffee, and then to inspire,\r\nher children to play games on the floor, so that, willy-nilly, Oblomov\r\nshould be forced to join in their sport. Presently she withdrew to\r\nthe kitchen to see if the coffee was yet ready, and, meanwhile, the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s clatter died away. Almost at once a gentle snore arose in\r\nthe room--then a louder one--then one louder still; and when Agafia\r\nMatvievna returned with the steaming coffee-pot she encountered such a\r\nvolume of snoring as would have done credit to a post-house.\r\n\r\nAngrily she shook her head at Alexiev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d he said deprecatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to stir up the\r\nchildren, but they would not listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSwiftly depositing the coffee-pot upon the table, she caught up little\r\nAndriusha from the floor, and gently seated him upon the sofa by\r\nOblomov\xe2\x80\x99s side; whereupon the child wriggled towards him, climbed his\r\nform until he had reached his face, and grasped him firmly by the nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Hullo I Who is that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov uneasily as he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had gone to sleep, so Andriusha climbed on to the sofa and awoke\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the landlady kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had gone to sleep, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Oblomov, laying his arm around\r\nthe little one. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I did not hear him creeping along on all\r\nfours? Why, I hear _everything_. To think of the little rascal catching\r\nme by the nose! I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it him! But there, there.\xe2\x80\x9d Tenderly embracing\r\nthe child, he deposited him on the floor again, and heaved a profound\r\nsigh. \xe2\x80\x9cTell us the news, Ivan Alexiev,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard it all. I have nothing more to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so? You go into society, and I do not. Is there nothing new in the\r\npolitical world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is being said that the earth is growing colder every day, and that\r\none day it will become frozen altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with you! Is _that_ politics?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence ensued. Oblomov quietly relapsed into a state of coma that was\r\nneither sleeping nor waking. He merely let his thoughts wander at will,\r\nwithout concentrating them upon anything in particular as calmly he\r\nlistened to the beating of his heart and occasionally blinked his eyes.\r\nThus he sank into a vague, enigmatical condition which partook largely\r\nof the nature of hallucination. In rare instances there come to a man\r\nfleeting moments of abstraction when he seems to be reliving past stages\r\nof his life. Whether he has previously beheld in sleep the phenomena\r\nwhich are passing before his vision, or whether he has gone through a\r\nprevious existence and has since forgotten it, we cannot say; but at\r\nall events he can see the same persons around him as were present in the\r\nfirst instance, and hear the same words as were uttered then.\r\n\r\nSo was it with Oblomov now. Gradually there spread itself about him\r\nthe hush which he had known long ago. He could hear the beating of the\r\nwell-known pendulum, the snapping of the thread as it was bitten off,\r\nand the repetition of familiar whispered sentences like \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\nmake the thread go through the eye of the needle. Pray do it for me,\r\nMasha--your eyesight is keener than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLazily, mechanically he looked into his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s face; and straightway\r\nfrom the recesses of his memory there arose a picture which, somewhere,\r\nhad been well known to him.\r\n\r\nTo his vision there dawned the great, dark drawing-room in the house\r\nof his youth, lit by a single candle. At the table his mother and her\r\nguests were sitting over their needlework, while his father was silently\r\npacing up and down. Somehow the present and the past had become fused\r\nand interchanged, so that, as the little Oblomov, he was dreaming that\r\nat length he had reached the enchanted country where the rivers run milk\r\nand honey, and bread can be obtained without toil, and every one walks\r\nclad in gold and silver.\r\n\r\nOnce again he could hear the old legends and the old folk-tales, mingled\r\nwith the clatter of knives and crockery in the kitchen. Once again he\r\nwas pressing close to his nurse to listen to her tremulous, old woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is Militrissa Kirbitievna,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying as she pointed\r\nto the figure of his landlady. Also, the same clouds seemed to be\r\nfloating in the blue zenith that used to float there of yore, and the\r\nsame wind to be blowing in at the window, and ruffling his hair, and\r\nthe same cock of the Oblomovkan poultry-yard to be strutting and crowing\r\nbelow. Suddenly a dog barked. Some other guest must be arriving! Would\r\nit be old Schtoltz and his little boy from Verklevo? Yes, probably, for\r\nto-day is a holiday. And in very truth it _is_ they--he can hear their\r\nfootsteps approaching nearer and nearer! The door opens, and \xe2\x80\x9cAndrei!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he exclaims excitedly, for there, sure enough, stands his friend--but\r\nnow grown to manhood, and no longer a little boy!...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOblomov recovered consciousness. Before him Schtoltz _was_\r\nstanding--but the Schtoltz of the present, not the Schtoltz of a\r\ndaydream.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the landlady caught up the baby Andriusha, swept the table clear\r\nof her work, and carried off the children. Alexiev also disappeared, and\r\nSchtoltz and Oblomov found themselves alone. For a moment or two they\r\ngazed at one another amid a tense silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that really you. Schtoltz?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov in tones scarcely audible\r\nfor emotion--such tones as a man employs only towards his dearest friend\r\nand after a long separation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is I,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Schtoltz quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you--are you quite well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov embraced him heartily. In that embrace were expressed all the\r\nlong-concealed grief and joy which, fermenting ever in his soul, had\r\nnever, since Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s last departure, been expressed to any human\r\nbeing. Then they seated themselves, and once more gazed at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you _really_ well?\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz asked again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oblomov. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have been ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--I was seized with a stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Ilya, Ilya! Evidently you have let yourself go again. What have you\r\nbeen doing? Actually, it is five years since last we saw one another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov sighed, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did you not come to Oblomovka?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why have\r\nyou never written to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was there to say?\xe2\x80\x9d was Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s sad reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know me.\r\nConsequently you need ask no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are still living in these rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d And Schtoltz surveyed the room\r\nas he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you not moved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am still here. I do not think the move will ever take place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I _am_ sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Schtoitz eyed him closely, then became thoughtful, and started to\r\npace the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what of Olga Sergievna?\xe2\x80\x9d was Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s next question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is\r\nshe now, and does she still remember me?\xe2\x80\x9d At this point he broke off\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is well, and has of you a remembrance as clear as though she\r\nhad parted from you yesterday. Presently I will tell you where she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children too are well. But are you jesting when you say that you\r\nare going to remain where you are? My express purpose in coming here is\r\nto carry you off to our place in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oblomov, though lowering his voice as he glanced at the\r\ndoor. Evidently the proposal had disturbed him greatly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not say a\r\nword about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not begin your arguments again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why will you not come? What is the matter with you? You know me\r\nwell, and know that long ago I undertook this task, and shall never\r\nrelinquish it. Hitherto business affairs have occupied my time, but now\r\nI am free once more. Come and live with us, or, at all events, near us.\r\nOlga and I have decided that you _must_ do so. Thank God that I have\r\nfound you the same as before, and not worse! My hopes of doing that had\r\nbeen small. Let us be off at once. I am prepared even to abduct you by\r\nforce. You _must_ change your mode of life, as you well know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this speech Oblomov listened with impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not speak so loudly,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged. \xe2\x80\x9cIn there----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the landlady, and, should she hear us, she will think that I am\r\ngoing to leave her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should you not leave her? Let her think what she likes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Andrei.\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s tone was one of unwonted firmness. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\ncontinue your useless attempts to persuade me. Come what may, I must\r\nremain where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSchtoltz gazed at his friend in astonishment, but Oblomov returned the\r\ngaze with quiet resolution on his features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemain here, and you are lost,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cThis house, that woman,\r\nthis way of living?--I tell you the thing cannot be Let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caught Oblomov by the sleeve, and started to drag him towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to take me away?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oblomov, hanging back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I want you to leave this den, this swamp, for the world of\r\nlight and air and health and normal existence.\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz was speaking\r\nsternly, and almost in a tone of command. \xe2\x80\x9cTo what point have you sunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is going to become of you? Think for a moment. Are\r\nyou so attached to this mode of life that you wish to go to sleep like a\r\nmole in its burrow? Remember that-----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire to remember nothing. Do not disturb the past. It can never\r\nbe brought back again.\xe2\x80\x9d Into Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s face there had come a full\r\nconsciousness of his power to think, to reason, and to will. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nit you wish me to do? From the world to which you would abduct me I have\r\nparted for ever; and to solder together two pieces which have started\r\nasunder is impossible. I have grown to look upon this nook as my world.\r\nShould you uproot me from it, I shall die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look at the place, at the people with whom you are living!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean--I am perfectly conscious of the facts. Ah,\r\nAndrei, believe me when I say that so well do I feel and understand\r\nthings that for many a day past I have been ashamed to show myself\r\nabroad. Yet I cannot accompany you on your road. Even did I wish it,\r\nsuch a course is out of my power. Possibly, when you were last here, I\r\n_might_ have made the attempt; but now\xe2\x80\x9d--here he dropped his eyes for\r\na moment and paused--\xe2\x80\x9cnow it is too late. Go, and waste no further time\r\nupon me. Your friendship, as God in heaven knows, I value; but your\r\ndisturbance of my peace I do _not_ value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing that you can say will turn me from my purpose. I intend to\r\ncarry you off, ard the more so because I suspect certain things. Look\r\nhere. Put on a garment of some sort, and come and spend the evening at\r\nmy rooms. I have much to tell you, for I suppose you know what is afoot\r\nat our place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I had forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou no longer go into society.\r\nWell, come with me, and I will tell you the whole story. Also, do you\r\nknow who is waiting for me in a carriage at the gates? I will go and\r\ncall her in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Olga?\xe2\x80\x9d As the words burst tremulously from Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s lips his\r\nface underwent a sudden change. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake do not bring her here!\r\nGo, go for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the elder man refused to move, although his friend half started to\r\npush him towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot return to her without you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have pledged my\r\nword on that. If you will not come with me to-day, then you must come\r\nto-morrow. You are merely putting me off for a time: you will never put\r\nme off for ever. Even should it be the day after to-morrow, we still\r\nshall meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOblomov said nothing, but hung his head as though afraid to meet\r\nSchtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you coming, therefore?\xe2\x80\x9d went on Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cOlga will be sure\r\nto ask me when.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Andrei,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other in a tone of affectionate appeal as he\r\nembraced his friend and laid his head upon his shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cPray leave me\r\nand--_forget_ me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? For ever?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Schtoltz in astonishment as he withdrew a little\r\nfrom Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s embrace in order the better to look him in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Oblomov.\r\n\r\nSchtoltz stepped, back a pace or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan this really be you, Ilya?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nreally reject me in favour of that woman, of that landlady of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He started with a sudden pang. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that child which I saw just new is\r\n_your_ child? Ah, Ilya, Ilya! Come hence at once. How you have fallen!\r\nWhat is that woman to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oblomov simply.\r\n\r\nSchtoltz stood petrified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the child is my son,\xe2\x80\x9d Oblomov continued. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been called\r\nAndrei after yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Somehow he seemed to breathe more freely now\r\nthat he had got rid of the burden of these disclosures. As for Schtoltz,\r\nhis face fell, and he gazed around the room with vacant eyes. A gulf had\r\nopened before him, a high wall had suddenly shot up, and Oblomov seemed\r\nto have ceased to exist--he seemed to have vanished from his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsight, and to have fallen headlong. The only feeling in Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nwas an aching sorrow of the kind which a man experiences when, hastening\r\nto visit a friend after a long parting, he finds that for many a day\r\npast that friend has been dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are lost!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept whispering mechanically. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to say to\r\nOlga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length Oblomov caught the last words, and tried to say something, but\r\nfailed. All he could do was to extend his hands in Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s direction.\r\nSilently, convulsively the pair embraced, even as before death or\r\na battle. In that embrace was left no room for words or tears or\r\nexpressions of feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever forget my little Andrei,\xe2\x80\x9d was Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s last choking utterance.\r\nSlowly and silently Schtoltz left the house. Slowly and silently he\r\ncrossed the courtyard and entered the carriage. When he had gone Oblomov\r\nreseated himself upon the sofa in his room, rested his elbows upon the\r\ntable, and buried his face in his hands....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never will I forget your little Andrei,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Schtoltz sadly as\r\nhe drove homewards. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Ilya, you are lost beyond recall! It would be\r\nuseless now to tell you that your Oblomovka is no longer in ruins, that\r\nits turn is come again, and that it is basking in the rays of the sun.\r\nIt would be useless now to tell you that, some four years hence, it will\r\nhave a railway-station, and that your peasantry are clearing away the\r\nrubbish there, and that before long an iron road will be carrying your\r\ngrain to the wharves, and that already local schools have been built.\r\nSuch a dawn of good fortune would merely affright you; it would merely\r\ncause you: unaccustomed eyes to smart. Yet along the road which you\r\ncould not tread I will lead your little Andrei; and with him I will put\r\ninto practice those theories whereof you and I used to dream in the days\r\nof our youth. Farewell, Oblomovka of the past! You have outlived your\r\nday!\xe2\x80\x9d For the last time Schtoltz looked back at Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s diminutive\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Olga with a beating heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Schtollz answered dryly and abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he alive and well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d came the reluctant reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why have you returned so soon? Why did you not call me to the\r\nhouse, or else bring him out to see me? Let me go back, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so? What has happened there? Will you not tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSchtoltz continued to say nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain I ask you: what is the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe disease of Oblomovka,\xe2\x80\x9d was the grim response. And throughout the\r\nrest of the journey homeward Schtoltz refused to answer a single one of\r\nOlga\xe2\x80\x99s questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nFive years have passed, and more than one change has taken place in the\r\nVeaborg Quarter. The street which used to lead, unenclosed, to Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhumble abode is now lined with villas. In the midst of them a tall stone\r\nGovernment office rears its head between the sunlight and the windows\r\nof that quiet, peaceful little house which the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays once warmed so\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nThe house itself has grown old and crazy: it wears a dull, neglected\r\nlook like that of a man who is unshaven and unwashed. In places the\r\npaint has peeled away, and in others the gutters are broken. To the\r\nlatter is due the fact that pools of dirty water stand in the courtyard,\r\nand that thrown across them is a piece of old planking. Should a visitor\r\napproach the wicket, the old watchdog no longer leaps nimbly to the\r\nextent of his chain, but gives tongue hoarsely and lazily from the\r\ninterior of his kennel.\r\n\r\nAnd, within the house, what changes have taken place! Over it there\r\nreigns a different housewife to the former one, and different children\r\nsport in play. Again is seen about the premises the lean countenance of\r\nTarantiev, rather than the kindly, careless features of Alexiev; while\r\nof Zakhar and Anisia also there is not a sign discernible. A new cook\r\nperforms, rudely and unwillingly, the quiet behests of Agafia Matvievna,\r\nand our old friend Akulina--her apron girded around her middle--washes\r\nup, as formerly, the domestic crockery and the pots and pans. Lastly,\r\nthe same old sleepy _dvornik_ whiles away the same old idle life in the\r\nsame old den by the gates, and at a given hour each morning, as well as\r\nalways at the hour of the evening meal, there flashes past the railings\r\nof the fence the figure of Agafia\xe2\x80\x99s brother, clad, summer and winter\r\nalike, in galoshes, and always carrying under his arm a large bundle of\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nBut what of Oblomov? Where is he--where? Under a modest urn in the\r\nadjoining cemetery his body rests among the shrubs. All is quiet where\r\nhe is lying; only a lilac-tree, planted there by a loving hand, waves\r\nits boughs to and fro over the grave as it mingles its scent with the\r\nsweet, calm odour of wormwood. One would think that the _Angel of Peace_\r\nhimself were watching over the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s slumbers....\r\n\r\nDespite his wife\xe2\x80\x99s ceaseless and devoted care for every moment of his\r\nexistence, the prolonged inertia, the unbroken stillness, the sluggish\r\ngliding from day to day had ended by quietly arresting the machine of\r\nlife. Thus Oblomov met his end, to all appearances without pain, without\r\ndistress, even as stops a watch which its owner has--forgotten to wind\r\nup. No one witnessed his last moments or heard his expiring gasp. A\r\nsecond stroke of apoplexy occurred within a year of the first, and, like\r\nits precursor, passed away favourably. Later, however, Oblomov became\r\npale and weak, took to eating little and seldom walking in the garden,\r\nand increased in moodiness and taciturnity as the days went on. At times\r\nhe would even burst into tears, for he felt death drawing nearer, and\r\nwas afraid of it. One or two relapses occurred, from which he rallied,\r\nand then Agafia Matvievna entered his room, one morning, to find him\r\nresting on his deathbed as quietly as he had done in sleep--the only\r\ndifference being that his head had slipped a little from the pillow, and\r\nthat one of his hands was convulsively clutching the region of the heart\r\nin a manner which suggested that the pain had there centred itself until\r\nthe circulation of the blood had stopped for ever.\r\n\r\nAfter his death Agafia Matvievna\xe2\x80\x99s sister-in-law, Irina Paptelievna,\r\nassumed control of the establishment. That is to say, she arrogated to\r\nherself the right to rise late in the morning, to drink three cups of\r\ncoffee for breakfast, to change her dress three times a day, and to\r\nconfine her housewifely energies to seeing that her gowns were starched\r\nto the utmost degree of stiffness. More she would not trouble to\r\nundertake, and, as before, Agafia Matvievna remained the active\r\npendulum of the domestic clock. Not only did she superintend the\r\nkitchen and the dining-room, and prepare tea and coffee for the entire\r\nhousehold, but also she did the general mending and supervised the\r\nlinen, the children, Akulina, and the _dvornik_.\r\n\r\nWhy was this? Was she not Madame Oblomov and the proprietress of a\r\nlanded estate? Might she not have maintained a separate, an independent\r\nestablishment, and have wanted for nothing, and have been at no one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeck and call? What had led her to take upon her shoulders the burden\r\nof another\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeping, the care of another\xe2\x80\x99s children, and all those\r\npetty details which women usually assume only at the call of love, or in\r\nobedience to sacred family ties, or for the purpose of earning a morsel\r\nof daily bread? Where, too, were Zakhar and Anisia--now become, by every\r\nright of law, her servants? Where, too, was the little treasure, Andrei,\r\nwhich Oblomov had bequeathed her? Where, finally, were her children by\r\nher first husband?\r\n\r\nThose children were now all provided for. That is to say, Vania had\r\nfinished his schooling and entered Government service, his sister had\r\nmarried the manager of a Government office, and little Andrei had been\r\ncommitted to the care of Schtoltz and his wife, who looked upon him as\r\na member of their own family. Never for a moment did Agafia Matvievna\r\nmentally compare his lot, or place it on a level with, that of her first\r\nchildren--although, unconsciously it may be, she allotted them all an\r\nequal place in her heart. In her opinion the little Andrei\xe2\x80\x99s upbringing,\r\nmode of life, and future career stood divided by an immeasurable gulf\r\nfrom the fortunes of Vania and his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are _they?_\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to herself when she called to see\r\nAndrei. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are children born of the people, whereas this one was born\r\na young _barin_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she would caress the boy, if not with actual timidity, at all\r\nevents with a certain touch of caution, and add to herself with\r\nsomething like respect: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a white skin he has! \xe2\x80\x99Tis almost\r\ntransparent. And what tiny hands and feet, too, and what silky hair! He\r\nis just like his dead father.\xe2\x80\x9d Consequently she was the more ready\r\nto accede to Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s request when he asked her that he (Schtoltz)\r\nshould educate the youngster; since she felt sure that Schtoltz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold was far more the lad\xe2\x80\x99s proper place than was her own\r\nestablishment, where he would have been thrown among her grimy young\r\nnephews.\r\n\r\nClad in black, she would glide like a shadow from room to room of the\r\nhouse--opening and shutting cupboards, sewing, making lace, but doing\r\neverything quietly, and without the least sign of energy. When spoken\r\nto, she would reply as though to do so were an effort. Moreover, her\r\neyes no longer glanced swiftly from object to object, as they had\r\ndone in the old days: rather, they remained fixed in a sort of ever\r\nconcentrated gaze. Probably they had assumed that gaze during the hour\r\nwhen she had stood looking at her dead husband\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nThat the light of her life was fast flickering before going out, that\r\nGod had breathed His breath into her existence and taken it away again,\r\nand that her sun had shone brilliantly and was setting for ever, she\r\nclearly understood. Yes, that sun was setting for ever, but not before\r\nshe had learnt the reason why she had been given life, and the fact that\r\nshe had not lived in vain. Greatly she had loved, and to the full: she\r\nhad loved _Oblomov_ as a lover, as a husband, and as a _barin_. But\r\naround her there was no one to comprehend this; wherefore she kept her\r\ngrief the more closely locked, in her own bosom.\r\n\r\nOnly, next winter, when Schtoltz came to town, she ran to see him,\r\nand to gaze hungrily at little Andrei, whom she covered with caresses.\r\nPresently she tried to say something--to thank Schtoltz, and to pour out\r\nbefore him all that had been accumulating in her heart in the absence of\r\nan outlet. Such words he would have understood perfectly, had they been\r\nuttered. But the task was beyond her--she could only throw herself\r\nupon Olga, glue her lips to her hand, and burst into such a torrent of\r\nscalding tears that perforce Olga wept with her, and Schtoltz, greatly\r\nmoved, hastened from the room. All three had now a common bond of\r\nsympathy--that bond being the memory of Oblomov\xe2\x80\x99s unsullied soul. More\r\nthan once Schtoltz and Olga besought the widow to come and live with\r\nthem in the country, but always she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere I was born and have\r\nlived my live, there must I also die.\xe2\x80\x9d Likewise, when Schtoltz proposed\r\nto render her an account of his management of the Oblomovkan property,\r\nshe returned him the income therefrom, with a request that he should lay\r\nit by for the benefit of little Andrei.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis his, not mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9c_He_ is the _barin_, and I will\r\ncontinue to live as I have always done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOne day, about noon, two gentlemen were walking along a pavement in the\r\nVeaborg Quarter, while behind them a carriage quietly paced. One of\r\nthe gentlemen was Schtoltz, the other a literary friend of his--a stout\r\nindividual with an apathetic face and sleepy, meditative eyes. As they\r\ndrew level with a church, Mass had just ended, and the congregation\r\nwas pouring into the street. In front of them a knot of beggars was\r\ncollecting a rich and varied harvest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder where these mendicants come from,\xe2\x80\x9d said the literary\r\ngentleman, glancing at the reapers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of sundry nooks and corners, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not what I meant. What I meant is, how have they descended\r\nto their present position of beggars? Have they come to it suddenly or\r\ngradually, for a good reason or for a bad one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so anxious to know? Are you contemplating writing a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mysteries of Petrograd\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am,\xe2\x80\x9d the literary gentleman explained with an indolent yawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen here is a chance for you. Ask any one of them, and, for the sum\r\nof a rouble, he will sell you his story, which, jotted down, you could\r\nresell to the nobility. For instance, take this old man here. He looks a\r\ngood example of the normal type. Hi, old man! We want you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man turned his head at the summons, doffed his cap, and\r\napproached the two gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d he whined, \xe2\x80\x9cpray help a poor man who has been wounded in\r\nthirty battles and grown old in war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Zakhar!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Schtoltz in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ you,\r\nZakhar, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Zakhar said nothing. Then suddenly, he shaded his eyes from the sun,\r\nand, staring intently at Schtoltz, muttered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, your Honour--I do not recognize you. I am nearly blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You have forgotten your old friend, the _bavin_ Schtoltz?\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nother asked reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! Is it _really_ your Honour? My bad sight has got the better\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatching Schtoltz impetuously by the hand, the old man imprinted kiss\r\nafter kiss upon the skirt of his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord Himself has permitted a poor lost wretch to see a joyful day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, half-laughing, half-crying. Over his face, and particularly\r\nover his rose, there had spread a purplish tinge, while his head was\r\nalmost completely bald, and his whiskers, though still long, looked so\r\nmatted and entangled as to resemble pieces of felt wherein snowballs\r\nhave been wrapped. As for his clothing, it consisted of an old, faded\r\ncloak, with one of the lapels missing, and a pair of down-at-heel\r\ngoloshes. In his hands was a cap from which the fur had become worn\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven has indeed granted me joy for\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x99s festival!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you in this state?\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you not ashamed\r\nof yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Honour; but what else could I do?\xe2\x80\x9d And Zakhar heaved a\r\nprofound sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cHow else was I to live? So long as Anisia was alive I\r\nhad _not_ to go wandering about like this, for I was given bite and sup\r\nwhenever I wanted it; but she died of cholera (Heaven rest her soul!),\r\nand her brother straightway refused to support me, saying that I was\r\nnothing but an old hanger-on. From Michei Andreitch Tarantiev too I\r\nreceived shameful abuse, and neither of them--would you believe it, your\r\nHonour?--ever gave me a morsel of bread! Indeed, had it not been for the\r\n_barinia_, God bless her\xe2\x80\x9d--and Zakhar crossed himself--\xe2\x80\x9cI should long\r\nago have perished of the cold; but for a while she gave me a bit of\r\nclothing, and as much bread as I could eat, and a place by the stove of\r\na night. Then they took to rating her on my account; so at last I left\r\nthe house to wander whither my eyes might lead me. This is the second\r\nyear that I have been dragging out this miserable existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did you not go and seek a situation?\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was I to get one at this time of day, your Honour? True, I tried\r\nfor two, but was unsuccessful. Things are not what they used to be:\r\neverything has changed for the worse. Nowadays masters require their\r\nlacqueys to look respectable, and the gentry no longer keep their halls\r\nchock-full of footmen. Indeed, \xe2\x80\x99tis seldom that you will find so many\r\nas _two_ footmen in a house. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gentry actually take\r\noff their_ own boots! They have even gone so _far as to invent a machine\r\nto do it with!\xe2\x80\x9d Evidently the idea cut Zakhar to the heart. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cour gentry are a shame and a disgrace to the country. They\r\nare fast coming to rack and ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d A sigh of profound regret followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt one place,\xe2\x80\x9d presently he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI did obtain a situation. \xe2\x80\x99Twas\r\nwith a German merchant, who engaged me to be his hall lacquey. After a\r\nwhile, however, he sent me to serve in the pantry. Now, was _that_ my\r\nproper business? One day I was carrying some crockery across the room\r\non a tray, and the floor happened to be smooth and slippery, and down\r\nI fell, and the tray and the crockery with me. So I was turned out\r\nof doors. Next, an old countess took a fancy to my looks. \xe2\x80\x98He is of\r\nrespectable appearance,\xe2\x80\x99 she said to herself, and added me to her\r\nstaff of Swiss lacqueys. The post was a light one, and bid fair to be\r\npermanent, too. All that I had to do was to sit as solemnly as possible\r\non a chair, to cross one leg over the other, and, when any rascal\r\ncalled, not to answer him, but just to grunt and send the fellow\r\naway--or else give him a box on the ear. Of course, to the gentry one\r\nhad to behave differently--just to wave one\xe2\x80\x99s staff like this.\xe2\x80\x9d Zakhar\r\ngave an illustration of what he meant. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I say, \xe2\x80\x99twas an easy job,\r\nand the lady, God bless her! was not overdifficult to please. But one\r\nday she happened to peep into my room and to see there a bug. With that\r\nshe bristled up and shrieked as though it had been _I_ who had invented\r\nbugs! When was a household _ever_ without a bug? So the next time she\r\npassed me she pretended that I smelt of liquor, and dismissed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you smell of it now--and very strongly,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Schtoltz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my sorrow, I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d whined Zakhar, wrinkling his brow\r\nbitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then I tried to get a coachman\xe2\x80\x99s job, and took service\r\nwith a gentleman; but one day I had my feet frost-bitten (for I was\r\noverold and weak for the job), and another day the brute of a horse fell\r\ndown and nearly broke my ribs, and another day I ran over an old woman\r\nand got taken to the police-station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well! Instead of drinking and getting yourself into trouble, come\r\nto my house, and I will give you a corner there until it is time for us\r\nto return to the country. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Honour--yes; but, but----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZakhar sighed again. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not leave these parts. You see, the\r\ngrave is here--the grave where my old patron is lying.\xe2\x80\x9d Zakhar sobbed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to-day I have been there to commend his soul to God. What a\r\n_barin_ the Lord God has taken from us! \xe2\x80\x99Twould have been good for us\r\nif he could have lived another hundred years. Yes, only to-day I have\r\nbeen visiting his grave. Whenever I am near the spot I go and sit beside\r\nit, and shed tears--ah, such tears! And sometimes, too, when all is\r\nquiet there, I seem to hear him calling to me once more, \xe2\x80\x98Zakhar!\r\nZakhar!\xe2\x80\x99--and shivers go running down my back. Never lived there such\r\na _barin_ as he! And how fond of yourself he was, your Honour! May the\r\nLord remember him when the heavenly kingdom shall come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to see our little Andrei,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you like, you\r\ncan have charge of him.\xe2\x80\x9d And he handed the old man some money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I _will_ come! How could I not come when it is to see little\r\nAndrei Ilyitch? By this time he must be grown into a tall young\r\ngentleman. What joy the Lord has reserved for me this day! Yes, I _will_\r\ncome, your Honour, and may God send you good health and many a long\r\nyear of life!\xe2\x80\x9d But it was after a departing carriage that Zakhar was\r\ndispatching his benedictions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear the old beggar\xe2\x80\x99s story?\xe2\x80\x9d Schtoltz asked of his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Who was the Oblomov whom he mentioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was--Oblomov. More than once I have spoken to you of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I think I remember the name. Yes, he was a friend and comrade of\r\nyours, was he not? What became of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came to rack and ruin--though for no apparent reason.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke\r\nSchtoltz sighed heavily. Then he added: \xe2\x80\x9cHis intellect was equal to\r\nthat of his fellow\xe2\x80\x99s, his soul was as clear and as bright as glass, his\r\ndisposition was kindly, and he was a gentleman to the core. Yet he--he\r\nfell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherefore? What was the cause?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cause?\xe2\x80\x9d re-echoed Schtoltz. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cause was--the disease of\r\nOblomovka.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe disease of Oblomovka?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the literary gentleman in some\r\nperplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome day I will tell you. For the moment leave me to my thoughts and\r\nmemories. Hereafter you shall write them down, for they might prove of\r\nvalue to some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn time Schtoltz related to his friend what herein is to be found\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OBLOMOV ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
