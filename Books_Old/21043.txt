There had been no day like it all the\r\nsummer.  Indeed, Squires, the head gardener at Garden Vale, positively\r\nasserted that there had been none like it since he had been employed on\r\nthe place, which was fourteen years last March.  Squires, by the way,\r\nnever lost an opportunity of reminding himself and the world generally\r\nof the length of his services to the family at Garden Vale; and on the\r\nstrength of those fourteen years he gave himself airs as if the place\r\nbelonged not to Mr Cruden at all, but to himself.  He was the terror of\r\nhis mistress, who scarcely dared to peep into a greenhouse without his\r\nleave, and although he could never exactly obtain from the two young\r\ngentlemen the respect to which he considered himself entitled, he still\r\nflattered himself in secret "they couldn\'t do exactly what they liked\r\nwith his garden!"\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, it was so hot that even Squires, after having expressed\r\nthe opinion on the weather above mentioned, withdrew himself into the\r\ncoolest recess of his snug lodge and slept sweetly, leaving the young\r\ngentlemen, had they been so minded, to take any liberty they liked with\r\n"his" garden.\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen, however, were not so minded.\r\n\r\nThey had been doing their best to play lawn tennis in the blazing sun\r\nwith two of their friends, but it was too hot to run, too hot to hit,\r\nand far too hot to score, so the attempt had died away, and three of\r\nthem now reclined on the sloping bank under the laurel hedge, dividing\r\ntheir time between lazily gazing up at the dark-blue sky and watching\r\nthe proceedings of the fourth of their party, who still remained in the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nThis last-mentioned youth, who, to judge by his countenance, was brother\r\nto one of those who lolled on the bank, presented a curious contrast to\r\nthe general languor of the afternoon.  Deserted by his companions in the\r\nsport, he was relieving himself of some of his superfluous energy by the\r\nnovel diversion of playing tennis with himself.  This he accomplished by\r\nserving the ball high up in the air and then jumping the net, so as to\r\ntake it on the other side, following up his return by another leap over\r\nthe net, and so on till either he or the ball came to grief.  On an\r\nordinary day the exertion involved in this pastime would be quite enough\r\nfor any ordinary individual, but on a day like the present, with the\r\nthermometer at ninety in the shade, it was a trifle too much even to\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake shut up, Horrors," said the elder brother.  "We\r\nmight as well be playing ourselves as watch you at that sort of thing."\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman addressed as Horrors was at that moment in the midst\r\nof one of his aerial flights, and had neither leisure nor breath to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?" repeated the other.  "If you want to keep warm, go\r\nindoors and put on a great-coat, but don\'t fag us to death with that\r\nfoolery."\r\n\r\n"Eight!" exclaimed the young athlete, scoring the number of times the\r\nball had crossed the net, and starting for another jump.  "Shut up, Reg,\r\ntill I\'ve done."\r\n\r\nHe soon was done.  Even Horace Cruden could not keep it up for ever, and\r\nat his tenth bound his foot caught in the net, and he came all fours on\r\nto the court.\r\n\r\n"There, now you\'re happy!" said his brother.  "Now you may as well come\r\nand sit here out of the cold."\r\n\r\nHorace picked himself up, laughing.\r\n\r\n"All very well," said he.  "I\'m certain I should have done it twelve\r\ntimes if you hadn\'t put me off my jump.  Never mind, I\'ll do it yet."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Horace," interposed one of the others, beseechingly, "if you love\r\nus, lie down now.  I\'m quite ill watching you, I assure you.  We\'ll all\r\nvow we saw you do it twelve times; we\'ll put it in the _Times_ if you\r\nlike, and say the net was five feet ten; anything, as long as you don\'t\r\nstart at it again."\r\n\r\nThis appeal had the effect of reducing the volatile Horace to a state of\r\nquiescence, and inducing him to come and share the shade with his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n"Never saw such a lazy lot," said he, lying flat on his back and\r\nbalancing his racquet on his finger; "you won\'t do anything yourselves\r\nand you won\'t let any one else do anything.  Regular dogs in the\r\nmanger."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said the fourth of the party in a half drawl, "we\'ve\r\nbeen doing nothing but invite you in to the manger for the last hour,\r\nand you wouldn\'t come.  Can\'t you take a holiday while we\'ve got one?"\r\n\r\n"Bad luck to it," said Reginald; "there\'s only a week more."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why you need growl, old man," said the visitor who had\r\nspoken first; "you\'ll get into the sixth and have a study to yourself,\r\nand no mathematics unless you like."\r\n\r\n"Poor Harker," said Horace, "he\'s always down on mathematics.  Anyhow, I\r\nshan\'t be sorry to show up at Wilderham again, shall you, Bland?"\r\n\r\n"Depends on the set we get," drawled Bland (whose full name was\r\nBlandford).  "I hear there\'s a crowd of new fellows coming, and I hate\r\nnew fellows."\r\n\r\n"A fellow must be new some time or other," said Horace.  "Harker and I\r\nwere new boys once, weren\'t we, Harker?"\r\n\r\nHarker, who had shared the distinction of being tossed with Horace in\r\nthe same blanket every night for the first week of his sojourn at\r\nWilderham, had not forgotten the fact, and ejaculated,--\r\n\r\n"Rather!"\r\n\r\n"The mischief is," continued Blandford, "they get such a shady lot of\r\nfellows there now.  The school\'s not half as respectable as it was--\r\nthere are far too many shopkeepers\' sons and that sort of--"\r\n\r\n"Sort of animal, he\'d like to say," laughed Horace.  "Bland can\'t get\r\nover being beaten for the French prize by Barber, the tailor\'s son."\r\n\r\nBlandford flushed up, and was going to answer when Reginald interposed.\r\n\r\n"Well, and suppose he can\'t, it\'s no wonder.  I don\'t see why those\r\nfellows shouldn\'t have a school for themselves.  It\'s not pleasant to\r\nhave the fellow who cuts your waistcoat crowing over you in class."\r\n\r\nHorace began to whistle, as he generally did when the conversation took\r\na turn that did not please him.\r\n\r\n"Best way to remedy that," said he, presently, "is not to get beaten by\r\nyour tailor\'s son."\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Horace," said the elder brother; "what\'s the use of making\r\nyourself disagreeable?  Bland\'s quite right, and you know you think so\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all serene," said Horace, cheerfully; "shouldn\'t have known I\r\nthought so unless you had told me.  What do you think, Harker?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Harker, laughing, "as I am disreputable enough to be the\r\nonly son of a widow who has barely enough to live on, and who depends on\r\nthe charity of a cousin or some one of the sort for my education, I\'m\r\nafraid Bland and I would have to go to different schools."\r\n\r\nEvery one laughed at this confession, and Reginald said,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you\'re different, Harker--besides, it isn\'t money makes the\r\ndifference--"\r\n\r\n"The thing is," interposed Horace, "was your father in the wholesale or\r\nretail trade?--that\'s the difference!"\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d shut up, Horace," said Reginald tartly; "you always spoil\r\nany argument with your foolery."\r\n\r\n"Now that\'s hard lines," said Horace, "when I thought I was putting the\r\ncase beautifully for you.  Never mind.  What do you say to a bathe in\r\nthe river, you fellows?"\r\n\r\n"Too much fag to get towels," said Reginald; "but if you like to go for\r\nthem, and don\'t ask us to look at our watches and see in how many\r\nseconds you run up to the house and back, we\'ll think about it."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Horace, and started up to the house whistling cheerily.\r\n\r\n"Awfully hot that brother of yours make? a fellow," said Blandford,\r\nwatching him disappear.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Reginald, yawning, "he is rather flighty, but he\'ll turn out\r\nall right, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Turn out!" said Harker; "why he\'s all right already, from the crown of\r\nhis head to the sole of his boot."\r\n\r\n"Except," said Blandford, "for a slight crack in the crown of his head.\r\nIt\'s just as well, perhaps, he\'s not the eldest son, Reg."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Reginald laughing, "I can hardly fancy Horace the head of\r\nthe family."\r\n\r\n"Must be a rum sensation," said Harker, "to be an heir and not have to\r\nbother your head about how you\'ll get your bread and butter some day.\r\nHow many hundred millions of pounds is it you\'ll come in for, Reg?  I\r\nforget."\r\n\r\n"What a humbug you are!" said Reginald; "my father\'s no better off than\r\na lot of other people."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a mild way of putting it, anyhow," said Blandford.\r\n\r\nAnd here the conversation ended.\r\n\r\nThe boys lay basking in the sun waiting for Horace\'s return.  He was\r\nunusually long in coming.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me," said Blandford, "he\'s trying how long he can be instead\r\nof how quick--for a variety."\r\n\r\n"Just like him," said Reginald.\r\n\r\nFive minutes passed away, and ten, and fifteen, and then, just as the\r\nboys were thinking of stirring themselves to inquire what had become of\r\nhim, they heard his steps returning rapidly down the gravel walk.\r\n\r\n"Well," cried Reginald, without sitting up, "have you got them at last?"\r\n\r\nHorace\'s voice startled them all as he cried,--\r\n\r\n"Reg!  Reg! come quick, quick!"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking either the tones or the white face of the boy who\r\nuttered them.\r\n\r\nReginald was on his feet in an instant, rushing in the direction of the\r\nhouse, towards which his brother had already started.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Horace?" he said as he overtook him.\r\n\r\n"Something about father--a telegram," gasped the other.\r\n\r\nNot another word was spoken as they ran on and reached the hall door.\r\n\r\nThe hall door stood open.  Just outside on the hot stone steps lay the\r\ntowels where Horace had dropped them five minutes ago.  Carlo, the dog,\r\nlay across the mat, and lazily lifted his head as his master approached.\r\nWithin stood Mrs Cruden, pale and trembling, with a telegram in her\r\nhand, and in the back-ground hovered three or four servants, with\r\nmingled curiosity and anxiety on their faces.\r\n\r\nDespite the heat, Reginald shivered as he stood a moment at the door,\r\nand then sprang towards the telegram, which his mother gave into his\r\nhand.  It was from Mr Cruden\'s coachman, dated from Saint Nathaniel\'s\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n"Master was took ill driving from City--brought here, where he is very\r\nbad indeed.  Doctor says no hope."\r\n\r\nOne needs to have received such a message oneself to understand the\r\nemotions with which the two brothers read and re-read the pitiless\r\nwords.  Nothing but their own hard breathing broke the stillness of\r\nthose few minutes, and who knows in that brief space what a lifetime\r\nseemed crowded?\r\n\r\nHorace was the first to recover his self-possession.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said he, and his voice sounded strange and startling in the\r\nsilence, "there\'s a train to the City in five minutes.  I\'ll go by\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nAnd he was off.  It was three-quarters of a mile to the station, and\r\nthere was no time to parley.  Even on an errand like this, many would\r\nhave abandoned the endeavour as an impossibility, especially in such a\r\nheat.  But Horace was a good runner, and the feat was nothing uncommon\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nAs he flung himself into the train he gave one quick glance round, to\r\nsee if Reginald had possibly followed him; but no, he was alone; and as\r\nthe whistle shrieked and the train steamed out of the station, Horace\r\nfor the first time had a moment to reflect.\r\n\r\nNot half an hour ago he had been lying with his brother and companions\r\non the tennis lawn, utterly unconscious of any impending calamity.  What\r\nages ago that seemed!  For a few minutes all appeared so confused and\r\nunreal that his mind was a blank, and he seemed even to forget on what\r\nerrand he was bound.\r\n\r\nBut Horace was a practical youth, and before that half-hour\'s journey to\r\nthe City was accomplished he was at least collected in mind, and\r\nprepared to face the trial that awaited him.\r\n\r\nThere was something about the telegram that convinced him it meant more\r\nthan it said.  Still, a boy\'s hopefulness will grasp at a straw, and he\r\nbattled with his despair.  His father was not dead--he would recover--at\r\nthe hospital he would have the best medical assistance possible.  The\r\ncoachman who sent the telegram would be sure to make things out at the\r\nworst.  Yes, when he got to Saint Nathaniel\'s he would find it was a\r\nfalse alarm, that there was nothing much the matter at all, and when his\r\nmother and Reginald arrived by the next train, he would be able to meet\r\nthem with reassuring news.  It was not more than a ten-minutes\' cab-\r\ndrive from the terminus--the train was just in now; in twelve minutes\r\nthis awful suspense would be at an end.\r\n\r\nSuch was the hurried rush of thoughts through the poor boy\'s brain\r\nduring that dismal journey.  He had sprung from the carriage to a hansom\r\ncab almost before the train had pulled up, and in another moment was\r\nclattering over the stones towards the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of a few minutes before oozed away as every street corner\r\nbrought him nearer his destination, and when at last the stately front\r\nof Saint Nathaniel\'s loomed before him, he wished his journey could\r\nnever end.  He gazed with faltering heart up at the ward windows, as if\r\nhe could read his fate there.  The place seemed deserted.  A few street\r\nboys were playing on the pavement, and at the door of the in-patients\'\r\nward a little cluster of visitors were collected round a flower stall\r\nbuying sweet mementoes of the country to brighten the bedsides of their\r\nfriends within.  No one heeded the pale scared boy as he alighted and\r\nwent up the steps.\r\n\r\nA porter opened the door.\r\n\r\n"My father, Mr Cruden, is here; how is he?"\r\n\r\n"Is it the gentleman that was brought in in a fit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in his carriage--is he better?"\r\n\r\n"Will you step in and see the doctor?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was not in his room when the boy was ushered in, and it\r\nseemed an age before he entered.\r\n\r\n"You are Mr Cruden\'s son?" said he gravely.\r\n\r\n"Yes--is he better?"\r\n\r\n"He was brought here about half-past three, insensible, with apoplexy."\r\n\r\n"Is he better now?" asked Horace again, knowing perfectly well what the\r\ndreaded answer would be.\r\n\r\n"He is not, my boy," said the doctor gravely.  "We telegraphed to your\r\nmother at once, as you know--but before that telegram could have reached\r\nher your poor father--"\r\n\r\nIt was enough.  Poor Horace closed his ears convulsively against the\r\nfatal word, and dropped back on his chair with a gasp.\r\n\r\nThe doctor put his hand kindly on the boy\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Are you here alone?" said he, presently.\r\n\r\n"My mother and brother will be here directly."\r\n\r\n"Your father lies in a private ward.  Will you wait till they come, or\r\nwill you go up now?"\r\n\r\nA struggle passed through the boy\'s mind.  An instinctive horror of a\r\nsight hitherto unknown struggled hard with the impulse to rush at once\r\nto his father\'s bedside.  At length he said, falteringly,--\r\n\r\n"I will go now, please."\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Cruden and Reginald arrived half an hour later, they found\r\nHorace where the doctor had left him, on his knees at his father\'s\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nA COME-DOWN IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nMr Cruden had the reputation of being one of the most respectable as\r\nwell as one of the richest men in his part of the county.  And it is\r\nfair to say he took far more pride in the former quality than the\r\nlatter.  Indeed, he made no secret of the fact that he had not always\r\nbeen the rich man he was when our story opens.  But he was touchy on the\r\nsubject of his good family and his title to the name of gentleman, which\r\nhe had taught his sons to value far more than the wealth which\r\naccompanied it, and which they might some day expect to inherit.\r\n\r\nHis choice of a school for them was quite consistent with his views on\r\nthis point.  Wilderham was not exactly an aristocratic school, but it\r\nwas a school where money was thought less of than "good style," as the\r\nboys called it, and where poverty was far less of a disgrace than even a\r\nremote connection with a "shop."  The Crudens had always been great\r\nheroes in the eyes of their schoolfellows, for their family was\r\nunimpeachable, and even with others who had greater claims to be\r\nconsidered as aristocratic, their ample pocket-money commended them as\r\nmost desirable companions.\r\n\r\nMr Cruden, however, with all his virtues and respectability, was not a\r\ngood man of business.  People said he let himself be imposed upon by\r\nothers who knew the value of money far better than he did.  His own\r\nbeautiful estate at Garden Vale, Rumour said, was managed at double the\r\nexpense it should be; and of his money transactions and speculations in\r\nthe City--well, he had need to be the wealthy man he was, said his\r\nfriends, to be able to stand all the fleecing he came in for there!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, no one ever questioned the wealth of the Crudens, least of\r\nall did the Crudens themselves, who took it as much for granted as the\r\natmosphere they breathed in.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which our story opens Mr Cruden had driven down into the\r\nCity on business.  No one knew exactly what the business was, for he\r\nkept such matters to himself.  It was an ordinary expedition, which\r\nconsisted usually of half a dozen calls on half a dozen stockbrokers or\r\nsecretaries of companies, with perhaps an occasional visit to the family\r\nlawyer or the family bank.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, it had consisted of but one visit, and that was to the\r\nbank.  And it was whilst returning thence that Mr Cruden was suddenly\r\nseized with the stroke which ended in his death.  Had immediate\r\nassistance been at hand the calamity might have been averted, but\r\nneither the coachman nor footman was aware of what had happened till the\r\ncarriage was some distance on its homeward journey, and a passer-by\r\ncaught sight of the senseless figure within.  They promptly drove him to\r\nthe nearest hospital, and telegraphed the news to Garden Vale; but Mr\r\nCruden never recovered consciousness, and, as the doctor told Horace,\r\nbefore even the message could have reached its destination he was dead.\r\n\r\nWe may draw a veil over the sad scenes of the few days which followed--\r\nof the meeting of the widow and her sons at the bedside of the dead, of\r\nthe removal of the loved remains home, of the dismal preparations for\r\nthe funeral, and all the dreary details which occupy mourners in the\r\nhouse of death.  For some time Mrs Cruden, prostrated by the shock of\r\nher bereavement, was unable to leave her room, and the burden of the\r\ncare fell on the two inexperienced boys, who had to face it almost\r\nsingle-handed.\r\n\r\nFor the Crudens had no near relatives in England, and those of their\r\nfriends who might have been of service at such a time feared to intrude,\r\nand so stayed away.  Blandford and Harker, the boys\' two friends who had\r\nbeen visiting at Garden Vale at the time of Mr Cruden\'s death, had left\r\nas quietly and considerately as possible; and so great was the\r\ndistraction of those few sad days that no one even noticed their absence\r\ntill letters of condolence arrived from each.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreary week, and Reginald, on whom, as the elder son and the\r\nheir to the property, the chief responsibility rested, was of the two\r\nleast equal to the emergency.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I should have done without you, old man," said he to\r\nHorace on the evening before the funeral, when, all the preparations\r\nbeing ended, the two boys strolled dismally down towards the river.\r\n"You ought to have been the eldest son.  I should never have thought of\r\nhalf the things there were to be done if you hadn\'t been here."\r\n\r\n"Of course, mother would have known what was to be done," said Horace,\r\n"if she hadn\'t been laid up.  She\'s to get up this evening."\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall be glad when to-morrow\'s over," said Reginald; "it\'s\r\nawful to have it all hanging over one like this.  I can\'t believe father\r\nwas alive a week ago, you know."\r\n\r\n"No more can I," said the other; "and I\'m certain we shall not realise\r\nhow we miss him for long enough yet."\r\n\r\nThey walked on for some distance in silence, each full of his own\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nThen Horace said, "Mother is sure to want to stay on here, she\'s so fond\r\nof the place."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s a comfort she won\'t have to move.  By the way, I wonder if\r\nshe will want us to leave Wilderham and stay at home now."\r\n\r\n"I fancy not.  Father wanted you to go to Oxford in a couple of years,\r\nand she is sure not to change his plan."\r\n\r\n"Well, I must say," said Reginald, "if I am to settle down as a country\r\ngentleman some day, I shall be glad to have gone through college and all\r\nthat sort of thing before.  If I go up in two years, I shall have\r\nfinished before I\'m twenty-three.  Hullo, here\'s mother!"\r\n\r\nThe boys ran forward to greet Mrs Cruden, who, pale but smiling, came\r\nquietly down the garden towards them, and after a fond embrace laid her\r\nhands on the arm of each and walked slowly on between them.\r\n\r\n"You two brave boys," said she, and there was a cheery ring in her voice\r\nthat sent comfort into the hearts of both her sons, "how sorry I am to\r\nthink of all you have had to go through, while I, like a silly weak\r\nwoman, have been lying in bed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother," said Horace, with a face that reflected already the\r\nsunshine of hers, "how absurd to talk like that!  I don\'t believe you\r\nought to be out here now."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I ought.  I\'ve done with that, and I am strong enough now to\r\nstand beside the boys who have stood so bravely by their mother."\r\n\r\n"We\'d be a nice pair of boys if we didn\'t, eh, Reg?" said Horace.\r\n\r\nReginald\'s reply was a pressure of his mother\'s hand, and with a rainbow\r\nof smiles over their sorrowful hearts the three walked on lovingly\r\ntogether; the mother with many a brave, cheery word striving to lift her\r\nsons above their trouble, not only to hope of earthly comfort, but to\r\ntrust in that great Father of the fatherless, beside whom all the love\r\nof this world is poor and fleeting.\r\n\r\nAt length they turned to go in, and Mrs Cruden said,--\r\n\r\n"There is a letter from Mr Richmond, the lawyer, saying he will call\r\nthis evening to talk over some business matters.  I suppose he will be\r\nhere by now."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t he have waited till after to-morrow?" said Horace.\r\n\r\n"He particularly asked to come to-night," said the mother.  "At any\r\nrate, I would like you both to be with me while he is here.  We must not\r\nhave any secrets from one another now."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s about the will or the estate," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so.  I don\'t know," said Mrs Cruden.  "Mr Richmond always\r\nmanaged your father\'s business affairs, you know, so he will be able to\r\ntell us how matters stand."\r\n\r\nThey reached the house, and found Mr Richmond had already arrived and\r\nwas awaiting them in the library.\r\n\r\nMr Richmond was a solemn, grave personage, whose profession was written\r\non his countenance.  His lips were so closely set that it seemed as if\r\nspeaking must be a positive pain to him, his eyes had the knack of\r\nlooking past you, as though he was addressing not you but your shadow on\r\nthe wall, and he ended every sentence, no matter what its import, with a\r\nmechanical smile, as though he were at that instant having his\r\nphotograph taken.  Why Mr Cruden should have selected Mr Richmond as\r\nhis man of business was a matter only known to Mr Cruden himself, for\r\nthose who knew the lawyer best did not care for him, and, without being\r\nable to deny that he was an honest man and a well-meaning man, were at\r\nleast glad that their affairs were in the hands of some one else.\r\n\r\nHe rose and solemnly greeted the widow and her two sons as they entered.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to intrude at such a time," said he, "but as your late\r\nhusband\'s adviser, I considered it right to call and make you acquainted\r\nwith his affairs."\r\n\r\nHere Mr Richmond smiled, greatly to Reginald\'s indignation.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Mrs Cruden; "sit down, please, Mr Richmond."\r\n\r\nMr Richmond obeyed, dubiously eyeing the two boys as he did so.\r\n\r\n"These are your sons, I presume?" said he to Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\n"They are," said she.\r\n\r\nMr Richmond rose and solemnly shook hands with each of the lads,\r\ninforming each with a smile as he did so that he was pleased to make his\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n"You wish the young gentlemen to remain, perhaps?" he inquired, as he\r\nresumed his seat.\r\n\r\n"To be sure," said Mrs Cruden, somewhat nettled at the question; "go\r\non, please, Mr Richmond."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, madam," said the lawyer.  "May I ask if you are acquainted\r\nwith the late Mr Cruden\'s state of affairs?"\r\n\r\n"I wish to hear that from you," said the widow, "and with as little\r\ndelay as possible, Mr Richmond."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, madam.  Mr Cruden honoured me with his confidence on these\r\nmatters, and I believe, next to himself, I knew more about them than any\r\none else."\r\n\r\nHere Mr Richmond paused and smiled.\r\n\r\n"In fact," continued he, "I may almost say I knew more about them than\r\nhe did himself, for your excellent husband, Mrs Cruden, was not a good\r\nman of business."\r\n\r\nReginald could not stand the smile which accompanied this observation,\r\nand said, somewhat hotly,--\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mr Richmond, if you will say what you\'ve got to say without\r\nlaughing and speaking disrespectfully of my father, we shall be glad."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Master Cruden," said the lawyer, a trifle disconcerted by\r\nthis unexpected interruption.  Then turning to the widow he continued,--\r\n\r\n"The fact is, madam, the late Mr Cruden was, I fear, under the\r\nimpression that he was considerably better off than he was."\r\n\r\nMr Richmond paused as if for a reply, but as no one spoke he\r\ncontinued,--\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to say this appears to have been the case to a much larger\r\nextent than even I imagined.  Your late husband, Mrs Cruden, I believe\r\nspent largely on his estate here, and unfortunately kept no accounts.  I\r\nhave frequently entreated him to reckon over his expenditure, but he\r\nalways replied that it was considerably under his income, and that there\r\nwas no need, as long as that was the case, to trouble himself about it."\r\n\r\nA nervous movement among his listeners was the only reply the lawyer\r\nreceived to this last announcement, or to the smile which accompanied\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Mr Cruden _may_ have been correct in his conjecture, madam, although I\r\nfear the contrary."\r\n\r\n"If my father said a thing," blurted out Reginald at this point, "I see\r\nno reason for doubting his word."\r\n\r\n"None in the least, my dear Master Cruden; but unfortunately your father\r\ndid not know either what his income was or what his expenditure was."\r\n\r\n"Do _you_ know what they were?" said Reginald, not heeding the\r\ndeprecating touch of his mother\'s hand on his.\r\n\r\n"As far as I understand the state of your father\'s affairs," said Mr\r\nRichmond, undisturbed by the rude tone of his inquisitor, "his income\r\nwas entirely derived from interest in the stock of two American\r\nrailways, in which he placed implicit confidence, and in one or the\r\nother of which he insisted on investing all capital which came to his\r\nhand.  The total income from these two sources would in my opinion just\r\nabout cover Mr Cruden\'s various expenses of all kinds."\r\n\r\nThere was something like a sigh of relief from the listeners as Mr\r\nRichmond reached this point.  But it died away as he proceeded.\r\n\r\n"In his choice of an investment for his capital Mr Cruden consulted no\r\none, I believe, beyond himself.  For some time it seemed a fortunate\r\ninvestment, and the shares rose in value, but latterly they took a turn\r\nfor the worse, and early this year I am sorry to say one of the railways\r\nsuspended payment altogether, and Mr Cruden lost a considerable portion\r\nof his fortune thereby."\r\n\r\n"I heard my husband say some months ago that he had made some slight\r\nloss in the City," said Mrs Cruden, "but I imagined from the light\r\nmanner in which he treated it that it was quite trifling, and would be\r\nquickly repaired."\r\n\r\n"He did hope that would be the case.  Although all his friends urged him\r\nto sell out at once, he insisted on holding on, in the hope of the\r\nrailway recovering itself."\r\n\r\n"And has it recovered?" asked Mrs Cruden, with a tremble in her voice.\r\n\r\n"I regret to say it has not, Mrs Cruden.  On the contrary, it was\r\ndeclared bankrupt a few days ago, and what is still more deplorable, it\r\nhas involved in its own ruin the other railway in which the remainder of\r\nyour husband\'s property was invested, so that all the shares which stand\r\nin his name in both concerns are now worth no more than the paper they\r\nare printed on."\r\n\r\nMr Richmond came to the point at last with startling abruptness, so\r\nmuch so that for a moment or two his listeners sat almost petrified by\r\nthe bad news, and unable to say a word.  The lawyer finished what he had\r\nto say without waiting.\r\n\r\n"Your husband heard this lamentable news, Mrs Cruden, on the occasion\r\nof his last visit to the City.  The only call he made that day was at\r\nhis banker\'s, where he was told all, and there is no reason to doubt\r\nthat the shock produced the stroke from which he died."\r\n\r\n"Mr Richmond," said Mrs Cruden, after a while, like one in a dream,\r\n"can this be true?  What _does_ it all mean?"\r\n\r\n"Alas! madam," said the lawyer, "it would be no kindness on my part to\r\ndeny the truth of what I have told you.  It means that unless you or\r\nyour late husband are possessed of some means of income of which I know\r\nnothing, your circumstances are reduced to a very low point."\r\n\r\n"But there must be some mistake," said Horace.  "_Both_ railways can\'t\r\nhave gone wrong; we shall surely save something?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I could hold out any hope.  I have all the documents at my\r\noffice, and shall be only too glad, Mrs Cruden, to accompany you to the\r\nbank for your own satisfaction."\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden shuddered and struggled bravely to keep down the rising\r\ntears.  A long pause ensued, every moment of which made the terrible\r\ntruth clearer to all three of the hearers, and closed every loophole of\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n"What can be done?" said Horace at last.\r\n\r\n"Happily there is Garden Vale," said Reginald, and there was a choking\r\nin the throat of the heir as he spoke; "we shall have to sell it."\r\n\r\n"The contents of it, you will, Master Cruden," said the lawyer; "the\r\nestate itself is held on lease."\r\n\r\n"Well, the contents of it," said Reginald, bitterly; "you are not going\r\nto make out they don\'t belong to us?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said Mr Richmond, on whom the taunt was quite lost;\r\n"unless, as I trust is not the case, your father died in debt."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say," said Horace, slowly, like one waking from a dream,\r\n"do you mean to say we are ruined, Mr Richmond?"\r\n\r\n"I fear it is so," said the lawyer, "unless Mr Cruden was possessed of\r\nsome means of income with which I was not acquainted.  I regret very\r\nmuch, Mrs Cruden, having to be the bearer of such bad news, and I can\r\nonly say the respect I had for your late husband will make any\r\nassistance I can offer you, by way of advice or otherwise, a pleasure."\r\nAnd Mr Richmond bowed himself out of the room with a smile.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to be left alone, and Mrs Cruden, despite her weakness\r\nand misery, struggled hard for the sake of her boys to put a brave face\r\non their trouble.\r\n\r\n"Reg, dear," said she to her eldest son, who had fairly broken down, and\r\nwith his head on his hand was giving vent to his misery, "try to bear\r\nit.  After all, we are left to one another, and--"\r\n\r\nThe poor mother could not finish her sentence, but bent down and kissed\r\nthe wet cheek of the boy.\r\n\r\n"Of course it means," said Horace, after a pause, "we shall have to give\r\nup Garden Vale, and leave Wilderham too.  And Reg was sure of a\r\nscholarship next term.  I say, mother, what _are_ we to do?"\r\n\r\n"We are all strong enough to do something, dear boy," said Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take care _you_ don\'t have to do anything, mother," said Reginald,\r\nlooking up.  "I\'ll work my fingers to the bones before you have to come\r\ndown to that."  He spoke with clenched teeth, half savagely.\r\n\r\n"Even if we can sell all the furniture," continued Horace, taking a\r\npractical view of the situation, "it wouldn\'t give us much to live on."\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Horace!" said Reginald.  "What\'s the use of making the worst\r\nof everything?  Hasn\'t mother had quite enough to bear already?"\r\n\r\nHorace subsided, and the three sat there in silence until the daylight\r\nfaded and the footman brought in the lights and announced that coffee\r\nwas ready in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThere was something like a shock about this interruption.  What had they\r\nto do with men-servants and coffee in the drawing-room, they who an hour\r\nor two ago had supposed themselves wealthy, but now knew that they were\r\nlittle better than beggars?\r\n\r\n"We shall not want coffee," said Mrs Cruden, answering for all three.\r\nThen when the footman had withdrawn, she said,--\r\n\r\n"Boys, I must go to bed.  God bless you, and give us all brave hearts,\r\nfor we shall need them!"\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place next day.  Happily it was of a simple character,\r\nand only a few friends were invited, so that it was not thought\r\nnecessary to alter the arrangements in consequence of Mr Richmond\'s\r\nannouncement of the evening before.  But even the slight expense\r\ninvolved in this melancholy ceremony grated painfully on the minds of\r\nthe boys, who forgot even their dead father in the sense that they were\r\nriding in carriages for which they could not pay, and offering their\r\nguests refreshments which were not theirs to give.  The little cemetery\r\nwas crowded with friends and acquaintances of the dead--country gentry\r\nmost of them, who sought to show their respect for their late neighbour\r\nby falling into the long funeral procession and joining the throng at\r\nthe graveside.\r\n\r\nIt was a severe ordeal for the two boys to find themselves the centres\r\nof observation, and to feel that more than half the interest exhibited\r\nin them was on account of their supposed inheritance.\r\n\r\nOne bluff squire came up after the funeral and patted Reginald on the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, my boy," said he; "I was left without a father at your age.\r\nYou\'ll soon get over it, and your mother will have plenty of friends.\r\nGlad to see you up at the Hall any day, and your brother too.  You must\r\njoin our hunt next winter, and keep up the family name.  God bless you!"\r\n\r\nReginald shrank from this greeting like a guilty being, and the two\r\ndesolate boys were glad to escape further encounters by retreating to\r\ntheir carriage and ordering the coachman to drive home at once.\r\n\r\nA few days disclosed all that was wanting to make their position quite\r\nclear.  Mr Cruden\'s will confirmed Mr Richmond\'s statement as to the\r\nsource of his income.  All his money was invested in shares of the two\r\nruined railways, and all he had to leave besides these was the furniture\r\nand contents of Garden Vale.  Even this, when realised, would do little\r\nmore than cover the debts which the next week or two brought to light.\r\nIt was pitiful the way in which that unrelenting tide of bills flowed\r\nin, swamping gradually the last hope of a competency, or even means of\r\nbare existence, for the survivors.\r\n\r\nNeither Mrs Cruden nor her sons had been able to endure a day\'s delay\r\nat Garden Vale after the funeral, but had hurried for shelter to quiet\r\nlodgings at the seaside, kept by an old servant, where in an agony of\r\nsuspense they awaited the final result of Mr Richmond\'s investigations.\r\n\r\nIt came at last, and, bad as it was, it was a comfort to know the worst.\r\nThe furniture, carriages, and other contents of Garden Vale had\r\nsufficed to pay all debts of every description, with a balance of about\r\nL350 remaining over and above, to represent the entire worldly\r\npossessions of the Cruden family, which only a month ago had ranked with\r\nthe wealthiest in the county.\r\n\r\n"So," said Mrs Cruden, with a shadow of her old smile, as she folded up\r\nthe lawyer\'s letter and put it back in her pocket, "we know the worst at\r\nlast, boys."\r\n\r\n"Which is," said Reginald, bitterly, "we are worth among us the\r\nmagnificent sum of sixteen pounds per annum.  Quite princely!"\r\n\r\n"Reg, dear," said his mother, "let us be thankful that we have anything,\r\nand still more that we may start life owing nothing to any one."\r\n\r\n"Start life!" exclaimed Reginald; "I wish we could end it with--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, hush, my precious boy!" exclaimed the widow; "you will break\r\nmy heart if you talk like that!  Think how many there are to whom this\r\nlittle sum would seem a fortune.  Why, it may keep a roof over our\r\nheads, at any rate, or help you into situations."\r\n\r\n"Or bury us!" groaned Reginald.\r\n\r\nThe mother looked at her eldest son, half in pity, half in reproach, and\r\nthen burst into tears.\r\n\r\nReginald sprang to her side in an instant.\r\n\r\n"What a beast I am!" he exclaimed.  "Oh, mother, do forgive me!  I\r\nreally didn\'t think what I was saying."\r\n\r\n"No, dear Reggie, I know you didn\'t," said Mrs Cruden, recovering\r\nherself with a desperate effort.  "You mustn\'t mind me, I--I scarcely--\r\nknow--I--"\r\n\r\nIt was no use trying.  The poor mother broke down completely, and on\r\nthat evening it was impossible to talk more about the future.\r\n\r\nNext morning, however, all three were in a calmer mood, and Horace said\r\nat breakfast, "We can\'t do any good here, mother.  Hadn\'t we better go\r\nto London?"\r\n\r\n"I think so; and Parker here knows of a small furnished lodging in Dull\r\nStreet, which she says is cheap.  We might try there to begin with.  Eh,\r\nReg?"\r\n\r\nReginald winced, and then replied, "Oh, certainly; the sooner we get\r\ndown to our right level the better."\r\n\r\nThat evening the three Crudens arrived in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nNUMBER SIX, DULL STREET.\r\n\r\nProbably no London street ever rejoiced in a more expressive name than\r\nDull Street.  It was not a specially dirty street, or a specially\r\ndisreputable street, or a specially dark street.  The neighbourhood\r\nmight a hundred years ago have been considered "genteel," and the houses\r\neven fashionable, and some audacious antiquarians went so far as to\r\nassert that the street took its name not from its general appearance at\r\nall, but from a worthy London alderman, who in the reign of George the\r\nFirst had owned most of the neighbouring property.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, Dull Street was--and for all I know may still be--one\r\nof the dullest streets in London.  A universal seediness pervaded its\r\nhouses from roof to cellar; nothing was as it should be anywhere.  The\r\nwindow sashes had to be made air-tight by wedges of wood or paper stuck\r\ninto the frames; a bell in Dull Street rarely sounded after less than\r\nsix pulls; there was scarcely a sitting-room but had a crack in its\r\ngrimy ceiling, or a handle off its ill-hung door, or a strip of wall-\r\npaper peeling off its walls.  There were more chairs in the furnished\r\napartments of Dull Street with three legs than there were with four, and\r\nthere was scarcely horsehair enough in the twenty-four sofas of its\r\ntwenty-four parlours to suffice for an equal quantity of bolsters.\r\n\r\nIn short, Dull Street was the shabbiest genteel street in the\r\nmetropolis, and nothing could make it otherwise.\r\n\r\nA well-built, tastefully-furnished house in the middle of it would have\r\nbeen as incongruous as a new patch in an old garment, and no one dreamt\r\nof disturbing the traditional aspect of the place by any attempt to\r\nrepair or beautify it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the people who lived in Dull Street were as much a part of its\r\ndulness as the houses they inhabited.  They were for the most part\r\nretired tradesmen, or decayed milliners, or broken-down Government\r\nclerks, most of whom tried to eke out their little pensions by letting\r\npart of their lodgings to others as decayed and broken-down as\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThese interesting colonists, whose one bond of sympathy was a mutual\r\nseediness, amused themselves, for the most part, by doing nothing all\r\nday long, except perhaps staring out of the window, in the remote hope\r\nof catching sight of a distant cab passing the street corner, or\r\nwatching to see how much milk their opposite neighbour took in, or\r\nreading the news of the week before last in a borrowed newspaper, or\r\ntalking scandal of one neighbour to another.\r\n\r\n"Jemima, my dear," said a middle-aged lady, who, with her son and\r\ndaughter, was the proud occupant of Number 4, Dull Street--"Jemima, my\r\ndear, I see to-day the bill is hout of the winder of number six."\r\n\r\n"Never!" replied Jemima, a sharp-looking young woman of twenty, who had\r\nonce in her life spent a month at a ladies\' boarding-school, and was\r\ntherefore decidedly genteel.  "I wonder who\'s coming."\r\n\r\n"A party of three, so I hear from Miss Moulden\'s maid, which is niece to\r\nMrs Grimley: a widow,"--here the speaker snuffled slightly--"and two\r\nchilder--like me."\r\n\r\n"Go on!" said Jemima.  "Any more about them, ma?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, I do hear as they \'ave come down a bit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah! lag!" put in the speaker\'s son, a lawyer\'s clerk in the receipt\r\nof two pounds a week, to whom this intelligence appeared particularly\r\namusing; "we know all about that--never heard that sort of tale before,\r\nhave we, ma?  Oh no!" and the speaker emphasised the question by giving\r\nhis widowed mother a smart dig in the ribs.\r\n\r\n"For shame, Sam! don\'t be vulgar!" cried the worthy lady; "how many\r\ntimes have I told you?"\r\n\r\n"All right, ma," replied the legal young gentleman; "but it is rather a\r\nwonner, you know.  What were they before they came down?"\r\n\r\n"Gentlefolk, so I\'m told," replied the lady, drawing herself up at the\r\nvery mention of the name; "and I hintend, and I \'ope my children will do\r\nthe same, to treat them as fellow-creatures with hevery consideration."\r\n\r\n"And how old is the babies, ma?" inquired Miss Jemima, whose gentility\r\nsometimes had the advantage of her grammar.\r\n\r\n"The babies!" said the mother; "why, they\'re young gentlemen, both of\r\n\'em--old enough to be your sweethearts!"\r\n\r\nSam laughed profusely.\r\n\r\n"Then what did you say they was babies for?" demanded Jemima, pettishly.\r\n\r\n"I never!"\r\n\r\n"You did, ma, I heard you!  Didn\'t she, Sam?"\r\n\r\n"So you did, ma.  Come now, no crackers!" said Sam.\r\n\r\n"I never; I said `childer,\'" pleaded the mother.\r\n\r\n"And ain\'t babies childer?" thundered Miss Jemima.\r\n\r\n"\'Ad \'er there, Jim!" chuckled the dutiful Samuel, this time favouring\r\nhis sister with a sympathetic nudge.  "Better give in, and own you told\r\na cracker, ma!"\r\n\r\n"Shan\'t!" said the lady, beginning to whimper.  "Oh, I wish my poor\r\n\'Oward was here to protect me!  He was a gentleman, and I\'m glad he\r\ndidn\'t live to see what a pair of vulgar brats he\'d left behind him,\r\nthat I am!"\r\n\r\n"There you go!" said Sam; "taking on at nothing, as per usual!  No one\r\nwas saying anything to hurt you, old girl.  Simmer down, and you\'ll be\r\nall the better for it.  There now, dry your eyes; it\'s all that Jim,\r\nshe\'s got such a tongue!  Next time I catch you using language to ma,\r\nJim, I\'ll turn you out of the house!  Come, cheer up, ma."\r\n\r\n"Yes, cheer up, ma," chimed in Jemima; "no one supposes you meant to\r\ntell fibs; you couldn\'t help it."\r\n\r\nAmid consolations such as these the poor flurried lady subsided, and\r\nregained her former tranquillity of spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Shucklefords--such was the name of this amiable family--were\r\ncomparatively recent sojourners in Dull Street.  They had come there six\r\nyears previously, on the death of Mr Shuckleford, a respectable\r\nwharfinger, who had saved up money enough to leave his wife a small\r\nannuity.  Shortly before his death he had been promoted to the command\r\nof one of the Thames steamboats plying between Chelsea and London\r\nBridge, in virtue of which office he had taken to himself--or rather his\r\nwife had claimed for him--the title of "captain," and with this patent\r\nof gentility had held up her head ever since.  Her children, following\r\nher good example, were not slow to hold up their heads too, and were\r\nfully convinced of their own gentility.  Samuel Shuckleford had, as his\r\nmother termed it, been "entered for the law" shortly after his father\'s\r\ndeath, and Miss Jemima Shuckleford, after the month\'s sojourn at a\r\nladies\' boarding-school already referred to, had settled down to assist\r\nher mother in the housework and maintain the dignity of the family by\r\nliving on her income.\r\n\r\nSuch were the new next-door neighbours of the Crudens when at last they\r\narrived, sadly, and with the new world before them, at Number 6, Dull\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr Richmond, who, with all his unfortunate manner, had acted a friend\'s\r\npart all along, had undertaken the task of clearing up affairs at Garden\r\nVale, superintending the payment of Mr Cruden\'s debts, the sale of his\r\nfurniture, and the removal to Dull Street of what little remained to the\r\nfamily to remind them of their former comforts.\r\n\r\nIt might have been better if in this last respect the boys and their\r\nmother had acted for themselves, for Mr Richmond appeared to have hazy\r\nnotions as to what the family would most value.  The first sight which\r\nmet the boys\' eyes as they arrived was their tennis-racquets in a corner\r\nof the room.  A very small case of trinkets was on Mrs Cruden\'s\r\ndressing-table, and not one of the twenty or thirty books arranged on\r\nthe top of the sideboard was one which any member of the small household\r\ncared anything about.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Richmond had done his best, and being left entirely to his own\r\ndevices, was not to be blamed for the few mistakes he had made.  He was\r\nthere to receive Mrs Cruden when she arrived, and after conducting the\r\nlittle party hurriedly through the three rooms destined for their\r\naccommodation, considerately retired.\r\n\r\nUntil the moment when they were left to themselves in the shabby little\r\nDull Street parlour, not one of the Crudens had understood the change\r\nwhich had come over their lot.  All had been so sudden, so exciting, so\r\nunlooked-for during the last few weeks, that all three of them had\r\nseemed to go through it as through a dream.  But the awakening came now,\r\nand a rude and cruel one it was.\r\n\r\nThe little room, dignified by the name of a parlour, was a dingy, stuffy\r\napartment of the true Dull Street type.  The paper was faded and torn,\r\nthe ceiling was discoloured, the furniture was decrepit, the carpet was\r\nthreadbare, and the cheap engraving on the wall, with its title, "As\r\nHappy as a King," seemed to brood over the scene like some mocking\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThey passed into Mrs Cruden\'s bedroom, and the thought of the\r\ndelightful snug little boudoir at Garden Vale sent a shiver through them\r\nas they glanced at the bare walls, the dilapidated half-tester, the\r\nchipped and oddly assorted crockery.\r\n\r\nThe boys\' room was equally cheerless.  One narrow bed, a chair, and a\r\nsmall washstand, was all the furniture it boasted of, and a few old\r\ncuttings of an antiquated illustrated paper pinned on to the wall\r\nafforded its sole decoration.\r\n\r\nA low, dreary whistle escaped from Horace\'s lips as he surveyed his new\r\nquarters, followed almost immediately by an equally dreary laugh.\r\n\r\n"Why," gasped he, "there\'s no looking-glass!  However is Reg to shave?"\r\n\r\nIt was an heroic effort, and it succeeded.  Mrs Cruden\'s face lit up at\r\nthe sound of her son\'s voice with its old sunshine, and even Reginald\r\nsmiled grimly.\r\n\r\n"I must let my beard grow," said he.  "But, mother, I say," and his\r\nvoice quavered as he spoke, "what a miserable room yours is!  I can\'t\r\nbear to think of your being cooped up there."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s not so bad," said Mrs Cruden, cheerily.  "The pink in the\r\nchintz doesn\'t go well with the scarlet in the wall-paper, certainly,\r\nbut I dare say I shall sleep soundly in the bed all the same."\r\n\r\n"But such a wretched look-out from the window, mother, and such a _vile_\r\njug and basin!"\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden laughed.\r\n\r\n"Never mind about the jug and basin," said she, "as long as they hold\r\nwater; and as for the look-out--well, as long as I can see my two boys\'\r\nfaces happy, that\'s the best view I covet."\r\n\r\n"You never think about yourself," said Reginald, sadly.\r\n\r\n"I say, mother," said Horace, "suppose we call up the spirits from the\r\nvasty deep and ask them to get tea ready."\r\n\r\nThis practical suggestion met with general approbation, and the little\r\nparty returned more cheerily to the parlour, where Horace performed\r\nmarvellous exploits with the bell-handle, and succeeded, in the\r\nincredible time of seven minutes, in bringing up a small slipshod girl,\r\nwho, after a good deal of staring about her, and a critical survey of\r\nthe pattern of Mrs Cruden\'s dress, contrived to gather a general idea\r\nof what was required of her.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer meal, half ludicrous, half despairing, that first little\r\ntea-party in Dull Street.  They tried to be gay.  Reginald declared that\r\nthe tea his mother poured out was far better than any the footman at\r\nGarden Vale used to dispense.  Horace tried to make fun of the\r\nheterogeneous cups and saucers.  Mrs Cruden tried hard to appear as\r\nthough she was taking a hearty meal, while she tasted nothing.  But it\r\nwas a relief when the girl reappeared and cleared the table.\r\n\r\nThen they unpacked their few belongings, and tried to enliven their\r\ndreary lodgings with a few precious mementoes of happier days.  Finally,\r\nworn out in mind and body, they took shelter in bed, and for a blessed\r\nseason forgot all their misery and forebodings in sleep.\r\n\r\nThere is no magic equal to that which a night\'s sleep will sometimes\r\nwork.  The little party assembled cheerfully at the breakfast-table next\r\nmorning, prepared to face the day bravely.\r\n\r\nA large letter, in Mr Richmond\'s handwriting, lay on Mrs Cruden\'s\r\nplate.  It contained three letters--one from the lawyer himself, and one\r\nfor each of the boys from Wilderham.  Mr Richmond\'s letter was brief\r\nand business-like.\r\n\r\n"Dear Madam,--Enclosed please find two letters, which I found lying at\r\nGarden Vale yesterday.  With regard to balance of your late husband\'s\r\nassets in your favour, I have an opportunity of investing same at an\r\nunusually good rate of interest in sound security.  Shall be pleased to\r\nwait on you with particulars.  Am also in a position to introduce the\r\nyoung gentlemen to a business opening, which, if not at first important,\r\nmay seem to you a favourable opportunity.  On these points I shall have\r\nthe honour of waiting on you during to-morrow afternoon, and meanwhile\r\nbeg to remain,--\r\n\r\n"Your obedient servant,--\r\n\r\n"R.  Richmond."\r\n\r\n"We ought to make sure what the investment is," said Reginald, after\r\nhearing the letter read, "before we hand over all our money to him."\r\n\r\n"To be sure, dear," said Mrs Cruden, who hated the sound of the word\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what he proposes for us?" said Horace.  "Some clerkship, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps in his own office," said Reginald.  "_What_ an opening that\r\nwould be!"\r\n\r\n"Never you mind.  The law\'s very respectable; but I know I\'d be no good\r\nfor that.  I might manage to serve tea and raisins behind a grocer\'s\r\ncounter, or run errands, or--"\r\n\r\n"Or black boots," suggested Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Black boots!  I bet you neither you nor I could black a pair of boots\r\nproperly to save our lives."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me we shall have to try it this very morning," said\r\nReginald, "for no one has touched mine since last night."\r\n\r\n"But who are your letters from?" said Mrs Cruden.  "Are they very\r\nprivate?"\r\n\r\n"Not mine," said Horace.  "It\'s from old Harker.  You may read it if you\r\nlike, mother."\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden took the letter and read aloud,--\r\n\r\n"Dear Horrors--"\r\n\r\n("That\'s what he calls me, you know," explained Horace, in a\r\nparenthesis.)\r\n\r\n"I am so awfully sorry to hear of your new trouble about money matters,\r\nand that you will have to leave Garden Vale.  I wish I could come over\r\nto see you and help you.  All the fellows here are awfully cut up about\r\nit, and lots of them want me to send you messages.  I don\'t know what I\r\nshall do without you this term, old man, you were always a brick to me.\r\nBe sure and write to me and tell me everything.  As soon as I can get\r\naway for a day I\'ll come and see you, and I\'ll write as often as I can.\r\n\r\n"Your affectionate,--\r\n\r\n"T.  Harker.\r\n\r\n"P.S.--Wilkins, I expect, will be the new monitor in our house.  He is\r\nsure now to get the scholarship Reg was certain of.  I wish to goodness\r\nyou were both back here."\r\n\r\n"He might just as well have left out that about the scholarship," said\r\nReginald; "it\'s not very cheering news to hear of another fellow\r\nstepping into your place like that."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he thought we\'d be curious to know," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"Precious curious!" growled Reginald.\r\n\r\n"But who\'s your letter from, Reg?" asked Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\n"Oh, just a line from Bland," replied he, hastily putting it into his\r\npocket; "he gives no news."\r\n\r\nIf truth must be told, Blandford\'s letter was not a very nice one, and\r\nReginald felt it.  He did not care to hear it read aloud in contrast\r\nwith Harker\'s warm-hearted letter.  Blandford had written,--\r\n\r\n"Dear Cruden,--I hope it\'s not true about your father\'s money going all\r\nwrong.  It is a great sell, and fellows here, I know, will be very\r\nsorry.  Never mind, I suppose there\'s enough left to make a decent show;\r\nand between you and me it would go down awfully well with the fellows\r\nhere if you could send your usual subscription to the football club.\r\nHarker says you\'ll have to leave Garden Vale.  I\'m awfully sorry, as I\r\nalways enjoyed my visits there so much.  What are you going to do?  Why\r\ndon\'t you try for the army?  The exams are not very hard, my brother\r\ntold me, and of course it\'s awfully respectable, if one must work for\r\none\'s living.  I must stop now, or I shall miss tennis.  Excuse more.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"G.  Blandford."\r\n\r\nReginald knew the letter was a cold and selfish one, but it left two\r\nthings sticking in his mind which rankled there for a long time.  One\r\nwas that, come what would, he would send a guinea to the school football\r\nclub.  The other was--was it _quite_ out of the question that he should\r\ngo into the army?\r\n\r\n"Awfully rough on Reg," said Horace, "being so near that scholarship.\r\nIt\'ll be no use to Wilkins, not a bit, and fifty pounds a year would be\r\nsomething to--"\r\n\r\nHorace was going to say "us," but he pulled up in time and said "Reg."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Reg, "as things have turned out it might have come in\r\nuseful.  I wonder if it wouldn\'t have been wiser, mother, for me to have\r\nstayed up this term and made sure of it?"\r\n\r\n"I wish you could, Reg; but we have no right to think of it.  Besides,\r\nyou could only have held it if you had gone to college."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course," said Reg; "but then it would have paid a good bit of my\r\nexpenses there; and I might have gone on from there to the army, you\r\nknow, and got my commission."\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden sighed.  What an awakening the boy had still to pass\r\nthrough!\r\n\r\n"We must think of something less grand than that, my poor Reg," said\r\nshe; "and something we can share all together.  I hope Mr Richmond will\r\nbe able to hear of some business opening for me, as well as you, for we\r\nshall need to put our resources together to get on."\r\n\r\n"Mother," exclaimed Reginald, overwhelmed with sudden contrition, "what\r\na selfish brute you must think me!  You don\'t think I\'d let you work\r\nwhile I had a nerve left.  I\'ll do anything--so will Horace, but you\r\n_shall not_, mother, you _shall not_."\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden did not argue the point just then, and in due time Mr\r\nRichmond arrived to give a new direction to their thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe investment he proposed seemed a good one.  But, in fact, the little\r\nfamily knew so little about business generally, and money matters in\r\nparticular, that had it been the worst security possible they would have\r\nhardly been the wiser.\r\n\r\nThis point settled, Mr Richmond turned to his proposals for the boys.\r\n\r\n"As I said in my letter, Mrs Cruden," said he, "the opening is only a\r\nmodest one.  A company has lately been formed to print and publish an\r\nevening paper in the city, and as solicitor to the company I had an\r\nopportunity of mentioning your sons to the manager.  He is willing to\r\ntake them, provided they are willing to work.  The pay will begin at\r\neighteen shillings a week, but I hope they will soon make their value\r\nfelt, and command a better position.  They are young yet."\r\n\r\n"What shall we have to do?" asked Horace.\r\n\r\n"That I cannot exactly say," said the lawyer; "but I believe the manager\r\nwould expect you to learn the printer\'s business from the beginning."\r\n\r\n"What would the hours be?" asked Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\n"Well, as it is an evening paper, there will fortunately be no late\r\nnight work.  I believe seven in the morning to eight at night were the\r\nhours the manager mentioned."\r\n\r\n"And--and," faltered the poor mother, who was beginning to realise the\r\nboys\' lot better than they did themselves--"and what sort of companions\r\nare they likely to have, Mr Richmond?"\r\n\r\n"I believe the manager is succeeding in getting respectable men as\r\nworkmen.  I hope so."\r\n\r\n"Workmen!" exclaimed Reginald, suddenly.  "Do you mean we are to be\r\nworkmen, Mr Richmond?  Just like any fellows in the street.  Couldn\'t\r\nyou find anything better than that for us?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Master Cruden, I am very sorry for you, and would gladly see\r\nyou in a better position.  But it is not a case where we can choose.\r\nThis opening has offered itself.  Of course, you are not bound to accept\r\nit, but my advice is, take what you can get in these hard times."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course, we\'re paupers, I--forgot," said Reg, bitterly, "and\r\nbeggars mayn\'t be choosers.  Anything you like, mother," added he,\r\nmeeting Mrs Cruden\'s sorrowful look with forced gaiety.  "I\'ll sweep a\r\ncrossing if you like, Mr Richmond, or black your office-boy\'s boots,--\r\nanything to get a living."\r\n\r\nPoor boy!  He broke down before he could finish the sentence, and his\r\nflourish ended in something very like a sob.\r\n\r\nHorace was hardly less miserable, but he said less.  Evidently, as Reg\r\nhimself had said, beggars could not be choosers, and when presently Mr\r\nRichmond left, and the little family talked the matter over late into\r\nthe afternoon, it was finally decided that the offer of the manager of\r\nthe _Rocket_ Newspaper Company, Limited, should be accepted, and that\r\nthe boys should make their new start in life on the Monday morning\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE "ROCKET" NEWSPAPER COMPANY, LIMITED.\r\n\r\nThe reader may imagine that the walk our two heroes took Citywards that\r\nMonday morning was not a very cheerful one.  It seemed like walking out\r\nof one life into another.  Behind, like a dream, were the joyous, merry\r\ndays spent at Garden Vale and Wilderham, with no care for the future,\r\nand no want for the present.  Before them, still more like a dream, lay\r\nthe prospect of their new work, with all its anxiety, and drudgery, and\r\nweariness, and the miserable eighteen shillings a week it promised them;\r\nand, equally wretched at the present moment, there was the vision of\r\ntheir desolate mother, alone in the Dull Street lodgings, where they had\r\njust left her, unable at the last to hide the misery with which she saw\r\nher two boys start out into the pitiless world.\r\n\r\nThe boys walked for some time in silence; then Horace said,--\r\n\r\n"Old man, I hope, whatever they do, they\'ll let us be together at this\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"We needn\'t expect any such luck," said Reginald.  "It wouldn\'t be half\r\nso bad if they would."\r\n\r\n"You know," said Horace, "I can\'t help hoping they\'ll take us as clerks,\r\nat least.  They must know we\'re educated, and more fit for that sort of\r\nwork than--"\r\n\r\n"Than doing common labourer\'s work," said Reg.  "Rather!  If they\'d put\r\nus to some of the literary work, you know, Horace--editing, or\r\ncorrecting, or reporting, or that sort of thing, I could stand that.\r\nThere are plenty of swells who began like that.  I\'m pretty well up in\r\nclassics, you know, and--well, they might be rather glad to have some\r\none who was."\r\n\r\nHorace sighed.\r\n\r\n"Richmond spoke as if we were to be taken on as ordinary workmen."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Richmond\'s an ass," said Reg, full of his new idea; "he knows\r\nnothing about it.  I tell you, Horace, they wouldn\'t be such idiots as\r\nto waste our education when they could make use of it.  Richmond only\r\nknows the manager, but the editor is the chief man, after all."\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached Fleet Street, and their attention was\r\nabsorbed in finding the by-street in which was situated the scene of\r\ntheir coming labours.  They found it at last, and with beating hearts\r\nsaw before them a building surmounted by a board, bearing in characters\r\nof gold the legend, _Rocket_ Newspaper Company, Limited.\r\n\r\nThe boys stood a moment outside, and the courage which had been slowly\r\nrising during the walk evaporated in an instant.  Ugly and grimy as the\r\nbuilding was, it seemed to them like some fairy castle before which they\r\nshrank into insignificance.  A board inscribed, "Work-people\'s\r\nEntrance," with a hand on it pointing to a narrow side court, confronted\r\nthem, and mechanically they turned that way.  Reginald did for a moment\r\nhesitate as he passed the editor\'s door, but it was no use.  The two\r\nboys turned slowly into the court, where, amid the din of machinery, and\r\na stifling smell of ink and rollers, they found the narrow passage which\r\nconducted them to their destination.\r\n\r\nA man at a desk half way down the passage intercepted their progress.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, young fellows, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"We want to see the manager, please," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"No use to-day, my lad.  No boys wanted; we\'re full up."\r\n\r\n"We want to see the manager," said Reginald, offended at the man\'s tone,\r\nand not disposed to humour it.\r\n\r\n"Tell you we want no boys; can\'t you see the notice up outside?"\r\n\r\n"Look here!" said Reginald, firing up, and heedless of his brother\'s\r\ndeprecating look; "we don\'t want any of your cheek.  Tell the manager\r\nwe\'re here, will you, and look sharp?"\r\n\r\nThe timekeeper stared at the boy in amazement for a moment, and then\r\nbroke out with,--\r\n\r\n"Take your hook, do you hear, you--or I\'ll warm you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a mistake," put in Horace, hurriedly.  "Mr Richmond said we were\r\nto come here to see the manager at nine o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"And couldn\'t you have said so at first?" growled the man, with his hand\r\nstill on his ruler, and glaring at Reginald, "without giving yourselves\r\nairs as if you were gentry?  Go on in, and don\'t stand gaping there."\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake, Reg," whispered Horace, as they knocked at the\r\nmanager\'s door, "don\'t flare up like that, you\'ll spoil all our chance."\r\n\r\nReg said nothing, but he breathed hard, and his face was angry still.\r\n\r\n"Come in!" cried a sharp voice, in answer to their knock.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed, and found a man standing with a pen in his mouth at a desk,\r\nsearching through a file of papers.  He went on with his work till he\r\nfound what he wanted, apparently quite unconscious of the boys\'\r\npresence.  Then he rang a bell for an overseer, whistled down a tube for\r\na clerk, and shouted out of the door for a messenger, and gave orders to\r\neach.  Then he sent for some one else, and gave him a scolding that made\r\nthe unlucky recipient\'s hair stand on end; then he received a visit from\r\na friend, with whom he chatted and joked for a pleasant quarter of an\r\nhour; then he took up the morning paper and skimmed through it,\r\nwhistling to himself as he did so; then he rang another bell and told\r\nthe errand-boy who answered it to bring him in at one o\'clock sharp a\r\nlarge boiled beef underdone, with carrots and turnips, and a pint of "s.\r\nand b."  (whatever that might mean).  Then he suddenly became aware of\r\nthe fact that he had visitors, and turned inquiringly to the two boys.\r\n\r\n"Mr Richmond--" began Horace, in answer to his look.\r\n\r\nBut the manager cut him short.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah! yes," he said.  "Nuisance!  Go to the composing-room and ask\r\nfor Mr Durfy."\r\n\r\nSaying which he sat down again at his desk, and became absorbed in his\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly a flattering reception, and gave our heroes very little\r\nchance of showing off their classical proficiency.  They had at least\r\nexpected, as Mr Richmond\'s nominees, rather more than a half glance\r\nfrom the manager; and to be thus summarily turned over to a Mr Durfy\r\nbefore they had as much as opened their mouths was decidedly\r\nunpromising.\r\n\r\nReginald did make one feeble effort to prolong the interview, and to\r\nimpress the manager at the same time.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said he, in his politest tones, "would you mind directing\r\nus to the composing-room?  My brother and I don\'t know the geography of\r\nthe place yet."\r\n\r\n"Eh?  Composing-room?  Get a boy to show you.  Plenty outside."\r\n\r\nIt was no go, evidently; and they turned dismally from the room.\r\n\r\nThe errand-boy was coming up the passage as they emerged--the same\r\nerrand-boy they had seen half an hour ago in the manager\'s room; but, as\r\ntheir classical friends would say--\r\n\r\n"Quantum mutatus ab illo Hectore!"\r\n\r\nHis two arms were strung with the handles of frothing tin cans from the\r\nelbow to the wrist.  He carried two tin cans in his mouth.  His apron\r\nwas loaded to bursting with bread, fish, cheese, potatoes, and other\r\nedibles; the necks of bottles protruded from all his pocket\'s,--from the\r\nbosom of his jacket and from the fob of his breeches,--and round his\r\nneck hung a ponderous chain of onions.  In short, the errand-boy was\r\nbusy; and our heroes, even with their short experience of business life,\r\nsaw that there was little hope of extracting information from him under\r\npresent circumstances.\r\n\r\nSo they let him pass, and waited for another.  They had not to wait\r\nlong, for the passage appeared to be a regular highway for the junior\r\nmembers of the staff of the _Rocket_ Newspaper Company, Limited.  But\r\nthough several boys came, it was some time before one appeared whose\r\nconvenience it suited to conduct our heroes to the presence of Mr\r\nDurfy.  Just, however, as their patience was getting exhausted, and\r\nReginald was making up his mind to shake the dust of the place from his\r\nfeet, a boy appeared and offered to escort them to the composing-room.\r\n\r\nThey followed him up several flights of a rickety staircase, and down\r\nsome labyrinthine passages to a large room where some forty or fifty men\r\nwere busy setting up type.  At the far end of this room, at a small\r\ntable, crowded with "proofs," sat a red-faced individual whom the boy\r\npointed out as "Duffy."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, what do _you_ want?" asked he, as the brothers approached.\r\n\r\n"The manager said we were to ask for Mr Durfy," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"I wish to goodness he\'d keep you down there; he knows I\'m crowded out\r\nwith boys.  He always serves me that way, and I\'ll tell him so one of\r\nthese days."\r\n\r\nThis last speech, though apparently addressed to the boys, was really a\r\nsoliloquy on Mr Durfy\'s part; but for all that it failed to enchant his\r\naudience.  They had not, in their most sanguine moments, expected much,\r\nbut this was even rather less than they had counted on.\r\n\r\nMr Durfy mused for some time, then, turning to Reginald, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Do you know your letters?"\r\n\r\nHere was a question to put to the captain of the fifth at Wilderham!\r\n\r\n"I believe I do," said Reginald, with a touch of scorn in his voice\r\nwhich was quite lost on the practical Mr Durfy.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by believe?  Do you, or do you not?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do."\r\n\r\n"Then why couldn\'t you say so at once?  Take this bit of copy and set it\r\nup at that case there.  And you, young fellow, take these proofs to the\r\nsub-editor\'s room, and say I\'ve not had the last sheet of the copy of\r\nthe railway accident yet, and I\'m standing for it.  Cut away."\r\n\r\nHorace went off.\r\n\r\n"After all," thought he to himself, "what\'s the use of being particular?\r\nI suppose I\'m what they call a `printer\'s devil\'; nothing like starting\r\nmodestly!  Here goes for my lords the sub-editors, and the last page of\r\nthe railway accident."\r\n\r\nAnd he spent a festive ten-minutes hunting out the sub-editor\'s domains,\r\nand possessing himself of the missing copy.\r\n\r\nWith Reginald, however, it fared otherwise.  A fellow may be head of the\r\nfifth at a public school, and yet not know his letters in a printing-\r\noffice, and after five or ten-minutes\' hopeless endeavour to comprehend\r\nthe geography of a typecase, he was obliged to acknowledge himself\r\nbeaten and apprise Mr Durfy of the fact.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I misunderstood you," said he, putting the copy down on the\r\ntable.  "I\'m not used to printing."\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr Durfy, scornfully, "I guessed not.  You\'re too stuck-up\r\nfor us, I can tell you.  Here, Barber."\r\n\r\nAn unhealthy-looking young man answered to the name.\r\n\r\n"Take this chap here to the back case-room, and see he sweeps it out and\r\ndusts the cases.  See if that\'ll suit your abilities, my dandy"; and\r\nwithout waiting to hear Reginald\'s explanations or remonstrances, Mr\r\nDurfy walked off, leaving the unlucky boy in the hands of Mr Barber.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, stir your stumps, Mr Dandy," said the latter.  "It\'ll take\r\nyou all your time to get that shop straight, I can tell you, so you\'d\r\nbetter pull up your boots.  Got a broom?"\r\n\r\n"No," muttered Reg, through his teeth, "I\'ve not got a broom."\r\n\r\n"Go and get that one, then, out of the corner there."\r\n\r\nReginald flushed crimson, and hesitated a moment.\r\n\r\n"Do you \'ear?  Are you deaf?  Get that one there."\r\n\r\nReginald got it, and trailing it behind him dismally, followed his guide\r\nto the back case-room.  It was a small room, which apparently had known\r\nneither broom nor water for years.  The floor was thick with dirt, and\r\nthe cases ranged in the racks against the walls were coated with dust.\r\n\r\n"There you are," said Mr Barber.  "Open the window, do you \'ear? and\r\ndon\'t let none of the dust get out into the composing-room, or there\'ll\r\nbe a row.  Come and tell me when you\'ve done the floor, and I\'ll show\r\nyou \'ow to do them cases.  Rattle along, do you \'ear? or you won\'t get\r\nit done to-day;" and Mr Barber, who had had his day of sweeping out the\r\nshops, departed, slamming the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThings had come to a crisis with Reginald Cruden early in his business\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nHe had _come_ into the City that morning prepared to face a good deal.\r\nHe had not counted on much sympathy or consideration from his new\r\nemployers; he had even vaguely made up his mind he would have to rough\r\nit at first; but to be shut up in a dirty room with a broom in his hand\r\nby a cad who could not even talk grammar was a humiliation on which he\r\nhad never once calculated.\r\n\r\nTossing the broom unceremoniously into a corner, he opened the door and\r\nwalked out of the room.  Barber was already out of sight, chuckling\r\ninwardly over the delicious task he had been privileged to set to his\r\ndandy subordinate, and none of the men working near knew or cared what\r\nthis pale, handsome new boy did either in or out of the back case-room.\r\n\r\nReginald walked through them to the passage outside, not much caring\r\nwhere he went or whom he met.  If he were to meet Mr Barber, or Mr\r\nDurfy, or the manager himself, so much the better.  As it happened, he\r\nmet Horace, looking comparatively cheerful, with some papers in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Reg," said he; "have they promoted you to a `printer\'s devil\'\r\ntoo?  Fancy what Bland would say if he saw us!  Never mind, there\'s four\r\nhours gone, and in about another six we shall be home with mother\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I shall be home before then," said Reg.  "I\'m going now.  I can\'t stand\r\nit, Horace."\r\n\r\nHorace stared at his brother in consternation.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Reg, old man, you mustn\'t; really you mustn\'t.  Do let\'s stick\r\ntogether, however miserable it is.  It\'s sure to seem worse at first."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well for you, Horace, doing messenger work.  You haven\'t\r\nbeen set to sweep out a room."\r\n\r\nHorace whistled.\r\n\r\n"Whew! that _is_ a drop too much!  But," he added, taking his brother\'s\r\narm, "don\'t cut it yet, old man, for mother\'s sake, don\'t.  I\'ll come\r\nand help you do it if I can.  Why couldn\'t they have given it me to do,\r\nand let you go the messages!"\r\n\r\nReginald said nothing, but let his brother lead him back slowly to the\r\nbig room presided over by Mr Durfy.\r\n\r\n"Where is it?"  Horace inquired of him at the door.\r\n\r\n"That little room in the corner."\r\n\r\n"All right.  I\'ll come if I possibly can.  Do try it, old man, won\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try it," said Reginald, with something very like a groan as he\r\nopened the door and walked grimly back to the back case-room.\r\n\r\nHorace, full of fear and trembling on his brother\'s account, hurried\r\nwith his copy to Mr Durfy, and waited impatiently till that grandee\r\ncondescended to relieve him of it.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything else?" he inquired, as he gave it up.\r\n\r\n"Anything else?  Yes, plenty; but don\'t come bothering me now."\r\n\r\nHorace waited for no more elaborate statement of Mr Durfy\'s wishes, but\r\nthankfully withdrew, and made straight for Reginald.\r\n\r\nHe found him half hidden, half choked by the dust of his own raising, as\r\nhe drew his broom in a spiritless way across the black dry floor.\r\n\r\nHe paused in his occupation as Horace entered, and for a moment, as the\r\ntwo stood face to face coughing and sneezing, a sense of the ludicrous\r\novercame them, and they finished up their duet with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"I say," said Horace, as soon as he could get words, "I fancy a little\r\nwater would be an improvement here."\r\n\r\n"Where are we to get it from?" said Reg.\r\n\r\n"I suppose there must be some about.  Shall I go and see?"\r\n\r\n"We might tip one of those fellows outside a sixpence to go and get us\r\nsome."\r\n\r\n"Hold hard, old man!" said Horace, laughing again.  "We\'re not so flush\r\nof sixpences as all that.  I guess if we want any water we shall have to\r\nget it ourselves.  I\'ll be back directly."\r\n\r\nPoor Reg, spirited up for a while by his brother\'s courage, proceeded\r\nmore gingerly with his sweeping, much amazed in the midst of his misery\r\nto discover how many walks in life there are beyond the capacity even of\r\nthe captain of the fifth of a public school.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, destined on the present occasion to perfect himself\r\nin the one that was then engaging his attention.  Horace had scarcely\r\ndisappeared in quest of water when the door opened, and no less a\r\npersonage than the manager himself entered the room.\r\n\r\nHe was evidently prepared neither for the dust nor the duster, and\r\nstarted back for a moment, as though he were under the impression that\r\nthe clouds filling the apartment were clouds of smoke, and Reginald was\r\nanother Guy Fawkes caught in the act.  He recovered himself shortly,\r\nhowever, and demanded sharply,--\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here, making all this mess?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying to carry out Mr Durfy\'s instructions," replied Reginald,\r\nleaning on his broom, and not at all displeased at the interruption.\r\n\r\n"Durfy\'s instructions?  What do you mean, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Mr Durfy\'s--"\r\n\r\n"That will do.  Here you," said the manager, opening the door, and\r\nspeaking to the nearest workman, "tell Mr Durfy to step here."\r\n\r\nMr Durfy appeared in a very brief space.\r\n\r\n"Durfy," said the manager, wrathfully, "what do you mean by having this\r\nroom in such a filthy mess?  Aren\'t your instructions to have it swept\r\nout once a week?  When was it swept last?"\r\n\r\n"Some little time ago.  We\'ve been so busy in our department, sir,\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; you always say that.  I\'m sick of hearing it.  Don\'t let\r\nme find this sort of thing again.  Send some one at once to sweep it\r\nout; this lad doesn\'t know how to hold a broom.  Take care it\'s done by\r\nfour o\'clock, and ready for use.  Pheugh! it\'s enough to choke one."\r\n\r\nAnd the manager went off in a rage, coughing.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory as this was, in a certain sense, for Reginald, it was not a\r\nflattering way of ending his difficulties, nor did the spirit in which\r\nMr Durfy accepted his chief\'s reprimand at all tend to restore him to\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\n"Bah, you miserable idiot, you!  Give up that broom, and get out of\r\nthis, or I\'ll chuck you out."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you will," said Reginald, coolly dropping the broom and\r\nfacing his enemy.\r\n\r\nHe was happier at that moment than he had been for a long time.  He\r\ncould imagine himself back at Wilderham, with the school bully shouting\r\nat him, and his spirits rose within him accordingly.\r\n\r\n"What do you say? you hugger-mugger puppy you--you--"\r\n\r\nMr Durfy\'s adjectives frequently had the merit of being more forcible\r\nthan appropriate, and on the present occasion, what with the dust and\r\nhis own rage, the one he wanted stuck in his throat altogether.\r\n\r\n"I said I don\'t think you will," repeated Reginald.\r\n\r\nMr Durfy looked at his man and hesitated.  Reginald stood five foot\r\nnine, and his shoulders were square and broad, besides, he was as cool\r\nas a cucumber, and didn\'t even trouble to take his hands out of his\r\npockets.  All this Mr Durfy took in, and did not relish; but he must\r\nnot cave in too precipitately, so he replied, with a sneer,--\r\n\r\n"Think!  A lot you know about thinking!  Can\'t even hold a broom.  Clear\r\nout of here, I tell you, double quick; do you hear?"\r\n\r\nReginald\'s spirits fell.  It was clear from Mr Durfy\'s tone he was not\r\ngoing to attempt to "chuck him out," and nothing therefore could be\r\ngained by remaining.\r\n\r\nHe turned scornfully on his heel, knowing that he had made one enemy, at\r\nany rate, during his short connection with his new business.\r\n\r\nAnd if he had known all, he could have counted two; for Mr Durfy,\r\nfinding himself in a mood to wreak his wrath on some one, summoned the\r\nill-favoured Barber to sweep out the back case-room, and gave his orders\r\nso viciously that Barber felt distinctly aggrieved, and jumping to the\r\nconclusion that Reginald had somehow contrived to turn the tables on\r\nhim, he registered a secret vow, there and then, that he would on the\r\nfirst opportunity, and on all subsequent opportunities, be square with\r\nthat luckless youth.\r\n\r\nCaring very little about who hated him or who liked him, Reginald\r\nwandered forth, to intercept the faithful Horace with the now\r\nunnecessary water; and the two boys, finding very little to occupy them\r\nduring the rest of the day, remained in comparative seclusion until the\r\nseven o\'clock bell rang, when they walked home, possibly wiser, and\r\ncertainly sadder, for their first day with the _Rocket_ Newspaper\r\nCompany, Limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE CRUDENS AT HOME.\r\n\r\nIf anything could have made up to the two boys for the hardships and\r\nmiseries of the day, it was the sight of their mother\'s bright face as\r\nshe awaited them that evening at the door of Number 6, Dull Street.  If\r\nthe day had been a sad and lonely one for Mrs Cruden, she was not the\r\nwoman to betray the secret to her sons; and, indeed, the happiness of\r\nseeing them back was enough to drive away all other care for the time\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nShabby as the lodgings were, and lacking in all the comforts and\r\nluxuries of former days, the little family felt that evening, as they\r\ngathered round the tea-table and unburdened their hearts to one another,\r\nmore of the true meaning of the word "home" than they had ever done\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Now, dear boys," said Mrs Cruden, when the meal was over, and they\r\ndrew their chairs to the open window, "I\'m longing to hear your day\'s\r\nadventures.  How did you get on?  Was it as bad as you expected?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t particularly jolly," said Reginald, shrugging his\r\nshoulders--"nothing like Wilderham, was it, Horrors?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it was a different sort of fun, certainly," said Horace.  "You\r\nsee, mother, our education has been rather neglected in some things, so\r\nwe didn\'t get on as well as we might have done."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean in the literary work?" said Mrs Cruden.  "I\'m quite sure\r\nyou\'ll get into it with a little practice."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s not the literary work, unluckily," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you mean clerk\'s work.  You aren\'t as quick at figures, perhaps, as\r\nyou might be?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not exactly it," said Horace.  "The fact is, mother, we\'re\r\nneither in the literary not the clerical department.  I\'m a `printer\'s\r\ndevil\'!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Horace! what _do_ you mean?" said the horrified mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m most innocently employed.  I run messages; I fetch and carry\r\nfor a gentleman called Durfy.  He gives me some parliamentary news to\r\ncarry to one place, and some police news to carry to another place--and,\r\nby-the-way, they read very much alike--and when I\'m not running\r\nbackwards or forwards I have to sit on a stool and watch him, and be\r\nready to jump up and wag my tail the moment he whistles.  It\'s a fact,\r\nmother!  Think of getting eighteen shillings a week for that!  It\'s a\r\nfraud!"\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden could hardly tell whether to laugh or cry.\r\n\r\n"My poor boy!" she murmured; then, turning to Reginald, she said, "And\r\nwhat do you do, Reg?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I sweep rooms," said Reg, solemnly; "but they\'ve got such a\r\nshocking bad broom there that I can\'t make it act.  If you could give me\r\na new broom-head, mother, and put me up to a dodge or two about working\r\nout corners, I might rise in my profession!"\r\n\r\nThere was a tell-tale quaver in the speaker\'s voice which made this\r\njaunty speech a very sad one to the mother\'s ears.  It was all she could\r\ndo to conceal her misery, and when Horace came to the rescue with a racy\r\naccount of the day\'s proceedings, told in his liveliest manner, she was\r\nglad to turn her head and hide from her boys the trouble in her face.\r\n\r\nHowever, she soon recovered herself, and by the time Horace\'s story was\r\ndone she was ready to join her smiles with those which the history had\r\ndrawn even from Reginald\'s serious countenance.\r\n\r\n"After all," said she, presently, "we must be thankful for what we have.\r\nSome one was saying the other day there never was a time when so many\r\nyoung fellows were out of work and thankful to get anything to do.  And\r\nit\'s very likely too, Reg, that just now, when they seem rather in\r\nconfusion at the office, they really haven\'t time to see about what your\r\nregular work is to be.  Wait a little, and they\'re sure to find out your\r\nvalue."\r\n\r\n"They seem to have done that already as far as sweeping is concerned.\r\nThe manager said I didn\'t know how to hold a broom.  I was quite\r\noffended," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"You are a dear brave pair of boys!" said the mother, warmly; "and I am\r\nprouder of you in your humble work than if you were kings!"\r\n\r\n"Hullo," said Horace, "there\'s some one coming up our stairs!"\r\n\r\nSure enough there was, and more than one person, as it happened.  There\r\nwas a knock at the door, followed straightway by the entrance of an\r\nelderly lady, accompanied by a young lady and a young gentleman, who\r\nsailed into the room, much to the amazement and consternation of its\r\noccupants.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Cruden, I believe?" said the elderly lady, in her politest tones.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the owner of that name.\r\n\r\n"Let me hintroduce myself--Mrs Captain Shuckleford, my son and\r\ndaughter--neighbours of yours, Mrs Cruden, and wishing to be friendly.\r\nWe\'re sorry to hear of your trouble; very trying it is.  My \'usband,\r\nMrs Cruden, has gone too."\r\n\r\n"Pray take a seat," said Mrs Cruden.  "Reg, will you put chairs?"\r\n\r\nReg obeyed, with a groan.\r\n\r\n"These are your boys, are they?" said the visitor, eyeing the youths.\r\n"Will you come and shake \'ands with me, Reggie?  What a dear, good-\r\nlooking boy he is, Mrs Cruden!  And \'ow do you do, too, my man?" said\r\nshe, addressing Horace.  "Pretty well?  And what do they call you?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Horace," said "my man," blushing very decidedly, and\r\nretreating precipitately to a far corner of the room.\r\n\r\n"Ah, dear me!  And my \'usband\'s name, Mrs Cruden, was \'Oward.  I never\r\n\'ear the name without affliction."\r\n\r\nThis was very awkward, for as the unfortunate widow could not fail to\r\nhear her own voice, it was necessary for consistency\'s sake that she\r\nshould show some emotion, which she proceeded to do, when her daughter\r\nhurriedly interposed in an audible whisper, "Ma, don\'t make a goose of\r\nyourself!  Behave yourself, do!"\r\n\r\n"So I am be\'aving myself, Jemima," replied the outraged parent, "and I\r\ndon\'t need lessons from you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of you to call in," said Mrs Cruden, feeling it time to\r\nsay something; "do you live near here?"\r\n\r\n"We live next door, at number four," said Miss Jemima; "put that\r\nhandkerchief away, ma."\r\n\r\n"What next, I wonder! if my \'andkerchief\'s not my hown, I\'d like to know\r\nwhat is?  Yes, Mrs Cruden.  We heard you were coming, and we wish to\r\ntreat you with consideration, knowing your circumstances.  It\'s all one\r\ngentlefolk can do to another.  Yes, and I \'ope the boys will be good\r\nfriends.  Sam, talk to the boys."\r\n\r\nSam needed no such maternal encouragement, as it happened, and had\r\nalready swaggered up to Horace with a familiar air.\r\n\r\n"Jolly weather, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Horace, looking round wildly for any avenue of escape, but\r\nfinding none.\r\n\r\n"Pretty hot in your shop, ain\'t it?" said the lawyer\'s clerk.\r\n\r\n"Yes," again said Horace, with a peculiar tingling sensation in his toes\r\nwhich his visitor little dreamed of.\r\n\r\nHorace was not naturally a short-tempered youth, but there was something\r\nin the tone of this self-satisfied lawyer\'s clerk which raised his\r\ndander.\r\n\r\n"Not much of a berth, is it?" pursued the catechist.\r\n\r\n"No," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"Not a very chirrupy screw, so I\'m told--eh?"\r\n\r\nThis was rather too much.  Either Horace must escape by flight, which\r\nwould be ignominious, or he must knock his visitor down, which would be\r\nrude, or he must grin and bear it.  The middle course was what he most\r\ninclined to, but failing that, he decided on the latter.\r\n\r\nSo he shook his head and waited patiently for the next question.\r\n\r\n"What do you do, eh? dirty work, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, isn\'t yours?" said Horace, in a tone that rather surprised the\r\nlimb of the law.\r\n\r\n"Mine?  No.  What makes you ask that?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Only because I thought I\'d like to know," said Horace artlessly.\r\n\r\nMr Shuckleford looked perplexed.  He didn\'t understand exactly what\r\nHorace meant, and yet, whatever it was, it put him off the thread of his\r\ndiscourse for a time.  So he changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"I once thought of going into business myself," he said; "but they\r\nseemed to think I\'d do better at the law.  Same time, don\'t think I\'m a\r\nnailer on business chaps.  I know one or two very respectable chaps in\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"Do you?" replied Horace, with a touch of satire in his voice which was\r\nquite lost on the complacent Sam.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Why, in our club--do you know our club?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"Oh--I must take you one evening--yes, in our club we\'ve a good many\r\nbusiness chaps--well-behaved chaps, too."\r\n\r\nHorace hardly looked as overwhelmed by this announcement as his visitor\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to join?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you."\r\n\r\n"Eh? you\'re afraid of being black-balled, I suppose?  No fear, I can\r\nwork it with them.  I can walk round any of them, I let you know; they\r\nwouldn\'t do it, especially when they knew I\'d a fancy for you, my boy."\r\n\r\nIf Horace was grateful for this expression of favour, he managed to\r\nconceal his feelings wonderfully well.  At the same time he had sense\r\nenough to see that, vulgar and conceited as Samuel Shuckleford was, he\r\nmeant to be friendly, and inwardly gave him credit accordingly.\r\n\r\nHe did his best to be civil, and to listen to all the bumptious talk of\r\nhis visitor patiently, and Sam rattled away greatly to his own\r\nsatisfaction, fully believing he was impressing his hearer with a sense\r\nof his importance, and cheering his heart by the promise of his favours\r\nand protection.\r\n\r\nWith the unlucky Reginald, meanwhile, it fared far less comfortably.\r\n\r\n"Jemima, my dear," said Mrs Shuckleford, who in all her domestic\r\nconfidences to Mrs Cruden kept a sharp eye on her family--"Jemima, my\r\ndear, I think Reggie would like to show you his album!"\r\n\r\nAn electric shock could not have startled and confused our hero more.\r\nIt was bad enough to hear himself called "Reggie," but that was nothing\r\nto the assumption that he was pining to make himself agreeable to Miss\r\nJemima--he to whom any lady except his mother was a cause of\r\ntrepidation, and to whom a female like Miss Jemima was nothing short of\r\nan ogress!\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not got an album," he gasped, with an appealing look towards his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nBut before Mrs Cruden could interpose to rescue him, the ladylike Miss\r\nJemima, who had already regarded the good-looking shy youth with\r\napproval, entered the lists on her own account, and moving her chair a\r\ntrifle in his direction, said, in a confidential whisper,--\r\n\r\n"Ma thinks we\'re not a very sociable couple, that\'s what it is."\r\n\r\nA couple!  He and Jemima a couple!  Reginald was ready to faint, and\r\nlooked towards the open window as if he meditated a headlong escape that\r\nway.  As to any other way of escape, that was impossible, for he was\r\nfairly cornered between the enemy and the wall, and unless he were to\r\ncut his way through the one or the other, he must sit where he was.\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t mind talking to me, Mr Reggie," continued the young\r\nlady, when Reginald gave no symptom of having heard the last\r\nobservation.  "We shall have to be friends, you know, now we are\r\nneighbours.  So you haven\'t got an album?"\r\n\r\nThis abrupt question drove poor Reginald still further into the corner.\r\nWhat business was it of hers whether he had got an album or not?  What\r\nright had she to pester him with questions like that in his own house?\r\nIn fact, what right had she and her mother and her brother to come there\r\nat all?  Those were the thoughts that passed through his mind, and as\r\nthey did so indignation got the better of good manners and everything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n"Find out," he said.\r\n\r\nHe could have bitten his tongue off the moment he had spoken.  For\r\nReginald was a gentleman, and the sound of these rude words in his own\r\nvoice startled him into a sense of shame and confusion tenfold worse\r\nthan any Miss Shuckleford had succeeded in producing.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," he gasped hurriedly.  "I--I didn\'t mean to be\r\nrude."\r\n\r\nNow was the hour of Miss Jemima\'s triumph.  She had the unhappy youth at\r\nher mercy, and she took full advantage of her power.  She forgave him,\r\nand made him sit and listen to her and answer her questions for as long\r\nas she chose; and if ever he showed signs of mutiny, the slightest hint,\r\nsuch as "You\'ll be telling me to mind my own business again," was enough\r\nto reduce him to instant subjection.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad quarter of an hour for Reginald, and the climax arrived\r\nwhen presently Mrs Shuckleford looked towards them and said across the\r\nroom,--\r\n\r\n"Now I wonder what you two young people are talking about in that snug\r\ncorner.  Oh, never mind, if it\'s secrets!  Nice it is, Mrs Cruden, to\r\nsee young people such good friends so soon.  We must be going now,\r\nchildren," she added.  "We shall soon see our friends in our own \'ouse,\r\nI \'ope."\r\n\r\nA tender leave-taking ensued.  For a while, as the retreating footsteps\r\nof the visitors gradually died away on the stairs, the little family\r\nstood motionless, as though the slightest sound might recall them.  But\r\nwhen at last the street-door slammed below, Reginald flung himself into\r\na chair and groaned.\r\n\r\n"Mother, we can\'t stay here.  We must leave to-morrow!"\r\n\r\nHorace could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n"Why, Reg," he said, "you seemed to be enjoying yourself no end."\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Horace, it\'s nothing to laugh about."\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," said Mrs Cruden, "you think far more about it than you\r\nneed.  After all, they seem kindly disposed persons, and I don\'t think\r\nwe should be unfriendly."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well," said Reg, "if there was no Jemima in the\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"I should say it\'s all very well," said Horace, "if there was no Sam in\r\nthe question; though I dare say he means to be friendly.  But didn\'t you\r\nand Jemima hit it, then, Reg?  I quite thought you did."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you to shut up?" repeated Reg, this time half angrily.\r\n"I don\'t see, mother," he added, "however poor we are, we are called on\r\nto associate with a lot like that."\r\n\r\n"They have not polished manners, certainly," said Mrs Cruden; "but I do\r\nthink they are good-natured, and that\'s a great thing."\r\n\r\n"I should think so," said Horace.  "What do you think?  Samuel wants to\r\npropose me for his club, which seems to be a very select affair."\r\n\r\n"All I know is," said Reginald, "nothing will induce me to go into their\r\nhouse.  It may be rude, but I\'m certain I\'d be still more rude if I did\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Horace, "I vote we take a walk, as it\'s a fine evening.  I\r\nfeel a trifle warm after it all.  What do you say?"\r\n\r\nThey said Yes, and in the empty streets that evening the mother and her\r\ntwo sons walked happy in one another\'s company, and trying each in his\r\nor her own way to gain courage for the days of trial that were to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe brothers had a short consultation that night as they went to bed,\r\n_not_ on the subject of their next door neighbours.\r\n\r\n"Horrors," said Reg, "what\'s to be done about the _Rocket_?  I can\'t\r\nstop there."\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful," said Horace; "but what else can we do?  If we cut it,\r\nthere\'s mother left a beggar."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we get into something else?"\r\n\r\n"What?  Who\'d take us?  There are thousands of fellows wanting work as\r\nit is."\r\n\r\n"But surely we\'re better than most of them.  We\'re gentlemen and well\r\neducated."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse, it seems," said Horace.  "What good is it to us when\r\nwe\'re put to sweep rooms and carry messages?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say you intend to stick to that sort of thing all your\r\nlife?" asked Reg.\r\n\r\n"Till I can find something better," said Horace.  "After all, old man,\r\nit\'s honest work, and not very fagging, and it\'s eighteen shillings a\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, I think we might let Richmond know what a nice berth he\'s let\r\nus in for.  Why, his office-boy\'s better off."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and if we knew as much about book-keeping and agreement stamps and\r\ncopying presses as his office-boy does, we might be as well off.  What\'s\r\nthe good of knowing how many ships fought at Salamis, when we don\'t even\r\nknow how many ounces you can send by post for twopence?  At least, I\r\ndon\'t.  Good-night, old man."\r\n\r\nAnd Horace, really scarcely less miserable at heart than his brother,\r\nburied his nose in the Dull Street pillow and tried to go to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nREGINALD\'S PROSPECTS DEVELOP.\r\n\r\nIt was in anything but exuberant spirits that the two Crudens presented\r\nthemselves on the following morning at the workman\'s entrance of the\r\n_Rocket_ Newspaper Company, Limited.  The bell was beginning to sound as\r\nthey did so, and their enemy the timekeeper looked as though he would\r\nfain discover a pretext for pouncing on them and giving them a specimen\r\nof his importance.  But even his ingenuity failed in this respect, and\r\nas Horace passed him with a good-humoured nod, he had, much against his\r\nwill, to nod back, and forego his amiable intentions.\r\n\r\nThe brothers naturally turned their steps to the room presided over by\r\nMr Durfy.  That magnate had not yet arrived, much to their relief, and\r\nthey consoled themselves in his absence by standing at the table\r\nwatching their fellow-workmen as they crowded in and proceeded with more\r\nor less alacrity to settle down to their day\'s work.\r\n\r\nAmong those who displayed no unseemly haste in applying themselves to\r\ntheir tasks was Barber, who, with the dust of the back case-room still\r\nin his mind, and equally on his countenance, considered the present\r\nopportunity of squaring up accounts with Reginald too good to be\r\nneglected.  For reasons best known to himself, Mr Barber determined\r\nthat his victim\'s flagellation should be moral rather than physical.  He\r\nwould have liked to punch Reginald\'s head, or, better still, to have\r\nknocked Reginald\'s and Horace\'s heads together.  But he saw reasons for\r\ndenying himself that pleasure, and fell back on the more ethereal\r\nweapons of his own wit.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, puddin\' \'ead," he began, "\'ow\'s your pa and your ma to-day?\r\nFind the Old Bailey a \'ealthy place, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\nReginald favoured the speaker by way of answer with a stare of mingled\r\nscorn and wrath, which greatly elevated that gentleman\'s spirits.\r\n\r\n"\'Ow long is it they\'ve got?  Seven years, ain\'t it?  My eye, they won\'t\r\nknow you when they come out, you\'ll be so growed."\r\n\r\nThe wrath slowly faded from Reginald\'s face, as the speaker proceeded,\r\nleaving only the scorn to testify to the interest he took in this\r\nintellectual display.\r\n\r\nHorace, delighted to see there was no prospect of a "flare-up," smiled,\r\nand began almost to enjoy himself.\r\n\r\n"I say," continued Barber, just a little disappointed to find that his\r\nexquisite humour was not as electrical in its effect as it would have\r\nbeen on any one less dense than the Crudens, "\'ow is it you ain\'t got a\r\nclean collar on to-day, and no scent on your \'andkerchers--eh?"\r\n\r\nThis was getting feeble.  Even Mr Barber felt it, for he continued, in\r\na more lively tone,--\r\n\r\n"Glad we ain\'t got many of your sickening sort \'ere; snivelling school-\r\nboy brats, that\'s what you are, tired of pickin\' pockets, and think\r\nyou\'re goin\' to show us your manners.  Yah! if you wasn\'t such a dirty\r\nugly pair of puppy dogs I\'d stick you under the pump--so I would."\r\n\r\nReginald yawned, and walked off to watch a compositor picking up type\r\nout of a case.  Horace, on the other hand, appeared to be deeply\r\ninterested in Mr Barber\'s eloquent observations, and inquired quite\r\nartlessly, but with a twinkle in his eye,--"Is the pump near here?  I\r\nwas looking for it everywhere yesterday."\r\n\r\nIt was Mr Barber\'s turn to stare.  He had not expected this, and he did\r\nnot like it, especially when one or two of the men and boys near, who\r\nhad failed to be convulsed by his wit, laughed at Horace\'s question.\r\n\r\nAfter all, moral flagellation does not always answer, and when one of\r\nthe victims yawns and the other asks a matter-of-fact questions it is\r\ndisconcerting even to an accomplished operator.  However, Barber\r\ngallantly determined on one more effort.\r\n\r\n"Ugh--trying to be funny, are you, Mr Snubnose?  Best try and be honest\r\nif you can, you and your mealy-mug brother.  It\'ll be \'ard work, I know,\r\nto keep your \'ands in your own pockets, but you\'d best do it, do you\r\n\'ear--pair of psalm-singin\' twopenny-ha\'penny puppy dogs!"\r\n\r\nThis picturesque peroration certainly deserved some recognition, and\r\nmight possibly have received it, had not Mr Durfy\'s entrance at that\r\nparticular moment sent the idlers back suddenly to their cases.\r\n\r\nReginald, either heedless of or unconcerned at the new arrival, remained\r\nlistlessly watching the operations of the compositor near him, an act of\r\naudacity which highly exasperated the overseer, and furnished the key-\r\nnote for the day\'s entertainment.\r\n\r\nFor Mr Durfy, to use an expressive term, had "got out of bed the wrong\r\nside" this morning.  For the matter of that, after the blowing-up about\r\nthe back case-room, he had got into it the wrong side last night, so\r\nthat he was doubly perturbed in spirit, and a short conversation he had\r\njust had with the manager below had not tended to compose him.\r\n\r\n"Durfy," said that brusque official, as the overseer passed his open\r\ndoor, "come in.  What about those two lads I sent up to you yesterday?\r\nAre they any good?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," growled Mr Durfy; "fools both of them."\r\n\r\n"Which is the bigger fool?"\r\n\r\n"The old one."\r\n\r\n"Then keep him for yourself--put him to composing, and send the other\r\none down here.  Send him at once, Durfy, do you hear?"\r\n\r\nWith this considerately worded injunction in his ears it is hardly to be\r\nwondered at that Mr Durfy was not all smiles as he entered the domain\r\nwhich owned his sway.\r\n\r\nHis eye naturally lit on Reginald as the most suitable object on which\r\nto relieve his feelings.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, there," he called out.  "What do you mean by interfering\r\nwith the men in their work?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not interfering with anybody," said Reginald, looking up with\r\nglowing cheeks, "I\'m watching this man."\r\n\r\n"Come out of it, do you hear me?  Why don\'t you go about your own work?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been waiting here ten-minutes for you."\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Mr Durfy, his tones getting lower as his passion\r\nrose; "if you think we\'re going to keep you here to give us any of your\r\nimpudence you\'re mistaken; so I can tell you.  It\'s bad enough to have a\r\nbig fool put into the place for charity, without any of your nonsense.\r\nIf I had my way I\'d give you your beggarly eighteen shillings a week to\r\nkeep you away.  Go to your work."\r\n\r\nReginald\'s eyes blazed out for a moment on the speaker in a way which\r\nmade Horace, who heard and saw all, tremble.  But he overcame himself\r\nwith a mighty effort, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\nMr Durfy glanced round the room.\r\n\r\n"Young Gedge!" he called out.\r\n\r\nA boy answered the summons.\r\n\r\n"Clear that rack between you and Barber, and put up a pair of cases for\r\nthis fool here, and look after him.  Off you go! and off _you_ go,"\r\nadded he, rounding on Reginald, "and if we don\'t make it hot for you\r\namong us I\'m precious mistaken."\r\n\r\nIt was a proud moment certainly for the cock of the fifth at Wilderham\r\nto find himself following meekly at the heels of a youngster like Gedge,\r\nwho had been commissioned to put him to work and look after him.  But\r\nReginald was too sick at heart and disgusted to care what became of\r\nhimself, as long as Mr Durfy\'s odious voice ceased to torment his ears.\r\nThe only thing he did care about was what was to become of Horace.  Was\r\nhe to be put in charge of some one too, or was he to remain a printer\'s\r\ndevil?\r\n\r\nMr Durfy soon answered that question.\r\n\r\n"What are you standing there for?" demanded he, turning round on the\r\nyounger brother as soon as he had disposed of the elder.  "Go down to\r\nthe manager\'s room at once; you\'re not wanted here."\r\n\r\nSo they were to be separated!  There was only time to exchange one\r\nglance of mutual commiseration and then Horace slowly left the room with\r\nsad forebodings, more on his brother\'s account than his own, and feeling\r\nthat as far as helping one another was concerned they might as well be\r\ndoomed to serve their time at opposite ends of London.\r\n\r\nGedge, under whose imposing auspices Reginald was to begin his\r\ntypographical career, was a diminutive youth who, to all outward\r\nappearances, was somewhere about the tender age of fourteen, instead of,\r\nas was really the case, being almost as old as Reginald himself.  He was\r\nfacetiously styled "Magog" by his shopmates, in allusion to his small\r\nstature, which required the assistance of a good-sized box under his\r\nfeet to enable him to reach his "upper case."  His face was not an\r\nunpleasant one, and his voice, which still retained its boyish treble,\r\nwas an agreeable contrast to that of most of the "gentlemen of the case"\r\nin Mr Durfy\'s department.\r\n\r\nFor all that, Reginald considered himself much outraged by being put in\r\ncharge of this chit of a child, and glowered down on him much as a\r\nmastiff might glower on a terrier who presumed to do the honour of his\r\nback yard for his benefit.\r\n\r\nHowever, the terrier in this case was not at all disheartened by his\r\nreception, and said cheerily as he began to clear the frame,--\r\n\r\n"You don\'t seem to fancy it, I say.  I don\'t wonder.  Never mind, I\r\nshan\'t lick you unless you make me."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Reginald, drily, but scarcely able to conceal a smile at\r\nthis magnanimous declaration.\r\n\r\n"Magog" worked busily away, putting away cases in the rack, dusting the\r\nframe down with his apron, and whistling softly to himself.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for helping me," said he, after a time, as Reginald still stood\r\nby doing nothing.  "I could never have done it all by myself."\r\n\r\nReginald blushed a little at this broad hint, and proceeded to lift down\r\na case.  But he nearly upset it in doing so, greatly to his companion\'s\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better rest," he said, "you\'ll be fagged out.  Here, let me do\r\nit.  There you are.  Now we\'re ready to start you.  I\'ve a good mind to\r\ngo and get old Tacker to ring up the big bell and let them know you\'re\r\njust going to begin."\r\n\r\nReginald could hardly be offended at this good-natured banter, and, as\r\nGedge was after all a decent-looking boy, and aspirated his "h\'s," and\r\ndid not smell of onions, he began to think that if he were doomed to\r\ndrudge in this place he might have been saddled with a more offensive\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity to put Tacker to the trouble, young \'un," said he; "he\'ll\r\nprobably ring when I\'m going to leave off, and that\'ll do as well."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not bad for you," said Gedge, approvingly; "not half bad.  Go on\r\nlike that, and you\'ll make a joke in about a fortnight."\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Reginald, smiling at last.  "I shall either have to\r\npunch your head or begin work.  You\'d better decide which you\'d like\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"Well, as Durfy is looking this way," said Gedge, "I suppose you\'d\r\nbetter begin work.  Stick that pair of empty cases up there--the one\r\nwith the big holes below and the other one above.  You needn\'t stick\r\nthem upside down, though, unless you particularly want to; they look\r\nquite as well the right way.  Now, then, you\'d better watch me fill\r\nthem, and see what boxes the sorts go in.  No larks, now.  Here goes for\r\nthe `m\'s.\'"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Mr "Magog" proceeded to fill up one box with types of the\r\nletter "m," and another box some distance off with "a\'s," and another\r\nwith "b\'s," and so on, till presently the lower of the two cases was\r\nnearly full.  Reginald watched him with something like admiration,\r\ninwardly wondering if he would ever be able to find his way about this\r\nlabyrinth of boxes, and strongly of opinion that only muffs like\r\nprinters would think of arranging the alphabet in such an absurdly\r\nhaphazard manner.  The lower case being full up, Gedge meekly suggested\r\nthat as he was yet several feet from his full size, they might as well\r\nlift the upper case down while it was being filled.  Which done, the\r\nsame process was repeated, only with more apparent regularity, and the\r\ncase having been finally tilted up on the frame above the lower case,\r\nthe operator turned round with a pleased expression, and said,--\r\n\r\n"What do you think of that?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I think it\'s very ridiculous not to put the `capital J\' next to\r\nthe `capital I,\'" said Reginald.\r\n\r\nGedge laughed.\r\n\r\n"Go and tell Durfy that; he\'d like to hear it."\r\n\r\nReginald, however, denied himself the pleasure of entertaining Mr Durfy\r\non this occasion, and occupied himself with picking up the types and\r\ninspecting them, and trying to learn the geography of his cases.\r\n\r\n"Now," said "Magog," mounting his box, and taking his composing-stick in\r\nhis hand, "keep your eye on me, young fellow, and you\'ll know all about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded to "set-up" a paragraph for the newspaper from a\r\nmanuscript in front of him at a speed which bewildered Reginald and\r\nbaffled any attempt on his part to follow the movements of the\r\noperator\'s hand among the boxes.  He watched for several minutes in\r\nsilence until Gedge, considering he had exhibited his agility\r\nsufficiently, halted in his work, and with a passing shade across his\r\nface turned to his companion and said,--\r\n\r\n"I say, isn\'t this a beastly place?"\r\n\r\nThere was something in his voice and manner which struck Reginald.  It\r\nwas unlike a common workman, and still more unlike a boy of Gedge\'s size\r\nand age.\r\n\r\n"It is beastly," he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry for you, you know," continued Gedge, in a half-\r\nwhisper, and going on with his work at the same time, "because I guess\r\nit\'s not what you\'re used to."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not used to it," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Nor was I when I came.  My old screw of an uncle took it into his head\r\nto apprentice me here because he\'d been an apprentice once, and didn\'t\r\nsee why I should start higher up the ladder than he did.  Are you an\r\napprentice?"\r\n\r\n"No, not that I know of," said Reginald, not knowing exactly what he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"Lucky beggar!  I\'m booked here for nobody knows how much longer.  I\'d\r\nhave cut it long ago if I could.  I say, what\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Cruden."\r\n\r\n"Well, Cruden, I\'m precious glad you\'ve turned up.  It\'ll make all the\r\ndifference to me.  I was getting as big a cad as any of those fellows\r\nthere, for you\'re bound to be sociable.  But you\'re a nicer sort, and\r\nit\'s a good job for me, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nApart from the flattery of these words, there was a touch of earnestness\r\nin the boy\'s voice which struck a sympathetic chord in Reginald\'s\r\nnature, and drew him mysteriously to this new hour-old acquaintance.  He\r\ntold him of his own hard fortunes, and by what means he had come down to\r\nhis present position.  Gedge listened to it all eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Were you really captain of the fifth at your school?" said he, almost\r\nreverentially.  "I say! what an awful drop this must be!  You must feel\r\nas if you\'d sooner be dead."\r\n\r\n"I do sometimes," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"I know I would," replied Gedge, solemnly, "if I was you.  Was that\r\nother fellow your brother, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nGedge mused a bit, and then laughed quietly.\r\n\r\n"How beautifully you two shut up Barber between you just now," he said;\r\n"it\'s the first snub he\'s had since I\'ve been here, and all the fellows\r\nswear by him.  I say, Cruden, it\'s a merciful thing for me you\'ve come.\r\nI was bound to go to the dogs if I\'d gone on as I was much longer."\r\n\r\nReginald brightened.  It pleased him just now to think any one was glad\r\nto see him, and the spontaneous way in which this boy had come under his\r\nwing won him over completely.\r\n\r\n"We must manage to stick together," he said.  "Horace, you know, is\r\nworking in another part of the office.  It\'s awfully hard lines, for we\r\nset our minds on being together.  But it can\'t be helped; and I\'m glad,\r\nany way, you\'re here, young \'un."\r\n\r\nThe young \'un beamed gratefully by way of response.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph by this time was nearly set-up, and the conversation was\r\ninterrupted by the critical operation of lifting the "matter" from the\r\nstick and transferring it to a "galley," a feat which the experienced\r\n"Magog" accomplished very deftly, and greatly to the amazement of his\r\ncompanion.  Just as it was over, and Reginald was laughingly hoping he\r\nwould not soon be expected to arrive at such a pitch of dexterity, Mr\r\nDurfy walked up.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s what you call doing your work, is it? playing the fool, and\r\ngetting in another man\'s way.  Is that all you\'ve done?"\r\n\r\nReginald glared at him, and answered,--\r\n\r\n"I\'m not playing the fool."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue and don\'t answer me, you miserable puppy!  Let me see\r\nwhat you have done."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been learning the boxes in the case," said Reginald.\r\n\r\nMr Durfy sneered.\r\n\r\n"You have, have you?  That\'s what you\'ve been doing the last hour, I\r\nsuppose.  Since you\'ve been so industrious, pick me out a lower-case\r\n`x,\' do you hear?"\r\n\r\nReginald made a vague dive at one of the boxes, but not the right one,\r\nfor he produced a `z.\'\r\n\r\n"Ah, I thought so," said Mr Durfy, with a sneer that made Reginald long\r\nto cram the type into his mouth.  "Now let\'s try a capital `J.\'"\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Reginald knew where the capital "J" was, but he made no\r\nattempt to reach it, and answered,--\r\n\r\n"If you want a capital `J,\' Mr Durfy, you can help yourself."\r\n\r\n"Magog" nearly jumped out of his skin as he heard this audacious reply,\r\nand scarcely ventured to look round to notice the effect of it on Mr\r\nDurfy.  The effect was on the whole not bad.  For a moment the overseer\r\nwas dumbfounded and could not speak.  But a glance at the resolute pale\r\nboy in front of him checked him in his impulse to use some other retort\r\nbut the tongue.  As soon as words came he snarled,--\r\n\r\n"Ho! is it that you mean, my beauty?  All right, we\'ll see who\'s master\r\nhere; and if I am, I\'m sorry for you."\r\n\r\nAnd he turned on his heel and went.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve done it now," said "Magog," in an agitated whisper--"done it\r\nclean."\r\n\r\n"Done what?" asked Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Done it with Durfy.  He will make it hot for you, and no mistake.\r\nNever mind, if the worst comes to the worst you can cut.  But hold on as\r\nlong as you can.  He\'ll make you go some time or another."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t make me go till I choose," replied Reginald.  "I\'ll stick here\r\nto disappoint him, if I do nothing else."\r\n\r\nThe reader may have made up his mind already that Reginald was a fool.\r\nI\'m afraid he was.  But do not judge him harshly yet, for his troubles\r\nare only beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nAN EXCITING END TO A DULL DAY.\r\n\r\nHorace meanwhile had wended his way with some trepidation and curiosity\r\nto the manager\'s sanctum.  He felt uncomfortable in being separated from\r\nReginald at all, especially when the latter was left single-handed in\r\nsuch an uncongenial atmosphere as that breathed by Mr Durfy and Barber.\r\nHe could only hope for the best, and, meanwhile, what fate was in store\r\nfor himself?\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the manager\'s door doubtfully and obeyed the summons to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nBrusque man as the manager was, there was nothing disagreeable about his\r\nface as he looked up and said, "Oh--you\'re the youngster Mr Richmond\r\nput in here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, my brother and I are."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I hear you\'re both fools.  Is that the case?"\r\n\r\n"Reginald isn\'t, whatever I am," said Horace, boldly.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he?  I\'m told he\'s the bigger fool of the two.  Never mind that,\r\nthough--"\r\n\r\n"I assure you," began Horace, but the manager stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes.  I know all about that.  Now, listen to me.  I dare say\r\nyou\'re both well-meaning boys, and Mr Richmond is interested in you.\r\nSo I\'ve promised to make room for you here, though it\'s not convenient,\r\nand the wages you are to get are out of all proportion to your value--so\r\nfar."\r\n\r\nHorace was glad at least that the manager dropped in those last two\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n"If your brother is clever and picks up his work soon and doesn\'t give\r\nhimself airs he\'ll get on faster than you.  I can\'t put you at case, but\r\nthey want a lad in the sub-editor\'s room.  Do you know where that is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Horace, "I took some proofs there yesterday.  But,\r\nsir--"\r\n\r\n"Well, what?" said the manager, sharply.\r\n\r\n"Is there no possibility of Reginald and me being together?" faltered\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes--outside if you\'re discontented," said the manager.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently no use, and Horace walked dismally to the door.\r\n\r\nThe manager looked after him.\r\n\r\n"Take my advice," said he, rather more kindly than he had hitherto\r\nspoken; "make the best of what you\'ve got, young fellow, and it\'ll be\r\nbetter still in time.  Shut the door after you."\r\n\r\nThe sub-editor\'s room--or rooms, for there was an inner and an outer\r\nsanctum--was in a remote dark corner of the building, so dark that gas\r\nwas generally burning in it all day long, giving its occupants generally\r\nthe washed-out pallid appearance of men who do not know when day ends or\r\nnight begins.  The chief sub-editor was a young, bald-headed, spectacled\r\nman of meek appearance, who received Horace in a resigned way, and\r\nreferred him to the clerks in the outer room, who would show him how he\r\ncould make himself useful.\r\n\r\nFeeling that, so far as he was concerned, he had fallen on his feet, and\r\nsecretly wishing poor Reginald was in his shoes, Horace obeyed and\r\nretired to the outer room.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of that apartment were two young gentlemen of from\r\neighteen to twenty years of age, who, it was evident at a glance, were\r\nnot brothers.  One was short and fair and chubby, the other was lank and\r\nlean and cadaverous; one was sorrowful and lugubrious in countenance;\r\nthe other seemed to be spending his time in trying hard not to smile,\r\nand not succeeding.  The only thing they did appear to share in common\r\nwas hard work, and in this they were so fully engrossed that Horace had\r\nto stand a full minute at the table before they had leisure to look up\r\nand notice him.\r\n\r\n"The gentleman in there," said Horace, addressing the lugubrious youth\r\nas being the more imposing of the two, "said if I came to you you could\r\nset me to work."\r\n\r\nThe sad one gave a sort of groan and said,--\r\n\r\n"Ah, he was right there.  It _is_ work."\r\n\r\n"I say," said the other youth, looking up, "don\'t frighten the kid,\r\nBooms; you\'ll make him run away."\r\n\r\n"I wish _I_ could run away," said Booms, in an audible soliloquy.\r\n\r\n"So you can if you like, you old crocodile.  I say, young \'un, have you\r\ngot a chair?"\r\n\r\nHorace had to confess he had not a chair about him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a go; we\'ve only two here.  We shall have to take turns on them.\r\nBooms will stand first, won\'t you, Booms?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course," said Booms, rising and pushing his chair towards\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Horace, "but I\'d sooner stand, really."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Booms, resignedly; "I\'m to stand, Waterford says so."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, young \'un," said Waterford, "and don\'t mind him.  He won\'t\r\nsay so, but he\'s awfully glad to stand up for a bit and stretch his\r\nlegs.  Now, do you see this lot of morning papers--you\'ll see a lot of\r\nparagraphs marked at the side with a blue pencil.  You\'ve got to cut\r\nthem out.  Mind you don\'t miss any.  Sure you understand?"\r\n\r\nHorace expressed himself equal to this enormous task, and set to work\r\nbusily with his scissors.\r\n\r\nIf he had had no one but himself to consider he would have felt\r\ncomparatively happy.  He found himself in a department of work which he\r\nliked, and which, though at first not very exciting, promised some day\r\nto become interesting.  His chief was a gentleman not likely to\r\ninterfere with him as long as he did his work steadily, and his\r\ncompanions were not only friendly but entertaining.  If only Reginald\r\ncould have a seat at this table too, Horace felt he could face the\r\nfuture cheerily.  How, he wondered, was the poor fellow getting on that\r\nmoment in his distant uncongenial work?\r\n\r\n"You\'re not obliged to read all the paragraphs, you know," said\r\nWaterford, as Horace\'s hand slackened amid these musings.  "It\'s a close\r\nshave to get done as it is, and he\'s marked a frightful lot this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nHe was right.  All the cuttings had to be taken out and pasted on sheets\r\nbefore twelve o\'clock, and it took the three of them, hard at work with\r\nscissors and paste, to get the task accomplished.  They talked very\r\nlittle, and joked still less; but when it was all done, like three\r\nhonest men, they felt pleased with themselves, and decidedly amiable\r\ntowards one another.\r\n\r\n"Now Booms is going out for the grub, aren\'t you, Booms?  He\'ll get some\r\nfor you too, young \'un, if you like."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; I\'d be very glad, but I promised to have dinner with my\r\nbrother--he\'s a compositor here."\r\n\r\n"Lucky man!" groaned Booms.  "Think of having nothing to do but pick up\r\ntypes instead of slaving like this every day!"\r\n\r\n"See the sausages are hot this time, won\'t you, Booms?  And look alive,\r\nthere\'s a dear fellow."\r\n\r\nBooms retired sadly.\r\n\r\n"Good-natured chap, Booms," said Waterford; "rather a risk of imposing\r\non him if one isn\'t careful.  He\'s an awfully decent fellow, but it\'s a\r\nsad pity he\'s such a masher."\r\n\r\n"A what?" asked Horace.\r\n\r\n"A masher.  He mayn\'t look it, but he goes it rather strong in that line\r\nafter hours.  He doesn\'t mean it, poor soul; but he\'s mixed up with some\r\nof our reporters, and tries to go the pace with them.  I don\'t care for\r\nthat sort of thing myself, but if you do, he\'s just your man.  You\r\nwouldn\'t think it to look at him, would you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," replied Horace, much impressed by this confidence and\r\nthe revelation it afforded.\r\n\r\nAs Booms re-entered shortly afterwards, looking very gloomy, burdened\r\nwith two plates, two mugs, and a sheaf of knives and forks under his\r\narm, he certainly did not give one the impression of a very rakish\r\ncharacter, and Horace could scarcely refrain from smiling as he tried to\r\npicture him in his after-hours character.\r\n\r\nHe left the couple to their sausages, and went out, in the vain hope of\r\nfinding Reginald somewhere.  But there was no sign of workmen anywhere,\r\nand, to his disgust, he ascertained from a passing boy that the\r\ncompositors\' dinner-hour did not begin till he was due back at his work.\r\nEverything seemed to conspire to sever the two brothers, and Horace\r\ndejectedly took a solitary and frugal repast.  He determined, at all\r\nhazards, to wait a minute after the bell summoning him back to work had\r\nceased pealing, and was rewarded by a hasty glimpse of his brother, and\r\nthe exchange of a few hurried sentences.  It was better than nothing,\r\nand he rushed back to his room just in time to save his reputation for\r\npunctuality.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon passed scarcely less busily than the morning.  They sat--\r\nand Booms had contrived to raise a third chair somewhere--with a pile of\r\nwork in front of them which at first seemed hopeless to expect to\r\novertake.\r\n\r\nThere were effusions to "decline with thanks," and others to enter in a\r\nbook and send up to the composing-room; there were some letters to write\r\nand others to answer; there were reporters\' notes to string together and\r\ntelegrams to transcribe.  And all the while a dropping fire of proofs\r\nand revises and messages was kept up at them from without, which they\r\nhad to carry to their chief and deal with according to his orders.\r\n\r\nHorace, being inexperienced, was only able to take up the simpler\r\nportions of this miscellaneous work, but these kept him busy, "hammer\r\nand tongs," with scarcely time to sneeze till well on in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe _Rocket_, unlike most evening papers, waited till the evening before\r\nit appeared, and did not go to press till five o\'clock.  After that it\r\nissued later editions once an hour till eight o\'clock, and on special\r\noccasions even as late as ten.\r\n\r\nThe great rush of the day, therefore, as Horace soon discovered, was\r\nover at five o\'clock, but between that hour and seven there was always\r\nplenty to do in connection with the late editions and the following\r\nday\'s work.  At seven o\'clock every one left except a sub-editor and one\r\nof the clerks, and one or two compositors, to see after the eight\r\no\'clock and any possible later edition.\r\n\r\n"As soon as you get your hand in, young \'un, you\'ll have to take your\r\nturn at late work.  Booms and I take every other night now."\r\n\r\nHorace could say nothing against this arrangement, though it meant more\r\nseparation from Reginald.  At present, however, his hand not being in,\r\nhe had nothing to keep him after the seven o\'clock bell, and he eagerly\r\nescaped at its first sound to look for Reginald.\r\n\r\nNot, however, till he had witnessed a strange sight.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter to seven Booms, whose early evening it was, showed signs\r\nof uneasiness.  He glanced sorrowfully once or twice at the clock, then\r\nat Horace, then at Waterford.  Then he got up and put his papers away.\r\nFinally he mused on a washhand basin in a corner of the room, and said\r\ndolefully,--\r\n\r\n"I must dress, I think, Waterford."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Waterford, briskly, "the young \'un and I will finish\r\nup here."  Then nudging Horace, he added in a whisper, "He\'s going to\r\nrig up now.  Don\'t pretend to notice him, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nBooms proceeded to divest himself of his office coat and waistcoat and\r\ncollar, and to roll up the sleeves of his flannel shirt, preparatory to\r\nan energetic wash.  He then opened a small box in a corner of the room,\r\nfrom which he produced, first a clothes-brush, with which he carefully\r\nremoved all traces of dust from his nether garments; after that came a\r\npair of light-coloured "pats," which he fitted on to his boots; then\r\ncame a bottle of hair-oil, and afterwards a highly-starched "dicky," or\r\nshirt-front, with a stud in it, which by a complicated series of strings\r\nthe owner contrived to fasten round his neck so as to conceal\r\neffectually the flannel shirt-front underneath.  Once more he dived, and\r\nthis time the magic box yielded up what seemed to Horace\'s uninitiated\r\neyes to be a broad strip of stiff cardboard, but which turned out to be\r\na collar of fearful and wonderful proportions, which, when once\r\nadjusted, fully explained the wisdom displayed by the wearer in not\r\ndeferring the brushing of his trousers and the donning of his "pats" to\r\na later stage of the proceedings.  For nothing, not even a pickpocket at\r\nhis gilt watch-chain with its pendant "charms," could lower his chin a\r\nquarter of an inch till bed-time.  But more was yet to come.  There were\r\ncuffs to put on, which left one to guess what had become of Mr Booms\'s\r\nknuckles, and a light jaunty necktie to embellish the "dicky."  Then,\r\nwith a plaintive sigh, he produced a blue figured waistcoat, and after\r\nit a coat shaped like the coat of a robin to cover all.  Finally there\r\nappeared a hat, broad-brimmed, low-crowned, and dazzling in its\r\nglossiness, a pair of gay dogskin gloves, a crutch walking-stick, a pink\r\nsilk handkerchief, and then this joint work of art and nature was\r\ncomplete!\r\n\r\n"All right?" said he, in melancholy tones, as he set his hat a little on\r\none side of his head, and, with his stick under his arm, began with his\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\nWaterford got up and walked slowly and critically round him, giving a\r\nfew touches here and there, and brushing a little stray dust from his\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n"All right, dear boy.  Mind how you go, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" groaned Booms, in tones of dire distress, "I knew I should forget\r\nsomething.  Would you mind, Waterford?"\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"My glass--it\'s in the box, and--and I should have got it out before I\r\nput the collar on.  Thanks; I should have been lost without it.  Oh! if\r\nI _had_ forgotten it!"\r\n\r\nWith this awful reflection in his mind he bade a sorrowful good-night\r\nand walked off, with his head very erect, his elbows high up, and one\r\nhand fondling the nearly-neglected eyeglass.\r\n\r\n"Pretty, isn\'t it?" said Waterford, as he disappeared.\r\n\r\n"It is--rot," said Horace, emphatically.  "Why ever don\'t you laugh him\r\nout of it?"\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, you might as well try to laugh the hair off his head.\r\nI\'ve tried it a dozen times.  After all, the poor dear fellow means no\r\nharm."\r\n\r\n"But what does he do now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t ask me.  According to his own account he\'s the fastest man\r\nabout town--goes to all the shows, hobnobs with all the swells, smokes\r\nfurious cigars, and generally `mashes.\'  But my private notion is he\r\nmoons about the streets with the handle of his stick in his mouth and\r\nlooks in a few shop windows, and gets half a dozen oysters for supper,\r\nand then goes home to bed.  You see he couldn\'t well get into much\r\nmischief with that collar on.  If he went in for turn-downs I\'d be\r\nafraid of him."\r\n\r\nThe bell cut further conversation short, and in another minute Horace\r\nand Reginald were walking arm-in-arm in the street outside.\r\n\r\nThere was much to talk about, much to lament over, and a little to\r\nrejoice over.  Horace felt half guilty as he told his brother of his\r\ngood fortune, and the easy quarters into which he had fallen.  But\r\nReginald was in too defiant a mood to share these regrets as much as he\r\nwould have done at any other time.  As long as Durfy wanted to get rid\r\nof him, so long was he determined to stay where he was, and meanwhile in\r\nyoung Gedge he had some one to look after, which would make the drudgery\r\nof his daily work tolerable.\r\n\r\nHorace did not altogether like it, but he knew it was no use arguing\r\nthen on the subject.  They mutually agreed to put the best face on\r\neverything before their mother.  She was there to meet them at the door,\r\nand it rejoiced her heart to hear their brave talk and the cheery story\r\nof their day\'s adventures.  All day long her heart had gone out to them\r\nin yearnings of prayer and hope and love, and it repaid her a hundred-\r\nfold, this hour of happy meeting, with the sunlight of their faces and\r\nthe music of their voices filling her soul.\r\n\r\nAs soon as supper was over Reginald suggested a precipitate retreat into\r\nthe streets, for fear of another neighbourly incursion.  Mrs Cruden\r\nlaughingly yielded, and the trio had a long walk, heedless where they\r\nwent, so long as they were together.  They wandered as far as Oxford\r\nStreet, looking into what shops were open, and interested still more in\r\nthe ever-changing stream of people who even at ten o\'clock at night\r\ncrowded the pavements.  They met no one they knew, not even Booms.  But\r\nit mattered little to them that no one noticed them.  They had one\r\nanother, and there was a sense of security and comfort in that which\r\nbefore these last few weeks they had never dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThey were about to turn out of Oxford Street on their homeward journey\r\nwhen a loud shout close by arrested their attention.  Looking round,\r\nthey saw a boy with disordered dress and unsteady gait attempting to\r\ncross the road just as a hansom cab was bearing down at full speed on\r\nthe place where he stood.  They only saw his back, but it was evident he\r\nwas either ill or dazed, for he stood stupidly where he was, with the\r\nperil in full-view, but somehow helpless to avoid it.  The cabman\r\nshouted and pulled at his horse\'s head.  But to the horrified onlookers\r\nit was only too clear that nothing could stop his career in time.  He\r\nwas already within a yard or two of the luckless boy when Reginald made\r\na sudden dash into the road, charging at him with a violence that sent\r\nhim staggering forward two paces and then brought him to the earth.\r\nReginald fell too, on the top of him, and as the cab dashed past it just\r\ngrazed the sole of his boot where he lay.\r\n\r\nIt was all the work of a moment--the shout, the vision of the boy, and\r\nthe rescue--so sudden, indeed, that Mrs Cruden had barely time to\r\nclutch Horace by the arm before Reginald lay prone in the middle of the\r\nroad.  In another moment Horace was beside his brother, helping him up\r\nout of the mud.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt, old man?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," said Reginald, very pale and breathless, but rising to his\r\nfeet without help.  "Look out--there\'s a crowd--take mother home, and\r\nI\'ll come on as soon as I\'ve seen this fellow safe.  I\'m not damaged a\r\nbit."\r\n\r\nWith this assurance Horace darted back to his mother in time to\r\nextricate her from the crowd which, whatever happens, is sure to collect\r\nin the streets of London at a minute\'s warning.\r\n\r\n"He\'s all right," said Horace--"not hurt a bit.  Come on, mother, out of\r\nthis; he\'ll probably catch us up before we\'re home.  I say," said he,\r\nand his voice trembled with excitement and brotherly pride as he spoke,\r\n"wasn\'t it splendid?"\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden would fain have stayed near, but the crowd made it\r\nimpossible to be of any use.  So she let Horace lead her home,\r\ntrembling, but with a heart full of thankfulness and pride and love for\r\nher young hero.\r\n\r\nReginald, meanwhile, with the coolness of an old football captain,\r\nproceeded to pick up his man, and appealed to the crowd to stand back\r\nand give the fellow room.\r\n\r\nThe boy lay half-stunned with his fall, his face covered with mud, but\r\nto Reginald\'s delight he was able to move and with a little help stand\r\non his feet.  As he did so the light from the lamp of the cab fell on\r\nhis face, and caused Reginald to utter an exclamation of surprise and\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n"Young Gedge!"\r\n\r\nThe boy looked at him for a moment in a stupid bewildered way, and then\r\ngave a short startled cry.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt?" said Reginald, putting his arm round him.\r\n\r\n"No--I--I don\'t think--let\'s get away."\r\n\r\nReginald called to the crowd to stand back and let them out, an order\r\nwhich the crowd obeyed surlily and with a disappointed grunt.  Not even\r\na broken leg! not even the cabman\'s number taken down!  One or two who\r\nhad seen the accident patted Reginald on the back as he went by, but he\r\nhurried past them as quickly as he could, and presently stood in the\r\nseclusion of a by-street, still supporting his companion on his arm.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt?" he inquired again.\r\n\r\n"No," said Gedge; "I can walk."\r\n\r\nThe two stood facing one another for a moment in silence, breathless\r\nstill, and trembling with the excitement of the last few minutes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cruden!" cried the boy at last, seizing Reginald\'s arm, "what will\r\nyou think of me?  I was--I--I\'d been drinking--I\'m sober now, but--"\r\n\r\nReginald cut him short gently but firmly.\r\n\r\n"I know," said he.  "You\'d better go home now, young \'un."\r\n\r\nGedge made no answer, but walked on, with his arm still in that of his\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\nReginald saw him into an omnibus, and then returned sadly and\r\nthoughtfully homeward.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said he to himself, as he reached Dull Street, "I suppose I\r\nshall have to stick on at the _Rocket_ after all."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nMR. DURFY GIVES REGINALD A TESTIMONIAL.\r\n\r\nReginald Cruden was a young man who took life hard and seriously.  He\r\nwas not brilliant--indeed, he was not clever.  He lacked both the good\r\nsense and the good-humour which would have enabled him, like Horace, to\r\naccept and make the best of his present lot.  He felt aggrieved by the\r\nfamily calamity, and just enough ashamed of his poverty to make him\r\ntouchy and intractable to a degree which, as we have seen already,\r\namounted sometimes almost to stupidity.\r\n\r\nStill Reginald was honest.  He made no pretence of enjoying life when he\r\ndid not enjoy it.  He disliked Mr Durfy, and therefore he flared up if\r\nMr Durfy so much as looked at him.  He liked young Gedge, and therefore\r\nit was impossible to leave the youngster to his fate and let him ruin\r\nhimself without an effort at rescue.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to snatch a heedless one from under the hoofs of a cab-\r\nhorse and another to pick him up from the slippery path of vice and set\r\nhim firmly on his feet.  Reginald had thought nothing of the one, but he\r\nlooked forward with considerable trepidation to meeting the boy next\r\nmorning and attempting the other.\r\n\r\nGedge was there when he arrived, working very busily, and looking rather\r\ntroubled.  He flushed up as Reginald approached, and put down his\r\ncomposing-stick to shake hands with him.  Reginald looked and felt by a\r\nlong way the more uncomfortable and guilty of the two, and he was at\r\nleast thankful that Gedge spared him the trouble of beginning.\r\n\r\n"Oh!  Cruden," said the boy, "I know exactly what you\'re going to say.\r\nYou\'re going to tell me you\'re deceived in me, and that I\'m a young fool\r\nand going to the dogs as hard as I can.  I don\'t wonder you think so."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t going to say that," said Reginald.  "I was going to ask you\r\nhow you were."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m all right; but I know you\'re going to lecture me, Cruden, and\r\nI\'m sure you may.  There\'s nothing you can say I don\'t deserve.  I only\r\nwish I could make you believe I\'ll never be such a fool again.  I\'ve\r\nbeen making resolutions all night, and now you\'ve come here I\'m sure I\r\nshall be able to break it off.  If you will only stand by me, Cruden!  I\r\nowe you such a lot.  If you only knew how grateful I was!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we\'d better not talk about it now," said Reginald, feeling very\r\nuncomfortable and rather disconcerted at this glib flow of penitence.\r\n\r\nBut young Gedge was full of it yet, and went on,--\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to turn over a new leaf this very day, Cruden.  I\'ve told the\r\nerrand-boy he\'s not to get me any beer, and I\'m determined next time\r\nthat beast Durfy asks me to go--"\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Reginald; "was it with him you used to go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I know you\'ll think all the worse of me for it, after the\r\nblackguard way he\'s got on to you.  You see, before you came I didn\'t\r\nlike--that is, I couldn\'t well refuse him; he\'d have made it so hot for\r\nme here.  I fancy he found out I had some pocket-money of my own, for he\r\ngenerally picked on me to come and have drinks with him, and of course I\r\nhad to pay.  Why, only last night--look out, here he comes!"\r\n\r\nSure enough he was, and in his usual amiable frame of mind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there you are, are you?" he said to Reginald, with a sneer.  "Do\r\nyou know where the lower-case `x\' is now, eh?"\r\n\r\nReginald, swelling with the indignation Gedge\'s story had roused in him,\r\nturned his back and made no answer.\r\n\r\nNothing, as he might have known by this time, could have irritated Mr\r\nDurfy more.\r\n\r\n"Look here, young gentleman," said the latter, coming close up to\r\nReginald\'s side and hissing the words very disagreeably in his ear,\r\n"when I ask a question in this shop I expect to get an answer; mind\r\nthat.  And what\'s more, I\'ll have one, or you leave this place in five\r\nminutes.  Come, now, give me a lower-case `x.\'"\r\n\r\nReginald hesitated a moment.  Suppose Mr Durfy had it in him to be as\r\ngood as his word.  What then about young Gedge?\r\n\r\nHe picked up an "x" sullenly, and tossed it at the overseer\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not giving it to me," said the latter, with a sneer of triumph\r\nalready on his face.  "Pick it up directly, do you hear? and give it to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nReginald stood and glared first at Mr Durfy, then at the type.\r\n\r\nYesterday he would have defiantly told him to pick it up himself, caring\r\nlittle what the cost might be.  But things had changed since then.\r\nHumiliating as it was to own it, he could not afford to be turned off.\r\nHis pride could not afford it, his care for young Gedge could not afford\r\nit, the slender family purse could not afford it.  Why ever did he not\r\nthink of it all before, and spare himself this double indignity?\r\n\r\nWith a groan which represented as much inward misery and humiliation as\r\ncould well be compressed into a single action, he stooped down and\r\npicked up the type and handed it to Mr Durfy.\r\n\r\nIt was well for him he did not raise his eyes to see the smile with\r\nwhich that gentleman received it.\r\n\r\n"Next time it\'ll save you trouble to do what you\'re told at once, Mr\r\nPuppy," he said.  "Get on with your work, and don\'t let me catch you\r\nidling your time any more."\r\n\r\nAnd he walked off crowned with victory and as happy in his mind as if he\r\nhad just heard of the decease of his enemy the manager.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad beginning to the day for Reginald.  He had come to work\r\nthat morning in a virtuous frame of mind, determined, if possible, to do\r\nhis duty peaceably and to hold out a helping hand to young Gedge.  It\r\nwas hard enough now to think of anything but his own indignities and the\r\nwretch to whom he owed them.\r\n\r\nHe turned to his work almost viciously, and for an hour buried himself\r\nin it, without saying a word or lifting his eyes from his case.  Then\r\nyoung Gedge, stealing a nervous glance at his face, ventured to say,--\r\n\r\n"I say, Cruden, I wish I could stand things like you.  I don\'t know what\r\nI should have done if that blackguard had treated me like that."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?" said Reginald.  "He wants to get rid of me, and I\'m\r\nnot going to let him."\r\n\r\n"I\'m jolly glad of it for my sake.  I wish I could pay him out for you."\r\n\r\n"So you can."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Next time he wants you to go and drink, say No," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I will," said Gedge; "and I don\'t care how hot he makes it\r\nfor me, if you stick by me, Cruden."\r\n\r\n"You know I\'ll stick by you, young \'un," said Reginald; "but that won\'t\r\ndo you much good, unless you stick by yourself.  Suppose Durfy managed\r\nto get rid of me after all--"\r\n\r\n"Then I should go to--to the dogs," said Gedge, emphatically.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a greater fool than I took you for, then," said Reginald.  "If\r\nyou only knew," he added more gently, "what a job it is to do what\'s\r\nright myself, and how often I don\'t do it, you\'d see it\'s no use\r\nexpecting me to be good for you and myself both."\r\n\r\n"What on earth am I to do, then?  I\'m certain I can\'t keep square\r\nmyself; I never could.  Who\'s to look after me if you don\'t?"\r\n\r\nLike a brave man, Reginald, shy and reserved as he was, told him.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat what was said that morning over the type cases.  It\r\nwas not a sermon, nor a catechism; only a few stammering laboured words\r\nspoken by a boy who felt himself half a hypocrite as he said them, and\r\nwho yet, for the affection he bore his friend, had the courage to go\r\nthrough with a task which cost him twenty times the effort of rescuing\r\nthe boy yesterday from his bodily peril.\r\n\r\nLittle good, you will say, such a sermon from such a perverse, bad-\r\nhumoured preacher as Reginald Cruden, could do!  Very likely, reader;\r\nbut, after all, who are you or I to say so?  Had any one told Reginald a\r\nweek ago what would be taking place to-day, he would have coloured up\r\nindignantly and hoped he was not quite such a prig as all that.  As it\r\nwas, when it was all over, it was with no self-satisfied smile or inward\r\ngratulation that he returned to his work, but rather with the nervous\r\nuncomfortable misgivings of one who says to himself,--\r\n\r\n"After all I may have done more harm than good."\r\n\r\nBy the end of a fortnight Reginald, greatly to Mr Durfy\'s\r\ndissatisfaction, was an accomplished compositor.  He could set-up almost\r\nas quickly as Gedge, and his "proofs" showed far fewer corrections.\r\nMoreover, as he was punctual in his hours, and diligent at his work, it\r\nwas extremely difficult for the overseer or any one else to find any\r\npretext for abusing him.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Mr Barber, who had not yet given up the idea of asserting\r\nhis moral and intellectual superiority, continued by the ingenious\r\ndevice of "squabbling" his case, and tampering with the screw of his\r\ncomposing-stick, and other such pleasing jokes not unknown to printers,\r\nto disconcert the new beginner on one or two occasions.  But ever since\r\nReginald one morning, catching him in the act of mixing up his e\'s with\r\nhis a\'s, had carried him by the collar of his coat and the belt of his\r\nbreeches to the water tank and dipped his head therein three times with\r\nno interval for refreshment between, Mr Barber had moderated his\r\nattentions and become less exuberant in his humour.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Gedge, now his fast ally, Reginald\'s other fellow-\r\nworkmen concerned themselves very little with his proceedings.  One or\r\ntwo, indeed, noticing his proficiency, hinted to him that he was a fool\r\nto work for the wages he was getting, and some went so far as to say he\r\nhad no right to do so, and had better join the "chapel" to save trouble.\r\n\r\nWhat the "chapel" was Reginald did not trouble even to inquire, and\r\nreplied curtly that it was no business of any one else what his wages\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it?" said the deputation.  "What was to become of them if\r\nfellows did their work for half wages, they should like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Are you going off, or must I make you?" demanded Reginald, feeling he\r\nhad had enough of it.\r\n\r\nAnd the deputation, remembering Barber\'s head and the water tank,\r\nwithdrew, very much perplexed what to do to uphold the dignity of the\r\n"chapel."\r\n\r\nThey decided to keep their "eye" on him, and as they were able to do\r\nthis at a distance, Reginald had no objection at all to their decision.\r\n\r\nHe meanwhile was keeping his eye on Gedge and Mr Durfy, and about a\r\nfortnight after his arrival at the _Rocket_, a passage of arms occurred\r\nwhich, slight as it was, had a serious influence on the future of all\r\nthree parties concerned.\r\n\r\nThe seven o\'clock bell had rung, and this being one of Horace\'s late\r\nevenings, Reginald proposed to Gedge to stroll home with him and call\r\nand see Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\nThe boy accepted readily, and the two were starting off arm in arm when\r\nMr Durfy confronted them.  Reginald, who had never met his adversary\r\nbeyond the precincts of the _Rocket_ before, did not for a moment\r\nrecognise the vulgar, loudly dressed little man, sucking his big cigar\r\nand wearing his pot hat ostentatiously on one side; but when he did he\r\nturned contemptuously aside and said,--\r\n\r\n"Come on, young \'un."\r\n\r\n"Come on, young \'un!" echoed Mr Durfy, taking his cigar from his mouth\r\nand flicking the ashes in Reginald\'s direction, "that\'s just what I was\r\ngoing to say.  Young Gedge, you\'re coming with me to-night.  I\'ve got\r\norders for the Alhambra, my boy, and supper afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Gedge, rather uncomfortably, "it\'s very kind of you,\r\nMr Durfy, but I\'ve promised Cruden to go with him."\r\n\r\n"Promised Cruden!  What do you mean?  Cruden\'ll keep till to-morrow; the\r\norders won\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I can\'t," said Gedge.\r\n\r\n"Afraid!  I tell you I don\'t mean to stand here all night begging you.\r\nJust come along and no more nonsense.  We\'ll have a night of it."\r\n\r\n"You must excuse me," said the boy, torn between Reginald on the one\r\nhand and the fear of offending Durfy on the other.\r\n\r\nThe latter began to take in the position of affairs, and his temper\r\nevaporated accordingly.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t excuse you; that\'s all about it," he said; "let go that\r\nsnivelling lout\'s arm and do what you\'re told.  Let the boy alone, do\r\nyou hear?" added he, addressing Reginald, "and take yourself off.  Come\r\nalong, Gedge."\r\n\r\n"Gedge is not going with you," said Reginald, keeping the boy\'s arm in\r\nhis; "he\'s coming with me, aren\'t you, young \'un?"\r\n\r\nThe boy pressed his arm gratefully, but made no reply.\r\n\r\nThis was all Mr Durfy wanted to fill up the vials of his wrath.\r\n\r\n"You miserable young hound you," said he, with an oath; "let go the boy\r\nthis moment, or I\'ll turn you out of the place--and him too."\r\n\r\nReginald made no reply.  His face was pale, but he kept the boy\'s arm\r\nstill fast in his own.\r\n\r\n"Going with you, indeed?" shouted Mr Durfy; "going with you, is he? to\r\nlearn how to cant and sing psalms!  Not if I know it--or if he does, you\r\nand he and your brother and your old fool of a mother--"\r\n\r\nMr Durfy never got to the end of that sentence.  A blow straight from\r\nthe shoulder of the Wilderham captain sent him sprawling on the pavement\r\nbefore the word was well out of his mouth.\r\n\r\nIt had come now.  It had been bound to come sooner or later, and\r\nReginald, as he drew the boy\'s arm once more under his own, felt almost\r\na sense of relief as he stood and watched Mr Durfy slowly pick himself\r\nup and collect his scattered wardrobe.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the operation was complete, and even then Mr\r\nDurfy\'s powers of speech had not returned.  With a malignant scowl he\r\nstepped up to his enemy and hissed the one menace,--\r\n\r\n"All right!" and then walked away.\r\n\r\nReginald waited till he had disappeared round the corner, and then,\r\nturning to his companion, took a long breath and said,--\r\n\r\n"Come along, young \'un; it can\'t be helped."\r\n\r\nThe reader must forgive me if I ask him to leave the two lads to walk to\r\nDull Street by themselves, while he accompanies me in the wake of the\r\noutraged and mud-stained Mr Durfy.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was far more wounded in his mind than in his person.  He\r\nmay have been knocked down before in his life, but he had never, as far\r\nas he could recollect, been quite so summarily routed by a boy half his\r\nage earning only eighteen shillings a week!  And the conviction that\r\nsome people would think he had only got his deserts in what he had\r\nsuffered, pained him very much indeed.\r\n\r\nHe did not go to the Alhambra.  His clothes were too dirty, and his\r\nspirits were far too low.  He did, in the thriftiness of his soul,\r\nattempt to sell his orders in the crowd at the theatre door.  But no one\r\nrose to the bait, so he had to put them back in his pocket on the chance\r\nof being able to "doctor up" the date and crush in with them some other\r\nday.  Then he mooned listlessly up and down the streets for an hour till\r\nhis clothes were dry, and then turned into a public-house to get a brush\r\ndown and while away another hour.\r\n\r\nStill the vision of Reginald standing where he had last seen him with\r\nyoung Gedge at his side haunted him and spoiled his pleasure.  He\r\nwandered forth again, feeling quite lonely, and wishing some one or\r\nsomething would turn up to comfort him.  Nor was he disappointed.\r\n\r\n"The very chap," said a voice suddenly at his side when he was beginning\r\nto despair of any diversion.\r\n\r\n"So it is.  How are you, my man?  We were talking of you not two minutes\r\nago."\r\n\r\nDurfy pulled up and found himself confronted by two gentlemen, one about\r\nforty and the other a fashionable young man of twenty-five.\r\n\r\n"How are you, Mr Medlock?" said he to the elder in as familiar a tone\r\nas he could assume; "glad to see you, sir.  How are you, too, Mr\r\nShanklin, pretty well?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty fair," said Mr Shanklin.  "Come and have a drink, Durfy.  You\r\nlook all in the blues.  Gone in love, I suppose, eh? or been speculating\r\non the Stock Exchange?  You shouldn\'t, you know, a respectable man like\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"He looks as if he\'d been speculating in mud," said Mr Medlock,\r\npointing to the unfortunate overseer\'s collar and hat, which still bore\r\ntraces of his recent calamity.  "Never mind; we\'ll wash it off in the\r\nBodega.  Come along."\r\n\r\nDurfy felt rather shy at first in his grand company, especially with the\r\nconsciousness of his muddy collar.  But after about half an hour in the\r\nBodega he recovered his self-possession, and felt himself at home.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Mr Medlock, filling up his visitor\'s glass, "last\r\ntime we saw you you did us nicely over that tip for the Park Races, my\r\nboy!  If Alf and I hadn\'t been hedged close up, we should have lost a\r\npot of money."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry," said Durfy.  "You see, another telegram came after the\r\none I showed you, that I never saw; that\'s how it happened.  I really\r\ndid my best for you."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s a bad job, if we pay you to get hold of the _Rocket\'s_\r\ntelegrams and then lose our money over it," said Mr Medlock.  "Never\r\nmind this time, but you\'d better look a little sharper, my boy.  There\'s\r\nthe Brummagem Cup next week, you know, and we shall want to know the\r\nlatest scratches on the night before.  It\'ll be worth a fiver to you if\r\nyou work it well, Durfy.  Fill up your glass."\r\n\r\nMr Durfy obeyed, glad enough to turn the conversation from the\r\nmiscarriage of his last attempt to filch his employers\' telegrams for\r\nthe benefit of his betting friends\' and his own pocket.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Mr Shanklin, presently, "Moses and I have got a\r\nlittle Company on hand just now, Durfy.  What do you think of that?"\r\n\r\n"A company?" said Mr Durfy; "I\'ll wager it\'s not a limited one, if\r\nyou\'re at the bottom of it!  What\'s your little game now?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a little idea of Alf\'s," said Mr Medlock, whose Christian name\r\nwas Moses, "and it ought to come off too.  This is something the way of\r\nit.  Suppose you were a young greenhorn, Durfy--which I\'m afraid you\r\naren\'t--and saw an advertisement in the _Rocket_ saying you could make\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds a year easy without interfering with your\r\nbusiness, eh? what would you do?"\r\n\r\n"If I was a greenhorn," said Durfy, "I\'d answer the advertisement and\r\nenclose a stamped envelope for a reply."\r\n\r\n"To be sure you would!  And the reply would be, we\'d like to have a look\r\nat you, and if you looked as green as we took you for, we\'d ask for a\r\ndeposit, and then allow you to sell wines and cigars and that sort of\r\nfancy goods to your friends.  You\'d sell a dozen of port at sixty\r\nshillings, do you see? half the cash down and half on delivery.  We\'d\r\nsend your friend a dozen at twelve and six, and if he didn\'t shell out\r\nthe other thirty bob on delivery, we\'d still have the thirty bob he paid\r\ndown to cover our loss.  Do you twig?"\r\n\r\nDurfy laughed.  "Do you dream all these things," he said, "or how do you\r\never think of them?"\r\n\r\n"Genius, my boy; genius," said Mr Medlock.  "Of course," he added, "it\r\ncouldn\'t run for long, but we might give it a turn for a month or two."\r\n\r\n"The worst of it is," put in Mr Shanklin, "it\'s a ticklish sort of\r\nbusiness that some people are uncommon sharp at smelling out; one has to\r\nbe very careful.  There\'s the advertisement, for instance.  You\'ll have\r\nto smuggle it into the _Rocket_, my boy.  It wouldn\'t do for the\r\ngovernors to see it; they\'d be up to it.  But they\'d never see it after\r\nit was in, and the _Rocket\'s_ just the paper for us."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try and manage that," said Durfy.  "You give it me, and I\'ll stick\r\nit in with a batch of others somehow."\r\n\r\n"Alf thinks we\'d better do the thing from Liverpool," continued Mr\r\nMedlock, "and all we want is a good secretary--a nice, green, innocent,\r\nstupid, honest young fellow--that\'s what we want.  If we could pick up\r\none of that sort, there\'s no doubt of the thing working."\r\n\r\nMr Durfy started and coloured up, and then looked first at Mr Medlock\r\nand then at Mr Shanklin.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?  Do you think _you\'d_ suit the place?" asked the\r\nformer, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"No; but I know who will!"\r\n\r\n"You do!  Who?"\r\n\r\n"A young puppy under me at the _Rocket_?" said Durfy, excitedly; "the\r\nvery man to a T!"  And he thereupon launched into a description of\r\nReginald\'s character in a way which showed that not only was he a shrewd\r\nobserver of human nature in his way, but, when it served his purpose,\r\ncould see the good even in a man he hated.\r\n\r\n"I tell you," said he, "he\'s born for you, if you can only get him!  And\r\nif you don\'t think so after what I\'ve said, perhaps you\'ll believe me\r\nwhen I tell you, on the quiet, he knocked me down in the gutter this\r\nvery evening because I wanted to carry off a young convert of his to\r\nmake a night of it at the Alhambra.  There, what do you think of that?\r\nI wouldn\'t tell tales of myself like that for fun, I can tell you!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no mistake about that being the sort of chap we want," said Mr\r\nMedlock.\r\n\r\n"If only we can get hold of him," said Mr Shanklin.\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me," said Mr Durfy; "only if he comes to you never say a\r\nword about me, or he\'ll shy off."\r\n\r\nWhereupon these three guileless friends finished their glasses and\r\nseparated in great good spirits and mutual admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SHUCKLEFORD COMES OF AGE.\r\n\r\nReginald, meanwhile, blissfully unconscious of the arrangements which\r\nwere being made for him, spent as comfortable an evening as he could in\r\nthe conviction that to-morrow would witness his dismissal from the\r\n_Rocket_, and see him a waif on the great ocean of London life.  To his\r\nmother, and even to young Gedge, he said nothing of his misgivings, but\r\nto Horace, as the two lay awake that night, he made a clean breast of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll call me a fool, I suppose," he said; "but how could I help it?"\r\n\r\n"A fool!  Why, Reg, I know I should have done the same.  But for all\r\nthat, it _is_ unlucky."\r\n\r\n"It is.  Even eighteen shillings a week is better than nothing," said\r\nReginald, with a groan.  "Poor mother was saying only yesterday we were\r\njust paying for our keep, and nothing more.  What will she do now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll get into something, I\'m certain," said Horace; "and\r\nmeanwhile--"\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile I\'ll do anything rather than live on you and mother, Horrors;\r\nI\'ve made up my mind to that.  Why," continued he, "you wouldn\'t believe\r\nwhat a sneak I\'ve been already.  You know what Bland said about the\r\nfootball club in his letter?  No, I didn\'t show it to you.  He said it\r\nwould go down awfully well if I sent the fellows my usual subscription.\r\nI couldn\'t bear not to do it after that, and I--I sold my tennis-bat for\r\nfive shillings, and took another five shillings out of my last two\r\nweeks\' wages, and sent them half a sov. the other day."\r\n\r\nHorace gave an involuntary whistle of dismay, but added, quickly,--\r\n\r\n"I hope the fellows will be grateful for it, old man; they ought to be.\r\nNever mind, I\'m certain we shall pull through it some day.  We must hope\r\nfor the best, anyhow."\r\n\r\nAnd with a brotherly grip of the hand they turned over and went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nReginald presented himself at the _Rocket_ next morning in an unusual\r\nstate of trepidation.  He had half made up his mind to march straight to\r\nthe manager\'s room and tell him boldly what had happened, and take his\r\ndischarge from him.  But Horace dissuaded him.\r\n\r\n"After all," he said, "Durfy may think better of it."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I hardly know whether I want him to," said Reginald,\r\n"except for young Gedge\'s sake and mother\'s.  Anyhow, I\'ll wait and see,\r\nif you like."\r\n\r\nMr Durfy was there when he arrived, bearing no traces of last night\'s\r\n_fracas_, except a scowl and a sneer, which deepened as he caught sight\r\nof his adversary.  Reginald passed close to his table, in order to give\r\nhim an opportunity of coming to the point at once; but to his surprise\r\nthe overseer took no apparent notice of him, and allowed him to go to\r\nhis place and begin work as usual.\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner see him tearing his hair than grinning like that," said\r\nyoung Gedge, in a whisper.  "You may be sure there\'s something in the\r\nwind."\r\n\r\nWhatever it was, Mr Durfy kept his own counsel, and though Reginald\r\nlooked up now and then and caught him scowling viciously in his\r\ndirection, he made no attempt at hostilities, and rather appeared to\r\nignore him altogether.\r\n\r\nEven when he was giving out the "copy" he sent Reginald his by a boy,\r\ninstead of, as was usually his practice, calling him up to the table to\r\nreceive it.  Reginald\'s copy on this occasion consisted of a number of\r\nadvertisements, a class of work not nearly as easy and far less\r\ninteresting than the paragraphs of news which generally fell to his\r\nshare.  However, he attacked them boldly, and, unattractive as they\r\nwere, contrived to get some occupation from them for his mind as well as\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nHere, for instance, was some one who wanted "a groom, young, good-\r\nlooking, and used to horses."  How would that suit him?  And why need he\r\nbe good-looking?  And what was the use of saying he must be used to\r\nhorses?  Who ever heard of a groom that wasn\'t?  The man who put in that\r\nadvertisement was a muff.  Here was another of a different sort:\r\n\r\n"J.S.  Come back to your afflicted mother and all shall be forgiven."\r\n\r\nHeigho! suppose "J.S." had got a mother like Mrs Cruden, what a brute\r\nhe must be to cut away.  What had he been doing to her? robbing her? or\r\nbullying her? or what?  Reginald worked himself into a state of wrath\r\nover the prodigal, and very nearly persuaded himself to leave out the\r\npromise of forgiveness altogether.\r\n\r\n"If the young gentleman who dropped an envelope in the Putney omnibus on\r\nthe evening of the 6th instant will apply to B, at 16, Grip Street, he\r\nmay hear of something to his advantage."\r\n\r\nHow some people were born to luck!  Think of making your fortune by\r\ndropping an envelope in a Putney omnibus.  How gladly he would pave the\r\nfloor of every omnibus he rode in with envelopes if only he could\r\nthereby hear anything to his advantage!  He had a great mind to stroll\r\nround by Number 16, Grip Street that evening to see who this mysterious\r\n"B" could be.\r\n\r\n"To intelligent young men in business.--Add L50 a year to your income\r\nwithout any risk or hindrance whatever to ordinary work.--Apply\r\nconfidentially to Omega, 13, Shy Street, Liverpool, with stamp for\r\nreply.  None but respectable intelligent young men need apply."\r\n\r\nHullo!  Reginald laid down his composing-stick and read the\r\nadvertisement over again: and after that he read it again, word by word,\r\nmost carefully. L50 a year!  Why, that was as much again as his present\r\nincome, and without risk or interfering with his present work too!\r\nWell, his present work might be his past work to-morrow; but even so,\r\nwith L50 a year he would be no worse off, and of course he could get\r\nsomething else to do as well by way of ordinary work.  If only he could\r\nbring in L100 a year to the meagre family store!  What little luxuries\r\nmight it not procure for his mother!  What a difference it might make in\r\nthat dreary, poky Dull Street parlour, where she sat all day!  Or if\r\nthey decided not to spend it, but save it up, think of a pound a week\r\nready against a rainy day!  Reginald used to have loose enough ideas of\r\nthe value of money; but the last few weeks had taught him lessons, and\r\none of them was that a pound a week could work wonders.\r\n\r\n"Apply confidentially."  Yes, of course, or else any duffer might snatch\r\nat the prize.  It was considerate, too, to put it that way, for of\r\ncourse it would be awkward for any one in a situation to apply unless he\r\ncould do it confidentially--and quite right too to enclose a stamp for a\r\nreply.  No one who wasn\'t in earnest would do so, and thus it would keep\r\nout fellows who applied out of mere idle curiosity.  "None but\r\nrespectable intelligent young men need apply."  Humph!  Reginald\'s\r\nconscience told him he was respectable, and he hoped he was also\r\nmoderately intelligent, though opinions might differ on that point.\r\n"Omega"--that sounded well!  The man knew Greek--possibly he was a\r\nclassical scholar, and therefore sure to be a gentleman.  Oh, what a\r\ncontrast to the cad Durfy!  "Liverpool."  Ah, there was the one\r\ndrawback; and yet of course it did not follow the L50 a year was to be\r\nearned in Liverpool, otherwise how could it fail to interfere with\r\nordinary business?  Besides, why should he advertise in the _Rocket_\r\nunless he meant to get applications from Londoners?\r\n\r\nAltogether Reginald was pleased with the advertisement.  He liked the\r\nway it was put, and the conditions it imposed, and, indeed, was so much\r\ntaken up with the study of it that he almost forgot to set it up in\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n"Whatever are you dreaming about?" said young Gedge.  "You\'ve stood like\r\nthat for a quarter of an hour at least.  You\'ll have Durfy after you if\r\nyou don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nThe name startled Reginald into industry, and he set the advertisement\r\nup very clearly and carefully, and re-read it once or twice in the type\r\nbefore he could make up his mind to go on to the next.\r\n\r\nThe thought of it haunted him all day.  Should he tell Horace, or Gedge,\r\nor his mother of it?  Should he go and give Durfy notice then and there?\r\nNo, he would reply to it before he told any one; and then, if the\r\nanswer _was_ unsatisfactory--which he could not think possible--then no\r\none would be the wiser or the worse for it.\r\n\r\nThe day flew on leaden wings.  Gedge put his friend\'s silence down to\r\nanxiety as to the consequences of yesterday\'s adventure and did and said\r\nwhat he could to express his sympathy.  Mr Durfy alone, sitting at his\r\ntable, and directing sharp glances every now and then in his direction,\r\ncould guess the real meaning of his pre-occupation, and chuckled to\r\nhimself as he saw it.\r\n\r\nReginald spent threepence on his way home that evening--one in procuring\r\na copy of the _Rocket_, and two on a couple of postage-stamps.  Armed\r\nwith these he walked rapidly home with Horace, giving him in an absent\r\nsort of way a chronicle of the day\'s doings, but breathing not a word to\r\nhim or his mother subsequently about the advertisement.\r\n\r\nAfter supper he excused himself from joining in the usual walk by saying\r\nhe had a letter to write, and for the first time in his life felt\r\nrelieved to see his mother and brother go and leave him behind them.\r\n\r\nThen he pulled out the newspaper and eagerly read the advertisement once\r\nmore in print.  There it was, not a bit changed!  Lots of fellows had\r\nseen it by this time, and some of them very likely were at this moment\r\nanswering it.  They shouldn\'t get the start of him, though!\r\n\r\nHe sat down and wrote--\r\n\r\n"Sir,--Having seen your advertisement in the _Rocket_, I beg to apply\r\nfor particulars.  I am respectable and fairly intelligent, and am at\r\npresent employed as compositor in the _Rocket_ newspaper-office.  I\r\nshall be glad to increase my income.  I am 18 years of age, and beg to\r\nenclose stamp for a reply to this address.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"Reginald Cruden."\r\n\r\nHe was not altogether pleased with this letter, but it would have to do.\r\nIf he had had any idea what the advertiser wanted intelligent young men\r\nfor, he might have been able to state his qualifications better.  But\r\nwhat was the use of saying "I think I shall suit you," when possibly he\r\nmight not suit after all?\r\n\r\nHe addressed the letter carefully, and wrote "private and confidential"\r\non the envelope; and then walked out to post it, just in time, after\r\ndoing so, to meet his mother and Horace returning from their excursion.\r\n\r\n"Well, Reg, have you written your letter?" said his mother, cheerily.\r\n"Was it to some old schoolfellow?"\r\n\r\n"No, mother," said Reginald, in a tone which meant, "I would rather you\r\ndid not ask me."  And Mrs Cruden did not ask.\r\n\r\n"I think," said she, as they stopped at their door--"I almost think,\r\nboys, we ought to return the Shucklefords\' call.  It\'s only nine\r\no\'clock.  We might go in for a few minutes.  I know you don\'t care about\r\nit; but we must not be rude, you know.  What do you think, Reg?"\r\n\r\nReg sighed and groaned and said, "If we must we must"; and so, instead\r\nof going in at their own door, they knocked at the next.\r\n\r\nThe tinkle of a piano upstairs, and the sound of Sam\'s voice, audible\r\neven in the street, announced only too unmistakably that the family was\r\nat home, and a collection of pot hats and shawls in the hall betrayed\r\nthe appalling fact, when it was _too_ late to retreat, that the\r\nShucklefords had visitors!  Mrs Shuckleford came out and received them\r\nwith open arms.\r\n\r\n"\'Ow \'appy I am to see you and the boys," said she.  "I suppose you saw\r\nthe extra lights and came in.  Very neighbourly it was.  We thought\r\nabout sending you an invite, but didn\'t like while you was in black for\r\nyour \'usband.  But it\'s all the same now you\'re here.  Very \'appy to see\r\nyou.  Jemima, my dear, come and tell Mrs Cruden and the boys you\'re\r\n\'appy to see them; Sam too--it\'s Sam\'s majority, Mrs Cruden; twenty-one\r\nhe is to-day, and his pa all over--oh, \'ow \'appy I am you\'ve come."\r\n\r\n"We had no idea you had friends," said Mrs Cruden, nervously.  "We\'ll\r\ncall again, please."\r\n\r\n"No you don\'t, Mrs Cruden," said the effusive Mrs Shuckleford; "\'ere\r\nyou are, and \'ere you stays--I am so \'appy to see you.  You and I can\r\n\'ave a cosy chat in the corner while the young folk enjoy theirselves.\r\nJemima, put a chair for Mrs C. alongside o\' mine; and, Sam, take the\r\nboys and see they have some one to talk to \'em."\r\n\r\nThe dutiful Sam, who appeared entirely to share his mother\'s jubilation\r\nat the arrival of these new visitors, obeyed the order with alacrity.\r\n\r\n"Come on, young fellows," said he; "just in time for shouting proverbs.\r\nYou go and sit down by Miss Tomkins, Horace, her in the green frock; and\r\nyou had better go next Jemima, Cruden.  When I say `three and away\'\r\nyou\'ve got to shout.  Anything\'ll do, so long as you make a noise."\r\n\r\n"No, they must shout their right word," said Miss Tomkins, a vivacious-\r\nlooking young person of thirty.\r\n\r\n"Come close," said she to Horace, "and I\'ll whisper what you\'ve got to\r\nshout.  Whisper, `Dog,\' that\'s your word."\r\n\r\nHorace seated himself dreamily where he was told, and received the\r\nconfidential communication of his partner with pathetic resignation.  He\r\nonly wished the signal to shout might soon arrive.  As for Reginald,\r\nwhen he felt himself once more in the clutches of the captivating\r\nJemima, and heard her whisper in his ear the mysterious monosyllable\r\n"love," his heart became as ice within him, and he sat like a statue in\r\nhis chair, looking straight before him.  Oh, how he hoped "Omega" would\r\ngive him some occupation for his evenings that would save him from this\r\nsort of thing!\r\n\r\n"Now call them in," said Sam.\r\n\r\nA signal was accordingly given at the door, and in marched a young lady,\r\nreally a pleasant, sensible-looking young person, accompanied by a\r\nmagnificently-attired young gentleman, who, to Horace\'s amazement,\r\nproved to be no other than the melancholy Booms.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, no time just now for an exchange of greetings.\r\n\r\nMr Booms and his partner were placed standing in the middle of the\r\nfloor, and the rest of the company were seated in a crescent round them.\r\nThere was a pause, and you might have heard a pin drop as Samuel slowly\r\nlifted his hand and said in a stage whisper,--\r\n\r\n"Now then, mind what you\'re at.  When I say `away.\'  One, two, three,\r\nand a--"\r\n\r\nAt the last syllable there arose a sudden and terrific shout which sent\r\nMrs Cruden nearly into a fit, and made the loosely-hung windows rattle\r\nas if an infernal machine had just exploded on the premises.\r\n\r\nThe shout was immediately followed by a loud chorus of laughter, and\r\ncries of,--\r\n\r\n"Well, have you guessed it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know what it is," said the pleasant young lady.  "Do you know,\r\nMr Booms?"\r\n\r\n"No," he said, sadly; "how could I guess?  What is it, Miss Crisp?"\r\n\r\n"Why, `Love me, _love_ my dog,\' isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Right.  Well guessed!" cried every one; and amid the general\r\nfelicitation that ensued the successful proverb-guessers were made room\r\nfor in the magic circle, and Horace had a chance of exchanging "How d\'ye\r\ndo?" with Mr Booms.\r\n\r\n"Who\'d have thought of meeting you here?" said he, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t expect to meet you," said the melancholy one.  "I say, Cruden,\r\nplease don\'t mention--_her_."\r\n\r\n"Her?  Whom?" said Horace, bewildered.\r\n\r\nBooms\'s reply was a mournful inclination of the head in the direction of\r\nMiss Crisp.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see.  All right, old man.  You\'re a lucky fellow, I think.  She\r\nlooks a jolly sort of girl."\r\n\r\n"Lucky!  Jolly!  Oh, Cruden," ejaculated his depressed friend.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s wrong?" said Horace.  "Don\'t you think she\'s nice?"\r\n\r\n"She is; but Shuckleford, Cruden, is not."\r\n\r\n"Hullo, you two," said the voice of the gentleman in question at this\r\nmoment; "you seem jolly thick.  Oh, of course, shopmates; I forgot; both\r\nin the news line.  Eh?  Now, who\'s for musical chairs?  Don\'t all speak\r\nat once."\r\n\r\n"I shall have to play the piano now, Mr Reginald," said Miss Jemima,\r\nmaking a last effort to get a word out of her silent companion.  "I\'m\r\nafraid you\'re not enjoying yourself a bit."\r\n\r\nReginald rose instinctively as she did, and offered her his arm.  He was\r\nhalf dreaming as he did so, and fancying himself back at Garden Vale.\r\nIt was to his credit that when he discovered what he was doing he did\r\nnot withdraw his arm, but conducted his partner gallantly to the piano,\r\nand said,--\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m a bad hand at games."\r\n\r\n"Musical chairs is great fun," said Miss Jemima.  "I wish I could play\r\nit and the piano both.  You have to run round and round, and then, when\r\nthe music stops, you flop down on the nearest chair, and there\'s always\r\none left out, and the last one wins the game.  Do try it."\r\n\r\nReginald gave a scared glance at the chairs being arranged back to back\r\nin a long line down the room, and said,--\r\n\r\n"May I play the piano instead? and then you can join in the game."\r\n\r\n"What! do _you_ play the piano?" exclaimed the young lady, forgetting\r\nher dignity and clapping her hands.  "Oh, my eye, what a novelty!  Ma,\r\nMr Reginald\'s going to play for musical chairs!  Sam, do you hear?  Mr\r\nCruden plays the piano!  Isn\'t it fun?"\r\n\r\nReginald flung himself with a sigh down on the cracked music-stool.\r\nMusic was his one passion, and the last few months had been bitter to\r\nhim for want of it.  He would go out of his way even to hear a street\r\npiano, and the brightest moments of his Sundays were often those spent\r\nwithin sound of the roll of the organ.\r\n\r\nIt was like a snatch of the old life to find his fingers once more laid\r\ncaressingly on the notes of a piano; and as he touched them and began to\r\nplay, the Shucklefords, the _Rocket_, "Omega," all faded from his\r\nthoughts, and he was lost in his music.\r\n\r\nWhat a piano it was!  Tinny and cracked and out of tune.  The music was\r\nin the boy\'s soul, and it mattered comparatively little.  He began with\r\nWeber\'s "last waltz," and dreamed off from it into a gavotte of\r\nCorelli\'s, and from that into something else, calling up favourite after\r\nfavourite to suit the passing moods of his spirit, and feeling happier\r\nthan he had felt for months.\r\n\r\nBut Weber\'s "last waltz" and Corelli\'s gavottes are not the music one\r\nwould naturally select for musical chairs; and when the strains continue\r\nuninterrupted for five or ten-minutes, during the whole of which time\r\nthe company is perambulating round and round an array of empty chairs,\r\nthe effect is somewhat monotonous.  Mrs Shuckleford\'s guests trotted\r\nround good-humouredly for some time, then they got a little tired, then\r\na little impatient, and finally Samuel, as he passed close behind the\r\nmusic-stool, gave the performer a dig in the back, which had the desired\r\neffect of stopping the music suddenly.  Whereupon everybody flopped down\r\non the seat nearest within reach.  Some found vacancies at once, others\r\nhad to scamper frantically round in search of them, and finally, as the\r\nchairs were one fewer in number than the company, one luckless player\r\nwas left out to enjoy the fun of those who remained in.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Samuel, when the first round was decided, and a chair\r\nwithdrawn in anticipation of the next; "I only nudged you to stop a bit\r\nsooner, Cruden.  The game will last till midnight if you give us such\r\nlong doses."\r\n\r\nDoses!  Reginald turned again to the piano and tried once more to lose\r\nhimself in its comforting music.  He played a short German air of only\r\nfour lines, which ended in a plaintive, wailing cadence.  Again the\r\nmoment the music ceased he heard the scuffling and scampering and\r\nlaughter behind him, and shouts of,--\r\n\r\n"Polly\'s out!  Polly\'s out!"\r\n\r\n"I say," said Shuckleford, as they stood ready for the next round, "give\r\nus a jingle, Cruden; `Pop goes the Weasel,\' or something of that sort.\r\nThat last was like the tune the cow died of.  And stop short in the\r\nmiddle of a line, anyhow."\r\n\r\nReginald rose from the piano with flushed cheeks, and said,--"I\'m afraid\r\nI\'m not used to this sort of music.  Perhaps Miss Shuckleford--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Jim, you play.  You know the way.  You change places with Jim,\r\nCruden, and come and run round."\r\n\r\nBut Reginald declined the invitation with thanks, and took up a comic\r\npaper, in which he attempted to bury himself, while Miss Shuckleford\r\nhammered out the latest polka on the piano, stopping abruptly and\r\nfrequently enough to finish half a dozen rounds in the time it had taken\r\nhim to dispose of two.\r\n\r\nFresh games followed, and to all except the Crudens the evening passed\r\nmerrily and happily.  Even Horace felt the infection of the prevalent\r\ngood-humour, and threw off the reserve he had at first been tempted to\r\nwear in an effort to make himself generally agreeable.  Mrs Cruden,\r\ncooped up in a corner with her loquacious hostess, did her best too not\r\nto be a damper on the general festivity.  But Reginald made no effort to\r\nbe other than he felt himself.  He could not have done it if he had\r\ntried.  But as scarcely any one seemed afflicted on his account, even\r\nhis unsociability failed to make Samuel Shuckleford\'s majority party\r\nanything but a brilliant success.\r\n\r\nIn due time supper appeared to crown the evening\'s delights.  And after\r\nsupper a gentleman got up and proposed a toast, which of course was the\r\nhealth of the hero of the occasion.\r\n\r\nSamuel replied in a facetious County Court address, in which he\r\nexpressed himself "jolly pleased to see so many friends around him, and\r\nhoping they\'d all enjoyed their evening, and that if there were any of\r\nthem still to come of age--(laughter)--they\'d have as high an old time\r\nof it as he had had to-night.  He was sure ma and Jim said ditto to all\r\nhe said.  And before he sat down he was very glad to see their new next-\r\ndoor neighbours.  (Hear, hear.)  They\'d had their troubles, but they\r\ncould reckon on friends in that room.  The young fellows were bound to\r\nget on if they stuck to their shop, and he\'d like to drink the health of\r\nthem and their ma."  (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nThe health was drunk.  Mrs Cruden looked at Reginald, Horace looked at\r\nReginald, but Reginald looked straight before him and bit his lips and\r\nbreathed hard.  Whereupon Horace rose and said,--\r\n\r\n"We think it very kind of you to drink our healths; and I am sure we are\r\nmuch obliged to you all for doing so."\r\n\r\nWhich said, the Shucklefords\' party broke up, and the Crudens went home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\n"WILL YOU WALK INTO MY PARLOUR?"  SAID THE SPIDER TO THE FLY.\r\n\r\nThe two days which followed the despatch of the letter to "Omega" were\r\nlong and anxious ones for Reginald Cruden.  It would have been a great\r\nrelief to him had he felt free to talk the matter over with Horace; but\r\nsomehow that word "confidential" in the advertisement deterred him.  For\r\nall that, he made a point of leaving the paper containing it in his\r\nbrother\'s way, if by any chance the invitation to an additional L50 a\r\nyear might meet his eye.  Had it done so, it is doubtful whether\r\nReginald would have been pleased, for he knew that if it came to\r\nselecting one of the two, Horace would probably pass for quite as\r\nrespectable and considerably more intelligent a young man than himself.\r\nStill, he had no right to stand in his brother\'s way if fate ordained\r\nthat he too should be attracted by the advertisement.  He therefore left\r\nthe paper lying conspicuously about with the advertisement sheet turned\r\ntoward the beholder.\r\n\r\nHorace, however, had too much of the _Rocket_ in his business hours to\r\ncrave for a further perusal of it during his leisure.  He kicked it\r\nunceremoniously out of his way the first time he encountered it; and\r\nwhen Reginald saw it next it was in a mangled condition under the stairs\r\nin the suspicious company of the servant-girl\'s cinder-shovel.\r\n\r\nOn the second morning, when he arrived at his work, a letter lay on his\r\ncase with the Liverpool postmark, addressed R.  Cruden, Esquire,\r\n_Rocket_ Office, London.  In his excitement and haste to learn its\r\ncontents it never occurred to him to notice the unexpected compliment\r\nconveyed in the word "Esquire"; and he might have remained for ever in\r\nblissful ignorance of the fact, had not his left-hand neighbour, the\r\nsatirical Mr Barber, considered the occasion a good one for a few\r\nflashes of wit.\r\n\r\n"\'Ullo, Esquire, \'ow are you, Esquire?  There is somebody knows you,\r\nthen.  Liverpool, too!  That\'s where all the chaps who rob the till go\r\nto.  R.  Cruden, Esquire--my eye!  What\'s the use of putting any more\r\nthan `London\' on the envelope--such a well-known character as you?\r\nStuck-up idiot!"\r\n\r\nTo this address Reginald attended sufficiently to discover that it was\r\nnot worth listening to; after which he did not even hear the concluding\r\npassages of his neighbour\'s declamation, being absorbed in far more\r\ninteresting inquiries.  He tore the envelope open and hurriedly read--\r\n\r\n"Sir,--Your favour is to hand, and in reply we beg to say we shall be\r\nglad to arrange an interview.  One of our directors will be in town on\r\nMonday next, and can see you between one and two o\'clock at Weaver\'s\r\nHotel.  Be good enough to treat this and all further communications as\r\nstrictly confidential.--We are, Sir, yours faithfully,--\r\n\r\n"The Select Agency Corporation.\r\n\r\n"P.S.--Ask at Weaver\'s Hotel for Mr Medlock.\r\n\r\n"Liverpool."\r\n\r\nThe welcome contents of this short note fairly staggered him.  If the\r\ntone of the advertisement had been encouraging, that of this letter was\r\npositively convincing.  It was concise, business-like, grammatical and\r\ncourteous.  Since his trouble Reginald had never been addressed by any\r\none in the terms of respect conveyed in this communication.\r\nFurthermore, the appointment being between one and two--the dinner-\r\nhour--he would be able to keep it without difficulty or observation,\r\nparticularly as Weaver\'s Hotel was not a stone\'s throw from the _Rocket_\r\noffice.  Then again, the fact of his letter being from a "corporation"\r\ngratified and encouraged him.  A Select Agency Corporation was not the\r\nsort of company to do things meanly or inconsiderately.  They were\r\ndoubtless a select body of men themselves, and they required the\r\nservices of select servants; and it was perfectly reasonable that in an\r\naffair like this, which _might_ lead to nothing, strict mutual\r\nconfidence should be observed.  Supposing in the end he should see\r\nreason to decline to connect himself with the Corporation (Reginald\r\nliked to think this possible, though he felt sure it was not probable),\r\nwhy, if he had said much about it previously, it _might_ be to the\r\nprejudice of the Corporation!  Finally, he thought the name "Medlock"\r\nagreeable, and was generally highly gratified with the letter, and\r\nwished devoutly Monday would come round quickly.\r\n\r\nThe one drawback to his satisfaction was that he was still as far as\r\never from knowing in what direction his respectable and intelligent\r\nservices were likely to be required.  Monday came at last.  When he went\r\nup on the Saturday to receive his wages he had fully expected to learn\r\nMr Durfy\'s intentions with regard to him, and was duly surprised when\r\nthat gentleman actually handed him his money without a word, and with\r\nthe faintest suspicion of a smile.\r\n\r\n"He\'s got a nailer on you, old man, and no mistake," said Gedge,\r\ndolefully.  "I\'d advise you to keep your eye open for a new berth, if\r\nyou get the chance; and, I say, if you can only hear of one for two!"\r\n\r\nThis last appeal went to Reginald\'s heart, and he inwardly resolved, if\r\nMr Medlock turned out to be as amiable a man as he took him for, to put\r\nin a word on Gedge\'s behalf as well as his own at the coming interview.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell that Monday tolled solemnly in Reginald\'s ears as he put\r\non a clean collar and brushed his hair previously to embarking on his\r\njourney to Weaver\'s Hotel.  What change might not have taken place in\r\nhis lot before that same bell summoned him once more to work?  He left\r\nthe _Rocket_ a needy youth of L47 10 shillings a year.  Was he to return\r\nto it passing rich of L97 10 shillings?\r\n\r\nWeaver\'s Hotel was a respectable quiet resort for country visitors in\r\nLondon, and Reginald, as he stood in its homely entrance hall, felt\r\nsecretly glad that the Corporation selected a place like this for its\r\nLondon headquarters rather than one of the more showy but less\r\nrespectable hotels or restaurants with which the neighbourhood abounded.\r\n\r\nMr Medlock was in his room, the waiter said, and Mr Cruden was to step\r\nup.  He did step up, and was ushered into a little sitting-room, where a\r\nmiddle-aged gentleman stood before the fire-place reading the paper and\r\nsoftly humming to himself as he did so.\r\n\r\n"Mr Cruden, sir," said the waiter.\r\n\r\n"Ah!  Mr Cruden, good morning.  Take a seat.  John, I shall be ready\r\nfor lunch in about ten-minutes."\r\n\r\nReginald, with the agitating conviction that his fate would be sealed\r\none way or another in ten-minutes, obeyed, and darted a nervous glance\r\nat his new acquaintance.\r\n\r\nHe rather liked the looks of him.  He looked a comfortable, well-to-do\r\ngentleman, with rather a handsome face, and a manner by no means\r\ndisheartening.  Mr Medlock in turn indulged in a careful survey of the\r\nboy as he sat shyly before him trying to look self-possessed, but not\r\nman of the world enough to conceal his anxiety or excitement.\r\n\r\n"Let me see," said Mr Medlock, putting his hands in his pocket and\r\nleaning against the mantel-piece, "you replied to the advertisement,\r\ndidn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"And what made you think you would suit us?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," stammered Reginald, "you wanted respectable intelligent\r\nyoung men--and--and I thought I--that is, I hoped I might answer that\r\ndescription."\r\n\r\nMr Medlock took one hand out of his pocket and stroked his chin.\r\n\r\n"Have you been in the printing trade long?"\r\n\r\n"Only a few weeks, sir."\r\n\r\n"What were you doing before that?"\r\n\r\nReginald flushed.\r\n\r\n"I was at school, sir--at Wilderham."\r\n\r\n"Wilderham?  Why, that\'s a school for gentlemen\'s sons."\r\n\r\n"My father was a gentleman, sir," said the boy, proudly.\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead then?" said Mr Medlock.  "That is sad.  But did he leave\r\nnothing behind him?"\r\n\r\n"He died suddenly, sir," said Reginald, speaking with an effort, "and\r\nleft scarcely anything."\r\n\r\n"Did he die in debt?  You must excuse these questions, Mr Cruden,"\r\nadded the gentleman, with an amiable smile; "it is necessary to ask them\r\nor I would spare you the trouble."\r\n\r\n"He did die in debt," said Reginald, "but we were able to pay off every\r\npenny he owed."\r\n\r\n"And left nothing for yourself when it was done?  Very honourable, my\r\nlad; it will always be a satisfaction to you."\r\n\r\n"It is, sir," said Reginald, cheering up.\r\n\r\n"You naturally would be glad to improve your income.  How much do you\r\nget where you are?"\r\n\r\n"Eighteen shillings a week."\r\n\r\nMr Medlock whistled softly.\r\n\r\n"Eighteen shillings; that\'s very little, very poor pay," said he.  "I\r\nshould have thought, with your education, you could have got more than\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nIt pleased Reginald to have his education recognised in this delicate\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"We had to be thankful for what we could get," said he; "there are so\r\nmany fellows out of work."\r\n\r\n"Very true, very true," said Mr Medlock, shaking his head impressively,\r\n"we had no less than 450 replies to our advertisement."\r\n\r\nReginald gave a gasp.  What chance had he among 450 competitors?\r\n\r\nMr Medlock took a turn or two up and down the room, meditating with\r\nhimself and keeping his eye all the time on the boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he, "450--a lot, isn\'t it?  Very sad to think of it."\r\n\r\n"Very sad," said Reginald, feeling called upon to say something.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Mr Medlock, coming to a halt in his walk in front of the\r\nboy, "I suppose you guess I wouldn\'t have asked you to call here if I\r\nand my fellow-directors hadn\'t been pleased with your letter."\r\n\r\nReginald looked pleased and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"And now I\'ve seen you and heard what you\'ve got to say, I think you\'re\r\nnot a bad young fellow; but--"\r\n\r\nMr Medlock paused, and Reginald\'s face changed to one of keen anxiety.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, Mr Cruden, you\'re not altogether the sort we want."\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s face fell sadly.\r\n\r\n"I would do my best," he said, as bravely as he could, "if you\'d try me.\r\nI don\'t know what the work is yet, but I\'m ready to do anything I can."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said Mr Medlock.  "What we advertise for is sharp agents, to\r\nsell goods on commission among their friends.  Now, do you think you\r\ncould sell L500 worth of wine and cigars and that sort of thing every\r\nyear among your friends?  You\'d need to do that to make L50 a year, you\r\nknow.  You understand?  Could you go round to your old neighbours and\r\ncrack up our goods, and book their orders and that sort of thing?  I\r\ndon\'t think you could, myself.  It strikes me you are too much of a\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\nReginald sat silent for a moment, with the colour coming and going in\r\nhis cheeks; then he looked up and said, slowly--\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I could not do that, sir--I didn\'t know you wanted that."\r\n\r\nSo saying he took up his hat and rose to go.\r\n\r\nMr Medlock watched him with a smile, if not of sympathy, at any rate of\r\napproval, and when he rose motioned him back to his seat.\r\n\r\n"Not so fast, my man; I like your spirit, and we may hit it yet."\r\n\r\nReginald resumed his seat with a new interest in his anxious face.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t suit us as a drummer--that is," said Mr Medlock, hastily\r\ncorrecting himself, "as a tout--an agent; but you might suit us in\r\nanother way.  We\'re looking out for a gentlemanly young fellow for\r\nsecretary--to superintend the concern for the directors, and be the\r\nmedium of communication between them and the agents.  We want an\r\neducated young man, and one we can depend upon.  As to the work, that\'s\r\npicked up in a week easily.  Now, suppose--suppose when I go back to\r\nLiverpool I were to recommend you for a post like that, what would you\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\nReginald was almost too overwhelmed for words; he could only stammer,--\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, how kind of you!"\r\n\r\n"The directors would appoint any one I recommended," continued Mr\r\nMedlock, looking down with satisfaction on the boy\'s eagerness; "you\'re\r\nyoung, of course, but you seem to be honest, that\'s the great thing."\r\n\r\n"I think I can promise that," said Reginald, proudly.\r\n\r\n"The salary would begin at L150 a year, but we should improve it if you\r\nturned out well.  And you would, of course, occupy the Company\'s house\r\nat Liverpool.  We should not ask for a premium in your case, but you\r\nwould have to put L50 into the shares of the Corporation to qualify you,\r\nand of course you would get interest on that.  Now," said he, as\r\nReginald began to speak, "don\'t be in a hurry.  Take your time and think\r\nit well over.  If you say `Yes,\' you may consider the thing settled, and\r\nif you say `No\'--well, we shall be able to find some one else.  Ah, here\r\ncomes lunch--stop and have some with me--bring another plate, waiter."\r\n\r\nReginald felt too bewildered to know what to think or say.  He a\r\nsecretary of a company with L150 a year!  It was nearly intoxicating.\r\nAnd for the post spontaneously offered to him in the almost flattering\r\nway it had been--this was more gratifying still.  In his wildest dreams\r\njust now he never pictured himself sitting down as secretary to the\r\nSelect Agency Corporation to lunch with one of its leading directors!\r\n\r\nMr Medlock said no more about "business", but made himself generally\r\nagreeable, asking Reginald about his father and the old days, inquiring\r\nas to his mother and brother, and all about his friends and\r\nacquaintances in London.\r\n\r\nReginald felt he could talk freely to this friend, and he did so.  He\r\nconfided to him all about Mr Durfy\'s tyranny, about his brother\'s work\r\nat the _Rocket_, and even went so far as to drop out a hint in young\r\nGedge\'s favour.  He told him all about Wilderham and his schoolfellows\r\nthere, about the books he liked, about the way he spent his evenings,\r\nabout Dull Street--in fact, he felt as if he had known Mr Medlock for\r\nyears and could talk to him accordingly.\r\n\r\n"I declare," said that gentleman, pulling out his watch, after this\r\npleasant talk had been going on a long time, "it\'s five minutes past\r\ntwo.  I\'m afraid you\'ll be late."\r\n\r\nReginald started up.\r\n\r\n"So I shall, I\'d no idea it was so late.  I\'m afraid I had better go,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"Well, write me a letter to Liverpool to-morrow, or Wednesday at the\r\nlatest, as we must fill up the place soon.  Think it well over.  Good-\r\nbye, my man.  I hope I shall see you again before long.  By the way, of\r\ncourse, you won\'t talk about all this out of doors."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Reginald, "I haven\'t even mentioned it yet at home."\r\n\r\nMr Medlock laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you come to Liverpool you\'ll have to tell them something about\r\nit.  See, here\'s a list of our directors, your mother may recognise some\r\nof the names.  But beyond your mother and brother don\'t talk about it\r\nyet, as the Corporation is only just starting."\r\n\r\nReginald heartily concurred in this caution, and promised to act on it,\r\nand then after a friendly farewell hastened back to the _Rocket_ office.\r\nThe clock pointed nearly a quarter past two when he entered.\r\n\r\nHe was not the sort of fellow to slink in when no one was looking.  In\r\nfact, he had such a detestation of that sort of thing that he went to\r\nthe other extreme, and marched ostentatiously past Mr Durfy\'s table, as\r\nthough to challenge his observation.\r\n\r\nIf that was his intention he was not disappointed.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the overseer, with a return of the old sneer, which had been\r\ndormant ever since the night Reginald had knocked him down.  "You _have_\r\ncome, have you?  And you know the hour, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s a quarter past two," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Is it?" sneered Mr Durfy, in his most offensive way.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is," replied the boy, hotly.\r\n\r\nWhat did he care for Durfy now?  To-morrow in all probability he would\r\nhave the satisfaction of walking up to that table and saying, "Mr\r\nDurfy, I leave here on Saturday," meanwhile he was not disposed to stand\r\nany of his insolence.\r\n\r\nBut he hardly expected what was coming next.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then you can just put your hat on your head and go back the\r\nway you came, sir."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Reginald, in startled tones.\r\n\r\n"Mean? what I say!" shouted Durfy.  "You\'re dismissed, kicked out, and\r\nthe sooner you go the better."\r\n\r\nSo this was the dignified leave-taking to which he had secretly looked\r\nforward!  Kicked out! and kicked out by Durfy!  Reginald\'s toes tingled\r\nat the very thought.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no right to dismiss me for being a few minutes late," said he.\r\n\r\nIt was Durfy\'s turn now to be dignified.  He went on writing, and did\r\nhis best to affect oblivion of his enemy\'s presence.\r\n\r\nReginald, too indignant to know the folly of such an outburst, broke\r\nout,--\r\n\r\n"I shall not take my dismissal from you.  I shall stay here as long as I\r\nchoose, and when I go I\'ll go of my own accord, you cad, you--"\r\n\r\nMr Durfy still went on writing with a cheerful smile on his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?" said Reginald, almost shouting the words.  "I\'m not going\r\nto please you.  I shall go to please myself.  I give _you_ notice, and\r\nthank Heaven I\'ve done with you."\r\n\r\nDurfy looked up with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Go and make that noise outside," he said.  "We can do without you here.\r\nGedge, my man, put those cases beside you back into the rack, and go\r\nand tell the porter he\'s wanted."\r\n\r\nThe mention of Gedge\'s name cowed Reginald in an instant, and in the\r\nsudden revulsion of feeling which ensued he was glad enough to escape\r\nfrom the room before fairly breaking down under a crushing sense of\r\ninjury, mortification, and helplessness.  Gedge was at the door as he\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cruden," he whispered, "what will become of me now?  Wait for me\r\noutside at seven o\'clock; please do."\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Reginald paced the streets more like a hunted beast than\r\na human being.  All the bad side of his nature--his pride, his conceit,\r\nhis selfishness--was stirred within him under a bitter sense of shame\r\nand indignity.  He forgot how much his own intractable temper and stupid\r\nself-importance had contributed to his fall, and could think of nothing\r\nbut Durfy\'s triumph and the evil fate which at the very moment, when he\r\nwas able to snap his fingers in the tyrant\'s face, had driven him forth\r\nin disgrace with the tyrant\'s fingers snapped in his face.  He had not\r\nspirit or resolution enough to wait to see Gedge or any one that\r\nevening, but slunk away, hating the sight of everybody, and wishing only\r\nhe could lose himself and forget that such a wretch as Reginald Cruden\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nAh!  Reginald.  It\'s a long race to escape from oneself.  Men have tried\r\nit before now with better reason than you, and failed.  Wait till you\r\nhave something worse to run from, my honest, foolish friend.  Face round\r\nlike a man, and stand up to your pursuer.  You have hit out straight\r\nfrom the shoulder before to-day.  Do it again now.  One smart round will\r\nfinish the business, for this false Reginald is a poor creature after\r\nall, and you can knock him out of time and over the ropes with one hand\r\nif you like.  Try it, and save your running powers for an uglier foeman\r\nsome other day!\r\n\r\nReginald did fight it out with himself as he walked mile after mile that\r\nafternoon through the London streets, and by the time he reached home in\r\nthe evening he was himself again.\r\n\r\nHe met his mother\'s tears and Horace\'s dismal looks with a smile of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve heard all about it, have you?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Reginald," said his mother, in deep distress, "how grieved I am for\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be, mother," said Reginald, "for I\'ve got another situation\r\nfar better and worth three times as much."\r\n\r\nAnd then he told them, as far as he felt justified in doing so, of the\r\nadvertisement and what it had led to, finishing up with a glowing\r\ndescription of Mr Medlock, whom he only regretted he had not had the\r\ncourage to ask up to tea that very evening.\r\n\r\nBut there was a cloud on the bright horizon which his mother and Horace\r\nwere quicker to observe than he.\r\n\r\n"But, Reg," said the latter, "surely it means you\'d have to go to\r\nLiverpool?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'m afraid it does.  That\'s the one drawback."\r\n\r\n"But surely you won\'t accept it, then?" said the younger brother.\r\n\r\nReginald looked up.  Horace\'s tone, if not imperious, had not been\r\nsympathetic, and it jarred on him in the fulness of his projects to\r\nencounter an obstacle.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" he replied.  "It\'s all very well for you, in your snug berth,\r\nbut I must get a living, mustn\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"I should have thought something might turn up in London," persisted\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\n"Things don\'t turn up as we want them," said Reginald, tartly.  "Look\r\nhere, Horace, you surely don\'t suppose I prefer to go to Liverpool to\r\nstaying here?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said Horace, beginning to whistle softly to himself.\r\nIt was a bad omen, and Mrs Cruden knew it.\r\n\r\n"Come," said she, cheerily, "we must make the best of it.  These names,\r\nReg, in the list of directors Mr Medlock gave you, seem all very\r\nrespectable."\r\n\r\n"Do you know any of them?" asked Reginald.  "Mr Medlock thought you\r\nmight."\r\n\r\n"I know one or two by name," replied she.  "There\'s the Bishop of S--, I\r\nsee, and Major Wakeman, who I suppose is the officer who has been doing\r\nso well in India.  There\'s a Member of Parliament, too, I see.  It seems\r\na good set of directors."\r\n\r\n"Of course they aren\'t likely all to turn up at board meetings," said\r\nReginald, with an explanatory air.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see myself what business a bishop has with a Select Agency\r\nCorporation," said Horace, determined not to see matters in a favourable\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said Reginald, trying hard to keep his temper, "I\r\ncan\'t help whether you see it or not.  By the way, mother, about the L50\r\nto invest.  I think Mr Richmond--"\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden started.\r\n\r\n"This exciting news," said she, "drove it out of my head for the moment.\r\nBoys, I am very sorry to say I had a note to-day stating that Mr\r\nRichmond was taken ill while in France, and is dead.  He was one of our\r\nfew old friends, and it is a very sad blow."\r\n\r\nShe was right.  The Crudens never stood in greater need of a wise friend\r\nthan they did now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nREGINALD TAKES HIS FATE INTO HIS OWN HANDS.\r\n\r\nThe next day Reginald wrote and accepted the invitation of the directors\r\nof the Select Agency Corporation.  He flattered himself he was acting\r\ndeliberately, and after fully weighing the pros and cons of the\r\nquestion.  True, he still knew very little about his new duties, and had\r\nyet to make the acquaintance of the Bishop of S-- and the other\r\ndirectors.  But, on the other hand, he had seen Mr Medlock, and heard\r\nwhat he had to say, and was quite satisfied in his own mind that\r\neverything was all right.  And, greatest argument of all, he had no\r\nother place to go to, and L150 a year was a salary not to be thrown away\r\nwhen put into one\'s hands.\r\n\r\nStill, he felt a trifle uncomfortable about the necessity of going to\r\nLiverpool and breaking up the old home.  Of course, he could not help\r\nhimself, and Horace had no right to insinuate otherwise.  All the same,\r\nit was a pity, and if there had not been the compensating certainty of\r\nbeing able to send up regular contributions to the family purse, which\r\nwould help his mother to not a few comforts hitherto denied, he would\r\nhave been more troubled still about it.\r\n\r\n"What will you do about the L50?" said Horace next day, forcing himself\r\nto appear interested in what he inwardly disapproved.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Reginald, "I\'d intended to ask Richmond to lend it me.  It\'s\r\nnot exactly a loan either; it would be the same as his investing in the\r\ncompany in my name.  The money would be safe, and he\'d get his interest\r\ninto the bargain.  But of course I can\'t go to him now."\r\n\r\n"No; and I don\'t know whom else you could ask," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"They might let me put in a pound a week out of my salary," said\r\nReginald.  "That would still leave me two pounds a week, and of that I\r\ncould send home at least twenty-five shillings."\r\n\r\nHorace mused.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me rather queer to expect you to put the money in," said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"It may be queer, but it\'s their rule, Mr Medlock says."\r\n\r\n"And whatever does the Corporation do?  It\'s precious hazy to my mind."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you anything about it now," said Reginald; "the concern is\r\nonly just started, and I have promised to treat all Mr Medlock told me\r\nas confidential.  But I\'m quite satisfied in my mind, and you may be\r\ntoo, Horace."\r\n\r\nHorace did not feel encouraged to pursue the discussion after this, and\r\nwent off alone to work in low spirits, and feeling unusually dismal.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Reginald, as he started, "bring young Gedge home with\r\nyou.  I meant to see him last night, but forgot."\r\n\r\nReginald spent the day uneasily for himself and his mother in trying to\r\nfeel absolutely satisfied with the decision he had come to, and in\r\nspeculating on his future work.  Towards afternoon, weary of being all\r\nday in the house, he went out for a stroll.  It was a beautiful day, and\r\nthe prospect of a walk in the park by daylight was a tempting one.\r\n\r\nAs he was passing down Piccadilly, he became aware of some one\r\napproaching him whom he knew, and whom, in another moment, he recognised\r\nas Blandford.\r\n\r\nThere was some excuse certainly for not taking in his old schoolfellow\'s\r\nidentity all at once, for the boy he had known at Wilderham only a few\r\nmonths ago had suddenly blossomed forth into a man, and had exchanged\r\nthe airy bearing of a school-boy for the half-languid swagger of a man\r\nabout town.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Bland, old man!" exclaimed Reginald, lighting up jubilantly at\r\nthe sight of an old familiar face, "how are you?  Who would have thought\r\nof seeing you?"\r\n\r\nBlandford was surprised too, and for a moment critically surveyed the\r\nboy in front of him before he replied.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Cruden, that you?  I shouldn\'t have known you."\r\n\r\nReginald\'s face fell.  He became suddenly aware, and for the first time\r\nin his life, that his clothes were shabby, and that his boots were in\r\nholes.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have known you," he replied; "you look so much older than\r\nwhen I saw you last."\r\n\r\n"So I am; but, I say," added Bland, reddening as an acquaintance passed\r\nand nodded to him, "I\'m rather in a hurry, Cruden, just now.  If you\'re\r\nnot engaged this evening, come and dine with me at seven at the Shades,\r\nand we can have a talk.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nAnd he went on hurriedly, leaving Reginald with an uncomfortable\r\nsuspicion that if he--Reginald--had been more smartly dressed, and had\r\nworn gloves and a tall hat, the interview would have been more cordial\r\nand less hasty.\r\n\r\nHowever, the longing he felt for the old happy days that were past\r\ndecided him to appear at the Shades at the hour appointed, although it\r\nmeant absence from home on one of his few remaining evenings, and, still\r\nmore, a further desertion of young Gedge.\r\n\r\nHe repented of his resolution almost as soon as he had made it.  What\r\nwas to be gained by assuming a false position for an evening, and trying\r\nto delude himself into the notion that he was the equal of his old\r\ncomrade?  Did not his clothes, his empty pockets, the smart of Durfy\'s\r\ntongue, and even the letter now on its way to Mr Medlock, all disprove\r\nit?  And yet, three months ago, he was a better man all round than\r\nBlandford, who had been glad to claim his friendship and accept his\r\nfather\'s hospitality.  Reginald rebelled against the idea that they two\r\ncould still be anything to one another than the friends they had once\r\nbeen; but all the while the old school saw came back into his mind--that\r\nimposition sentence he had in his day written out hundreds of times\r\nwithout once thinking of its meaning: _Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur\r\nin illis_.\r\n\r\nHe reached the Shades a few minutes before seven, and waited outside\r\ntill his friend arrived.  He had not to wait long, for Blandford and a\r\ncouple of companions drove up punctually in a hansom--all of them, to\r\nReginald\'s horror, being arrayed in full evening dress.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Cruden, you\'ve turned up then," said Blandford.  "What, not in\r\nregimentals?  You usen\'t to be backward in that way.  Never mind; they\r\nsay dress after seven o\'clock here, but they\'re not strict.  We can\r\nsmuggle you in."\r\n\r\nOh, how Reginald wished he was safe back in Dull Street!\r\n\r\n"By the way," continued Blandford, "these are two friends of mine,\r\nCruden--Mr Shanklin and Mr Pillans.  Cruden\'s an old Wilderham fellow,\r\nyou know," he added, in an explanatory aside.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman introduced as Mr Shanklin stared curiously at Reginald\r\nfor a few seconds, and then shook hands.  Had the boy known as much of\r\nthat gentleman as the reader does, he would probably have displayed\r\nconsiderably more interest in his new acquaintance than he did.  As it\r\nwas, he would have been glad of an excuse to avoid shaking hands with\r\neither him or his empty-headed companion, Mr Pillans.  He went through\r\nthe ceremony as stiffly as possible, and then followed the party within.\r\n\r\n"Now, then," said Blandford, as they sat down at one of the tables,\r\n"what do you say?  It\'ll save trouble to take the table d\'hote, eh? are\r\nyou game, you fellows?  Table d\'hote for four, waiter.  What shall we\r\nhave to drink?  I say hock to start with."\r\n\r\n"I wont take any wine," said Reginald, with an effort.\r\n\r\n"Why not?  You\'re not a teetotaler, are you?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t take any wine," repeated Reginald decisively; and, to his\r\nsatisfaction, he was allowed to do as he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe dinner passed as such entertainments usually do, diminishing in\r\ninterest as it went on.  In his happiest days, Reginald always hated\r\nwhat the boys used to call "feeds," and he found that three months\'\r\naltered circumstances had by no means reconciled him to the infliction.\r\nHe shirked the last two or three courses, and grew heartily tired of the\r\nsight of a plate.\r\n\r\n"You wondered how I came to be in town?" said Blandford.  "The fact is,\r\nmy uncle went off the hooks a few weeks ago, and as I\'m his heir, you\r\nknow, I came up, and haven\'t gone back yet.  I don\'t think I shall\r\neither."\r\n\r\n"No; what\'s the use, with the pot of money you\'ve come in for?" said Mr\r\nShanklin.  "You\'re far more comfortable up in town."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and _you\'re_ a nice boy to show a fellow about town," said\r\nBlandford, laughing, "Wilderham\'s all very well, you know, Cruden,"\r\ncontinued he, "but it\'s a grind being cooped up there when you\'ve got\r\nyour chance of a fling."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve not wasted your chances, my boy," said Mr Pillans, who,\r\nbesides being empty-headed, was unhealthy in complexion, and red about\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nBlandford appeared rather flattered than otherwise by this observation,\r\nand told Mr Pillans to shut up and not tell tales out of school.\r\n\r\n"I suppose Wilderham hasn\'t changed much since last term?" asked\r\nReginald wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh no; plenty of fellows left and new ones come--rather a better lot,\r\ntake them all round, than we had last term."\r\n\r\n"Has the football club been doing well again?" asked the old boy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, middling.  By the way, the fellows growled rather when you only\r\nsent them half-a-sov. instead of a sov."\r\n\r\nReginald coloured up.  Little his comrade knew what that half-sovereign\r\nhad cost him!\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into silence, and had to derive what compensation he could\r\nfrom the fast talk in which the other three engaged, apparently heedless\r\nof his presence.\r\n\r\nIn due time the meal ended, and Blandford called for the bills.\r\n\r\nUntil that moment Reginald had never imagined for a moment but that he\r\nhad been dining as his old schoolfellow\'s guest.  He had understood\r\nBlandford\'s request of his company as an invitation, and as an\r\ninvitation he had accepted it, and as an invitation he had repented of\r\nit.  What, then, was his embarrassment to find a bill for six shillings\r\nand sixpence laid down before him as his share of the entertainment!\r\n\r\nFor a moment a flush of relief passed across his face.  He was glad not\r\nto find himself under obligations to Blandford after all.  But in\r\nanother moment relief was changed to horror as he remembered that three\r\nshillings was all the money he had about him.  Oh, the humiliation, the\r\nanguish of this discovery!  He would have had anything happen rather\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\nHe sat staring at the bill like a being petrified.\r\n\r\n"Come along," said Blandford, "let\'s go to the smoking-room.  I suppose\r\nyou fellows will have coffee there.  Coffee for four, waiter.  Are you\r\nready?"\r\n\r\nBut Reginald did not move, nor did the waiter.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the row?" said Blandford to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe waiter pointed to Reginald\'s bill.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s waiting for your bill, Cruden.  Look sharp, old man!"\r\n\r\nThe colour came and went in Reginald\'s face, as though he had been\r\ncharged with some hideous crime.  And it seemed like a deliberate\r\nmockery of his trouble that his three companions and the waiter stood\r\nsilent at the table, eyeing him, and waiting for his answer.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," he said at length, bringing up the words with a tremendous\r\neffort, "I find I\'ve not money enough to pay it.  I made a mistake in\r\ncoming here."\r\n\r\nAll four listeners stood with faces of mingled amazement and amusement\r\nat the boy\'s agitation and the tragic manner in which he accounted for\r\nit.  Any one else would have carried it off with a jest; but to Reginald\r\nit was like passing through the fire.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind--may I trouble you--that is, will you lend me three-and-\r\nsixpence, Blandford?" he said at last.\r\n\r\nBlandford burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"I thought at least you\'d swallowed a silver spoon!" said he.  "Here,\r\nwaiter, I\'ll settle that bill.  How much is it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Reginald, laying down his three shillings; "if you can lend\r\nme three-and-sixpence, that\'s all I want."\r\n\r\n"Bosh!" said Blandford, pitching half a sovereign to the waiter; "take\r\nit out of that, and this coffee too, and come along into the smoking-\r\nroom, you fellows."\r\n\r\nReginald would fain have escaped; but the horrid dread of being\r\nsuspected of caring more about his dinner than his company deterred him,\r\nand he followed dejectedly to the luxurious smoking-room of the Shades.\r\n\r\nHe positively refused to touch the coffee or the cigar, even though\r\nBlandford took care to remind him they had been paid for.  Nor, except\r\nwhen spoken to, could he bring himself to open his lips or take part in\r\nthe general talk.\r\n\r\nBlandford, however, who, ever since the incident of the bill, seemed to\r\nconsider himself entitled to play a patronising part towards his\r\nschoolfellow, continued to keep him from lapsing into obscurity.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s your brother living?" he asked presently.\r\n\r\n"He\'s in town, too," said Reginald.  "My mother and he and I live\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"Where?  I\'d like to call on your mother."\r\n\r\n"We live in Dull Street," said Reginald, beginning in sheer desperation\r\nto pluck up heart and hang out no more false colours.\r\n\r\n"Dull Street?  That\'s rather a shady locality, isn\'t it?" said Mr\r\nPillans.\r\n\r\nReginald rounded on him.  Blandford might have a right to catechise him;\r\nbut what business was it of this numbskull\'s where he lived?\r\n\r\n"You\'re not obliged to go there," he said, with a curl of his lip,\r\n"unless you like."\r\n\r\nMr Shanklin smiled at this sally, a demonstration which considerably\r\nincensed the not too amiable Mr Pillans.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take precious care I don\'t," said the latter.\r\n\r\nReginald said "Thanks!" drily, and in a way so cutting that Mr Shanklin\r\nand Blandford both laughed this time.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said the unwholesome Pillans, looking very warm, "what do\r\nyou say that for?  Do you want to cheek me?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Pillans.  It doesn\'t matter to you where he lives,"\r\nsaid Blandford.\r\n\r\n"Thank goodness it don\'t--or whether he pays his rent either."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity you had to leave Garden Vale," said Blandford, apparently\r\nanxious to turn the conversation into a more pacific channel; "such a\r\njolly place it was.  What do you do with yourself all day long in town?"\r\n\r\nReginald smiled.\r\n\r\n"I work for my living," said he, keeping his eye steadily fixed on Mr\r\nPillans, as if waiting to catch the first sign of an insult on his part.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we all do, more or less," said Mr Shanklin.  "Blandford\r\nhere works like a nigger to spend his money, don\'t you, old man?"\r\n\r\n"I do so," said Blandford, "with your valuable assistance."\r\n\r\n"And with somebody else\'s assistance too," said Mr Pillans, with a\r\nshrug in the direction of Reginald.\r\n\r\nReginald understood the taunt, and rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going?" said Blandford.\r\n\r\n"I am.  I don\'t forget I owe you for my dinner, Blandford; and I shan\'t\r\nforget that I owe you also for introducing me to a blackguard.  Good-\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nAnd without allowing his hearers time to recover from the astonishment\r\ninto which these words had thrown them, he marched out of the Shades\r\nwith his head in the air.\r\n\r\nIt was a minute before any of the three disconcerted companions could\r\nrecover the gift of speech.  At last Mr Shanklin burst out into a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Capital, that was," he said; "there\'s something in the fellow.  And,"\r\nhe added internally, and not in the hearing of either of his companions,\r\n"if he\'s the same fellow Medlock has hooked, our fortune\'s made."\r\n\r\n"All very well," said Pillans; "but he called me a blackguard."\r\n\r\nThis simple discovery caused still greater merriment at the expense of\r\nthe outraged owner of the appellation.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a good mind to go after him, and pull his nose," growled he.\r\n\r\n"Nothing would please him better," said Blandford.  "But you\'d better\r\nleave your own nose behind, my boy, before you start, or there won\'t be\r\nmuch of it left.  I know Cruden of old."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t see much more of him now," sneered Pillans, "now he owes you\r\nfor his dinner."\r\n\r\n"It strikes me, Bland was never safer of a six-and-six in his life than\r\nhe is of the one he lent to-night," said Mr Shanklin.  "Unless I\'m\r\nmistaken, the fellow would walk across England on his bare feet to pay\r\nit back."\r\n\r\nMr Shanklin, it was evident, could appreciate honesty in any one else.\r\nHe was highly delighted with what he had seen of the new secretary.  If\r\nanything could float the Select Agency Corporation, the lad\'s\r\nunsuspicious honesty would do it.  In fact, things were looking up all\r\nround for the precious confederates.  With Reginald to supply them with\r\nhonesty, with easy-going spendthrifts, like Blandford and Pillans, to\r\nsupply them with money, and with a cad like Durfy to do their dirty work\r\nfor them, they were in as comfortable and hopeful a way as the promoters\r\nof such an enterprise could reasonably hope to be.\r\n\r\nThe trio at the Shades soon forgot Reginald in the delights of one\r\nanother\'s sweet society.  They played billiards, at which Mr Shanklin\r\nwon.  They also played cards, at which, by a singular coincidence, Mr\r\nShanklin won too.  They then went to call on a friend who knew the\r\n"straight tip" for the Saint Leger, and under his advice they laid out a\r\ngood deal of money, which (such are the freaks of fortune) also found\r\nits way somehow into Mr Shanklin\'s pocket-book.  Finally, they supped\r\ntogether, and then went home to bed, each one under the delusion that he\r\nhad spent a very pleasant evening.\r\n\r\nReginald was far from sharing the same opinion as he paced home that\r\nevening.  How glad he should be to be out of this hateful London, where\r\neverything went wrong, and reminded him that he was a pauper, dependent\r\non others for his living, for his clothes, for his--faugh! for his\r\ndinner!  Happily he had not to endure it much longer.  At Liverpool, he\r\nwould be independent.  He would hold a position not degrading to a\r\ngentleman; he would associate with men of intellect and breeding; he\r\nwould even have the joy of helping his mother to many a little luxury\r\nwhich, as long as he remained in London, he could never have given her.\r\nHe quickened his pace, and reached home.  Gedge had been there,\r\nspiritless and forlorn, and had left as soon as he could excuse himself.\r\n\r\n"Out of sight, out of mind," he had said, with a forced laugh, to Horace\r\nwhen the latter expressed his regret at Reginald\'s absence.\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden and Horace both tried to look cheerful; but the cloud on the\r\nhorizon was too large now to be covered with a hand.\r\n\r\nWhen Reginald announced that he had written and accepted the invitation\r\nto Liverpool, there was no jubilation, no eager congratulation.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do without you?" said Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\n"It is horrid having to go, mother," said the boy; "but we must make the\r\nbest of it.  If you look so unhappy, I shall be sorry I ever thought of\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHis mother tried to smile, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Yes, we must try and make the best of it, dear boys; and if we cannot\r\nseem as glad as we should like to be, it\'s not to be wondered at at\r\nfirst, is it?"\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll get holidays enough now and then to run up," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I don\'t fancy there\'ll be much difficulty about that," replied\r\nReg.  "In fact, it\'s possible I may have to come up now and then on\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence for a few seconds, and then he added rather\r\nnervously,--\r\n\r\n"By the way, mother, about the L50.  I had intended to ask Mr Richmond\r\nto advance it, although I should have hated to do so.  But now, I was\r\nwondering--do you think there would be any objection to taking it out of\r\nour money, and letting it be invested in my name in the Corporation?  It\r\nreally wouldn\'t make any difference, for you\'d get exactly the same\r\ninterest for it as you got through Mr Richmond; and, of course, the\r\nprincipal would belong to you too."\r\n\r\n"I see no objection," said Mrs Cruden.  "It\'s our common stock, and if\r\nwe can use it for the common good, so much the better."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Reginald.  "If you wouldn\'t mind sending a line to Mr\r\nRichmond\'s clerk to-morrow, he could let me have the cheque to take down\r\nor Monday with me."\r\n\r\nThe three days that followed were dismal ones for the three Crudens.\r\nThere are few miseries like that of an impending separation.  We wish\r\nthe fatal moment to arrive and end our suspense.  We know of a thousand\r\nthings we want to say, but the time slips by wasted, and hangs drearily\r\non our hands.  We have not the spirit to look forward, or the heart to\r\nlook back.  We long to have it all over, and yet every stroke of the\r\nclock falls like a cruel knell on our ears.  We long that we could fall\r\nasleep, and wake to find ourselves on the other side of the crisis we\r\ndread.\r\n\r\nSo it was with the Crudens; and when at last the little trio stood on\r\nthe Monday on the platform of Euston Station, all three felt that they\r\nwould give anything to have the last few days back again.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll write, mother, as often as ever I can," said Reginald, trying to\r\nspeak as if the words did not stick in his throat.\r\n\r\n"Tell us all about your quarters, and what you have to do, and all\r\nthat," said Horace.\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden had no words.  She stood with her eyes fixed on her boy, and\r\nfelt she needed all her courage to do that steadily.\r\n\r\n"Horrors," said Reg, as the guard locked the carriage door, and the\r\nusual silence which precedes the blowing of the whistle ensued, "keep\r\nyour eye on young Gedge, will you? there\'s a good fellow."\r\n\r\n"I will, and I\'ll--"\r\n\r\nBut here the whistle sounded, and amid the farewells that followed,\r\nReginald went out into his new world, leaving them behind, straining\r\ntheir eyes for a last look, but little dreaming how and when that little\r\nfamily should meet again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nHORACE LEARNS AN ART, PAYS A BILL, AND LENDS A HELPING HAND.\r\n\r\n"I say, Cruden," said Waterford to Horace one morning, shortly after\r\nReginald\'s departure from London, "I shall get jealous if you don\'t pull\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"Jealous of me?" said Horace.  "Whatever for?"\r\n\r\n"Why, before you came I flattered myself I was a bit of a dab at the\r\nscissors-and-paste business, but you\'ve gone and cut me out completely."\r\n\r\n"What rot!" said Horace, laughing.  "There\'s more than enough cutting\r\nout to do with the morning papers to leave any time for operating on\r\nyou.  Besides, any duffer can do work like that."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well," said Waterford.  "There\'s only one duffer here\r\nthat can do as much as me and Booms put together, and that\'s you.  Now,\r\nif you weren\'t such a racehorse, I\'d propose to you to join our\r\nshorthand class.  You\'ll have to learn it some time or other, you know."\r\n\r\n"The very thing I\'d like," said Horace.  "That is," he added, "if it\r\nwon\'t take up all a fellow\'s evenings.  How often are the classes?"\r\n\r\n"Well, as often as we like.  Generally once a week.  Booms\'s\r\nwasherwoman--"\r\n\r\n"Whatever has she to do with shorthand?" asked Horace.\r\n\r\n"More than you think, my boy.  She always takes eight days to wash his\r\ncollars and cuffs.  He sends them to her on Wednesdays, and gets them\r\nback on the next day week, so that we always practise shorthand on the\r\nWednesday evening.  Don\'t we, Booms?" he inquired, as the proud owner of\r\nthat name entered the office at that moment.\r\n\r\n"There you are," sighed he.  "How do I know what you are talking about?"\r\n\r\n"I was saying we always worked up our shorthand on Wednesday evenings."\r\n\r\n"If you say so," said the melancholy one, "it must be so."\r\n\r\n"I was telling Cruden he might join us this winter."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the other, resignedly; "but where are you going to\r\nmeet?  Mrs Megson has gone away, and we\'ve no reader."\r\n\r\n"Bother you, Booms, for always spotting difficulties in a thing.  You\r\nsee," added he, to Horace, "we used to meet at a good lady\'s house who\r\nkept a day school.  She let us go there one evening a week, and read\r\naloud to us, for us to take it down in shorthand.  She\'s gone now, bad\r\nluck to her, and the worst of it is we\'re bound to get a lady to take us\r\nin, as we\'ve got ladies in our class, you see."\r\n\r\nAt the mention of ladies Booms groaned deeply.\r\n\r\n"Why, I tell you what," said Horace, struck by a brilliant idea.  "What\r\nshould you say to my mother?  I think she would be delighted; and if you\r\nwant a good reader aloud, she\'s the very woman for you."\r\n\r\nWaterford clapped his friend enthusiastically on the back.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a trump, Cruden, to lend us your mother; isn\'t he, Booms?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Booms.  "I\'ve seen her, and--" here he appeared to\r\nundergo a mental struggle--"I like her."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I\'ll sound her on the matter.  By the way, she\'ll want to\r\nknow who the ladies are."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll only be one this winter, I\'m afraid," said Waterford, "as the\r\nMegsons have gone.  It\'s a Miss Crisp, Cruden, a friend of Booms\'s,\r\nwho--"\r\n\r\n"Whom I met the other night at the Shucklefords\'?" said Horace.\r\n\r\nBooms answered the question with such an agonised sigh that both his\r\ncompanions burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"Dear old Booms can tell you more about her than I can," said Waterford.\r\n"All I know is she\'s a very nice girl indeed."\r\n\r\n"I agree with you," said Horace; "I\'m sure she is.  You think so too,\r\ndon\'t you, Booms?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what I think," said Booms; which was very true.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty still remained, and this appeared to trouble Horace\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nHe did not like to refer to it as long as the melancholy masher was\r\npresent, but as soon as he had gone in to fetch the papers, Horace\r\ninquired of his friend,--\r\n\r\n"I say, Waterford, do you mean to say he chooses the very night he\r\nhasn\'t got a high collar to--"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" cried Waterford, mysteriously, "it\'s a sore question with him;\r\nbut _he couldn\'t write if he had one_.  We never mention it, though."\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say Mrs Cruden fell in most cordially with the new\r\nproposal.  She needed little persuasion to induce her to agree to a plan\r\nwhich meant the bright presence of her son and his friends in her house,\r\nand it gave her special satisfaction to find her services on such\r\noccasions not only invited, but indispensable; and it is doubtful\r\nwhether any of the party looked forward more eagerly to the cheery\r\nWednesday evenings than she did.\r\n\r\nIt was up-hill work, of course, for Horace, at first; in fact, during\r\nthe first evening he could do nothing but sit and admire the pace at\r\nwhich Miss Crisp, followed more haltingly by Booms and Waterford, took\r\ndown the words of _Ivanhoe_ as fast as Mrs Cruden read them.  But, by\r\ndint of hard, unsparing practice, he was able, a week later, to make\r\nsome sort of a show, and as the lessons went on he even had the delight\r\nof finding himself, as Waterford said, `in the running\' with his fellow-\r\nscholars.  This success was not achieved without considerable\r\ndetermination on the boy\'s part; but Horace, when he did take a thing\r\nup, went through with it.  He gave himself no relaxation for the first\r\nweek or two.  Every evening after supper he produced his pencil and\r\npaper, and his mother produced her book, and for two steady hours the\r\nwork went on.  Even at the office, in the intervals of work, he reported\r\neverything his ears could catch, not excepting the melancholy utterances\r\nof Booms and the vulgar conversation of the errand-boy.\r\n\r\nOne day the sub-editor summoned him to the inner room to give him some\r\ninstructions as to a letter to be written, when the boy much astonished\r\nhis chief by taking a note of every word, and producing the letter in a\r\nfew moments in the identical language in which it had been dictated.\r\n\r\n"You know shorthand, then?" inquired the mild sub-editor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, a little."\r\n\r\n"I did not know of this before."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I only began lately.  Booms and Waterford and I are all\r\nworking it up."\r\n\r\nThe sub-editor said nothing just then, but in future availed himself\r\nfreely of the new talent of his juniors.  And what was still more\r\nsatisfactory, it was intimated not many days later to Horace from\r\nheadquarters, that as he appeared to be making himself generally useful,\r\nthe nominal wages at which he had been admitted would be increased\r\nhenceforth to twenty-four shillings a week.\r\n\r\nThis piece of good fortune was most opportune; for now that Reginald\'s\r\nweekly contribution was withdrawn, and pending the payment of his first\r\nquarter\'s salary at Christmas, the family means had been sorely reduced,\r\nand Horace and his mother had been hard put to it to make both ends\r\nmeet.  Even with this augmented pay it might still have been beyond\r\naccomplishment had not their income been still further improved in a\r\nmanner which Horace little suspected, and which, had he known, would\r\nhave sorely distressed him.\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden, between whom and the bright Miss Crisp a pleasant\r\nfriendship had sprung up, had, almost the first time the two ladies\r\nfound themselves together, inquired of her new acquaintance as to the\r\npossibility of finding any light employment for herself during the hours\r\nwhen she was alone.  Miss Crisp, as it happened, did know of some work,\r\nthough hardly to be called light work, which she herself, having just at\r\npresent other duties on hand, had been obliged to decline.  This was the\r\ntranscribing of the manuscript of a novel, written by a lady, in a\r\nhandwriting so enigmatical that the publishers would not look at it\r\nunless presented in a legible form.  The lady was, therefore, anxious to\r\nget it copied out, and had offered Miss Crisp a small sum for the\r\nservice.  Mrs Cruden clutched eagerly at the opportunity thus\r\npresented.  The work was laborious and dreary in the extreme, for the\r\nstory was long and insipid, and the wretched handwriting danced under\r\nher eyes till they ached and grew weak.  But she persevered boldly, and\r\nfor three hours a day pored over her self-imposed task.  When Horace\r\nreturned at evening no trace of it was to be seen, only the pale face\r\nand weary eyes of his mother, who yet was ready with a smile to read\r\naloud as long as the boy wished, and pretend that she only enjoyed a\r\nlabour which was really taxing her both in health and eyesight.\r\n\r\nReginald had written home once or twice since his departure, but none of\r\nhis letters had contained much news.  He said very little either about\r\nhis work or his employers, but from the dismal tone in which he drew\r\ncomparisons between London and Liverpool, and between his present\r\nloneliness and days before their separation, it was evident enough he\r\nwas homesick.  In a letter to Horace he said,--\r\n\r\n"I get precious little time just now for anything but work, and what I\r\ndo get I don\'t know a soul here to spend it with.  There\'s a football\r\nclub here, but of course I can\'t join it.  I go walks occasionally,\r\nthough I can\'t get far, as I cannot be away from here for long at a\r\ntime, and never of an evening.  You might send me a _Rocket_ now and\r\nthen, or something to read.  What about young Gedge?  See Durfy doesn\'t\r\nget hold of him.  Could you ever scrape up six-and-six, and pay it for\r\nme to Blandford, whose address I give below?  It\'s something he lent me\r\nfor a particular purpose when I last saw him.  Do try.  I would enclose\r\nit, but till Christmas I have scarcely enough to keep myself.  I wish\r\nthey would pay weekly instead of quarterly.  I would be awfully obliged\r\nif you would manage to pay the six-and-six somehow or other.  If you do,\r\nsee he gets it, and knows it comes from me, and send me a line to say he\r\nhas got it.  Don\'t forget, there\'s a brick.  Love to mother and young\r\nGedge.  I wish I could see you all this minute."\r\n\r\nHorace felt decidedly blue after receiving this letter, and purposely\r\nwithheld it from his mother.  Had he been sure Reginald was prosperous\r\nand happy in his new work, this separation would not have mattered so\r\nmuch, but all along he had had his doubts on both these points, and the\r\nletter only confirmed them.\r\n\r\nAt any rate he determined to lose no time in easing his brother\'s mind\r\nof the two chief causes of his anxiety.  The very next Saturday he\r\nappropriated six-and-six of his slender wages, and devoted the evening\r\nto finding out Blandford\'s rooms, and paying him the money.\r\n\r\nFortunately his man was at home, an unusual circumstance at that hour of\r\nthe night, and due solely to the fact that he and Pillans, his fellow-\r\nlodger, were expecting company; indeed, the page-boy (for our two gay\r\nsparks maintained a "tiger" between them) showed Horace up the moment he\r\narrived, under the delusion that he was one of the guests.  Blandford\r\nand his friend, sitting in state to receive their distinguished\r\nvisitors, among whom were to be the real owner of a racehorse, a real\r\njockey, a real actor, and a real wine-merchant, these open-hearted and\r\nknowing young men were considerably taken aback to find a boy of\r\nHorace\'s age and toilet ushered into their august presence.  Blandford\r\nwould have preferred to appear ignorant of the identity of the intruder,\r\nbut Horace left him no room for that amiable fraud.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Bland!" said he, just as if he had seen him only yesterday at\r\nWilderham, "what a jolly lot of stairs you keep in this place.  I\r\nthought I should never smoke you out.  How are you, old man?"\r\n\r\nAnd before the horrified dandy could recover from his surprise, he found\r\nhis hand being warmly shaken by his old schoolfellow.\r\n\r\nHorace, sublimely unconscious of the impression he was creating,\r\nindulged in a critical survey of the apartment, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Snug little crib you\'ve got--not quite so jolly, though, as the old\r\nstudy you and Reg had at Wilderham.  How\'s Harker, by the way?"\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded to stroll across the room to look at a picture.\r\n\r\nBlandford and Pillans exchanged glances.  Wrath was in the face of the\r\none, bewilderment in the face of the other.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s your friend?" whispered the latter.\r\n\r\n"An old schoolfellow who--"\r\n\r\n"Nice lot of fellows you seem to have been brought up with, upon my\r\nword," said Mr Pillans.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'ll be up for Christmas," pursued Horace.  "Jolly glad I\r\nshall be to see him, too.  I say, why don\'t you come and look us up?\r\nThe _mater_ would be awfully glad, though we\'ve not very showy quarters\r\nto ask you to.  Ah! that\'s one of the prints you had in the study at\r\nschool.  Do you remember Reg chipping that corner of the frame with a\r\nsinglestick?"\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Cruden," began Blandford, in a severe tone; "my friend and I\r\nare just expecting company."\r\n\r\n"Are you?  Well, I couldn\'t have stayed if you\'d asked me.  Are any of\r\nthe old school lot coming?"\r\n\r\n"The fact is, we can do without you, young fellow," said Mr Pillans.\r\n\r\nHorace stared.  It had not occurred to him till that moment that his old\r\nschoolfellow could be anything but glad to see him, and he didn\'t\r\nbelieve it now.\r\n\r\n"Will Harker be coming?" he inquired, ignoring Mr Pillans\' presence.\r\n\r\n"No, no one you know is coming," said Blandford, half angrily, half\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pity.  I\'d have liked to see some of the old lot.  Ever since\r\nwe came to grief none of them has been near us except Harker.  He called\r\none day, like a brick, but he won\'t be up again till Christmas."\r\n\r\n"Good-night," said Blandford.\r\n\r\nHis tone was quite lost on Horace.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, old man.  By the way, Reg--you know he\'s up in the North\r\nnow--asked me to pay you six-and-six he owed you.  He said you\'d know\r\nabout it.  Is it all right?"\r\n\r\nBlandford coloured up violently.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to take it.  I told him so," said he.  "Oh yes, you are,\r\nyou old humbug," said Horace, "so catch hold.  A debt\'s a debt, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a debt," said Blandford.  "I gave it to him, so good-night."\r\n\r\n"No, that won\'t do," said Horace.  "He doesn\'t think so--"\r\n\r\n"The fact is, the beggar couldn\'t pay for his own dinner, and Blandford\r\nhad to pay it for him.  He managed it very neatly," said Mr Pillans.\r\n\r\nHorace fired up fiercely.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?  Who\'s this cad you keep about the place, Blandford?"\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t go I\'ll kick you down the stairs!" cried Mr Pillans, by\r\nthis time in a rage.\r\n\r\nHorace laughed.  Mr Pillans was his senior in years and his superior in\r\ninches, but there was nothing in his unhealthy face to dismay the sturdy\r\nschool-boy.\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to try?" shouted Mr Pillans.\r\n\r\n"Not unless you like," replied Horace, putting the money down on the\r\ntable and holding out his hand to Blandford.\r\n\r\nThe latter took it mechanically, too glad to see his visitor departing\r\nto offer any obstacle.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll look you up again some day," said Horace, "when your bulldog here\r\nis chained up.  When Reg and Harker are up this Christmas, we must all\r\nget a day together.  Good-night."\r\n\r\nAnd he made for the door, brushing up against the outraged Mr Pillans\r\non his way.\r\n\r\n"Take that for an impudent young beggar!" said the latter as he passed,\r\nsuiting the action to the word with a smart cuff directed at the\r\nvisitor\'s head.\r\n\r\nHorace, however, was quick enough to ward it off.\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d try that on," he said, with a laugh; "you\'re--"\r\n\r\nBut Mr Pillans, who had by this time worked himself into a fury by a\r\nmethod known only to himself, cut short further parley by making a\r\ndesperate rush at him just as he reached the door.\r\n\r\nThe wary Horace had not played football for three seasons for nothing.\r\nHe quietly ducked, allowing his unscientific assailant to overbalance\r\nhimself, and topple head first on the lobby outside, at the particular\r\nmoment when the real owner of the racehorse and the real wine-merchant,\r\nwho had just arrived, reached the top of the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, young fellow!" said the sporting gentleman; "practising\r\ncroppers, are you? or getting up an appetite? or what?  High old times\r\nyou\'re having up here among you!  Who\'s the kid?"\r\n\r\n"Stop him!" gasped Pillans, picking himself up; "don\'t let him go! hold\r\nhim fast!"\r\n\r\nThe wine-merchant obligingly took possession of Horace by the collar,\r\nand the company returned in solemn procession to the room.\r\n\r\n"Now, then," said Horace\'s captor, "what\'s the row?  Let\'s hear all\r\nabout it.  Has he been collaring any of your spoons? or setting the\r\nhouse on fire? or what?  Who is he?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s cheeked me!" said Pillans, brushing the dust off his coat.  "Hold\r\nhim fast, will you? till I take it out of him."\r\n\r\nBut the horse-racer was far too much of a sportsman for that.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said he, laughing; "make a mill of it and I\'m your man.  I\'ll\r\nbet two to one on the young \'un to start with."\r\n\r\nThe wine-merchant said he would go double that on Pillans, whereupon the\r\nsporting man offered a five-pound note against a half-sovereign on his\r\nman, and called out to have the room cleared and a sponge brought in.\r\n\r\nHow far his scientific enthusiasm would have been rewarded it is hard to\r\nsay, for Blandford at this juncture most inconsiderately interposed.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said he, "I\'m not going to have the place made a cock-pit.\r\nShut up, Pillans, and don\'t make an ass of yourself; and you, Cruden,\r\ncut off.  What did you ever come here for?  See what a row you\'ve made."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t I made the row," said Horace.  "I\'m awfully sorry, Bland.\r\nI\'d advise you to cut that friend of yours, I say.  He\'s an idiot.\r\nGood-bye."\r\n\r\nAnd while the horse-racer and the wine-merchant were still discussing\r\npreliminaries, and Mr Pillans was privately ascertaining whether his\r\nnose was bleeding, Horace departed in peace, partly amused, partly\r\nvexed, and decidedly of opinion that Blandford had taken to keeping very\r\nqueer company since he last saw him.\r\n\r\nThe great thing was that Horace could now write and report to Reg that\r\nthe debt had been paid.\r\n\r\nHis way home led him past the _Rocket_ office.  It was half-past ten,\r\nand the place looked dark and deserted.  Even the lights in the editor\'s\r\nwindows were out, and the late hands had gone home.  Just at the corner\r\nHorace encountered Gedge, one of the late hands in question.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, young \'un!" he said.  "Going home?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m going home," said young Gedge.\r\n\r\n"I heard from my brother yesterday.  He was asking after you."\r\n\r\n"Was he?" said the boy half-sarcastically.  "He does remember my name,\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever do you mean?  Of course he does," said Horace.  "You know that\r\nwell enough."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have known it unless you\'d told me," said Gedge, with a\r\ncloud on his face; "he\'s never sent me a word since he left."\r\n\r\n"He\'s been awfully busy--he\'s scarcely had time to write home.  I say,\r\nyoung \'un, what\'s the row with you?  What makes you so queer?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said the boy wearily; "I used to fancy somebody\r\ncared for me, but I was mistaken.  I was going to the dogs fast enough\r\nwhen Cruden came here; I pulled up then, because I thought he\'d stand by\r\nme; but now he\'s gone and forgotten all about me.  I\'ll--well, there\'s\r\nnothing to prevent me going to the bad; and I may as well make up my\r\nmind to it."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Horace, taking his arm kindly; "you mustn\'t say that,\r\nyoung \'un.  The last words Reg said to me when he went off were, `Keep\r\nyour eye on young Gedge, don\'t forget\'; the very last words, and he\'s\r\nreminded me of my promise in every letter since.  I\'ve been a cad, I\r\nknow, not to see more of you; but you mustn\'t go thinking that you\'ve no\r\nfriends.  If it were only for Reg\'s sake I\'d stick to you.  Don\'t blame\r\nhim, though, for I know he thinks a lot about you, and it would break\r\nhis heart if you went to the bad.  Of course you can help going to the\r\nbad, old man; we can all help it."\r\n\r\nThe boy looked up with the clouds half brushed away from his face.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go to the bad," said he; "but I sort of feel I\'m bound\r\nto go, unless some one sticks up for me.  I\'m so awfully weak-minded,\r\nI\'m not fit to be trusted alone."\r\n\r\n"Hullo, I say," whispered Horace, suddenly stopping short in his walk,\r\n"who\'s that fellow sneaking about there by the editor\'s door?"\r\n\r\n"He looks precious like Durfy," said Gedge; "I believe it is he."\r\n\r\n"What does he want there, I wonder--he wasn\'t on the late shift to-\r\nnight, was he?"\r\n\r\n"No; he went at seven."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what he wants hanging about when everybody\'s gone," said\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\n"Unless he\'s screwed and can\'t get home--I\'ve known him like that.  That\r\nfellow\'s not screwed, though," he added; "see, he\'s heard some one\r\ncoming, and he\'s off steady enough on his legs."\r\n\r\n"Rum," said Horace.  "It looked like Durfy, too.  Never mind, whoever it\r\nis, we\'ve routed him out this time.  Good-night, old man; don\'t go down\r\non your luck, mind, and don\'t go abusing Reg behind his back, and don\'t\r\nforget you\'re booked to come home to supper with me on Monday, and see\r\nmy mother.  Ta-ta."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW SECRETARY TAKES THE REINS.\r\n\r\nIt is high time to return to Reginald, whom we left in a somewhat dismal\r\nfashion, straining his eyes for a last sight of his mother and brother\r\nas they waved farewell to him on the Euston platform.\r\n\r\nIf the reader expects me to tell him that on finding himself alone our\r\nhero burst into tears, or broke out into repentant lamentations, or\r\nwished himself under the wheels of the carriage, I\'m afraid he will be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nReginald spent the first half-hour of his solitary journey in\r\nspeculating how the oil in the lamp got round at the wick.  He\r\nconsidered the matter most attentively, and kept his eyes fixed on the\r\ndim light until London was miles behind him, and the hedges and grey\r\nautumn fields on either hand proclaimed the country.  Then his mind\r\nabandoned its problems, and for another half-hour he tried with all his\r\nmight to prevent the beat of the engine taking up the rhythm of one of\r\nthe old Wilderham cricket songs.  That too he gave up eventually, and\r\nlet his imagination wander at large over those happy school days, when\r\nall was merry, when every friend was a brick, and every exertion a\r\nsport, when the future beckoned him forward with coaxing hand.  What\r\ngrand times they were!  Should he ever forget the last cricket match of\r\nthe summer term, when he bowled three men in one over, and made the\r\nhardest catch on record in the Wilderham Close?  He and Blandford--\r\n\r\nAh, Blandford!  His mind swerved on the points here, and branched off\r\ninto the recollection of that ill-starred dinner at the Shades, and the\r\nunhealthy bloated face of the cad Pillans.  How he would have liked to\r\nknock the idiot down, just as he had knocked Durfy down that night when\r\nyoung Gedge--\r\n\r\nAh, another point here and another swerve.  Would Horace be sure and\r\nkeep his eye on the young \'un, and was there any chance of getting him\r\ndown to Liverpool?\r\n\r\nOnce more a swerve, and this time into a straight reach of meditation\r\nfor miles and miles ahead.  He thought of everything.  He pictured his\r\nown little office and living-room.  He drew a mental portrait of the\r\nhousekeeper, and the cups and saucers he would use at his well-earned\r\nmeals.  He made up his mind the board-room would be furnished in green\r\nleather, and that the Bishop of S-- would be a jolly sort of fellow and\r\nfond of his joke.  He even imagined what the directors would say among\r\nthemselves respecting himself after he had been introduced and made his\r\nfirst impression.  At any rate they should not say he lacked in interest\r\nfor their affairs, and when he wrote home--\r\n\r\nAh! this was the last of all the points, and his thoughts after that ran\r\non the same lines till the train plunged into the smoke and gloom of the\r\ngreat city which was henceforth to extend to him its tender mercies.\r\n\r\nIf Reginald had reckoned on a deputation of directors of the Select\r\nAgency Corporation to meet their new secretary at the station, he was\r\ndestined to be disappointed.  There were plenty of people there, but\r\nnone concerning themselves with him as he dragged his carpet-bag from\r\nunder the seat and set foot on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe bag was very heavy, and Shy Street, so he was told, was ten-minutes\'\r\nwalk from the station.  It did occur to him that most secretaries of\r\ncompanies would take a cab under such circumstances and charge it to\r\n"general expenses."  But he did not care to spend either the\r\nCorporation\'s money or his own for so luxurious a purpose, and therefore\r\ngripped his bag manfully and wrestled with it out into the street.\r\n\r\nThe ten-minutes grew to considerably more than twenty before they both\r\nfound themselves in Shy Street.  A long, old-fashioned, dismal street it\r\nwas, with some shops in the middle, and small offices at either end.  No\r\nimposing-looking edifice, chaste in architecture and luxurious in\r\nproportions, stood with open doors to receive its future lord.  Reginald\r\nand his bag stumbled up a side staircase to the first floor over a\r\nchemist\'s shop, where a door with the name "Medlock" loomed before him,\r\nand told him he had come to his journey\'s end.\r\n\r\nWaiting a moment to wipe the perspiration from his face, he turned the\r\nhandle and found himself in a large, bare, carpetless room, with a table\r\nand a few chairs in the middle of it, a clock over the chimneypiece, a\r\nfew directories piled up in one corner, and a bundle of circulars and\r\nwrappers in another; and a little back room screened off from the\r\ngeneral observation with the word "private" on the door.  Such was the\r\nimpression formed in Reginald\'s mind by a single glance round his new\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nIn the flutter of his first entrance, however, he entirely overlooked\r\none important piece of furniture--namely, a small boy with long lank\r\nhair and pale blotched face, who was sitting on a low stool near the\r\nwindow, greedily devouring the contents of a pink-covered periodical.\r\nThis young gentleman, on becoming aware of the presence of a stranger,\r\ncrumpled his paper hurriedly into his pocket and rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n"What do yer want?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr Medlock here?" asked Reginald.\r\n\r\n"No fear," replied the boy.\r\n\r\n"Has he left any message?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know who you are.  What\'s yer name?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m Mr Cruden, the new secretary."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re \'im, are yer?  Yes, you\'ve got to address them there\r\nenvellups, and \'e\'ll be up in the morning."\r\n\r\nThis was depressing.  Reginald\'s castles in the air were beginning to\r\ntumble about his ears in rapid succession.  The bare room he could\r\nexcuse, on the ground that the Corporation was only just beginning its\r\noperations.  Doubtless the carpet was on order, and was to be delivered\r\nsoon.  He could even afford not to afflict himself much about this\r\nvulgar, irreverent little boy, who was probably put in, as they put in a\r\nlittle watch-dog, to see to the place until he and his staff of\r\nassistants rendered his further presence unnecessary.  But it did chill\r\nhim to find that after his long journey, and his farewell to his own\r\nhome, no one should think it worth while to be here to meet him and\r\ninstall him with common friendliness into his new quarters.  However,\r\nMr Medlock was a man of business, and was possibly prevented by\r\ncircumstances over which he had no control from being present to receive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the housekeeper?" demanded he, putting down his bag and\r\nrelieving himself of his overcoat.\r\n\r\n"\'Ousekeeper!  Oh yus," said the boy, with a snigger; "no \'ousekeepers\r\n\'ere."\r\n\r\n"Where are my rooms, then?" asked Reginald, beginning to think it a pity\r\nthe Corporation had brought him down all that way before they were ready\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t this room big enough for yer?" said the boy; "ain\'t no more \'sep\'\r\nyour bedroom--no droring-rooms in this shop."\r\n\r\n"Show me the bedroom," said Reginald.\r\n\r\nThe boy shuffled to the door and up another flight of stairs, at the\r\nhead of which he opened the door of a very small room, about the size of\r\none of the Wilderham studies, with just room to squeeze round a low iron\r\nbedstead without scraping the wall.\r\n\r\n"There you are--clean and haired and no error.  I\'ve slep\' in it\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nReginald motioned him from the room, and then sitting down on the bed,\r\nlooked round him.\r\n\r\nHe could not understand it.  Any common butcher\'s boy would be better\r\nput up.  A little box of a bedroom like this, with no better testimonial\r\nto its cleanliness and airiness than could be derived from the fact that\r\nthe dirty little watch-dog downstairs had occupied it!  And in place of\r\na parlour that bare gaunt room below in which to sit of an evening and\r\ntake his meals and enjoy himself.  Why ever had the Corporation not had\r\nthe ordinary decency to have his permanent accommodation ready for him\r\nbefore he arrived?\r\n\r\nHe washed himself as well as he could without soap and towel, and\r\nreturned to the first floor, where he found the boy back on his old\r\nstool, and once more absorbed in his paper.\r\n\r\nThe reader looked up as Reginald entered.\r\n\r\n"Say, what\'s yer name," said he, "ever read _Tim Tigerskin_?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve not," replied Reginald, staring at his questioner, and\r\nwondering whether he was as erratic in his intellect as he was mealy in\r\nhis countenance.\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t a bad \'un, but \'tain\'t \'arf as prime as _The Pirate\'s Bride_.\r\nThe bloke there pisons two on \'em with prussic acid, and wouldn\'t ever\r\n\'ave got nabbed if he \'adn\'t took some hisself by mistake, the flat!"\r\n\r\nReginald could hardly help smiling at this appetising _resume_.\r\n\r\n"I want something to eat," he said.  "Is there any place near here where\r\nI can get it?"\r\n\r\n"Trum\'s, but \'is sosseges is off at three o\'clock.  Better try\r\nCupper\'s--he\'s a good \'un for bloaters; _I_ deals with \'im."\r\n\r\nReginald felt neither the spirit nor the inclination to make a personal\r\nexamination into the merits of the rival caterers.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better go and get me something," he said to the boy; "coffee and\r\nfish or cold meat will do."\r\n\r\n"No fear; I ain\'t a-goin\' for nothing," replied the boy.  "I\'ll do your\r\nerrands for a tanner a week and your leavings, but not no less."\r\n\r\n"You shall have it," said Reginald.  Whereupon the boy undertook the\r\ncommission and departed.\r\n\r\nThe meal was a dismal one.  The herrings were badly over-smoked and the\r\ncoffee was like mud, and the boy\'s conversation, which filled in a\r\nrunning accompaniment, was not conducive to digestion.\r\n\r\n"I\'d \'most a mind to try some prussic in that corfee," said that\r\nbloodthirsty young gentleman, "if I\'d a known where the chemist\r\ndownstairs keeps his\'n.  Then they\'d \'a said you\'d poisoned yourself\r\n\'cos you was blue coming to this \'ere \'ole.  I\'d \'a been put in the box\r\nat the inquige, and I\'d \'a said Yes, you was blue, and I thought there\r\nwas a screw loose the minit I see yer, and I\'d seen yer empty a paper of\r\npowder in your corfee while you thort nobody wasn\'t a-looking.  And the\r\njury\'d say it was tempory \'sanity and sooiside, and say they considers I\r\nwas a honest young feller, and vote me a bob out of the poor-box.  There\r\nyou are.  What do you think of that?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'s what the man in _The Pirate\'s Bride_ ought to have\r\ndone," said Reginald, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n"To be sure he ought.  Why, it\'s enough to disgust any one with the\r\nflat, when he goes and takes the prussic hisself.  Of course he\'d get\r\nfound out."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s just as well you\'ve not put any in my coffee," said\r\nReginald.  "It\'s none too nice as it is.  And I\'d advise you, young\r\nfellow, to burn all those precious story-books of yours, if that\'s the\r\nsort of stuff they put into your head."\r\n\r\nThe boy stared at him in horrified amazement.\r\n\r\n"Burn \'em!  Oh, Walker!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?" demanded Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Why, Love," replied the boy, in a tone as if to say you had only to\r\nlook at him to know his name.\r\n\r\n"Well then, young Love, clear these things away and come and make a\r\nstart with these envelopes."\r\n\r\n"No fear.  I ain\'t got to do no envellups.  You\'re got to do \'em."\r\n\r\n"I say you\'ve got to do them too," said Reginald, sternly; "and if you\r\ndon\'t choose to do what you\'re told I can\'t keep you here."\r\n\r\nThe boy looked up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t my governor," said he.\r\n\r\n"I am, though," said Reginald, "and you\'d better make up your mind to\r\nit.  If you choose to do as you\'re told we shall get on all right, but\r\nI\'ll not keep you here if you don\'t."\r\n\r\nHis tone and manner effectually overawed the mutinous youngster.  He\r\ncould not have spoken like that unless he possessed sufficient authority\r\nto back it up, and as it did not suit the convenience of Mr Love just\r\nthen to receive the "sack" from any one, he capitulated with the honours\r\nof war, put his _Tim Tigerskin_ into his pocket, and placed himself at\r\nhis new "governor\'s" disposal.\r\n\r\nThe evening\'s work consisted in addressing some two hundred or three\r\nhundred envelopes to persons whose names Mr Medlock had ticked in a\r\ndirectory, and enclosing prospectuses therein.  It was not very\r\nentertaining work; still, as it was his first introduction to the\r\noperations of the Corporation, it had its attractions for the new\r\nsecretary.  A very fair division of labour was mutually agreed upon by\r\nthe two workers before starting.  Reginald was to copy out the\r\naddresses, and Master Love, whose appetite was always good, was to fold\r\nand insert the circulars and "lick up" the envelopes.\r\n\r\nThis being decided, the work went on briskly and quietly.  Reginald had\r\nleisure to notice one or two little points as he went on, which, though\r\ntrivial in themselves, still interested him.  He observed for one thing\r\nthat the largest proportion of the names marked in the directory were\r\neither ladies or clergymen, and most of them residing in the south of\r\nEngland.  Very few of them appeared to reside in any large town, but to\r\nprefer rural retreats "far from the madding crowd," where doubtless a\r\nletter, even on the business of the Corporation, would be a welcome\r\ndiversion to the monotony of existence.  As to the clergy, doubtless\r\ntheir names had been suggested by the good Bishop of S--, who would be\r\nin a position to introduce a considerable connection to his fellow-\r\ndirectors.  Reginald also noticed that only one name had been marked in\r\neach village, it doubtless being assumed that every one in these places\r\nbeing on intimate terms with his neighbour, it was unnecessary to waste\r\nstamps and paper in making the Corporation known to two people where one\r\nwould answer the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe was curious enough to read one of the circulars, and he was on the\r\nwhole pleased with its contents.  It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n"Select Agency Corporation, Shy Street, Liverpool.--Reverend Sir," (for\r\nthe ladies there were other circulars headed "Dear Madam"), "The\r\napproach of winter, with all the hardships that bitter season entails on\r\nthose whom Providence has not blessed with sufficient means, induces us\r\nto call your attention to an unusual opportunity for providing yourself\r\nand those dear to you with a most desirable comfort at a merely nominal\r\noutlay.  Having acquired an enormous bankrupt stock of _winter clothing_\r\nof most excellent material, and suitable for all measures, we wish, in\r\ntestimony to our respect for the profession of which you are an honoured\r\nrepresentative, to acquaint you _privately_ with the fact before\r\ndisposing of the stock in the open market.  For L3 we can supply you\r\nwith a complete clerical suit of the best make, including overcoat and\r\ngloves, etcetera, etcetera, the whole comprising an outfit which would\r\nbe cheap at L10.  In _your_ case we should have no objection to meet you\r\nby taking L2 with your order and the balance _any time within six\r\nmonths_.  Should you be disposed to show this to any of your friends, we\r\nmay say we shall be pleased to appoint you our agent, and to allow you\r\nten per cent, on all sales effected by you, which you are at liberty to\r\ndeduct from the amount you remit to us with the orders.  We subjoin full\r\nlist of winter clothing for gentlemen, ladies, and children.  Money\r\norders to be made payable to Cruden Reginald, Esquire, Secretary, 13,\r\nShy Street, Liverpool."\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said Reginald, looking up excitedly, "don\'t fold up any more of\r\nthose, boy.  They\'ve made a mistake in my name and called me Cruden\r\nReginald instead of Reginald Cruden.  It will have to be altered."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah.  There\'s on\'y a couple of billions on \'em printed; that won\'t\r\ntake no time at all," said Master Love, beginning to think longingly of\r\n_Tim Tigerskin_.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do to send them out like that," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, it will.  Bless you, what\'s the odds if you call me Tommy Love\r\nor Love Tommy?  I knows who you mean.  And the governor, \'e is awful\r\npartickler about these here being done to-night.  And we sent off\r\nmillions on \'em last week.  My eye, wasn\'t it a treat lickin\' up the\r\nenvellups!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say a lot of the circulars have been sent already?"\r\n\r\n"\'Undreds of grillions on \'em," replied the boy.\r\n\r\nOf course it was no use after that delaying these; so Reginald finished\r\noff his task, not a little vexed at the mistake, and determined to have\r\nit put right without delay.\r\n\r\nIt was this cause of irritation, most likely, which prevented his\r\ndwelling too critically on the substance of the circular so\r\naffectionately dedicated to the poor country clergy.  Beyond vaguely\r\nwondering where the Corporation kept their "bankrupt" stock of clothing,\r\nand how by the unaided light of nature they were to decide whether their\r\napplicants were stout or lean, or tall or short, he dismissed the matter\r\nfrom his mind for the time being, and made as short work as possible of\r\nthe remainder of the task.\r\n\r\nThen he wrote a short line home, announcing his arrival in as cheerful\r\nwords as he could muster, and walked out to post it.  The pavements were\r\nthronged with a crowd of jostling men and women, returning home from the\r\nday\'s work; but among them all the boy felt more lonely than had he been\r\nthe sole inhabitant of Liverpool.  Nobody knew him, nobody looked at\r\nhim, nobody cared two straws about him.  So he dropped his letter\r\ndismally into the box, and turned back to Shy Street, where at least\r\nthere was one human being who knew his name and heeded his voice.\r\n\r\nMaster Love had made the most of his opportunities.  He had lit a candle\r\nand stuck it into the mouth of an ink-bottle, and by its friendly light\r\nwas already deep once more in the history of his hero.\r\n\r\n"Say, what\'s yer name," said he, looking up as Reginald re-entered,\r\n"this here chap" as scuttled a ship, and drowned twenty on \'em. _\'E_ was\r\na cute \'un, and no error.  He rigs hisself up as a carpenter, and takes\r\na tile off the ship\'s bottom just as the storm was a-coming on; and in\r\ncorse she flounders and all \'ands."\r\n\r\n"And what became of him?" asked Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Oh, in corse he stows hisself away in the boat with a lifebelt, and\r\ngets washed ashore; and he kills a tiger for \'is breakfast, and--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity you waste your time over bosh like that," said Reginald,\r\nnot interested to hear the conclusion of the heroic Tim\'s adventures;\r\n"if you\'re fond of reading, why don\'t you get something better?"\r\n\r\n"No fear--I like jam; don\'t you make no error, governor."\r\n\r\nWith which philosophical albeit enigmatical conclusion he buried his\r\nface once more in his hands, and immersed himself in the literary "jam"\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nReginald half envied him as he himself sat listless and unoccupied\r\nduring that gloomy evening.  He did his best to acquaint himself, by the\r\naid of papers and circulars scattered about the room, with the work that\r\nlay before him.  He made a careful tour of the premises, with a view to\r\npossible alterations and improvements.  He settled in his own mind where\r\nthe directors\' table should stand, and in which corner of the private\r\nroom he should establish his own desk.  He went to the length of\r\ndesigning a seal for the Corporation, and in scribbling, for his own\r\namusement, the imaginary minutes of an imaginary meeting of the\r\ndirectors.  How would this do?\r\n\r\n"A meeting of directors of the Select Agency Corporation"--by the way,\r\nwas it "Limited"?  He didn\'t very clearly understand what that meant.\r\nStill, most companies had the word after their name, and he made a note\r\nto inquire of Mr Medlock whether it applied to them--"was held on\r\nOctober 31st at the company\'s offices.  Present, the Bishop of S-- in\r\nthe chair, Messrs. Medlock, Blank, M.P., So-and-so, etcetera.  The\r\nsecretary, Mr Cruden, having been introduced, took his seat and thanked\r\nthe directors for their confidence.  It was reported that the receipts\r\nfor the last month had been (well, say) L1,000, including L50 deposited\r\nagainst shares by the new secretary, and the expenses L750.  Mr Medlock\r\nreported the acquisition of a large bankrupt stock of clothing, which it\r\nwas proposed to offer privately to a number of clergymen and others as\r\nper a list furnished by the right reverend the chairman.  The following\r\ncheques were drawn:--Rent for offices for a month, L5; printing and\r\npostage, L25; secretary\'s salary for one month, L12 10 shillings; ditto,\r\ninterest on the L50 deposit, 4 shillings 2 pence; office-boy (one\r\nmonth), L2; Mr Medlock for bankrupt stock of clothing, L150; etcetera,\r\netcetera.  The secretary suggested various improvements in the offices\r\nand fittings, and was requested to take any necessary steps.  After\r\nsundry other routine business the Board adjourned."\r\n\r\nThis literary experiment concluded, Reginald, who after the fatigues and\r\nexcitement of the day felt ready for sleep, decided to adjourn too.\r\n\r\n"Do you stay here all night?" said he to Love.\r\n\r\n"Me?  You and me sleeps upstairs."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid there\'s no room up there for two persons," said Reginald;\r\n"you had better go home to-night, Love, and be here at nine in the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Go on--as if I \'ad lodgin\'s in the town.  If you don\'t want me I know\r\none as do.  Me and the chemist\'s boy ain\'t too big for the attick."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Reginald, "you had better go up to bed now, it\'s\r\nlate."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think you\'re having a lark with me," said the boy; "\'tain\'t\r\neleven, and I ain\'t done this here Tigerskin yet.  There\'s a lump of\r\nreading in it, I can tell you.  When he\'d killed them tigers he rigged\r\nhisself up in their skins, and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Reginald.  "I\'m not going to let you stay up all night\r\nreading that rot.  Cut up to bed now, do you hear?"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the boy obeyed.  There was something about Reginald\r\nwhich reduced him to obedience, though much against his will.  So he\r\nshambled off with his book under his arm, secretly congratulating\r\nhimself that the bed in the attic was close to the window, so that he\r\nwould be able to get a jolly long read in the morning.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone, Reginald followed his example, and retired to his own\r\nvery spare bed, where he forgot all his cares in a night of sound\r\nrefreshing sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SELECT AGENCY CORPORATION LOSES ITS OFFICE-BOY.\r\n\r\nMr Medlock duly appeared next morning.  He greeted the new secretary\r\nwith much friendliness, hoped he had a good journey and left them all\r\nwell at home, and so on.  He further hoped Reginald would find his new\r\nquarters comfortable.  Most unfortunately they had missed securing the\r\nlease of a very fine suite of offices in Lord Street, and had to put up\r\nwith these for the present.  Reginald must see everything was\r\ncomfortable; and as of course he would be pretty closely tied to the\r\nplace (for the directors would not like the offices left in charge of a\r\nmere office-boy), he must make it as much of a home as possible.\r\n\r\nAs to money, salaries were always paid quarterly, and on Christmas Day\r\nReginald would receive his first instalment.  Meanwhile, as there were\r\nsure to be a few expenses, Reginald would receive five pounds on account\r\n(a princely allowance, equal to about thirteen shillings a week for the\r\neight weeks between now and Christmas!)\r\n\r\nThe directors, Mr Medlock said, placed implicit confidence in the new\r\nsecretary.  He was authorised to open all letters that came.  Any money\r\nthey might contain he was strictly to account for and pay into the bank\r\ndaily to Mr Medlock\'s account.  He needn\'t send receipts, Mr Medlock\r\nwould see to that.  Any orders that came he was to take copies of, and\r\nthen forward them to Mr John Smith, Weaver\'s Hotel, London, "to be\r\ncalled for," for execution.  He would have to answer the questions of\r\nany who called to make inquiries, without of course disclosing any\r\nbusiness secrets.  In fact, as the aim of the Corporation was to supply\r\ntheir supporters with goods at the lowest possible price, they naturally\r\nmet with a good deal of jealousy from tradesmen and persons of that\r\nsort, so that Reginald must be most guarded in all he said.  If it\r\nbecame known how their business was carried on, others would be sure to\r\nattempt an imitation; and the whole scheme would fail.\r\n\r\n"You know, Mr Reginald," said he--\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," interrupted Reginald, "I\'m afraid you\'re mistaken about my\r\nname.  You\'ve printed it Cruden Reginald, it should be Reginald Cruden."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, how extraordinarily unfortunate!" said Mr Medlock; "I quite\r\nunderstood that was your name.  And the unlucky part of it is, we have\r\ngot all the circulars printed, and many of them circulated.  I have also\r\ngiven your name as Mr Reginald to the directors, and advertised it, so\r\nthat I don\'t see what can be done, except to keep it as it is.  After\r\nall, it is a common thing, and it would put us to the greatest\r\ninconvenience to alter it now.  Dear me, when I saw you in London I\r\ncalled you Mr Reginald, didn\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; you called me Mr Cruden."\r\n\r\n"I must have supposed it was your Christian name, then."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it doesn\'t matter much," said Reginald; "and I don\'t wish to\r\nput the directors to any trouble."\r\n\r\n"To be sure I knew you would not.  Well, I was saying, Reginald (that\'s\r\nright, whatever way you take it!) the directors look upon you as a\r\ngentleman of character and education, and are satisfied to allow you to\r\nuse your discretion and good sense in conducting their business.  You\r\nhave their names, which you can show to any one.  They are greatly\r\nscattered, so that our Board meetings will be rare.  Meanwhile they will\r\nbe glad to hear how you are getting on, and will, I know, appreciate and\r\nrecognise your services.  By the way, I believe I mentioned (but really\r\nmy memory is so bad) that we should ask you to qualify to the extent of\r\nL50 in the shares of the company?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I have the cheque here," said Reginald, taking it out of his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right.  And of course you will give yourself a receipt for it in\r\nthe company\'s name.  Curious, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nWith which pleasantry Mr Medlock departed, promising to look in\r\nfrequently, and meanwhile to send in a fresh directory marked, and some\r\nnew circulars for him to get on with.\r\n\r\nReginald, not quite sure whether it was all as good as he expected, set\r\nto work without delay to put into practice the various instructions he\r\nhad received.\r\n\r\nMr Medlock\'s invitation to him to see everything was comfortable could\r\nhardly be fully realised on 13 shillings a week.  That must wait for\r\nChristmas, and meanwhile he must make the best of what he had.\r\n\r\nHe set Love to work folding and enclosing the new circulars (this time\r\ncalling attention to some extremely cheap globes and blackboards for\r\nladies\' and infants\' schools), while he drew himself up a programme of\r\nhis daily duties, in accordance with his impression of the directors\'\r\nwishes.  The result of this was that he came to the conclusion he should\r\nhave his hands very full indeed--a possibility he by no means objected\r\nto.\r\n\r\nBut it was not clear to him how he was to get much outdoor exercise or\r\nrecreation, or how he was to go to church on Sundays, or even to the\r\nbank on weekdays, if the office was never to be left.  On this point he\r\nconsulted Mr Medlock when he called in later in the day, and arranged\r\nthat for two hours on Sunday, and an hour every evening, besides the\r\nnecessary walk to the bank, he might lock up the office and take his\r\nwalks abroad.  Whereat he felt grateful and a little relieved.\r\n\r\nIt was not till about four days after his arrival that the first crop of\r\ncirculars sown among the clergy yielded their firstfruits.  On that day\r\nit was a harvest with a vengeance.  At least 150 letters arrived.  Most\r\nof them contained the two pounds and an order for the suit.  In some\r\ncases most elaborate measurements accompanied the order.  Some asked for\r\nHigh Church waistcoats, others for Low; some wished for wideawake hats,\r\nothers for broad-brimmed clericals.  Some sent extra money for a school-\r\nboy\'s suit as well, and some contained instructions for a complete\r\nfamily outfit.  All were very eager about the matter, and one or two\r\nbegged that the parcel might be sent marked "private."\r\n\r\nReginald had a busy day from morning till nearly midnight, entering and\r\npaying in the cash and forwarding the orders to Mr John Smith.  He\r\norganised a beautiful tabular account, in which were entered the name\r\nand address of each correspondent, the date of their letters, the goods\r\nthey ordered, and the amount they enclosed, and before the day was over\r\nthe list had grown to a startling extent.\r\n\r\nThe next day brought a similar number of applications and remittances as\r\nto the globes and blackboards, and of course some more also about the\r\nclerical suits.  And so, from day to day, the post showered letters in\r\nat the door, and the secretary of the Select Agency Corporation was one\r\nof the hardest worked men in Liverpool.\r\n\r\nMaster Love meanwhile had very little time for his "penny dreadfuls,"\r\nand complained bitterly of his hardships.  And indeed he looked so pale\r\nand unhealthy that Reginald began to fear the constant "licking" was\r\nundermining his constitution, and ordered him to use a sponge instead of\r\nhis tongue.  But on this point Love\'s loyalty made a stand.  Nothing\r\nwould induce him to use the artificial expedient.  He deliberately made\r\naway with the sponge, and after a battle royal was allowed his own way,\r\nand continued to lick till his tongue literally clave to the roof of his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nBy the end of a fortnight the first rush of work was over, and Reginald\r\nand his henchman had time to draw breath.  Mr Medlock had gone to\r\nLondon, presumably to superintend the dispatch of the various articles\r\nordered.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Reginald had written home to Horace\r\ncomplaining of the dulness of his life, and begging him to repay\r\nBlandford the 6 shillings 6 pence, which had been weighing like lead on\r\nhis mind ever since he left town, and which he now despaired of ever\r\nbeing able to spare out of the slender pittance on which he was doomed\r\nto subsist till Christmas.  Happily that festive season was only a few\r\nweeks away now, and then how delighted he should be to send home a round\r\nhalf of his income, and convince himself he was after all a main prop to\r\nthat dear distant little household.\r\n\r\nHad he been gifted with ears sharp enough to catch a conversation that\r\ntook place at the Bodega in London one evening about the same time, the\r\nChristmas spirit within him might have experienced a considerable chill.\r\n\r\nThe company consisted of Mr Medlock, Mr Shanklin, and Mr Durfy.  The\r\nlatter was present by sufferance, not because he was wanted or invited,\r\nbut because he felt inclined for a good supper, and was sharp enough to\r\nknow that neither of his employers could afford to fall out with him\r\njust then.\r\n\r\n"Well, how goes it?" said Mr Shanklin.  "You\'ve had a run lately, and\r\nno mistake."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I flatter myself we\'ve done pretty well.  One hundred pounds a day\r\nfor ten days makes how much, Durfy?"\r\n\r\n"A thousand," said Durfy.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said Mr Shanklin.  "Time to think of our Christmas holidays."\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit.  We\'ve not done yet.  You say your two young mashers are\r\nstill in tow, Alf?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; green as duckweed.  But they\'re nearly played out, I guess.  One\r\nof them has a little bill for fifty pounds coming due in a fortnight,\r\nand t\'other--well, he wagered me a hundred pounds on a horse that never\r\nran for the Leger, and he\'s got one or two trifles besides down in my\r\nbooks."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I got you that tip about the Leger," said Durfy, beginning to\r\nthink himself neglected in this dialogue of self-congratulation.\r\n\r\n"Yes; you managed to do it this time without botching it, for a wonder!"\r\nsaid Mr Shanklin.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and I hope you\'ll manage to give me the ten-pound note you\r\npromised me for it, Mr S.," replied Durfy, with a snarl.  "You seem to\r\nhave forgotten that, and my commission too for finding you your new\r\nsecretary."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  By the way," said Mr Medlock, "he deserves something for that;\r\nit\'s the best stroke of business we\'ve done for a long time.  It\'s worth\r\nthree weeks to us to have him there to answer questions and choke off\r\nthe inquisitive.  He\'s got his busy time coming on, I fancy.  Bless you,\r\nDurfy, the fellow was born for us!  He swallows anything.  I\'ve allowed\r\nhim thirteen shillings a week till Christmas, and he says, `Thank you.\'\r\nHe\'s had his name turned inside out, and I do believe he thinks it an\r\nimprovement!  He sticks in the place all day with that young cockney\r\ngaol-bird you picked us up too, Durfy, and never growls."\r\n\r\n"Does he help himself to any of the money?"\r\n\r\n"Not a brass farthing!  I do believe he buys his own postage-stamps when\r\nhe writes home to his mamma!"\r\n\r\nThis last announcement was too comical to be received gravely.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! he ought to be exhibited!" said Shanklin.\r\n\r\n"He ought to be starved!" said Durfy viciously.  "He knocked me down\r\nonce, and I wouldn\'t have told you of him if I didn\'t owe him a grudge--\r\nthe puppy!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I daresay you\'ll be gratified some day or other," said\r\nMedlock.\r\n\r\n"I tell you one thing," said Durfy; "you\'d better put a stopper on his\r\nwriting home too often; I believe he\'s put his precious brother up to\r\nwatch me.  Why, the other night, when I was waiting for the postman to\r\nget hold of that letter you wanted, I\'m blessed if he didn\'t turn up and\r\nrout me out--he and a young chum of his brother\'s that used to be in the\r\nswim with me.  I don\'t think they saw me, luckily; but it was a shave,\r\nand of course I missed the letter."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did; there was no mistake about that!" said Mr Shanklin\r\nviciously.  "When did you ever not miss it?"\r\n\r\n"How can I help it, when it\'s your own secretary is dogging me?"\r\n\r\n"Bless you! think of him dogging any one, the innocent!  Anyhow, we can\r\ncut off his letters home for a bit, so as to give you no excuse next\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s the next job to be, then?" asked Durfy.\r\n\r\n"The most particular of all," replied the sporting man.  "I want a\r\nletter with the Boldham postmark, or perhaps a telegram, that will be\r\ndelivered to-morrow night by the last post.  There\'s a fifty pounds\r\nturns on it, and I must have it before the morning papers are out.\r\nNever mind what it is; you must get it somehow, and you\'ll get a fiver\r\nfor it.  As soon as that\'s done, Medlock, and the young dandies\' bills\r\nhave come due, we can order a cab.  Your secretary at Liverpool will\r\nhold out long enough for us to get to the moon before we\'re wanted."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right there!" said Mr Medlock, laughing.  "I\'ll go down and\r\nlook him up to-morrow, and clear up, and then I fancy he\'ll manage the\r\nrest himself; and we can clear out.  Ha, ha! capital sherry, this brand.\r\nHave some more, Durfy."\r\n\r\nMr Medlock kept his promise and cheered Reginald in his loneliness by a\r\nfriendly visit.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been away longer than I expected, and I must say the way you have\r\nmanaged matters in my absence does you the greatest credit, Reginald.  I\r\nshall feel perfectly comfortable in future when I am absent."\r\n\r\nA flush of pleasure rose to Reginald\'s cheeks, such as would have moved\r\nto pity any heart less cold-blooded than Mr Medlock\'s.\r\n\r\n"No one has called, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir.  There\'s been a letter, though, from the Rev.  T.  Mulberry,\r\nof Woolford-in-the-Meadow, to ask why the suit he ordered has not yet\r\nbeen delivered."\r\n\r\nMr Medlock smiled.\r\n\r\n"These good men are so impatient," said he; "they imagine their order is\r\nthe only one we have to think of.  What would they think of the four\r\nhundred and odd suits we have on order, eh, Mr Reginald?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I had better write and say the orders will be taken in\r\nrotation, and that his will be forwarded in a few days."\r\n\r\n"Better say a few weeks.  You\'ve no notion of the difficulty we have in\r\ntrying to meet every one\'s wishes.  Say before Christmas--and the same\r\nwith the globes and other things.  The time and trouble taken in packing\r\nthe things really cuts into the profits terribly."\r\n\r\n"Could we do any of it down here?" said Reginald.  "Love and I have\r\noften nothing to do."\r\n\r\nIt was well the speaker did not notice the fiendish grimace with which\r\nthe young gentleman referred to accepted the statement.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very good," said Mr Medlock; "but I shouldn\'t think of it.  We\r\nwant you for head work.  There are plenty to be hired in London to do\r\nthe hand work.  By the way, I will take up the register of orders and\r\ncash you have been keeping, to check with the letters in town.  You\r\nwon\'t want it for a few days."\r\n\r\nReginald felt sorry to part with a work in which he felt such pride as\r\nthis beautifully kept register.  However, he had made it for the use of\r\nthe Corporation, and it was not his to withhold.\r\n\r\nAfter clearing up cautiously all round, with the result that Reginald\r\nhad very little besides pen, ink, and paper left him, Mr Medlock said\r\ngood morning.\r\n\r\n"I may have to run up to town for a few days," he said, "but I shall see\r\nyou again very soon, I hope.  Meanwhile, make yourself comfortable.  The\r\ndirectors are very favourably impressed with you already, and I hope at\r\nChristmas they may meet and tell you so in person.  Boy, make a parcel\r\nof these books and papers and bring them for me to my hotel."\r\n\r\nLove obeyed surlily.  He was only waiting for Mr Medlock\'s departure to\r\ndive into the mystery of _Trumpery Toadstool, or Murdered for a Lark_,\r\nin which he had that morning invested.  He made a clumsy parcel of the\r\nbooks, and then shambled forth in a somewhat homicidal spirit in Mr\r\nMedlock\'s wake down the street.\r\n\r\nAt the corner that gentleman halted till he came up.\r\n\r\n"Well, young fellow, picked any pockets lately?"\r\n\r\nThe boy scowled at him inquisitively.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Mr Medlock.  "I never said you had.  I\'m not going to\r\ntake you to the police-station, I\'m going to give you half a crown."\r\n\r\nThis put a new aspect on the situation.  Love brightened up as he\r\nwatched Mr Medlock\'s hand dive into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"What should you do with a half-crown if you had it?"\r\n\r\n"Do?  I know, and no error.  I\'d get the _Noogate Calendar_, that\'s what\r\nI\'d do."\r\n\r\n"You can read, then?"\r\n\r\n"Ray-ther; oh no, not me."\r\n\r\n"Can you read writing?"\r\n\r\n"In corse."\r\n\r\n"Do you always go to the post with the letters?"\r\n\r\n"In corse."\r\n\r\n"Do you ever see any addressed to Mrs Cruden or Mr Cruden in London?"\r\n\r\n"\'Bout once a week.  That there sekketery always gives \'em to me\r\nseparate, and says I\'m to be sure and post \'em."\r\n\r\n"Well, I say they\'re not to be posted," said Mr Medlock.  "Here\'s half\r\na crown; and listen: next time you get any to post put them on one side;\r\nand every one you can show me you shall have sixpence for.  Mind what\r\nyou\'re at, or he\'ll flay you alive if he catches you.  Off you go,\r\nthere\'s a good boy."\r\n\r\nAnd Love pocketed his half-crown greedily, and with a knowing wink at\r\nhis employer sped back to the office.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Reginald wrote a short polite note to the Rev.  T.\r\nMulberry, explaining to him the reason for any apparent delay in the\r\nexecution of his order, and promising that he should duly receive it\r\nbefore Christmas.  This was the only letter for the post that day, and\r\nLove had no opportunity of earning a further sixpence.\r\n\r\nHe had an opportunity of spending his half-crown, however, and when he\r\nreturned from the post he was radiant in face and stouter under the\r\nwaistcoat by the thickness of the coveted volume of the _Newgate\r\nCalendar_ series.\r\n\r\nWith the impetuosity characteristic of his age, he plunged into its\r\ncontents the moment he found himself free of work, and by the time\r\nReginald returned from his short evening stroll he was master of several\r\nof its stories.  _Tim Tigerskin_ and _The Pirate\'s Bride_ were nothing\r\nto it.  They all performed their incredible exploits on the other side\r\nof the world, but these heroes were beings of flesh and blood like\r\nhimself, and, for all he knew, he might have seen them and talked to\r\nthem, and have known some of the very spots in London which they\r\nfrequented.  He felt a personal interest in their achievements.\r\n\r\n"Say, governor," said he as soon as Reginald entered, "do you know\r\nSouthwark Road?"\r\n\r\n"In London?  Yes," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"This \'ere chap, Bright, was a light porter to a cove as kep\' a grocer\'s\r\nshop there, and one night when he was asleep in the arm-cheer he puts a\r\nsack on \'is \'ead and chokes \'im.  The old cove he struggles a bit,\r\nbut--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" said Reginald angrily.  "I\'ve told you quite often enough.\r\nGive me that book."\r\n\r\nAt the words and the tones in which they were uttered Love suddenly\r\nturned into a small fiend.  He struggled, he kicked, he cursed, he\r\nhowled to keep his treasure.  Reginald was inexorable, and of course it\r\nwas only a matter of time until the book was in his hands.  A glance at\r\nits contents satisfied him.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said he, holding the book behind his back and parrying all\r\nthe boy\'s frantic efforts to recover it, "don\'t make a fool of yourself,\r\nyoungster."\r\n\r\n"Give it to me!  Give me my book, you--"\r\n\r\nAnd the boy broke into a volley of oaths and flung himself once more\r\ntooth-and-nail on Reginald.  Already Reginald saw he had made a mistake.\r\nHe had done about the most unwise thing he possibly could have done.\r\nBut it was too late to undo it.  The only thing, apparently, was to go\r\nthrough with it now.  So he flung the book into the fire, and, catching\r\nthe boy by the arm, told him if he did not stop swearing and struggling\r\nat once he would make him.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not stop, and Reginald did make him.\r\n\r\nIt was a poor sort of victory, and no one knew it better than Reginald.\r\nIf the boy was awed into silence, he was no nearer listening to reason--\r\nnay, further than ever.  He slunk sulkily into a corner, glowering at\r\nhis oppressor and deaf to every word he uttered.  In vain Reginald\r\nexpostulated, coaxed, reasoned, even apologised.  The boy met it all\r\nwith a sullen scowl.  Reginald offered to pay him for the book, to buy\r\nhim another, to read aloud to him, to give him an extra hour a day--it\r\nwas all no use; the injury was too deep to wash out so easily; and\r\nfinally he had to give it up and trust that time might do what arguments\r\nand threats had failed to effect.\r\n\r\nBut in this he was disappointed; for next morning when nine o\'clock\r\narrived, no Love was there, nor as the day wore on did he put in an\r\nappearance.  When at last evening came, and still no signs of him,\r\nReginald began to discover that the sole result of his well-meant\r\ninterference had been to drive his only companion from him, and doom\r\nhimself henceforth to the miseries of solitary confinement.\r\n\r\nFor days he scarcely spoke a word.  The silence of that office was\r\nunearthly.  He opened the window, winter as it was, to let in the sound\r\nof cabs and footsteps for company.  He missed even the familiar rustle\r\nof the "penny dreadfuls" as the boy turned their pages.  He wished\r\nanybody, even his direst foe, might turn up to save him from dying of\r\nloneliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM HORACE.\r\n\r\n"Dear Reg," (so ran a letter from Horace which Reginald received a day\r\nor two after Master Love\'s desertion), "I\'m afraid you are having rather\r\na slow time up there, which is more than can be said for us here.\r\nThere\'s been no end of a row at the _Rocket_, which you may like to hear\r\nabout, especially as two of the chief persons concerned were your friend\r\nDurfy and your affectionate brother.\r\n\r\n"Granville, the sub-editor, came into the office where Booms and\r\nWaterford and I were working on Friday morning, and said, in his usual\r\nmild way,--\r\n\r\n"`I should like to know who generally clears the post-box in the\r\nmorning?\'\r\n\r\n"`I do,\' said Booms.  You know the way he groans when he speaks.\r\n\r\n"`The reason I want to know is, because I have an idea one or two\r\nletters lately have either been looked at or tampered with before the\r\neditor or I see them.\'\r\n\r\n"`I suppose I\'m to be given in charge?\' said Booms.  `I didn\'t do it;\r\nbut when once a man\'s suspected, what\'s the use of saying anything?\'\r\n\r\n"Even Granville couldn\'t help grinning at this.\r\n\r\n"`Nonsense, Booms.  I\'m glad to say I know you three fellows well enough\r\nby this time to feel sure it wasn\'t one of you.  I shouldn\'t have spoken\r\nto you about it if I had.\'\r\n\r\n"Booms seemed quite disappointed he wasn\'t to be made a martyr of after\r\nall.\r\n\r\n"`You think I know all about it?\' he said.\r\n\r\n"`No, I don\'t; and if you\'ll just listen without running away with\r\nridiculous notions, Booms,\' said Granville, warming up a bit, `I\'ll\r\nexplain myself.  Two letters during the last fortnight have been\r\nundoubtedly opened before I saw them.  They both arrived between eight\r\no\'clock in the evening and nine next morning, and they both came from\r\nsporting correspondents of ours in the country, and contained\r\ninformation of a private nature intended for our paper the next day.  In\r\none case it was about a horse race, and in the other about an important\r\nfootball match.  The letters were not tampered with for the purpose of\r\ngiving information to any other papers, because we were still the only\r\npaper who gave the news, so the probability is some one who wanted to\r\nbet on the event has tried to get hold of the news beforehand.\'\r\n\r\n"`I never made a bet in my life,\' said Booms.\r\n\r\n"We couldn\'t help laughing at this, for the stories he tells us of his\r\nterrific sporting exploits when he goes out of an evening in his high\r\ncollar would make you think he was the loudest betting man in London.\r\n\r\n"Granville laughed too.\r\n\r\n"`Better not begin,\' he said, and then blushed very red, as it occurred\r\nto him he had made an unintentional pun.  But we looked quite grave, and\r\ndid not give any sign of having seen it, and that put him on his feet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"`It\'s not a comfortable thing to happen,\' said he, `and what I want to\r\npropose is that one or two of you should stay late for a night or two\r\nand see if you can find out how it occurs.  There are one or two events\r\ncoming off during the next few days about which we expect special\r\ncommunications, so that very likely whoever it is may try again.  You\r\nmust be very careful, and I shall have to leave you to use your\r\ndiscretion, for I\'m so busy with the new Literary Supplement that I\r\ncannot stay myself.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, when he\'d gone we had a consultation, and of course it ended in\r\nWaterford and me determining to sit up.  Poor Booms\'s heart would break\r\nif he couldn\'t go `on the mash\' as usual; and though he tried to seem\r\nvery much hurt that he was not to stay, we could see he was greatly\r\nrelieved.  Waterford and I were rather glad, as it happened, for we\'d\r\nsome work on hand it just suited us to get a quiet evening for.\r\n\r\n"So I wrote a note to Miss Crisp.  Don\'t get excited, old man; she\'s a\r\nvery nice girl, but she\'s another\'s.  [By the way, Jemima asks after you\r\nevery time I meet her, which is once a week now; she\'s invited herself\r\ninto our shorthand class.] And after helping to rig old Booms up to the\r\nninety-nines, which wasn\'t easy work, for his `dicky\' kept twisting\r\nround to the side of his neck, and we had to pin it in three places\r\nbefore it would keep steady, I gave him the note and asked him would he\r\never be so kind as to take it round for me, as it was to ask Miss Crisp\r\nif she would go and keep my mother company during my absence.\r\n\r\n"After that I thought we should never get rid of him.  He insisted on\r\noverhauling every article of his toilet.  At least four more pins were\r\nadded to fix the restless dicky in its place on his manly breast.  We\r\npolished up his eye-glasses with wash-leather till the pewter nearly all\r\nrubbed off; we helped him roll his flannel shirt-sleeves up to the\r\nelbows for fear--horrible idea!--they should chance to peep out from\r\nbelow his cuffs; we devoted an anxious two minutes to the poising of his\r\nhat at the right angle, and then passed him affectionately from one to\r\nthe other to see he was all right.  After which he went off, holding my\r\nletter carefully in his scented handkerchief and saying--dear gay\r\ndeceiver!--that he envied us spending a cosy evening in that snug office\r\nby the fire!\r\n\r\n"The work Waterford and I have on hand is--tell it not in Gath, old man,\r\nand don\'t scorn a fellow off the face of the earth--to try to write\r\nsomething that will get into the Literary Supplement.  This supplement\r\nis a new idea of the editor\'s, and makes a sort of weekly magazine.  He\r\nwrites a lot of it himself, and we chip a lot of stuff for him out of\r\nother papers.  The idea of having a shot at it occurred to us both\r\nindependently, in a funny and rather humiliating way.  It seems\r\nWaterford, without saying a word to me or anybody, had sat down and\r\ncomposed some lines on the `Swallow\'--appropriate topic for this season\r\nof the year.  I at the same time, without saying a word to Waterford or\r\nanybody except mother, had sat down and, with awful groanings and\r\nwrestlings of mind, evolved a lucubration in prose on `Ancient and\r\nModern Athletic Sports.\'  Of course I crammed a lot of it up out of\r\nencyclopaedias and that sort of thing.  It was the driest rot you ever\r\nread, and I knew it was doomed before I sent it in.  But as it was\r\nwritten I thought I might try.  So, as of course I couldn\'t send it in\r\nunder my own name, I asked Miss Crisp if I might send it under hers.\r\nThe obliging little lady laughed and said, `Yes,\' but she didn\'t tell me\r\nat the same time that Waterford had come to her with his `Swallow\' and\r\nasked the very same thing.  A rare laugh she must have had at our\r\nexpense!  Well, I sent mine in and Waterford sent in his.\r\n\r\n"We were both very abstracted for the next few days, but little guessed\r\nour perturbation arose from the same cause.  Then came the fatal\r\nWednesday--the `d.w.t.\' day as we call it--for Granville always saves up\r\nhis rejected addresses for us to `decline with thanks\' for Wednesdays.\r\nThere was a good batch of them this day, so Waterford and I took half\r\neach.  I took a hurried skim through mine, but no `Ancient and Modern\r\nAthletic Sports\' were there.  I concluded therefore Waterford had it.\r\nGranville writes in the corner of each `d.w.t.,\' or `d.w.t. note,\' which\r\nmeans `declined with thanks\' pure and simple, or `declined with thanks\'\r\nand a short polite note to be written at the same time stating that the\r\nsub-editor, while recognising some merit in the contribution, regretted\r\nit was not suitable for the Supplement.  I polished off my pure and\r\nsimple first, and then began to tackle the notes.  About the fourth I\r\ncame to considerably astonished me.  It was a couple of mild sonnets on\r\nthe `Swallow,\' with the name M.E.  Crisp attached!\r\n\r\n"`Hullo,\' I said to Waterford, tossing the paper over to him, `here\'s\r\nMiss Crisp writing some verses.  I should have thought she could write\r\nbetter stuff than that, shouldn\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n"Waterford, very red in the face, snatched up the paper and glanced at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"`Do you think they\'re so bad?\' said he.\r\n\r\n"`Frightful twaddle,\' said I; `fancy any one saying--\'"\r\n\r\n  "The drowsy year from winter\'s sleep ye wake,\r\n  Yet two of ye do not a summer make."\r\n\r\n"`Well,\' said he, grinning, `you\'d better tell her straight off it\'s\r\nbosh, and then she\'s not likely to make a fool of herself again.  Hullo,\r\nthough, I say,\' he exclaimed, picking up a paper in front of him, every\r\nsmudge and blot of which I knew only too well, `why, she\'s at it again.\r\nWhat\'s this?\r\n\r\n"`"Ancient and Mod--" Why, it\'s in your writing; did you copy it out for\r\nher?\'\r\n\r\n"`I wrote that out, yes,\' said I, feeling it my turn to colour up and\r\nlook sheepish.\r\n\r\n"Waterford glanced rapidly through the first few lines, and then said,--\r\n\r\n"`Well, all I can say is, it\'s a pity she didn\'t stick to poetry.  I\'m\r\nsure the line about waking the drowsy year is a jolly sight better than\r\nthis awful rot.\'\r\n\r\n"`Though we are not told so in so many words, we may reasonably conclude\r\nthat athletic sports were not unpractised by Cain and Abel prior to the\r\ndeath of the latter!\r\n\r\n"`As if they could have done it after!\'\r\n\r\n"`I never said they could,\' I said, feeling very much taken down.\r\n\r\n"`Oh--it was you composed it as well as wrote it, was it?\' said he\r\nlaughing.  `Ho, ho! that\'s the best joke I ever heard.  Poor little\r\nCrisp, what a shame to get her to father--or mother a thing like this;\r\nha, ha! "prior to the death of the latter"--that\'s something like a play\r\nof language!  My eye, what a game she\'s been having with us!\'\r\n\r\n"`_Us_! then you\'re the idiot who wrote about the Swallows!\' said I.\r\n\r\n"`Suppose I am,\' said he, blushing all over, `suppose I am.\'\r\n\r\n"`Well, all I can say is, I\'m precious glad the little Crisp isn\'t\r\nguilty of it.  "Two of ye do not a summer make," indeed!\'\r\n\r\n"`Well, they don\'t,\' said he.\r\n\r\n"`I know they don\'t,\' said I, half dead with laughing, `but you needn\'t\r\ngo and tell everybody.\'\r\n\r\n"`I\'m sure it\'s just as interesting as "Cain and Abel"--\'\r\n\r\n"`There now, we don\'t want to hear any more about them,\' said I, `but I\r\nthink we ought to send them both back to Miss Crisp, to give her her\r\nlaugh against us too.\'\r\n\r\n"We did so; and I needn\'t tell you she lets us have it whenever we get\r\nwithin twenty yards of her.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a long digression, but it may amuse you; and you said you wanted\r\nsomething to read.\r\n\r\n"Well, Waterford and I recovered in a few days from our first reverse,\r\nand decided to have another shot; and so we were rather glad of the\r\nquiet evening at the office to make our new attempts.  We half thought\r\nof writing a piece between us, but decided we\'d better go on our own\r\nhooks after all, as our styles were not yet broken in to one another.\r\nWe agreed we had better this time both write on subjects we knew\r\nsomething about; Waterford accordingly selected `A Day in a Sub-Sub-\r\nEditor\'s Life\' as a topic he really could claim to be familiar with;\r\nwhile I pitched upon `Early Rising,\' a branch of science in which I\r\nflatter myself, old man, _you_ are not competent to tell me whether I\r\nexcel or not.  Half the battle was done when we had fixed on our\r\nsubjects; so as soon as every one was gone we poked up the fire and made\r\nourselves snug, and settled down to work.\r\n\r\n"We plodded on steadily till we heard the half-past nine letters dropped\r\ninto the box.  Then it occurred to us we had better turn down the lights\r\nand give our office as deserted a look as we could.  It was rather slow\r\nwork sitting in the dark for a couple of hours, not speaking a word or\r\ndaring to move a toe.  The fire got low, but we dared not make it up;\r\nand of course we both had awful desires to sneeze and cough--you always\r\ndo at such times--and half killed ourselves in our efforts to smother\r\nthem.  We could hear the cabs and omnibuses in Fleet Street keeping up a\r\nregular roar; but no footsteps came near us, except once when a\r\ntelegraph boy (as we guessed by his shrill whistling and his smart step)\r\ncame and dropped a telegram into the box.  I assure you the click the\r\nflap of the letter-box made that moment, although I knew what it was and\r\nwhy it was, made my heart beat like a steam-engine.\r\n\r\n"It was beginning to get rather slow when twelve came and still nothing\r\nto disturb us.  We might have been forging ahead with our writing all\r\nthis time if we had only known.\r\n\r\n"Presently Waterford whispered,--\r\n\r\n"`They won\'t try to-night now.\'\r\n\r\n"Just as he spoke we heard a creak on the stairs outside.  We had heard\r\nlots of creaks already, but somehow this one startled us both.  I\r\ninstinctively picked up the ruler from the table, and Waterford took my\r\narm and motioned me close to the wall beside him.  Another creak came\r\npresently and then another.  Evidently some one was coming down the\r\nstairs cautiously, and in the dark too, for we saw no glimmer of a light\r\nthrough the partly-opened door.  We were behind it, so that if it opened\r\nwe should be quite hidden unless the fellow groped round it.\r\n\r\n"Down he came slowly, and there was no mistake now about its being a\r\nhuman being and not a ghost, for we heard him clearing his throat very\r\nquietly and snuffling as he reached the bottom step.  I can tell you it\r\nwas rather exciting, even for a fellow of my dull nerves.\r\n\r\n"Waterford nudged me to creep a little nearer the gas, ready to turn it\r\nup at a moment\'s notice, while he kept at the door, to prevent our man\r\ngetting out after he was once in.\r\n\r\n"Presently the door opened very quietly.  He did not fling it wide open,\r\nluckily, or he was bound to spot us behind it; but he opened it just\r\nenough to squeeze in, and then, feeling his way round by the wall, made\r\nstraight for the letter-box.  Although it was dark he seemed to know his\r\nway pretty well, and in a few seconds we heard him stop and fumble with\r\na key in the lock.  In a second or two he had opened it, and then,\r\ncrouching down, began cautiously to rub a match on the floor.  The light\r\nwas too dim to see anything but the crouching figure of a man bending\r\nover the box and examining the addresses of one or two of the letters in\r\nit.  His match went out before he had found what he wanted.\r\n\r\n"It was hard work to keep from giving him a little unexpected light, for\r\nmy fingers itched to turn up the gas.  However, it was evidently better\r\nto wait a little longer and see what he really was up to before we were\r\ndown on him.\r\n\r\n"He lit another match, and this time seemed to find what he wanted, for\r\nwe saw him put one letter in his pocket and drop all the others back\r\ninto the box, blowing out his match as he did so.\r\n\r\n"Now was our time.  I felt a nudge from Waterford and turned the gas\r\nfull on, while he quietly closed the door and turned the key.\r\n\r\n"I felt quite sorry for the poor scared beggar as he knelt there and\r\nturned his white face to the light, unable to move or speak or do\r\nanything.  You\'ll have guessed who it was.\r\n\r\n"`So, Mr Durfy,\' said Waterford, leaning up against the door and\r\nfolding his arms, `it\'s you, is it?\'\r\n\r\n"The culprit glared at him and then at me, and rose to his feet with a\r\nforced laugh.\r\n\r\n"`It looks like it,\' he said.\r\n\r\n"`So it does,\' said Waterford, taking the key out of the door and\r\nputting it in his pocket; `very like it.  And it looks very much as if\r\nhe would have to make himself comfortable here till Mr Granville\r\ncomes!\'\r\n\r\n"`What do you mean?\' exclaimed the fellow.  `I\'ve as much right to be\r\nhere as you have, for the matter of that, at this hour.\'\r\n\r\n"`Very _well_, then,\' said Waterford, as cool as a cucumber, `we\'ll all\r\nthree stay here.  Eh, Cruden?\'\r\n\r\n"`I\'m game,\' said I.\r\n\r\n"He evidently didn\'t like the turn things were taking, and changed his\r\ntack.\r\n\r\n"`Come, don\'t play the fool!\' he said coaxingly, `The fact is, I\r\nexpected a letter from a friend, and as it was very important I came to\r\nget it.  It\'s all right.\'\r\n\r\n"`You may think so,\' said Waterford; `you may think it\'s all right to\r\ncome here on tiptoe at midnight with a false key, and steal, but other\r\npeople may differ from you, that\'s all!  Besides, you\'re telling a lie;\r\nthe letter you\'ve got in your pocket doesn\'t belong to you!\'\r\n\r\n"It was rather a rash challenge, but we could see by the way his face\r\nfell it was a good shot.\r\n\r\n"He uttered an oath, and advanced threateningly towards the door.\r\n\r\n"`Sit down,\' said Waterford, `unless you want to be tied up.  There are\r\ntwo of us here, and we\'re not going to stand any nonsense, I can tell\r\nyou!\'\r\n\r\n"`You\'ve no right--\'\r\n\r\n"`Sit down, and shut up!\' repeated Waterford.\r\n\r\n"`I tell you if you--\'\r\n\r\n"`Cruden, you\'ll find some cord in one of those drawers.  If you don\'t\r\nshut up, and sit down, Durfy, we shall make you.\'\r\n\r\n"He caved in after that, and I was rather glad we hadn\'t to go to\r\nextremes.\r\n\r\n"`Hadn\'t we better get the letter?\' whispered I.\r\n\r\n"`No; he\'d better fork it out to Granville,\' said Waterford.\r\n\r\n"He was wrong for once, as you shall hear.\r\n\r\n"Durfy slunk off and sat down on a chair in the far corner of the room,\r\nswearing to himself, but not venturing to raise his voice above a growl.\r\n\r\n"It was now about half-past twelve, and we had the lively prospect of\r\nwaiting at least eight hours before Granville turned up.\r\n\r\n"`Don\'t you bother to stay,\' said Waterford.  `I can look after him.\'\r\n\r\n"But I scouted the idea, and said nothing would induce me to go.\r\n\r\n"`Very well, then,\' said he; `we may as well get on with our writing.\'\r\n\r\n"So we pulled our chairs up to the table, with a full-view of Durfy in\r\nthe corner, and tried to continue our lucubrations.\r\n\r\n"But when you are sitting up at dead of night, with a prisoner in the\r\ncorner of the room cursing and gnashing his teeth at you, it is not easy\r\nto grow eloquent either on the subject of `A Day in a Sub-sub-Editor\'s\r\nLife,\' or `Early Rising.\'  And so we found.  We gave it up presently,\r\nand made up the fire and chatted together in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Once or twice Durfy broke the silence.\r\n\r\n"`I\'m hungry,\' growled he, about two o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"`So are we,\' said Waterford.\r\n\r\n"`Well, go and get something.  I\'m not going to be starved, I tell you.\r\nI\'ll make you smart for it, both of you.\'\r\n\r\n"`You\'ve been told to shut up,\' said Waterford, rising to his feet with\r\na glance towards the drawer where the cord was kept.\r\n\r\n"Durfy was quiet after that for an hour or so.  Then I suppose he must\r\nhave overheard me saying something to Waterford about you, for he broke\r\nout with a vicious laugh,--\r\n\r\n"`Reginald!  Yes, he\'ll thank you for this.  I\'ll make it so hot for\r\nhim--\'\r\n\r\n"`Look here,\' said Waterford, `this is the last time you\'re going to be\r\ncautioned, Durfy.  If you open your mouth once more you\'ll be gagged;\r\nmind that.  I mean what I say.\'\r\n\r\n"This was quite enough for Durfy.  He made no further attempt to speak,\r\nbut curled himself up on the floor and turned his face to the wall, and\r\ndisposed himself to all appearances to sleep.  Whether he succeeded or\r\nnot I can\'t say.  But towards morning he glowered round at us.  Then he\r\ntook out some tobacco and commenced chewing it, and finally turned his\r\nback on us again and continued dozing and chewing alternately till the\r\neight o\'clock bell rang and aroused us.\r\n\r\n"Half an hour later Granville arrived, and a glance at our group was\r\nquite sufficient to acquaint him with the state of affairs.\r\n\r\n"`So this is the man,\' said he, pointing to Durfy.\r\n\r\n"`Yes, sir.  We caught him in the act of taking a letter out of the box\r\nat midnight.  In fact, he\'s got it in his pocket this moment.\'\r\n\r\n"Durfy gave a fiendish grin, and said,--\r\n\r\n"`That\'s a lie.  I\'ve no letter in my pocket!\'\r\n\r\n"And he proceeded to turn his pockets one after the other inside out.\r\n\r\n"`All I know is we both saw him take a letter out of the box and put it\r\nin his pocket,\' said Waterford.\r\n\r\n"`Yes,\' snarled Durfy, `and I told you it was a private letter of my\r\nown.\'\r\n\r\n"`Whatever the letter is, you took it out of the box, and you had better\r\nshow it quietly,\' said Granville; `it will save you trouble.\'\r\n\r\n"`I tell you I have no letter,\' replied Durfy again.\r\n\r\n"`Very well, then, Cruden, perhaps you will kindly fetch a policeman.\'\r\n\r\n"I started to go, but Durfy broke out, this time in tones of sincere\r\nterror,--\r\n\r\n"`Don\'t do that, don\'t ruin me!  I did take it, but--\'\r\n\r\n"`Give it to me then.\'\r\n\r\n"`I can\'t.  I\'ve eaten it!\'\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t this a thunderbolt!  How were we to prove whose the letter was?\r\nWild thoughts of a stomach-pump, or soap and warm water, did flash\r\nthrough my mind, but what was the use?  The fellow had done us after\r\nall, and we had to admit it.\r\n\r\n"No one stopped him as he went to the door, half scowling, half\r\ngrinning.\r\n\r\n"`Good morning, gentlemen!\' said he.  `I hope you\'ll get a better\r\nnight\'s rest to-morrow.  I promise not to disturb you,\' (here followed a\r\nfew oaths).  `But I\'ll pay you out, some of you--Crudens, Reginalds,\r\nsneaks, prigs--all of you!\'\r\n\r\n"With which neat peroration he took his leave, and the _Rocket_ has not\r\nseen him since.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a long screed!  I must pull up now.\r\n\r\n"Mother\'s not very well, she\'s fretting, I\'m afraid, and her eyes\r\ntrouble her.  I can\'t say we shall be sorry when Christmas comes, for\r\ntry all we can, we\'re in debt at one or two of the shops.  I know you\'ll\r\nhate to hear it, but it\'s simply unavoidable on our present means.  I\r\nwish I could come down and see you; but for one thing, I can\'t afford\r\nit, and for another, I can\'t leave mother.  Mrs Shuckleford is really\r\nvery kind, though she\'s not a congenial spirit.\r\n\r\n"Young Gedge and I see plenty of one another: he\'s joined our shorthand\r\nclass, and is going in for a little steady work all round.  He owes you\r\na lot for befriending him at the time you did, and he\'s not forgotten\r\nit.  I promised to send you his love next time I wrote.  Harker will be\r\nin town next week, which will be jolly.  I\'ve never seen Bland since I\r\ncalled to pay the 6 shillings 6 pence.  I fancy he\'s got into rather a\r\nfast lot, and is making a fool of himself, which is a pity.\r\n\r\n"You tell us very little about your Corporation; I hope it is going on\r\nall right.  I wish to goodness you were back in town.  I never was in\r\nlove with the concern, as you know, and at the risk of putting you in a\r\nrage, I can\'t help saying it\'s a pity we couldn\'t all have stayed\r\ntogether just now.  Forgive this growl, old man.\r\n\r\n"Your affectionate brother,--\r\n\r\n"Horace.\r\n\r\n"Wednesday, `d.w.t.\' day.  To our surprise and trepidation, neither the\r\n`Day in a Sub-Sub-editor\'s Life\' nor `Early Rising\' were among the\r\npapers given out to-day to be `declined with thanks.\'  Granville may\r\nhave put them into the fire as not even worth returning, or he may\r\nactually--_O mirabile dictu_--be going to put us into print?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nVISITORS AT NUMBER 13, SHY STREET.\r\n\r\nThe concluding sentences of Horace\'s long letter, particularly those\r\nwhich referred to his mother\'s poor health and the straitened\r\ncircumstances of the little household, were sufficiently unwelcome to\r\neclipse in Reginald\'s mind the other exciting news the letter had\r\ncontained.  They brought on a fit of the blues which lasted more than\r\none day.\r\n\r\nFor now that he had neither companion nor occupation (for the business\r\nof the Select Agency Corporation had fallen off completely) there was\r\nnothing to prevent his indulgence in low spirits.\r\n\r\nHe began to chafe at his imprisonment, and still more at his\r\nhelplessness even were he at liberty to do anything.  Christmas was\r\nstill a fortnight off, and till then what could he do on thirteen\r\nshillings a week?  He might cut down his commissariat certainly, to,\r\nsay, a shilling a day, and send home the rest.  But then, what about\r\ncoals and postage-stamps and other incidental expenses, which had to be\r\nmet in Mr Medlock\'s absence out of his own pocket?  The weather was\r\nvery cold--he could hardly do without coals, and he was bound in the\r\ninterests of the Corporation to keep stamps enough in the place to cover\r\nthe necessary correspondence.\r\n\r\nWhen all was said, two shillings seemed to be the utmost he could save\r\nout of his weekly pittance, and this he sent home by the very next post,\r\nwith a long, would-be cheerful, but really dismal letter, stoutly\r\ndenying that he was either miserable or disappointed with his new work,\r\nand anticipating with pleasure the possibility of being able to run up\r\nat Christmas and bring with him the welcome funds which would clear the\r\nfamily of debt and give it a good start for the New Year.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his letter home he wrote to Mr Medlock, very\r\nrespectfully suggesting that as he had been working pretty hard and for\r\nthe last few days single-handed, Mr Medlock might not object to advance\r\nhim at any rate part of the salary due in a fortnight, as he was rather\r\nin need of money.  And he ventured to ask, as Christmas Day fell on a\r\nThursday, and no business was likely to be done between that day and the\r\nfollowing Monday, might he take the _two_ or three days\' holiday,\r\nundertaking, of course, to be back at his post on the Monday morning?\r\nHe enclosed a few post-office orders which had come to hand since he\r\nlast wrote, and hoped he should soon have the pleasure of seeing Mr\r\nMedlock--"or anybody," he added to himself as he closed the letter and\r\nlooked wearily round the gaunt, empty room.\r\n\r\nNow, if Reginald had been a believer in fairies he would hardly have\r\nstarted as much as he did when, almost as the words escaped his lips,\r\nthe door opened, and a female marched into the room.\r\n\r\nA little prim female it was, with stiff curls down on her forehead and a\r\nvery sharp nose and very thin lips and fidgety fingers that seemed not\r\nto know whether to cling to one another for support or fly at the\r\ncountenance of somebody else.\r\n\r\nThis formidable visitor spared Reginald the trouble of inquiring to what\r\nfortunate circumstance he was indebted for the honour of so unlooked-for\r\na visit.\r\n\r\n"Now, sir!" said she, panting a little, after her ascent of the stairs,\r\nbut very emphatic, all the same.\r\n\r\nThe observation was not one which left much scope for argument, and\r\nReginald did not exactly know what to reply.  At last, however, he\r\nsummoned up resolution enough to say politely,--\r\n\r\n"Now, madam, can I be of any service?"\r\n\r\nInoffensive as the observation was, it had the effect of greatly\r\nirritating the lady.\r\n\r\n"None of your sauce, young gentleman," said she, putting down her bag\r\nand umbrella, and folding her arms defiantly.  "I\'ve not come here to\r\ntake any of your impertinence."\r\n\r\nReginald\'s impertinence!  He had never been rude to a lady in all his\r\nlife except once, and the penance he had paid for that sin had been\r\nbitter enough, as the reader can testify.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t pretend not to know what I\'ve come here for," continued the\r\nlady, taking a hasty glance round the room, as if mentally calculating\r\nfrom what door or window her victim would be most likely to attempt to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she\'s Love\'s mother!" gasped Reginald, to himself.--"Oh, but\r\nwhat a Venus!"\r\n\r\nThis classical reflection he prudently kept to himself, and waited for\r\nhis visitor to explain her errand further.\r\n\r\n"You know who I am," she said, walking up to him.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Reginald, hardly liking to retreat, but not quite\r\ncomfortable to be standing still.  "Unless--unless your name is Love."\r\n\r\n"Love!" screamed the outraged "Venus."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll Love you, young gentleman, before I\'ve done with you.  Love,\r\nindeed, you impudent sauce-box, you!"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," began Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Love, indeed!  I\'d like to scratch you, so I would!" cried the lady,\r\nwith a gesture so ominously like suiting the action to the word, that\r\nReginald fairly deserted his post and retreated two full paces.\r\n\r\nThis was getting critical.  Either the lady was mad, or she had mistaken\r\nReginald for some one else.  In either case he felt utterly powerless to\r\ndeal with the difficulty.  So like a prudent man he decided to hold his\r\ntongue and let the lady explain herself.\r\n\r\n"Love, indeed!" said she, for the third time.  "You saucy jackanapes,\r\nyou.  No, sir, my name\'s Wrigley!"\r\n\r\nShe evidently supposed this announcement would fall like a thunderbolt\r\non the head of her victim, and it disconcerted her not a little when he\r\nmerely raised his eyebrows and inclined his head politely.\r\n\r\n"Now do you know what I\'m come about?" said she.\r\n\r\n"No," replied he.\r\n\r\n"Yes you do.  You needn\'t think to deceive me, sir.  It won\'t do, I can\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\n"I _really_ don\'t know," said poor Reginald.  "Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m the lady who ordered the globe and blackboard, and sent two pounds\r\nalong with the order to you, Mr Cruden Reginald.  There!  _Now_ perhaps\r\nyou know what I\'ve come for!"\r\n\r\nIf she had expected Reginald to fly out of the window, or seek refuge up\r\nthe chimney, at this announcement, the composure with which he received\r\nthe overpowering disclosure must have considerably astonished her.\r\n\r\n"Eh?" she said.  "Eh?  Do you know me now?"\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt you are right," said he.  "We had more than a hundred\r\norders for the globes and boards, and expect they will be delivered this\r\nweek or next."\r\n\r\n"Oh! then you have been imposing on more than me?" said the lady, who\r\ntill this moment had imagined she had been the only correspondent of the\r\nCorporation on the subject.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been imposing on no one," said Reginald warmly.  "You have no\r\nright to say that, Mrs Wrigley."\r\n\r\nHis honest indignation startled the good lady.\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you send the things?" she demanded, in a milder tone.\r\n\r\n"There are a great many orders to attend to, and they have to be taken\r\nin order as we receive them.  Probably yours came a good deal later than\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"No, it didn\'t.  I wrote by return of post, and put an extra stamp on\r\ntoo.  You must have got mine one of the very first."\r\n\r\n"In that case you will be one of the first to receive your globe and\r\nboard."\r\n\r\n"I know that, young man," said she.  "I\'m going to take them with me\r\nnow!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you can\'t do that," said Reginald.  "They are being sent off\r\nfrom London."\r\n\r\nThe lady, who had somewhat moderated her wrath in the presence of the\r\nsecretary\'s unruffled politeness, fired up as fiercely as ever at this.\r\n\r\n"There!  I _knew_ it was a swindle!  From London, indeed!  Might as well\r\nsay New York at once!  _I\'m_ not going to believe your lies, you young\r\nrobber!  Don\'t expect it!"\r\n\r\nIt was a considerable tax on Reginald\'s temper to be addressed in\r\nlanguage like this, even by a lady, and he could not help retorting\r\nrather hotly, "I\'m glad you are only a woman, Mrs Wrigley, for I\r\nwouldn\'t stand being called a thief by a man, I assure you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t let that make any difference!" said she, fairly in a rage,\r\nand advancing up to him.  "Knock me down and welcome!  You may just as\r\nwell murder a woman as rob her!"\r\n\r\n"I can only tell you again your order is being executed in London."\r\n\r\n"And I can tell you I don\'t believe a word you say, and I\'ll just have\r\nmy two pounds back, and have done with you!  Come, you can\'t say you\r\nnever got _that_!"\r\n\r\n"If you sent it, I certainly did," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Then perhaps you\'ll hand it up this moment?"\r\n\r\n"I would gladly do so if I had it, but--"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s gone to London too?" said she, with supernatural\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\n"It has been paid in with all the money to the bank," said Reginald.\r\n"But if you wish it I will write to the managing director and ask him to\r\nreturn it by next post."\r\n\r\n"Will you?" said she, in tones that might have frozen any one less\r\nheated than Reginald.  "And you suppose I\'ve come all the way from\r\nDorsetshire to get that for an answer, do you?  You\'re mistaken, sir!  I\r\ndon\'t leave this place till I get my money or my things!  So now!"\r\n\r\n"Then," said Reginald, feeling the case desperate, and pushing a chair\r\nin her direction, "perhaps you\'d better sit down."\r\n\r\nShe glared round at him indignantly.  But perhaps it was the sight of\r\nhis haggard, troubled face, or the faint suspicion that he, after all,\r\nmight be more honest than his employers, or the reflection that she\r\ncould get her rights better out of the place than in it.  Whatever the\r\nreason was, she changed her mind.\r\n\r\n"You shall hear of me again, sir!" said she; "mind that!  Love, indeed!"\r\nwhereupon she bounced out of the office and slammed the door behind her.\r\n\r\nReginald sat with his eyes on the door for a full two minutes before he\r\ncould sufficiently collect his wits to know where he was or what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThen a sense of indignation overpowered all his other feelings--not\r\nagainst Mrs Wrigley, but against Mr Medlock, for leaving him in a\r\nposition where he could be, even in the remotest degree, open to so\r\nunpleasant a charge as that he had just listened to.\r\n\r\nWhy could he not be trusted with sufficient money and control over the\r\noperations of the Corporation to enable him to meet so unfounded a\r\ncharge?  What would the Bishop of S-- or the other directors think if\r\nthey heard that a lady had come all the way from Dorsetshire to tell\r\nthem they were a set of swindlers and thieves?  If he had had the\r\nsending off of the orders to see to, he was confident he could have got\r\nevery one of them off by this time, even if he had made up every parcel\r\nwith his own hands.\r\n\r\nWhat, in short, was the use of being called a secretary if he was armed\r\nwith no greater authority than a common junior clerk?\r\n\r\nHe opened the letter he had just written to Mr Medlock, and sat down to\r\nwrite another, more aggrieved in its tone and more urgent in its request\r\nthat Mr Medlock would come down to Liverpool at once to arrange matters\r\non a more satisfactory footing.  It was difficult to write a letter\r\nwhich altogether pleased him; but at last he managed to do it, and for\r\nfear his warmth should evaporate he went out to post it, locking the\r\noffice up behind him.\r\n\r\nHe took a walk before returning--the first he had taken for a week.  It\r\nwas a beautiful crisp December day, when, even through the murky\r\natmosphere of Liverpool, the sun looked down joyously, and the blue sky,\r\nflecked with little fleecy clouds, seemed to challenge the smoke and\r\nsteam of a thousand chimneys to touch its purity.  Reginald\'s steps\r\nturned away from the city, through a quiet suburb towards the country.\r\nHe would have to walk too far, he knew, to reach real open fields and\r\ngreen lanes, but there was at least a suggestion of the country here\r\nwhich to his weary mind was refreshing.\r\n\r\nHis walk took him past a large public school, in the playground of which\r\nan exciting football match was in active progress.  Like an old war\r\nhorse, Reginald gazed through the palings and snorted as the cry of\r\nbattle rose in the air.\r\n\r\n"Hack it through, sir!"  "Well run!"  "Collar him there!"\r\n\r\nAs he heard those old familiar cries it seemed to him as if the old life\r\nhad come back to him with a sudden rush.  He was no longer a poor baited\r\nsecretary, but a joyous school-boy, head of his form, lord and master of\r\nhalf a dozen fags, and a caution and example to the whole junior school.\r\nHe had chums by the score; his study was always crowded with fellows\r\nwanting him to do this or help them in that.  How jolly to be popular!\r\nHow jolly, when the ball came out of the scrimmage, to hear every one\r\nshout, "Let Cruden have it!"  How jolly, as he snatched it up and\r\nrushed, cleaving his way to the enemy\'s goal, to hear that roar behind\r\nhim, "Run indeed, sir!"\r\n\r\n"Back him up!"\r\n\r\n"Well played!"  Yes, he heard them still, like music; and as he watched\r\nthe shifting fortunes of this game he felt the blood course through his\r\nveins with a strange, familiar ardour.\r\n\r\nAh, here came the ball out of the scrimmage straight towards him!  Oh,\r\nthe thrill of such a moment!  Who does not know it?  A second more and\r\nhe would have it--\r\n\r\nAlas! poor Reginald awoke as suddenly as he had dreamed.  A hideous\r\npaling stood between him and the ball.  He was not in the game at all.\r\nNothing but a lonely, friendless drudge, whom nobody wanted, nobody\r\ncared about.\r\n\r\nWith a glistening in his eyes which he would have scornfully protested\r\nwas not a tear, he turned away and walked moodily back to Shy Street,\r\ncaring little if it were to be the last walk he should ever take.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, to be allowed much time for indulging his gloomy\r\nreflections on reaching his journey\'s end.  A person was waiting outside\r\nthe office, pacing up and down the pavement to keep himself warm.  The\r\nstranger took a good look at Reginald as he entered and let himself in,\r\nand then followed up the stairs and presented himself.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr Reginald at home?" inquired he blandly.\r\n\r\nReginald noticed that he was a middle-aged person, dressed in a sort of\r\nvery shabby clerical costume, awkward in his manner, but not\r\nunintelligent in face.\r\n\r\n"That is my name," replied he.\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  I am glad to see you, Mr Reginald.  You were kind enough\r\nto send me a communication not long ago about--well, about a suit of\r\nclothes."\r\n\r\nHis evident hesitation to mention anything that would call attention to\r\nhis own well-worn garb made Reginald feel quite sorry for him.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said he, taking good care not to look at his visitor\'s toilet,\r\n"we sent a good many of the circulars to clergymen."\r\n\r\n"Very considerate," said the visitor.  "I was away from home and have\r\nonly just received it."\r\n\r\nAnd he took the circular out of his pocket, and seating himself on a\r\nchair began to peruse it.\r\n\r\nPresently he looked up and said,--\r\n\r\n"Are there any left?"\r\n\r\n"Any of the suits?  Oh yes, I expect so.  We had a large number."\r\n\r\n"Could I--can you show me one?"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately I haven\'t got them here; they are all in London."\r\n\r\n"How unfortunate!  I did so want to get one."\r\n\r\nThen he perused the paper again.\r\n\r\n"How soon could I have one?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh very soon now; before Christmas certainly," replied Reginald.\r\n\r\n"You are sure?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes.  They will all be delivered before then."\r\n\r\n"And have you had many orders?" said the clergyman.\r\n\r\n"A great many," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Hundreds, I daresay.  There are many to whom it would be a boon at this\r\nseason to get so cheap an outfit."\r\n\r\n"Two hundred, I should say," said Reginald.  "Would you like to leave an\r\norder with me?"\r\n\r\n"Two hundred!  Dear me!  And did they all send the two pounds, as stated\r\nhere, along with their order?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes.  Some sent more," said Reginald, quite thankful to have some\r\none to talk to, who did not regard him either as a fool or a knave.\r\n\r\n"It must have been a very extensive bankrupt stock you acquired," said\r\nthe clergyman musingly.  "And were all the applicants clergymen like\r\nmyself?"\r\n\r\n"Nearly all."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, how sad to think how many there are to whom such an\r\nopportunity is a godsend!  We are sadly underpaid, many of us, Mr\r\nReginald, and are apt to envy you gentlemen of business your comfortable\r\nmeans.  Now you, I daresay, get as much as three or four of us poor\r\ncurates get together."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Reginald with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Well, if I even had your L200 a year I should be thankful," said the\r\npoor curate.\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t that by L50," said Reginald.  "Shall I put you down for a\r\ncomplete suit, as mentioned in the circular?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m afraid I cannot well do without it," said the other.\r\n\r\n"And what name and address?" said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps the simplest way would be, as I am going back to London,\r\nfor you to give me an order for the things to present at your depot\r\nthere.  It will save carriage, you know."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Reginald, "I will write one for you.  You notice,"\r\nadded he, "that we ask for L2 with the order."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes," said the visitor, with a sigh, "that appears to be a stern\r\nnecessity.  Here it is, Mr Reginald."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Reginald.  "I will write you a receipt; and here is a\r\nnote to Mr John Smith, at Weaver\'s Hotel, London, who has charge of the\r\nclothing.  I have no doubt he will be able to suit you with just what\r\nyou want."\r\n\r\n"John Smith?  I fancy I have heard his name somewhere.  Is he one of\r\nyour principals--a dark tall man?"\r\n\r\n"I have never seen him," said Reginald, "but all our orders go to him\r\nfor execution."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, thank you very much.  I am sure I am much obliged to you.\r\nYou seem to be single-handed here.  It must be hard work for you."\r\n\r\n"Pretty hard sometimes."\r\n\r\n"I suppose clothing is what you chiefly supply?"\r\n\r\n"We have also been sending out a lot of globes and blackboards to\r\nschools."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, I should be glad to get a pair of globes for our parish\r\nschool--very glad.  Have you them here?"\r\n\r\n"No, they are in London too."\r\n\r\n"And how do you sell them?  I fear they are very expensive."\r\n\r\n"They cost L3 the set, but we only ask L2 with the order."\r\n\r\n"That really seems moderate.  I shall be strongly tempted to ask our\r\nVicar to let me get a pair when in London.  Will Mr Smith be able to\r\nshow them to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is superintending the sending off of them too."\r\n\r\n"How crowded Weaver\'s Hotel must be, with so many bulky articles!" said\r\nthe curate.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know, I don\'t suppose Mr Smith keeps them there; but he lives\r\nthere while he\'s in town, that\'s all.  Our directors generally put up at\r\nWeaver\'s Hotel."\r\n\r\n"I should greatly like to see a list of the directors, if I may," said\r\nthe clergyman.  "There\'s nothing gives one so much confidence as to see\r\nhonoured names on the directorate of a company like yours."\r\n\r\n"I can give you a list if you like," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"I daresay you know by name the Bishop of S--, our chairman?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure, and--dear me, what a very good list of names!  Thank you,\r\nif I may take one of these, I should like to show it to my friends.\r\nWell, then, I will call on Mr Smith in London, and meanwhile I am very\r\nmuch obliged to you, Mr Reginald, for your courtesy.  Very glad to have\r\nmade your acquaintance.  Good afternoon."\r\n\r\nAnd he shook hands cordially with the secretary, and departed, leaving\r\nReginald considerably soothed in spirit, as he reflected that he had\r\nreally done a stroke of work for the Corporation that day on his own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIt was well for his peace of mind that he did not know that the\r\nclergyman, on turning the corner of Shy Street, rubbed his hands merrily\r\ntogether, and said to himself, in tones of self-satisfaction,--\r\n\r\n"Well, if that wasn\'t the neatest bit of work I\'ve done since I came on\r\nthe beat.  The innocent!  He\'d sit up, I guess, if he knew the nice\r\npleasant-spoken parson he\'s been blabbing to was Sniff of the detective\r\noffice.  My eye--it\'s all so easy, there\'s not much credit about the\r\nbusiness after all.  But it\'s pounds, shillings and pence to Sniff, and\r\nthat\'s better!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SHUCKLEFORD FINDS HIMSELF BUSY.\r\n\r\n"Jemima, my dear," said Mrs Shuckleford one day, as the little family\r\nin Number 4, Dull Street, sat round their evening meal, "I don\'t like\r\nthe looks of Mrs Cruden.  It\'s my opinion she don\'t get enough to eat."\r\n\r\n"Really, ma, how you talk!" replied the daughter.  "The butcher\'s boy\r\nleft there this very afternoon.  I saw him."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, my dear, he didn\'t leave anything more filling than a bill.\r\nIn fact, I \'eard myself that the butcher told Mrs Marks he thought\r\nNumber 6 \'ad gone far enough for \'im."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma! you don\'t mean to say they\'re in debt?" said Jemima, who, by\r\nthe way, had been somewhat more pensive and addicted to sitting by\r\nherself since Reginald had gone north.\r\n\r\n"Well, if it was only the butcher I heard it from I wouldn\'t take much\r\naccount of it, but Parker the baker \'as \'is doubts of them; so I \'eard\r\nthe Grinsons\' maid tell Ford when I was in \'is shop this very day.  And\r\nI\'m sure you\'ve only to look at \'Orace\'s coat and \'at to see they must\r\nbe in debt: the poor boy looks a reg\'lar scarecrow.  It all comes, my\r\ndear, of Reginald\'s going off and leaving them.  Oh, \'ow I pity them\r\nthat \'as a wild son."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk nonsense, ma," said Miss Jemima, firing up.  "He\'s no more\r\nwild than Sam here."\r\n\r\n"You seem to know more about Reginald than most people, my dear," said\r\nher mother significantly.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of the mother and brother, Jemima replied to this\r\ninsinuation by bursting into tears and walking out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see the like of that?  She always takes on if any one\r\nmentions that boy\'s name; and she\'s old enough to be his aunt, too!"\r\n\r\n"The sooner she cures herself of that craze the better," said Sam,\r\npouring himself out some more tea.  "She don\'t know quite so much about\r\nhim as I do!"\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you know about \'im, then?" inquired Mrs Shuckleford, in\r\ntones of curiosity.\r\n\r\n"Never you mind; we don\'t talk business out of the office.  All I can\r\ntell you is, he\'s a bad lot."\r\n\r\n"Poor Mrs Cruden! no wonder she takes on.  What an infliction a wicked\r\nson is to a mother, Sam!"\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do," said the dutiful Sam.  "What do you know about it?  I tell\r\nyou what, ma, you\'re thick enough with Number 6.  You\'d better draw off\r\na bit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sam, why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because I give you the tip, that\'s all.  The old lady may not be in it,\r\nbut I don\'t fancy the connection."\r\n\r\n"But, Sam, she\'s starving herself, and \'Orace is in rags."\r\n\r\n"Send her in a rump-steak and a suit of my old togs by the housemaid,"\r\nsaid Sam; "or else do as you like, and don\'t blame me if you\'re sorry\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\nMrs Shuckleford knew it was no use trying to extract any more lucid\r\ninformation from her legal offspring, and did not try, but she made\r\nanother effort to soften his heart with regard to the Widow Cruden and\r\nher son.\r\n\r\n"After all they\'re gentlefolk in trouble, as we might be," said she,\r\n"and they do behave very nice at the short-\'and class to Jemima."\r\n\r\n"Gentlefolk or not," said Sam decisively, spreading a slice of toast\r\nwith jam, "I tell you you\'d better draw off, ma--and Jim must chuck up\r\nthe class.  I\'m not going to have her mixing with them."\r\n\r\n"But the child\'s \'eart would break, Sam, if--"\r\n\r\n"Let it break.  She cares no more about shorthand than she does about\r\ncounty courts.  It\'s all part of her craze to tack herself on that lot.\r\nShe\'s setting her cap at _him_ while she\'s making up to his ma; any flat\r\nmight see that; but she\'s got to jack up the whole boiling now--there.\r\nWe needn\'t say any more about it."\r\n\r\nAnd, having finished his tea, Mr Samuel Shuckleford went down to his\r\n"club" to take part in a debate on "Cruelty to Animals."\r\n\r\nNow the worthy captain\'s widow, Mrs Shuckleford, had lived long enough\r\nin this world to find that human nature is a more powerful law even than\r\nparental obedience; she therefore took to heart just so much of her\r\nson\'s discourse as fitted with the one, and overlooked just so much as\r\nexacted the latter.  In other words, she was ready to believe that\r\nReginald Cruden was a "bad lot," but she was not able to bring herself\r\non that account to desert her neighbour at the time of her trouble.\r\n\r\nAccordingly that same evening, while Samuel was pleading eloquently on\r\nbehalf of our dumb fellow-creatures, and Jemima, having recovered from\r\nher tears, was sitting abstractedly over a shorthand exercise in her own\r\nbedroom, Mrs Shuckleford took upon herself to pay a friendly call at\r\nNumber 6.\r\n\r\nIt happened to be one of Horace\'s late evenings, so that Mrs Cruden was\r\nalone.  She was lying wearily on the uncomfortable sofa, with her eyes\r\nshaded from the light, dividing her time between knitting and musing,\r\nthe latter occupation receiving a very decided preference.\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t get up," said Mrs Shuckleford, the moment she entered.  "I\r\nonly looked in to see \'ow you was.  You\'re looking bad, Mrs Cruden."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I am quite well," said Mrs Cruden, "only a little tired."\r\n\r\n"And down in your spirits, too; and well you may be, poor dear," said\r\nthe visitor soothingly.\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs Shuckleford," said Mrs Cruden brightly.  "Indeed, I ought not\r\nto be in bad spirits to-day.  We\'ve had quite a little family triumph\r\nto-day.  Horace has had an article published in the _Rocket_, and we are\r\nso proud."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; he\'s the steady one," said Mrs Shuckleford.  "There\'s no\r\nrolling stone about \'Orace."\r\n\r\n"No," said the mother warmly.\r\n\r\n"If they was only both alike," said the visitor, approaching her subject\r\ndelicately.\r\n\r\n"Ah! but it often happens two brothers may be very different in temper\r\nand mind.  It\'s not always a misfortune."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, Mrs Cruden; but when one\'s good and the other\'s\r\nwicked--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, of course, it is very sad," said Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\n"Sad\'s no name for it," replied the visitor, with emotion.  "Oh, Mrs\r\nCruden, \'ow sorry I am for you."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind.  It is a sad trial to be separated from my boy, but\r\nI\'ve not given up hopes of seeing him back soon."\r\n\r\nMrs Shuckleford shook her head.\r\n\r\n"\'Ow you must suffer on \'is account," said she.  "If your \'eart don\'t\r\nbreak with it, it must be made of tougher stuff than mine."\r\n\r\n"But after all, Mrs Shuckleford," said Mrs Cruden, "there are worse\r\ntroubles in this life than separation."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right.  Oh, I\'m so sorry for you."\r\n\r\n"Why for me?  I have only the lighter sorrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs Cruden, do you call a wicked son a light sorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, but my sons, thank God, are good, brave boys, both of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"And who told you \'e was a good, brave boy?  Reggie, I mean."\r\n\r\n"Who told me?" said Mrs Cruden, with surprise.  "Who told me he was\r\nanything else?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs Cruden!  Oh, Mrs Cruden!" said Mrs Shuckleford, beginning to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden at last began to grow uneasy and alarmed.  She sat up on the\r\nsofa, and said, in an agitated voice,--\r\n\r\n"What _do_ you mean, Mrs Shuckleford?  Has anything happened?  Is there\r\nany bad news about Reginald?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs Cruden, I made sure you knew all about it."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" cried Mrs Cruden, now thoroughly terrified and trembling\r\nall over.  "Has anything happened to him?  Is he--dead?" and she seized\r\nher visitor\'s hand as she asked the question.\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs Cruden, not dead.  Maybe it would be better for \'im if he\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"Better if he was dead?  Oh, please, have pity and tell me what you\r\nmean!" cried the poor mother, dropping back on to the sofa with a face\r\nas white as a sheet.\r\n\r\n"Come, don\'t take on," said Mrs Shuckleford, greatly disconcerted to\r\nsee the effect of her delicate breaking of the news.  "Perhaps it\'s not\r\nas bad as it seems."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what is it? what is it?  I can\'t bear this suspense.  Why don\'t you\r\ntell me?" and she trembled so violently and looked so deadly pale that\r\nMrs Shuckleford began to get alarmed.\r\n\r\n"There, there," said she soothingly; "I\'ll tell you another time.\r\nYou\'re not equal to it now.  I\'ll come in to-morrow, or the next day,\r\nwhen you\'ve had a good night\'s rest, poor dear."\r\n\r\n"For pity\'s sake tell me all now!" gasped Mrs Cruden; "unless you want\r\nto kill me."\r\n\r\nIt dawned at last on the well-meaning Mrs Shuckleford that no good was\r\nbeing done by prolonging her neighbour\'s suspense any further.\r\n\r\n"Well, well!  It\'s only that I\'m afraid he\'s been doing something--\r\nwell--dreadful.  Oh, Mrs Cruden, how sorry I am for you!"\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden lay motionless, like one who had received a stab.\r\n\r\n"What has he done?" she whispered slowly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, dear--really I don\'t," said Mrs Shuckleford, beginning\r\nto whimper at the sight of the desolation she had caused.  "It was Sam,\r\nmy son, told me--he wouldn\'t say what it was--and I \'ope you won\'t let\r\n\'im know it was me you \'eard it from, Mrs Cruden, for he\'d be very--\r\nMercy on us!"\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden had fainted.\r\n\r\nHelp was summoned, and she was carried to her bed.  When Horace arrived\r\nshortly afterwards he found her still unconscious, with Mrs Shuckleford\r\nbathing her forehead, and tending her most gently.\r\n\r\n"You had better run for a doctor, \'Orace," whispered she, as the scared\r\nboy entered the room.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?  What has happened?" gasped he.\r\n\r\n"Poor dear, she\'s broken down--she\'s-- But go quick for the doctor,\r\n\'Orace."\r\n\r\nHorace went as fast as his fleet feet would carry him.  The doctor\r\npronounced Mrs Cruden to be in a state of high fever, produced by\r\nnervous prostration and poor living.  He advised Horace, if possible, to\r\nget a nurse to tend her while the fever lasted, especially as she would\r\nprobably awake from her swoon delirious, and would for several days\r\nremain in a very critical condition.\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes Horace was at Miss Crisp\'s, imploring her\r\nassistance.  The warm-hearted little lady undertook the duty without a\r\nmoment\'s hesitation, and from that night, and for a fortnight to come,\r\nhardly quitted her friend\'s bedside.\r\n\r\nMrs Shuckleford, deeming it prudent not to refer again to the\r\nunpleasant subject which had been the immediate cause of Mrs Cruden\'s\r\nseizure, waited till she was assured that at present she could be of no\r\nfurther use, and then withdrew, full of sympathy and commiseration,\r\nwhich she manifested in all sorts of womanly ways during her neighbour\'s\r\nillness.  Not a day passed but she called in, morning and afternoon, to\r\ninquire after the patient, generally the bearer of some home-made\r\ndelicacy, and sometimes to take her post by the sick bed while Miss\r\nCrisp snatched an hour or so of well-earned repose.\r\n\r\nAs for Horace, he could hardly be persuaded to leave the sick chamber.\r\nBut the stern necessity of work, greater than ever now at this time of\r\nspecial emergency, compelled him to take the rest necessary for his own\r\nhealth and daily duties.  With an effort he dragged himself to the\r\noffice every morning, and like an arrow he returned from it every\r\nevening, and often paid a flying visit at midday.  His good-natured\r\ncompanions voluntarily relieved him of all late work, and, indeed, every\r\none who had in the least degree come into contact with the gentle\r\npatient seemed to vie in showing sympathy and offering help.\r\n\r\nYoung Gedge was amongst the most eager of the inquirers at the house.\r\nHe squandered shillings in flowers and grapes, and sometimes even ran\r\nthe risk of disgrace at the _Rocket_ by lingering outside the house\r\nduring a doctor\'s visit, in order to hear the latest bulletin before he\r\nwent back to work.\r\n\r\nIn his mind, as well as in Horace\'s, a faint hope had lurked that\r\nsomehow Reginald might contrive to run up to London for a day or two at\r\nleast, to cheer the house of watching.  Mrs Cruden, in her delirium,\r\noften moaned her absent son\'s name, and called for him, and they\r\nbelieved if only he were to come, her restless troubled mind might cease\r\nits wanderings and find rest.\r\n\r\nBut Reginald neither came nor wrote.\r\n\r\nSince Horace, on the first day of her illness, had written, telling him\r\nall, no one had heard a word from him.\r\n\r\nAt last, when after a week Horace wrote again, saying,--\r\n\r\n"Come to us, if you love us," and still no letter or message came back,\r\na new cloud of anxiety fell over the house.\r\n\r\nReginald must be ill, or away from Liverpool, or something must have\r\nhappened to him, or assuredly, they said, he would have been at his\r\nmother\'s side at the first breath of danger.\r\n\r\nMrs Shuckleford only, as day passed day, and the prodigal never\r\nreturned, shook her head and said to herself, it was a blessing no one\r\nknew the reason, not even the poor delirious sufferer herself.  Poor\r\npeople! they had trouble enough on them not to need any more just now!\r\nso she kept her own counsel, even from Jemima.\r\n\r\nThis was the more easy to do because she knew nothing either of Reginald\r\nor his doings beyond what her son had hinted, and as Samuel was at\r\npresent in the country on business, she had no opportunity of\r\nprosecuting her inquiries on the subject.\r\n\r\nSam, in fact, whether he liked it or not, happened just now to hold the\r\nfortunes of the family of Cruden pretty much in his own hands.\r\n\r\nA few days before the conversation with his mother already reported, he\r\nhad been sitting in his room at the office, his partner and the head\r\nclerk both being absent on County Court business.\r\n\r\nSamuel felt all the dignity of a commander-in-chief, and was therefore\r\nnot at all displeased when the office-boy had come and knocked at his\r\ndoor, and said that a lady of the name of Wrigley had called, and wished\r\nto see him.\r\n\r\n"Show the lady in," said Sam grandly, "and put a chair."\r\n\r\nMrs Wrigley was accordingly ushered in, the dust of travel still on\r\nher, for she had come direct from Liverpool by the night train,\r\ndetermined to put her wrongs in the hands of the law.  Mr Crawley,\r\nSamuel\'s principal, had been legal adviser to the late Mr Wrigley; it\r\nwas only natural, therefore, that the widow, not liking to entrust her\r\nsecret to the pettifogging practitioner of her own village, should make\r\nuse of a two hours\' break in her journey to seek his aid.\r\n\r\n"Your master\'s not in, young man?" said she, as she took the proffered\r\nseat.  "That\'s a pity."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he\'ll be very sorry," said Sam; "but if it\'s anything I can\r\ndo--"\r\n\r\n"If you can save poor defenceless women from being plundered, and punish\r\nthose that plunder them--then you can."\r\n\r\nHere was a slice of luck for Samuel!  The first bit of practice on his\r\nown account that had ever fallen in his way.  If he did not make a good\r\nthing out of it his initials were not S.S.!\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair confidentially beside that of the injured Mrs\r\nWrigley, and drank in the story of her woes with an interest that quite\r\nwon her heart.  At first he failed to recognise either the name of the\r\ndelinquent Corporation or its secretary, but when presently his client\r\nproduced one of the identical circulars sent out, with the name Cruden\r\nReginald at the foot, his professional instincts told him he had\r\ndiscovered a "real job, and no mistake."\r\n\r\nHe made Mrs Wrigley go back and begin her story over again (a task she\r\nwas extremely ready to perform), and took copious notes during the\r\nrecital.  He impounded the document, envelope and all, cross-examined\r\nand brow-beat his own witness--in fact, did all a rising young lawyer\r\nought to do, and concluded in judicial tones, "Very good, Mrs Wrigley;\r\nI think we can do something for you.  I think we know something of the\r\nparties.  Leave it to us, madam; we will put you right."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will," said the lady.  "You see, as I\'ve been all the way up\r\nto Liverpool and back, I think I ought to be put right."\r\n\r\n"Most certainly you ought, and you shall be."\r\n\r\n"And to think of his brazen-faced impudence in calling me `Love,\' young\r\nman.  There\'s a profligate for you!"\r\n\r\nSamuel was knowing enough to see that it would greatly please the\r\noutraged lady if he took a special note of this disclosure, which he\r\naccordingly did, and then rising, once more assured his client of his\r\ndetermination to put her right, and bade her a very good morning.\r\n\r\n"Well, if that ain\'t a go," said he to himself, as he returned to his\r\ndesk.  "I never did have much faith in the chap, but I didn\'t fancy he\r\nwas that sort.  Cruden Reginald, eh?  Nice boy you are.  Never mind!\r\nI\'m dead on you this time.  Nuisance it is that ma\'s gone and mixed\r\nherself up with that lot.  Can\'t be helped, though; business is\r\nbusiness; and such a bit of practice too.  Cruden Reginald!  But you\r\ndon\'t get round Sam Shuckleford when he\'s once round your way, my\r\nbeauty."\r\n\r\nTo the legal mind of Sam this transposition of Reginald\'s name was in\r\nitself as good as a verdict and sentence against him.  Any one else but\r\nhimself might have been taken in by it, but you needed to get up very\r\nearly in the morning to take in a cute one like S.S.!\r\n\r\nHe said nothing about the affair to his principal when he returned,\r\npreferring to "nurse" it as a little bit of business of his own, which\r\nhe would manage by himself for once in a way.\r\n\r\nAnd that very evening fortune threw into his way a most unexpected and\r\ninvaluable auxiliary.\r\n\r\nHe was down at his "club," smoking his usual evening pipe over the\r\n_Rocket_, when a man he had once or twice seen before in the place came\r\nup and said,--\r\n\r\n"After you with that paper."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Sam; "I\'ll be done with it in about an hour."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t take long," said the other.\r\n\r\n"Considering I\'m on the committee," said Sam, with ruffled dignity,\r\n"I\'ve a right to keep it just as long as I please.  Are you a member\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I\'m introduced."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Durfy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re the man who was in the _Rocket_.  I heard of you from a\r\nfriend of mine.  By the way," and here his manner became quite civil, as\r\na brilliant idea occurred to him, "look here, it was only my chaff about\r\nkeeping the paper; you can have it.  I\'ll look at it afterwards."\r\n\r\n"All right, thanks," said Durfy, who felt no excuse for not being civil\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Sam, as he was going off with the paper, "there was a\r\nfellow at your office, what was his name, now--Crowder, Crundell?  Some\r\nname of that sort--I forget."\r\n\r\n"Cruden you mean, perhaps," said Durfy, with a scowl.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes--Cruden.  Is he still with you?  What sort of chap is he?"\r\n\r\nDurfy described him in terms far more forcible than affectionate, and\r\nadded, "No, he\'s not there now; oh no.  I kicked him out long ago.  But\r\nI\'ve not done with him yet, my boy."\r\n\r\nSam felt jubilant.  Was ever luck like his?  Here was a man who\r\nevidently knew Reginald\'s real character, and could, doubtless, if\r\nproperly handled, put him on the scent, and, as he metaphorically put it\r\nto himself, "give him a clean leg up over the job."\r\n\r\nSo he called for refreshments for two, and then entered on a friendly\r\ndiscourse with Durfy on things in general, and offered to make him a\r\nmember of the club; then bringing the conversation round to Reginald, he\r\nhinted gently that _he_ too had his eye on that young gentleman, and was\r\nat the present moment engaged in bowling him out.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Durfy, after a slight hesitation, and stipulating that his\r\nname should not be mentioned in the matter, gave Sam what information he\r\nconsidered would be useful to him, suppressing, of course, all mention\r\nof the real promoters of the Select Agency Corporation, and giving the\r\nsecretary credit for all the ingenuity and cunning displayed in its\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe two new friends spent a most agreeable evening, Sam flattering\r\nhimself he was squeezing Durfy beautifully into the service of his "big\r\njob," and Durfy flattering himself that this bumptious young pettifogger\r\nwas the very person to get hold of to help him pay off all his old\r\nscores with Reginald Cruden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nPOVERTY AND LOVE BOTH COME IN AT THE DOOR.\r\n\r\nWe left Reginald in a somewhat comfortable frame of mind after his\r\ninterview with the pleasant clergyman and the stroke of business he had\r\ntransacted on behalf of the Corporation.  It had been refreshing to him\r\nto converse in terms of peace with any fellow-mortal; and the ready\r\nsatisfaction of this visitor with the method of business adopted by the\r\nCompany went far to dispel the uneasy impressions which Mrs Wrigley\'s\r\nvisit had left earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he felt that he was yet on probation.  When Christmas came,\r\nand he was able to discuss matters personally with the directors, he had\r\nno doubt his position would be improved.  He flattered himself they\r\nmight think he was useful enough to be worth while keeping; and in that\r\ncase of course he would have a right to ask to be put on rather more\r\ncomfortable a footing than he possessed at present, and to be entrusted\r\nwith a certain amount of control over the business of the Corporation.\r\nHe would also be able mildly to suggest that it would be more convenient\r\nto him to receive his salary monthly than quarterly, so as to enable him\r\nnot only to live respectably himself, as became their secretary, but\r\nalso to give regular help to his mother at home.  As it was, with a\r\nbeggarly thirteen shillings a week to live on, he was little better than\r\na common office-boy, he would have said to himself, but at that\r\nparticular moment the door opened, and the very individual whom his\r\nthoughts connected with the words appeared before him.\r\n\r\nIt was the very last apparition Reginald could have looked for.  He had\r\ngiven up all idea of seeing the young desperado any more.\r\n\r\nThough he could not exactly say, "Poverty had come in at the door and\r\nLove had flown out of the window"--for the young gentleman had departed\r\nby the door--he yet had made up his mind that Cupid had taken to himself\r\nwings and flown away, with no intention of ever returning to the scene\r\nof his late struggle.\r\n\r\nBut a glance at the starved, emaciated figure before him explained very\r\nsimply the mystery of this strange apparition.  The boy\'s hands and lips\r\nwere blue with cold, and his cheek-bones seemed almost to protrude\r\nthrough his pallid, grimy cheeks.  He looked, in fact, what he was, the\r\npicture of misery, and he had no need of any other eloquence to open the\r\nheart of his late "governor."\r\n\r\n"Say, what\'s yer name," he said, in a hollow imitation of his old voice,\r\n"beg yer pardon, gov\'nor--won\'t do it no more if yer overlook it this\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Come in out of the cold and warm yourself by the fire," said Reginald,\r\npoking it up to a blaze.\r\n\r\nThe boy obeyed, half timidly.  He seemed to be not quite sure whether\r\nReginald was luring him in to his own destruction.  But at any rate the\r\nsight of the fire roused him to heroism, and, reckless of all\r\nconsequences, he walked in.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do nothink to me this time, gov\'nor," whimpered he, as he got\r\nwithin arm\'s length; "let us off, do you hear? this time."\r\n\r\n"Poor boy," said Reginald kindly, putting a stool for him close beside\r\nthe fire; "I\'m not going to do anything but warm you.  Sit down, and\r\ndon\'t be afraid."\r\n\r\nThe boy dropped almost exhausted on the stool, and gazed in a sort of\r\nrapture into the fire.  Then, looking up at Reginald, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Beg your pardon, gov\'nor,--ain\'t got a crust of bread you don\'t want,\r\n\'ave yer?"\r\n\r\nThe hint was quite enough to send Reginald flying to his little\r\n"larder."\r\n\r\nThe boy devoured the bread set before him with a fierceness that looked\r\nas if he had scarcely touched food since he had gone away.  He made\r\nclear decks of all Reginald had in the place; and then, slipping off the\r\nstool, curled himself up on the floor before the fire like a dog, and\r\ndropped off into a heavy sleep.  Reginald took the opportunity to make a\r\nhurried excursion to the nearest provision shop to lay in what store his\r\nlittle means would allow.  He might have spared himself the trouble of\r\nlocking the door behind him, though, for on his return the boy had never\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nThe little sleeper lay there all night, until, in fact, the coals could\r\nhold out no longer, and the fire went out.  Then Reginald woke him and\r\ncarried him off to his own bed, where he dropped off into another long\r\nsleep which lasted till midday.  After partaking of the meal his\r\nbenefactor had ready for him on waking, he seemed more like himself, and\r\ndisposed to make himself useful.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t got no envellups to lick, then?" said he, looking round the\r\ndeserted room.\r\n\r\n"No, there\'s nothing to do here just now," said Reginald.\r\n\r\nThe boy looked a little disappointed, but said, presently,--\r\n\r\n"Want any errands fetched, gov\'nor?"\r\n\r\n"No, not now.  I\'ve got all I want in for the present."\r\n\r\n"Like yer winders cleaned?"\r\n\r\n"Not much use with this frost on them," said Reginald.\r\n\r\nThwarted thus on every hand, the boy asked no more questions, but took\r\nupon himself to go round the office and dust it as well as he could with\r\nthe ragged tail of his coat.  It was evidently his way of saying, "Thank\r\nyou," and he seemed more easy in his mind when it was done.\r\n\r\nHe stopped once in the middle of his task as he caught Reginald\'s eyes\r\nfixed half curiously, half pityingly upon him.\r\n\r\n"Say--gov\'nor, I ain\'t going to read no more books; do ye hear?"\r\n\r\nThere was something quite pathetic in the tones in which this\r\ndeclaration of renunciation was made.  It was evidently a supreme effort\r\nof repentance, and Reginald felt almost uncomfortable as he heard it.\r\n\r\n"That there _Noogate Calendar_ made a rare flare-up, didn\'t it,\r\ngov\'nor?" continued Love, looking wistfully towards the grate, if\r\nperchance any stray leaves should have escaped the conflagration.\r\n\r\n"Not such a flare-up as you did," said Reginald, laughing.  "Never mind,\r\nwe\'ll try and get something nicer to read."\r\n\r\n"No fear!  Never no more.  I ain\'t a-goin\' to read nothink again, I tell\r\nyer," said the boy, quite warmly.\r\n\r\nAnd for fear of wavering in his resolution he went round the room once\r\nmore, rubbing up the cheap furniture till it shone, and ending with\r\npolishing up the very hearth that had served as the sacrificial altar to\r\nhis beloved _Newgate Calendar_ only a few days before.  There was little\r\nor no more work to be done during the day.  A few letters had come by\r\nthe morning\'s post, angrily complaining of the delay in delivering the\r\npromised goods.  To these Reginald had replied in the usual form,\r\nleaving to Love the privilege of "licking them up."  He also wrote to\r\nMr Medlock, enclosing the two pounds the pleasant clergyman had left\r\nthe day before, and once more urging that gentleman to come down to\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nHe went out, happily unconscious of the fact that a detective dogged\r\nevery step he took, to post these letters himself, and at the same time\r\nto lay in a day\'s provisions for two.  It was with something like a\r\nqualm that he saw his last half-sovereign broken over this purchase.\r\nWith nine shillings left in his pocket, and twelve days yet to\r\nChristmas, it was as clear as daylight that things were rapidly\r\napproaching a crisis.  It was almost a relief to feel it.\r\n\r\nOn his way back to the office he passed a secondhand book-stall.  He had\r\nlingered in front of it many times before now, turning over the leaves\r\nof this and that odd volume, and picking up the scraps of amusement and\r\ninformation which are always to be found in such an occupation.  To-day,\r\nhowever, he overhauled the contents of the trays with rather more\r\ncuriosity than usual; not because he expected to find a pearl of great\r\nprice among the dust and dog\'s ears of the "threepenny" tray.  Reginald\r\nwas the last person in the world to consider himself a child of fortune\r\nin that respect.\r\n\r\nNo! he had Master Love on his mind, and the memory of that blazing\r\n_Newgate Calendar_ on his conscience, and, even at the cost of a further\r\nreduction of his vanishing income, he determined not to return provided\r\nwith food for Love\'s body only, but also for Love\'s mind.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he selected two very shabby and tattered volumes from the\r\n"threepenny" tray--one a fragment of _Robinson Crusoe_, the other Part\r\nOne of the _Pilgrim\'s Progress_, and with these in his pocket and the\r\neatables in his hands, he returned to his charge as proud as a general\r\nwho has just relieved a starving garrison.\r\n\r\nAfter the frugal supper the books were triumphantly produced, but Master\r\nLove, still mindful of his recent tribulations, regarded them shyly at\r\nfirst, as another possible bait to his own undoing; but presently\r\ncuriosity, and the sight of a wonderful picture of Giant Despair,\r\novercame his scruples, and he held out his hand eagerly.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to watch the critical look on his face as he took a\r\npreliminary glance through the pages of the two books.  Reginald was\r\nhalf sorry he had not produced them one at a time; but it being too late\r\nnow to recall either, he awaited with no little excitement the decision\r\nof the young connoisseur upon them.  Apparently Love found considerable\r\ntraces of what he would call "jam" in both.  The picture of Crusoe\r\ncoming upon the footprint in the sand, and that of the great battle\r\nbetween Christian and Apollyon, seemed to gather into themselves the\r\nfinal claims of the two rivals, and for a few moments victory trembled\r\nin the balance.  At last he shut up _Robinson Crusoe_ and stuffed it in\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\n"Say, what\'s yer name," said he, looking up and laying his finger on the\r\nbattle scene; "which of them two does for t\'other?"\r\n\r\n"The one in the armour," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Thought so--t\'other one\'s a flat to fight with that there long\r\nflagpole.  Soon as \'e\'s chucked it away \'e\'s a dead \'un.  Say, what did\r\nthey do with \'is dead body?  No use a \'idin\' of it.  If I was \'im I\'d a\r\ncut \'is throat, and left the razor in \'is \'and, and they\'d a brought it\r\nin soosanside.  Bless you, coroners\' juries is reg\'lar flats at findin\'\r\nout them sort of things."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you read what it says," said Reginald, hardly able to restrain\r\na laugh; "if you like you can read it aloud; I\'d like to hear it again\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nThe boy agreed, and that evening the two queerly assorted friends sat\r\nside by side in the dim candle-light, going over the wonderful story of\r\nthe Pilgrim.  Reginald judiciously steered the course through the most\r\nthrilling parts of the narrative, carefully avoiding whatever might have\r\nseemed to the boy dull or digressive.\r\n\r\nLove stopped in his reading frequently to discuss the merits of the\r\nstory and deliver himself of his opinion as to what he would have done\r\nunder similar circumstances.  He would have made short work with the\r\nlions chained by the roadside; he would have taken a bull\'s-eye lantern\r\nthrough the dark valley; and as for the river at the end, he couldn\'t\r\nunderstand anybody coming to grief there.  Why, at Victoria Park last\r\nWhit Monday he had swum three-quarters of a mile himself!\r\n\r\nIn vain Reginald pointed out that Christian had his armour on.  The\r\nyoung critic would not allow this as an excuse, and brought up cases of\r\ngentlemen of his acquaintance who had swum incredible distances in their\r\nclothes and boots.\r\n\r\nBut the story that delighted him most was that of the man who hacked his\r\nway into the palace.  This was an adventure after his own heart.  He\r\nread it over and over again, and was unsparing in his admiration of the\r\nhero, whom he compared for prowess with "Will Warspite the Pirate," and\r\n"Dick Turpin," and even his late favourite "Tim Tigerskin."  His\r\ninterest in him was indeed so great that he allowed Reginald in a few\r\nsimple words to say what it meant, and to explain how we could all, if\r\nwe went the right way about it, do as great things as he did.\r\n\r\n"Why you, youngster, when you made up your mind you wouldn\'t read any\r\nmore of those bad books, you knocked over one of your enemies."\r\n\r\n"Did I, though? how far in did I get?"\r\n\r\n"You got over the doorstep, anyhow; but you\'ve got plenty more to knock\r\nover before you get right into the place.  So have I."\r\n\r\n"My eye, gov\'nor," cried the boy, his grimy face lighting up with an\r\nexcited flush, "we\'ll let \'em \'ave it!"\r\n\r\nThey read and discussed and argued far into the night; and when at last\r\nReginald gave the order to go to bed there were no two friends more\r\ndevoted than the Secretary of the Select Agency Corporation and his\r\noffice-boy.\r\n\r\nLove\'s sleep that night was like the sleep of a pugilistic terrier, who\r\nin his dreams encounters and overcomes even deep-mouthed mastiffs and\r\ncolossal Saint Bernards.  He sniffed and snorted defiance as he lay, and\r\nhis brow was damp with the sweat of battle, and his lips curled with the\r\nsmile of victory.  As soon as he awoke his hand sought the pocket where\r\nthe wonderful book lay; and even as he tidied up the office and prepared\r\nthe gov\'nor\'s breakfast, he was engaged in mortal inward combats.\r\n\r\n"Say, gov\'nor," cried he, with jubilant face, as Reginald entered, "I\'ve\r\ndone for another of \'em.  Topped him clean over."\r\n\r\n"Another of whom?" said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Them pals a-waitin\' in the \'all," said he; "you know, in that there\r\npallis."\r\n\r\n"Oh! in the Beautiful Palace we were reading about," said Reginald.\r\n"Who have you done for this time?"\r\n\r\n"That there Medlock," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Medlock!  What _are_ you talking about?" said Reginald, in blank\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve give him a wonner," said the boy, beaming.  "He says to me,\r\n`Collar all the letters your gov\'nor writes \'ome,\' he says, `and I\'ll\r\ngive you a tanner for every one you shows me.\'"\r\n\r\n"Love, you\'re talking rubbish!" said Reginald indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Are I? don\'t you make no mistake," said the boy confidently; "I knows\r\nwhat he says; and that there letter you wrote home last night and leaves\r\non the table, `That\'s a tanner to me,\' says I to myself when I sees it\r\nthis morning.  `A lie,\' says I, recollecting of that chap in the story-\r\nbook.  So I lets it be; and my eye, ain\'t that a topper for somebody--oh\r\nno!"\r\n\r\nReginald stared at the boy, half stupefied.  The room whirled round him;\r\nand with a sudden rush the hopes of his life seemed to go from under\r\nhim.  It was not for some time that he could find words to say,\r\nhoarsely,--\r\n\r\n"Love, is this the truth, or a lie you are telling me?"\r\n\r\n"Lie--don\'t you make no error, gov\'nor--I ain\'t on that lay, I can tell\r\nyou.  I\'m goin\' right into that there pallis, and there\'s two on \'em\r\ntopped a\'ready."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say Mr Medlock told you to steal my letters and give them\r\nto him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and a tanner apiece on \'em, too.  But don\'t you be afraid, he\r\ndon\'t get none out of me, not if I swings for it."\r\n\r\n"You can go out for a run, Love," said Reginald.  "Come back in an hour.\r\nI want to be alone."\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t a-giving me the sack?" asked the boy with falling\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"No, no."\r\n\r\n"And you ain\'t a-goin\' to commit soosanside while I\'m gone, are yer?" he\r\ninquired, with a suspicious glance at Reginald\'s blanched face.\r\n\r\n"No.  Be quick and go."\r\n\r\n"\'Cos if you do, they do say as a charcoal fire--"\r\n\r\n"Will you go?" said Reginald, almost angrily, and the boy vanished.\r\n\r\nI need not describe to the reader all that passed through the poor\r\nfellow\'s mind as he paced up and down the bare office that morning.  The\r\nfloodgates had suddenly been opened upon him, and he felt himself\r\noverwhelmed in a deluge of doubt and shame and horror.\r\n\r\nIt was long before he could collect his thoughts sufficiently to see\r\nanything clearly.  Why Mr Medlock should take the trouble to prevent\r\nhis home letters reaching their destination was incomprehensible, and\r\nindeed it weighed little with him beside the fact that the man who had\r\ngiven him his situation, and on whom he was actually depending for his\r\nliving, was the same who could bribe his office-boy to steal his\r\nletters.  If he were capable of such a meanness, was he to be trusted in\r\nanything else?  How was Reginald to know whether the money he had\r\nregularly remitted to him was properly accounted for, or whether the\r\norders were being conscientiously executed?\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to him the whole business of the Corporation had been\r\ndone in his--Reginald\'s--name, that all the circulars had been signed by\r\nhim, and that all the money had come addressed to him.  Then there was\r\nthat awkward mistake about his name, which, accidental or intentional,\r\nwas Mr Medlock\'s doing.  And beyond all that was the fact that Mr\r\nMedlock had taken away the only record Reginald possessed of the names\r\nof those who had replied to the circulars and sent money.\r\n\r\nHe found himself confronted with a mountain of responsibility, of which\r\nhe had never before dreamed, and for the clearing of which he was\r\nentirely dependent on the good faith of a man who had, not a week ago,\r\nplayed him one of the meanest tricks imaginable.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to make of it--what else could he make of it except that he\r\nwas a miserable dupe, with ruin staring him in the face?\r\n\r\nHis one grain of comfort was in the names of some of the directors.\r\nUnless that list were fictitious, they would not be likely to allow a\r\nconcern with which they were identified to collapse in discredit.  Was\r\nit genuine or not?\r\n\r\nHis doubts on this question were very speedily resolved by a letter\r\nwhich arrived that very afternoon.\r\n\r\nIt was dated London, and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n"Cruden Reginald, Esquire.\r\n\r\n"Sir,--The attention of the Bishop of S-- having been called to the\r\nunauthorised, and, as it would appear, fraudulent use of his name in\r\nconnection with a company styled the Select Agency Corporation, of which\r\nyou are secretary, I am instructed, before his lordship enters on legal\r\nproceedings, to request you to furnish me with your authority for using\r\nhis lordship\'s name in the manner stated.  Awaiting your reply by\r\nreturn, I am, sir, yours, etcetera,--\r\n\r\n"A.  Turner, Secretary."\r\n\r\nThis was a finishing stroke to the disillusion.  In all his troubles and\r\nperplexities the good Bishop of S-- had been a rock to lean on for the\r\npoor secretary.\r\n\r\nBut now even that prop was snatched away, and he was left alone in the\r\nruins of his own hopes.\r\n\r\nHe could see it all at last.  As he went back over the whole history of\r\nhis connection with the Corporation he was able to recognise how at\r\nevery step he had been duped and fooled; how his very honesty had been\r\nturned to account; how his intelligence had been the one thing disliked\r\nand discouraged.\r\n\r\nAnd what was to become of him now?\r\n\r\nAnything but desert the sinking ship--that question never cost Reginald\r\ntwo thoughts.  He would right himself if he could.  He would protest his\r\ninnocence of all fraud or connivance at fraud.  He would even do what he\r\ncould to bring the real offenders to justice; but as long as the\r\nCorporation had a creditor left he would be there to face him and suffer\r\nthe consequence of his own folly and stupidity.\r\n\r\nYoung Love got little sympathy that day in his reading.  Indeed, he\r\ncould not but notice that something unusual had happened to the\r\n"gov\'nor," and that being so, not even the adventures of Christian or\r\nthe unexplored marvels of Robinson Crusoe could satisfy him.  He\r\npolished up the furniture half a dozen times, and watched Reginald\'s eye\r\nlike a dog, ready to catch the first sign of a want or a question.\r\nPresently he could stand it no longer, and said,--"Say, gov\'nor, what\'s\r\nup? \'taint nothing along of me, are it?"\r\n\r\n"No, my boy," said Reginald.  "Is it along of that there Medlock?"\r\nReginald nodded.\r\n\r\nIt was well for Mr Medlock that he was not in the room at that moment.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll top \'im, see if I don\'t," muttered the boy; "I owes \'im one for\r\ncarting me down \'ere, and I owes \'im four or five now; and you\'ll see if\r\nI don\'t go for \'im, gov\'nor."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better go back to your home," said Reginald, with a kindly tremor\r\nin his voice; "I\'m afraid you\'ll get into trouble by staying with me."\r\n\r\nIt was fine to see the flash of scorn in the boy\'s face as he said,--\r\n\r\n"Oh yus, me go \'ome and leave yer!  Walker--I stays \'ere."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," said Reginald, with a sigh.  "We may as well go on\r\nwith the book.  Suppose you read me about Giant Despair."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SHADES LOSE SEVERAL GOOD CUSTOMERS.\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to Samuel Shuckleford to say that he had no\r\ncompunction whatever in deciding upon a course of action which he knew\r\nwould involve the ruin of Reginald Cruden.\r\n\r\nHe did not like it at all.  It was a nuisance; it was a complication\r\nlikely to hamper him.  He wished his mother and sister would be less\r\ngushing in the friendships they made.  What right had they to interfere\r\nwith his business prospects by tacking themselves on to the family of a\r\nman who was afterwards to turn out a swindler?\r\n\r\nYes, it was a nuisance; but for all that it must not be allowed to\r\ninterfere with the course that lay before the rising lawyer.  Business\r\nis business after all, and if Cruden is a swindler, whose fault is it if\r\nCruden\'s mother breaks her heart?  Not S.S.\'s, at any rate.  But S.S.\'s\r\nfault it would be if he made a mess of this "big job"!  That was a\r\nreproach no one should lay at his door.\r\n\r\nSamuel may not have been quite the Solomon he was wont to estimate\r\nhimself.  Still, to do him justice once more, he displayed no little\r\nability in tracing out the different frauds of the Select Agency\r\nCorporation and establishing Reginald\'s guilt conclusively in his own\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIt all fitted in like a curious puzzle.  His sudden mysterious departure\r\nfrom London--his change of name--the selection of Liverpool as\r\nheadquarters--the distribution of the circulars among unsuspecting\r\nschoolmistresses in the south of England--the demand for money to be\r\nenclosed with the order--and the fiction of the dispatch of the goods\r\nfrom London.  What else could it point to but a deliberate, deeply-laid\r\nscheme of fraud?  The further Samuel went, the clearer it all appeared,\r\nand the less compunction he felt for running to earth such a scoundrel.\r\n\r\nBut he was going to do nothing in a hurry.  S.S. was not the man to dish\r\nhimself by showing his cards till he was sure he had them all in his\r\nhand.  Possibly Cruden was not alone in the swindle.  He might have\r\naccomplices.  Even his mother and brother--who can answer for the\r\nduplicity of human nature?--might know more of his operations than they\r\nprofessed to know.  He might have confederates among his old companions\r\nat the _Rocket_, or even among his old school acquaintances.  Yes; there\r\nwas plenty to go into before Samuel put down his foot, and who knew\r\nbetter how to go into it than S.S.?\r\n\r\nSo he kept his own counsel, and, except for cautioning his mother and\r\nsister to "draw off" from the undesirable connection, and intimidating\r\nthe maid-of-all-work at Number 6, Dull Street, by most horrible threats\r\nof the penalties of the law, to detain and give to him every letter\r\nbearing the Liverpool postmark which should from that time forward come\r\nto the house, no matter to whom addressed--for in his zeal it was easy\r\nto forget that by such a proceeding he was sailing uncommonly close to\r\nthe wind himself--showed no sign of taking any immediate step either in\r\nthis or any other matter.\r\n\r\nHad he been aware that one Sniff, of the Liverpool detective police, had\r\nsome days ago arrived, by a series of independent and far more artistic\r\ninvestigations, at as much knowledge as he himself possessed of the\r\ndoings of the Corporation, Samuel would probably have been content to\r\nmake the most of the cards he held before the chance of using them at\r\nall had slipped by.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, whether in any case he would have succeeded in\r\nforestalling the wary Mr Sniff.  That gentleman had discovered in a few\r\nhours what it had taken Samuel days of patient grubbing to unearth.  And\r\nhis discoveries would have decidedly astonished the self-complacent\r\nlittle practitioner.  He would have been astonished, for instance, to\r\nhear that the Liverpool post-office had received instructions from the\r\nHome Office to hand over every letter addressed to Cruden Reginald, 13,\r\nShy Street, to the police.  He would also have been astonished if he had\r\nknown that a detective in plain clothes dined every evening at the\r\nShades, near to the table occupied by Mr Durfy and his friends; that\r\nthe hall-porter of Weaver\'s Hotel was a representative of the police in\r\ndisguise, and that representatives of the police had called on business\r\nat the _Rocket_ office, had brushed up against Blandford at street-\r\ncorners, and had even taken the trouble to follow him--Samuel\r\nShuckleford--here and there in his evening\'s perambulations.\r\n\r\nYes, small job as it was in Mr Sniff\'s estimation, he knew the way to\r\ngo about it, and had a very good notion what was the right scent to go\r\non and what the wrong.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that did put him out at first was Reginald\'s absolutely\r\ntruthful replies to all the pleasant clergyman\'s questions.  This really\r\ndid bother Mr Sniff.  For when a swindler is face to face with his\r\nvictim the very last thing you expect of him is straightforward honesty.\r\nSo when Reginald had talked about Weaver\'s Hotel and Mr John Smith,\r\nand had mentioned the number of orders that had arrived, and the account\r\nof money that had accompanied them, and had even confided the amount of\r\nhis own salary, Mr Sniff had closed one of his mental eyes and said to\r\nhimself, "Yes; we know all about that."\r\n\r\nBut when it turned out that, so far from such statements being\r\nfabrications to delude him, they were simply true--when the letter\r\nReginald had written to Mr Medlock that very evening lay in his hands\r\nand corroborated all he had said--when he himself followed the poor\r\nfellow an hour or two later on his errand of mercy, and stood beside him\r\nas he spent that precious sixpence over _Robinson Crusoe_ and the\r\n_Pilgrim\'s Progress_, Mr Sniff did feel for a moment disconcerted.\r\n\r\nBut, unusual as it was, he made the bold venture of jumping to the\r\nconviction of Reginald\'s innocence; and that theory once started,\r\neverything went beautifully.\r\n\r\nOn the evening following Mrs Cruden\'s sudden illness, Mr Durfy\r\nstrolled down in rather a disconsolate frame of mind towards the Shades.\r\n\r\nSince his expulsion from the _Rocket_ office things had not been going\r\npleasantly with him.  For a day or two he had deemed it expedient to\r\nkeep in retirement, and when at last he did venture forth, in the vague\r\nhope of picking up some employment worthy of his talents, he took care\r\nto keep clear of the haunts of his former confederates, whom, after his\r\nlast failure, he rather dreaded meeting.\r\n\r\nIt had been during this period that he had made the acquaintance of\r\nShuckleford, and the prospect of revenge which that intimacy opened to\r\nhim was a welcome diversion to the monotony of his existence.\r\n\r\nBut prospects of revenge do not fill empty stomachs, and Durfy at the\r\nend of a week began to discover that there might be an end even to the\r\nprivate resources of the late overseer of an evening newspaper and the\r\npart proprietor of an Agency Corporation.  He was, in fact, getting hard\r\nup, and therefore, putting his pride in his empty pocket, he strolled\r\ndown moodily to the Shades, determined at any rate to have a supper at\r\nsomebody else\'s expense.\r\n\r\nHe had not reckoned without his host, for after about half an hour\'s\r\nimpatient kicking of his heels outside, Mr Medlock and Mr Shanklin\r\nappeared on the scene, arm in arm.\r\n\r\nThey appeared by no means elated at seeing him, but that mattered very\r\nlittle to the hungry Durfy, who followed them into the supper-room and\r\ntook his seat at the table beside them.  If he had been possessed of any\r\nsensitiveness, it might have been wounded by the utter indifference,\r\nafter the first signs of displeasure, they paid to his presence.  They\r\ncontinued their conversation as though no third party had been near, and\r\nexcept that Mr Medlock nodded when the waiter said "For three?" seemed\r\nto see as little of him as Hamlet\'s mother did of the Ghost.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the time being that nod of Mr Medlock\'s was all Durfy\r\nparticularly coveted.  He was hungry.  Time enough to stand on his\r\ndignity when the knife and fork had done their work.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr Shanklin, "time\'s up to-day.  I\'ve told him where to\r\nfind us.  If he doesn\'t, you must go your trip by yourself; I can safely\r\nstay and screw my man up."\r\n\r\n"Think he will turn up?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say.  He seems to be flush enough of money still."\r\n\r\n"Well, he can\'t say you\'ve not helped him to get rid of it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done my best," said Mr Shanklin, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad of a holiday.  It\'s as hard work sponging one fool as\r\nit is fleecing a couple of hundred sheep, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Well, the wool came off very easily, I must say.  I reckon there\'ll be\r\na clean L500 to divide on the Liverpool business alone."\r\n\r\n"Nice occupation that\'ll be on the Boulogne steamer to-morrow," said\r\nMr Shanklin.  "Dear me, I hope it won\'t be rough, I\'m such a bad\r\nsailor!"\r\n\r\n"Then, of course," said Mr Medlock, "there\'ll be your little takings to\r\nadd to that.  Your working expenses can\'t have been much."\r\n\r\nMr Shanklin laughed again.\r\n\r\n"No.  I\'ve done without circulars and a salaried secretary.  By the way,\r\ndo you fancy any one smells anything wrong up in the North yet?"\r\n\r\n"Bless you, no.  The fellow\'s pretty near starving, and yet he sent me\r\nup a stray L2 he received the other day.  It\'s as good as a play to read\r\nthe letters he sends me up about getting the orders executed in strict\r\nrotation, as entered in a beautiful register he kept, and which I\r\nborrowed, my boy.  Ha! ha!  He wants me to run down to Liverpool, he\r\nsays, as he\'s not quite satisfied with his position there.  Ho! ho!  And\r\nhe\'d like a little money on account, as he\'s had to buy stamps and coals\r\nand all that sort of thing out of his own thirteen shillings a week.\r\nIt\'s enough to make one die of laughing, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"It is funny," said Mr Shanklin.  "But you\'re quite right to be on the\r\nsafe side and start to-morrow.  You did everything in his name, I\r\nsuppose--took the office, ordered the printing, and all that sort of\r\nthing?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I took care of that.  My name or yours was never mentioned,\r\nexcept mine on the dummy list of directors.  That won\'t hurt."\r\n\r\n"Well, the Corporation\'s had a short life and a merry one; and your\r\nprecious secretary\'s likely to have a merry Christmas after it all--\r\nunless you\'d like to go down and spend it with him, Durfy," added Mr\r\nShanklin, taking notice for the first time of the presence of their\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nDurfy replied by a scowl.\r\n\r\n"I shall be far enough away by then," said he.\r\n\r\n"Why, where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going with you, to be sure," said he, doggedly.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Medlock and Shanklin greeted this announcement with a laugh of\r\ngenuine amusement.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you told us," said Mr Shanklin.  "We should have forgotten to\r\ntake a ticket for you."\r\n\r\n"You may grin," said Durfy.  "I\'m going, for all that."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a bigger fool even than you look," said Mr Medlock, "to think\r\nso.  You can consider yourself lucky to get a supper out of us this last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"You forget I can make it precious awkward for you if I like," growled\r\nDurfy.\r\n\r\n"Awkward!  _You\'ve_ a right to be a judge of what\'s awkward after the\r\nneat way you\'ve managed things," sneered Shanklin.  "It takes you all\r\nyour time to make things awkward for yourself, let alone troubling about\r\nus."\r\n\r\nDurfy always hated when Mr Shanklin alluded to his blunders, and he\r\nscowled all the more viciously now because he felt that, after all, he\r\ncould do little against his two patrons which would not recoil with\r\ntwofold violence on his own head.  No, he had better confine his\r\nreprisals to the Crudens by Mr Shuckleford\'s assistance, and meanwhile\r\nmake what he could out of these ungrateful sharpers.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t want me with you," said he, "you\'ll have to make it worth\r\nmy while to stay away, that\'s all.  You\'d think it a fine joke if you\r\nfound yourself in the police-station instead of the railway-station to-\r\nmorrow morning, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Durfy\'s face actually relaxed into a smile at this flash of\r\npleasantry.\r\n\r\n"You\'d find it past a joke if you found yourself neck-and-crop in the\r\ngutter in two minutes," said Mr Shanklin, in a rage, "as you will do if\r\nyou don\'t take care."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take care for fifty pounds," said Durfy.  "It\'s precious little\r\nshare I\'ve had out of the business, and if you want me mum, that\'s what\r\nwill do it.  There, I could tell you a thing or two already; you don\'t\r\nknow--"\r\n\r\n"Tush!  Durfy, you\'re a born ass!  Come round to my hotel to-morrow at\r\neight, and I\'ll see what I can do for you," said Mr Medlock.\r\n\r\nDurfy knew how to value such promises, and did not look by any means\r\njubilant at the prospect held out.  However, at this moment Blandford\r\nand Pillans entered the supper-room, and his hosts had something better\r\nto think about than him.\r\n\r\nHe was hustled from his place to make room for the new guests, and\r\nsurlily retired to a neighbouring table, where, if he could not hear all\r\nthat was said, he could at least see all that went on.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said Shanklin gaily, "here\'s a nice time to turn up, dear boys.\r\nMedlock and I have nearly done supper."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t help.  We\'ve been to the theatre, haven\'t we, Pillans?" said\r\nBlandford, who appeared already to be rather the worse for drink.\r\n\r\n"I have.  _You\'ve_ been in the bar most of the time," said Pillans.\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha!  I was told Bland was studying for the Bar.  I do like\r\napplication," said Mr Medlock.\r\n\r\nBlandford seemed to regard this as a compliment, and sitting down at the\r\ntable, told the waiter to bring a bottle of champagne and some more\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, with a simper, "what I say I\'ll do, I\'ll do.  I said\r\nI\'d turn up here and pay you that bill, Shanklin, and I have turned up,\r\nhaven\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour, I\'d almost forgotten that bill," said Mr Shanklin, who\r\nhad thought of little else for the last week.  "It\'s not inconvenient, I\r\nhope?"\r\n\r\nBlandford laughed stupidly.\r\n\r\n"Sorry if a trifle like that was inconvenient," said he, with all the\r\nlanguor of a millionaire.  "Forget what it was about.  Some take in,\r\nI\'ll swear.  Never mind, a debt\'s a debt, and here goes.  How much is\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Fifty," said Mr Shanklin.\r\n\r\nBlandford produced a pocket-book with a flourish, and took from it a\r\nhandful of notes that made Durfy\'s eyes, as he sat at the distant table,\r\ngleam.  The half-tipsy spendthrift was almost too muddled to count them\r\ncorrectly, but finally he succeeded in extracting five ten-pound notes\r\nfrom the bundle, which he tossed to Shanklin.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, very much," said that gentleman, putting them in his pocket.\r\n"I find I\'ve left your bill at home, but I\'ll send it round to you in\r\nthe morning."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all serene!" said Blandford, putting his pocketbook back into his\r\npocket.  "Have another bottle of cham--do--just to celebrate--settling--\r\nold scores.  Hullo, where are you, Pillans?"\r\n\r\nPillans had gone off to play billiards with Mr Medlock, so Blandford\r\nand Mr Shanklin attacked the bottle themselves.  When it was done, the\r\nformer rose unsteadily, and, bidding his friend good-night, said he\r\nwould go home, as he\'d got a headache.  Which was about as true an\r\nobservation as man ever uttered.\r\n\r\n"Good-night--old--feller," said he; "see you to-morrow."\r\n\r\nAnd he staggered out of the place, assisted to the door by Mr Shanklin,\r\nwho, after an affectionate farewell, sauntered to the billiard-room,\r\nwhere Mr Medlock had already won a five-pound note from the ingenuous\r\nMr Pillans.\r\n\r\n"Your friend\'s in good spirits to-night," said Mr Shanklin.  "Capital\r\nfellow is Bland."\r\n\r\n"So he is," said Pillans.\r\n\r\n"Capital fellow, with plenty of capital, eh?" said Mr Medlock; "your\r\nshoot, Pillans, and I don\'t mind going a sov. with you on the cannon."\r\n\r\nOf course Pillans lost his sovereign, as he did several others before\r\nthe game was over.  Then, feeling he had had enough enjoyment for one\r\nevening, he said good-bye and followed his friend home.\r\n\r\nBut some one else had already followed his friend home.\r\n\r\nDurfy, in whose bosom the glimpse of that well-lined pocket-book had\r\nroused unusual interest, found himself ready to go home a very few\r\nmoments after Blandford had quitted the Shades.  It may have been only\r\ncoincidence, or it may have been idle curiosity to see if the tipsy lad\r\ncould find his way home without an accident, or it may have been a\r\nlaudable determination that, no one should take advantage of his\r\nhelpless condition to deprive him of that comfortable pocket-book.\r\nWhatever it was, Durfy followed the reeling figure along the pavement as\r\nit threaded its way westward from the Shades.\r\n\r\nBlandford may have had reason enough left to tell him that it would be\r\nbetter for his headache to walk in the night air than to take a cab, and\r\nMr Durfy highly approved of the decision.  He was able without\r\ndifficulty or obtrusiveness to follow his man at a few yards\' distance,\r\nand even give proof of his solicitude by an occasional steadying hand on\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nPresently the wanderer turned out of the crowded thoroughfare up a by-\r\nstreet, where he had the pavement more to himself.  Indeed, except for a\r\nfew stragglers hurrying home from theatres or concerts, he encountered\r\nno one; and as he penetrated farther beyond the region of public houses\r\nand tobacco-shops into the serener realms of offices and chambers, and\r\nbeyond that into the solitude of a West-end square, not a footstep save\r\nhis own and that of his escort broke the midnight silence.\r\n\r\nDurfy\'s heart beat fast, for he had a heart to beat on occasions like\r\nthis.  A hundred chances on which he had never calculated suddenly\r\npresented themselves.  What if some one might be peering out into the\r\nnight from one of the black windows of those silent houses?  Suppose\r\nsome motionless policeman under the shadow of a wall were near enough to\r\nsee and hear!  Suppose the cool night air had already done its work and\r\nsobered the wayfarer enough to render him obstinate or even dangerous!\r\nHe seemed to walk more steadily.  If anything was to be done, every\r\nmoment was of consequence.  And the risk?\r\n\r\nThe vision of that pocket-book and the crisp white notes flashed across\r\nDurfy\'s memory by way of answer.\r\n\r\nYes, to Durfy, the outcast, the dupe, the baffled adventurer, the risk\r\nwas worth running.\r\n\r\nHe quickened his step and opened the blade of the penknife in his pocket\r\nas he did so.  Not that he meant to use it, but in case--\r\n\r\nFaugh! the fellow was staggering as helplessly as ever!  He never even\r\nheeded the pursuing steps, but reeled on, muttering to himself, now\r\nclose to the palings, now on the kerb, his hat back on his head and the\r\ncigar between his lips not even alight.\r\n\r\nDurfy crept silently behind, and with a sudden dash locked one arm\r\ntightly round his victim\'s neck, while with the other he made a swift\r\ndive at the pocket where lay the coveted treasure.\r\n\r\nIt was all so quickly done that before Blandford could exclaim or even\r\ngasp the pocket-book was in the thief\'s hands.  Then as the arm round\r\nhis neck was relaxed, he faced round, terribly sobered, and made a wild\r\nspring at his assailant.\r\n\r\n"Thief!" he shouted, making the quiet square ring and ring again with\r\nthe echo of that word.\r\n\r\nHis hand was upon Durfy\'s collar, so fiercely that nothing but a hand-\r\nto-hand struggle could release its grip; unless--\r\n\r\nDurfy\'s hand dropped to his pocket.  There was a flash and a scream, and\r\nnext moment Blandford was clinging, groaning, to the railings of the\r\nsquare, while Durfy\'s footsteps died away in the gloomy mazes of a\r\nnetwork of back streets.\r\n\r\nWhen Pillans got home to his lodgings that night he found his comrade in\r\nbed with a severe wound in the shoulder, unable to give any account of\r\nhimself but that he had been first garotted, then robbed, and finally\r\nstabbed, on his way home from the Shades.\r\n\r\nMr Durfy did not present himself at Mr Medlock\'s hotel at the\r\nappointed hour next morning.\r\n\r\nNor, although it was a fine calm day, and their luggage was all packed\r\nup and labelled, did Mr Medlock and his friend Mr Shanklin succeed in\r\nmaking their promised trip across the Channel.  A deputation of police\r\nawaited them on the Victoria platform, and completely disconcerted their\r\narrangements by taking them in a cab to the nearest police-station on a\r\ncharge of fraud and conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SHUCKLEFORD FINDS VIRTUE ITS OWN REWARD.\r\n\r\nIt was just as well for Horace\'s peace of mind, during his time of\r\nanxious watching, that two short paragraphs in the morning papers of the\r\nfollowing day escaped his observation.\r\n\r\n"At--police-court yesterday, two men named Medlock and Shanklin were\r\nbrought before the magistrate on various charges of fraud connected with\r\nsham companies in different parts of the country.  After some formal\r\nevidence they were remanded for a week, bail being refused."\r\n\r\n"A youth named Reginald was yesterday charged at Liverpool with\r\nconspiracy to defraud by means of fictitious circulars addressed in the\r\nname of a trading company.  He was remanded for three days without bail,\r\npending inquiries."\r\n\r\nIt so happened that it fell to Booms\'s lot to cut the latter paragraph\r\nout.  And as he was barely aware of the existence of Cruden\'s brother,\r\nand in no case would have recognised him by his assumed name, the news,\r\neven if he read it, could have conveyed no intelligence to his mind.\r\n\r\nHorace certainly did not read it.  Even when he had nothing better to\r\ndo, he always regarded newspapers as a discipline not to be meddled with\r\nout of office hours.  And just now, with his mother lying in a critical\r\ncondition, and with no news day after day of Reginald, he had more\r\nserious food for reflection than the idle gossip of a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe only other person in London whom the news could have interested was\r\nSamuel Shuckleford.  But as he was that morning riding blithely in the\r\ntrain to Liverpool, reading the _Law Times_, and flattering himself he\r\nwould soon make the public "sit up" to a recognition of his astuteness,\r\nhe saw nothing of them.\r\n\r\nHe found himself on the Liverpool platform just where, scarcely three\r\nmonths ago, Reginald had found himself that dreary afternoon of his\r\narrival.  But, unlike Reginald, it cost the young ornament of the law\r\nnot a moment\'s hesitation as to whether he should take a cab or not to\r\nhis destination.  If only the cabman knew whom he had the honour to\r\ncarry, how he would touch up his horse!\r\n\r\n"Shy Street.  Put me down at the corner," said Samuel, swinging himself\r\ninto the hansom.\r\n\r\nSo this was Liverpool.  He had never been there before, and consequently\r\nit was not to be wondered at that the crowds jostling by on the\r\npavement, without so much as a glance in his direction, neither knew him\r\nnor had heard of him.  He could forgive them, and smiled to think how\r\ndifferent it would be in a few days, when all the world would point at\r\nhim as he drove back to the station, and say,--\r\n\r\n"There goes Shuckleford, the clever lawyer, who first exposed the Select\r\nAgency Corporation, don\'t you know?"\r\n\r\nDon\'t you know?  What a question to ask respecting S.S.!\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Shy Street he alighted, and sauntered gently down the\r\nstreet, keeping a sharp look-out on both sides of him, without appearing\r\nto regard anything but the pavement.\r\n\r\nHumph!  The odd numbers were on the left side, so S.S. would walk on the\r\nright, and get a good survey of Number 13 from a modest distance.\r\n\r\nWhat, thought he, would the precious Cruden Reginald (ha! ha!) think if\r\nhe knew who was walking down the other side of the road?\r\n\r\nAh! he was getting near it now.  Here was 17, a baker\'s; 15, a\r\ngreengrocer\'s; and 13--eh? a chemist\'s?  Ah, yes, he noticed that the\r\nfirst floors of all the shops were let for offices, and the first floor\r\nof the chemist\'s shop was the place he wanted.\r\n\r\nHe could see through the grimy window the top rail of a chair-back and\r\nthe corner of a table, on which stood an inkpot and a tattered\r\ndirectory.  No occupant of the room was visible; doubtless he found it\r\nprudent to keep away from the window; or he might possibly have seen the\r\nfigure of S.S. advancing down the street.\r\n\r\nSamuel crossed over.  No name was on the chemist\'s side-door, but it\r\nstood ajar, and he pushed it open and peered up the gloomy staircase.\r\nThere was a name on the door at the top, so he crept stealthily up the\r\nstairs to decipher the word "Medlock" in dim characters on the plate.\r\n\r\n"Medlock!"  Ho! ho!  He was getting warm now.  Not only was his man\r\ngoing about with his own name turned inside out, but he had the\r\neffrontery to stick up the name of one of his own directors on his door!\r\n\r\nSamuel knew Mr Medlock--whom didn\'t he know?  He had been introduced to\r\nhim by Durfy, and had supped with him once at the Shades.  A nice,\r\npleasant-spoken gentleman, who had made some very complimentary little\r\nspeeches about Samuel in Samuel\'s own hearing.  This was the man whose\r\nname Cruden had borrowed for his door-plate, in the hope of further\r\nmystifying the public as to his own personality!\r\n\r\nAh! ah!  He might mystify the public, but there was one whose initials\r\nwere S.S. whom it would need a cleverer cheat than Cruden Reginald,\r\nEsquire, to mystify!\r\n\r\nHe listened for a moment at the door, and, hearing no sound, made bold\r\nto enter.  Had Reginald been in, he was prepared to represent that,\r\nbeing on a chance visit to Liverpool, he had been unable to pass the\r\ndoor of an old neighbour without giving him a friendly call.\r\n\r\nBut he was not put to this shift, for the room was empty.  "Gone out to\r\nhis dinner, I suppose," said Sam to himself.  "Well, I\'ll take a good\r\nlook round while I am here."\r\n\r\nWhich he proceeded to do, much to his own satisfaction, but very little\r\nto his information, for scarcely a torn-up envelope was to be found to\r\nreward the spy for his trouble.  The only thing that did attract his\r\nattention as likely to be remotely useful was a fragment of a pink paper\r\nwith the letters "gerskin" on it--a relic Love would have recognised as\r\npart of the cover of an old favourite, but which to the inquiring mind\r\nof the lawyer appeared to be a document worth impounding in the\r\ninterests of justice.\r\n\r\nAs nobody appeared after the lapse of half an hour, Samuel considered\r\nhis time was being wasted, and therefore withdrew.  He looked into the\r\nchemist\'s shop as he went down, but the chemist was not at home; so he\r\nstrolled into the greengrocer\'s next door, and bought an orange, which\r\nhe proceeded to consume, making himself meanwhile cunningly agreeable to\r\nthe lady who presided over the establishment.\r\n\r\n"Fine Christmas weather," said he, looking up in the middle of a\r\nprolonged suck.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the lady.\r\n\r\n"Plenty of customers?"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.  Sam might interpret that as he liked.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you supply the Corporation next door?" said Sam, digging his\r\ncountenance once more into the orange.\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said the lady.\r\n\r\n"The--what\'s-his-name?--Mr Reginald--I suppose he deals with you?"\r\n\r\n"He did, if you want to know."\r\n\r\n"I thought so--a friend of mine, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, is he?" said the lady, finding words at last, and bridling up in a\r\nway that astonished her cross-examiner; "then the sooner you go and walk\r\noff after him the better!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," said Sam.  "He\'s not at home just now, though."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ain\'t he?" said the woman, "that\'s funny!"\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing--what should I?  If you\'re a friend of his, you\'d better\r\ntake yourself off!  That\'s what I mean."\r\n\r\n"All right; no offence, old lady.  Perhaps he\'s come in by this time."\r\n\r\nThe lady laughed disagreeably.  The Corporation had bought coals of her\r\nthree months ago.\r\n\r\nSamuel returned to the office, but it was as deserted as ever.  He\r\ntherefore resolved to try what his blandishments could do with the\r\nchemist\'s boy downstairs in the way of obtaining information.\r\n\r\nThat young gentleman, as the reader will remember, had been a bosom\r\nfriend of Love in his day, and was animated to some extent by the spirit\r\nof his comrade.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, my man!" said Sam, walking into the shop.  "Governor\'s out,\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Yus."\r\n\r\n"Got any lollipops in those bottles?"\r\n\r\n"Yus."\r\n\r\n"Any brandy-balls?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Any acid-drops?"\r\n\r\n"Yus."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take a penn\'orth, then.  I suppose you don\'t know when the\r\ngentleman upstairs will be back?"\r\n\r\nThe boy stopped short in his occupation and stared at Sam.\r\n\r\n"What gentleman?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Mr Medlock, is it? or Reginald, or some name like that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yus, I do!" said the boy, with a grin.\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"Six months all but a day.  That\'s what I reckon."\r\n\r\n"Six months!  Has he gone away, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no--he was took off."\r\n\r\n"Took off--you don\'t mean to say he\'s dead?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ain\'t you a rum \'un!  As if you didn\'t know he\'s been beaked."\r\n\r\n"Beaked! what\'s that?"\r\n\r\nThe boy looked disgusted at the fellow\'s obtuseness.\r\n\r\n"\'Ad up in the p\'lice-court, of course.  What else could I mean?"\r\n\r\nSamuel jumped off his stool as if he had been electrified.\r\n\r\n"What do you say?" said he, gaping wildly at the boy.\r\n\r\n"Go on; if you\'re deaf, it\'s no use talkin\' to you.  He\'s been up in the\r\np\'lice-court," said he, raising his voice to a shout.  "Yesterday--there\r\nyou are--and there\'s your drops, and you ain\'t give me the penny for\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nSamuel threw down the penny, and, too excited to take up the drops,\r\ndashed out into the street.\r\n\r\nWhat! yesterday--while he was lounging about town, fancying he had the\r\ngame all to himself.  Was ever luck like his?\r\n\r\nHe rushed to a shop and bought a morning paper.  There, sure enough, was\r\na short notice of yesterday\'s proceedings, and you might have knocked\r\nS.S. down with a feather as he read it.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," said he to himself, crumpling up the paper in sheer vexation,\r\n"they won\'t be able to do without me, I\'ll take care of that.  I can\r\ntell them all about it--but catch me doing it now, the snobs, unless\r\nthey\'re civil."\r\n\r\nWith which valiant determination he swung himself into another cab, and\r\nordered the man to drive to the head police-station.\r\n\r\nThe inspector was not in, but his second-in-command was, and to him,\r\nmuch against his will, Samuel had to explain his business.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you know about the prisoner?" asked the official.\r\n\r\n"Oh, plenty.  You\'d better subpoena me for the next examination," said\r\nSam.\r\n\r\nThe sub-inspector smiled.\r\n\r\n"You\'re like all the rest of them," he said, "think you know all about\r\nit.  Come, let\'s hear what you\'ve got to say, young fellow; there\'s\r\nplenty of work to be done here, I can tell you, without dawdling our\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Sam, "I\'d sooner tell the magistrate."\r\n\r\n"Go and tell the magistrate then!" shouted the official, "and don\'t stay\r\nblocking up the room here."\r\n\r\nThis was not what Samuel expected.  There was little chance of the\r\nmagistrate being more impressed with his importance than a sub-\r\ninspector.  So he felt the only thing for it was to bring himself to the\r\nunpleasant task of showing his cards after all.\r\n\r\n"The fact is--" he began.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re going to say what you know about the case, I\'ll listen to\r\nyou," said the sub-inspector, interrupting him, "if not, go and talk in\r\nthe street."\r\n\r\n"I am going to say what I know," said the crestfallen Sam.\r\n\r\n"Very well.  It\'s a pity you couldn\'t do it at first," said the\r\nofficial, getting up and standing with his back turned, warming his\r\nhands at the fire.\r\n\r\nUnder these depressing circumstances Samuel began his story, showing his\r\nweakest cards first, and saving up his trumps as long as he could.  The\r\nsub-inspector listened to him impassively, rubbing his hands, and\r\nwarming first one toe and then the other in the fender.\r\n\r\nAt length it was all finished, and he turned round.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all you know?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--at present--I expect to discover more, though, in a day or two."\r\n\r\n"Just write your name and address on one of those envelopes," said the\r\nsub-inspector, pointing to a stationery case on his table.\r\n\r\nSam obeyed, and handed the address to the official.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the latter, folding the paper up without looking at\r\nit, and putting it into his waistcoat pocket, "if we want you, we\'ll\r\nfetch you."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I had better put my statement down in writing?" said Samuel,\r\nmaking a last effort at pomposity.\r\n\r\n"Can if you like," said the sub-inspector, yawning, "when you\'ve nothing\r\nelse to do."\r\n\r\nAnd he ended the conference by calling to a constable outside to tell\r\n190 C he might come in.\r\n\r\nGrievously crestfallen, Samuel withdrew, bemoaning the hour when he\r\nfirst heard the name of Cruden, and was fool enough to dirty his hands\r\nwith a "big job."  What else was he to expect when once these official\r\nsnobs took a thing up?  Of course they would put every obstacle and\r\nhumiliation in the way of an outsider that jealousy could suggest.  He\r\nhad very little doubt that this sub-inspector, the moment his back was\r\nturned, would sit down and make notes of his information, and then take\r\nall the credit of it to himself.  Never mind, they were bound to want\r\nhim when the trial came on, and wouldn\'t he just show up their tricks!\r\nOh no!  S.S. wasn\'t going to be flouted and snubbed for nothing, he\r\ncould tell them, and so they\'d discover.\r\n\r\nIt was no use staying in Liverpool, that was clear.  The Liverpool\r\npolice should have the pleasure of fetching him all the way from London\r\nwhen they wanted him; and possibly, with Durfy\'s aid, he might succeed\r\nin getting hold of another trump-card meanwhile to turn up when they\r\nleast expected it.\r\n\r\nThe journey south next day was less blithe and less occupied with the\r\n_Law Times_ than the journey north had been.  But as he got farther away\r\nfrom inhospitable Liverpool his spirits revived, and before London was\r\nreached he was once more in imagination "the clever lawyer, Shuckleford,\r\ndon\'t you know, who gave the Liverpool police a slap in the face over\r\nthat Agency Corporation business, don\'t you know."\r\n\r\nTwo "don\'t you knows" this time!\r\n\r\nOn reaching home, any natural joy he might be expected to feel on being\r\nrestored to the bosom of his family was damped by the discovery that his\r\nmother was that very moment in next door relieving guard with Miss Crisp\r\nat the bedside of Mrs Cruden.\r\n\r\n"What business has she to do it when I told her not?" demanded Sam\r\nwrathfully of his sister.\r\n\r\n"She\'s not bound to obey you," said Jemima; "she\'s your mother."\r\n\r\n"She is.  And a nice respectable mother, too, to go mixing with a lot of\r\nlow, swindling jail-birds!  It\'s sickening!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no right to talk like that, Sam," said Jemima, flushing up;\r\n"they\'re as honest as you are--more so, perhaps.  There!"\r\n\r\n"Go it; say on," said Samuel.  "All I can tell you is, if you don\'t both\r\nof you turn the Cruden lot up, I\'ll go and live in lodgings by myself."\r\n\r\n"Why should we turn them or anybody up for you, I should like to know?"\r\nsaid Jemima, with a toss of her head.  "What have they done to you?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re an idiot," said Sam, "or you wouldn\'t talk bosh.  Your dear\r\nReginald--"\r\n\r\n"Well, what about him?" said Jemima, her trembling lip betraying the\r\ninward flutter with which she heard the name.\r\n\r\n"How would you like to know your precious Reginald was this moment in\r\nprison?"\r\n\r\n"What!" shrieked Jemima, with a clutch at her brother\'s arm.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to see there was some one he could make "sit up," and\r\nreplied, with brutal directness,--\r\n\r\n"Yes--in prison, I tell you; charged with swindling and theft ever since\r\nhe set foot in Liverpool.  There, if that\'s not reason enough for\r\nturning them up, I give you up.  You can tell mother so, and say I\'m\r\ndown at the club, and she\'d better leave supper up for me; do you hear?"\r\n\r\nJemima did not hear.  She sat rocking herself in her chair, and sobbing\r\nas if her heart would break.  Vulgar young person as she was, she had a\r\nheart, and, quite apart from everything else, the thought of the\r\ncalamity which had befallen the fatherless family was in itself enough\r\nto move her deep pity; but when to that was added her own strange but\r\nconstant affection for Reginald himself, despite all his aversion to\r\nher, it was a blow that fell heavily upon her.\r\n\r\nShe would not believe Reginald was guilty of the odious crimes Sam had\r\nso glibly catalogued; but guilty or not guilty, he was in prison, and it\r\nis only due to the honest, warm-hearted Jemima to say that she wished a\r\nhundred times that wretched evening that she could be in his place.\r\n\r\nBut could nothing be done?  She knew it was no use trying to extract any\r\nmore particulars from Samuel.  As it was, she guessed only too truly\r\nthat he would be raging with himself for telling her so much.  Her\r\nmother could do nothing.  She would probably fly with the news to Mrs\r\nCruden\'s bedside, and possibly kill her outright.\r\n\r\nHorace!  She might tell him, but she was afraid.  The news would fall on\r\nhim like a thunderbolt, and she dreaded being the person to inflict the\r\nblow.  Yet he ought to knew, even if it doubled his misery and ended in\r\nno good to Reginald.  Suppose she wrote to him.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a knock came at the door, followed by the entrance of\r\nBooms in all the gorgeousness of his evening costume.  He frequently\r\ndropped in like this, especially since Mrs Cruden\'s illness, to hear\r\nhow she was, and to inquire after Miss Crisp; and this was his errand\r\nthis evening.\r\n\r\n"No better, I suppose?" said he, dolefully, sitting down very slowly by\r\nreason of the tightness of his garments.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the doctor says she\'s better; a little, a very little," said\r\nJemima.\r\n\r\n"And _she_, of course she\'s quite knocked up?" said he, with a groan.\r\n\r\n"No.  Miss Crisp\'s taking a nap, that\'s all; and mother\'s keeping watch\r\nnext door."\r\n\r\nBooms sat very uncomfortably, not knowing what fresh topic to discourse\r\non.  But an inspiration seized him presently.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see you\'re crying," he said.  "You\'re in trouble, too."\r\n\r\n"So I am," said Jemima.\r\n\r\n"Something I\'ve done, I suppose?" said Booms.\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t.  It\'s about--about the Crudens."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course.  What about them?"\r\n\r\n"Well, isn\'t it bad enough they have this dreadful trouble?" said\r\nJemima; "but it isn\'t half the trouble they really are in."\r\n\r\n"You know I can\'t understand what you mean when you talk like that,"\r\nsaid Booms.\r\n\r\n"Will you promise, if I tell you, to keep it a secret?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course.  I hate secrets, but go on."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Booms, Mr Reginald is in prison at Liverpool, on a charge--a\r\nfalse charge, I\'m certain--of fraud.  Isn\'t it dreadful?  And Mr Horace\r\nought to know of it.  Could you break it to him?"\r\n\r\n"How can I keep it a secret and break it to him?" said Mr Booms, in a\r\npained tone.  "Oh yes, I\'ll try, if you like."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you.  Do it very gently, and be sure not to let my mother, or\r\nhis, or anybody else hear of it, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try.  Of course every one will put all the blame on me if it does\r\nspread."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t.  Do it first thing to-morrow, won\'t you, Mr Booms?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes"; and then, as if determined to be in time for the interview, he\r\nadded, "I\'d better go now."\r\n\r\nAnd he departed very like a man walking to the gallows.\r\n\r\nShuckleford returned at midnight, and found the supper waiting for him,\r\nbut, to his relief, neither of the ladies.\r\n\r\nHe wrote the following short note before he partook of his evening\r\nmeal:--\r\n\r\n"Dear D.,--Come round first thing in the morning.  The police have\r\ndished us for once, but we\'ll be quits with them if we put our heads\r\ntogether.  Be sure and come.  Yours, S.  S."\r\n\r\nAfter having posted this eloquent epistle with his own hand at the\r\npillar-box he returned to his supper, and then went, somewhat dejected,\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nREGINALD FINDS HIMSELF "DISMISSED WITH A CAUTION."\r\n\r\nThere is a famous saying of a famous modern poet which runs--\r\n\r\n"Sudden the worst turns the best to the brave."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with Reginald Cruden when finally the whole bitter truth\r\nof his position broke in upon his mind.  If the first sudden shock drove\r\nhim into the dungeon of Giant Despair, a night\'s quiet reflection, and\r\nthe consciousness of innocence within, helped him to shake off the\r\nfetters, and emerge bravely and serenely from the crisis.\r\n\r\nHe knew he had nothing to be proud of--nothing to excuse his own folly\r\nand shortsightedness--nothing to flatter his self-esteem; but no one\r\ncould accuse him of dishonour, or point the finger of shame in his way.\r\nSo he rose next morning armed for the worst.\r\n\r\nWhat that would be he could not say, but whatever it was he would face\r\nit, confident in his own integrity and the might of right to clear him.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured, in a few words, to explain the position of affairs to\r\nLove, who was characteristically quick at grasping it, and suggesting a\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n"That there Medlock\'s got to be served, and no error!" he said.  "I\'ll\r\nmurder \'im!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Reginald; "you can\'t make things right by doing wrong\r\nyourself.  And you know you wouldn\'t do such a thing."\r\n\r\n"Do I know?  Tell you I would, gov\'nor!  I\'d serve him just like that\r\nthere \'Pollyon in the book.  Or else I\'d put rat p\'ison in his beer,\r\nand--my! wouldn\'t it be a game to see the tet\'nus a-comin\' on \'im,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet," said Reginald; "I won\'t allow you to talk like that.  It\'s\r\nas bad as the _Tim Tigerskin_ days, Love, and we\'ve both done with\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right there!" said the boy, pulling his _Pilgrim\'s Progress_\r\nfrom his pocket.  "My! don\'t I wish I had the feller to myself in the\r\nSlough o\' Despond!  Wouldn\'t I \'old \'is \'ead under!  Oh no, not me!\r\nNone o\' yer Mr \'Elpses to give \'im a leg out, if I knows it!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he\'ll get punished enough without us," said Reginald.  "It\r\nwouldn\'t do us any good to see him suffering."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it, though?  Would me, I can tell yer!" said the\r\nuncompromising Love.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently hopeless to attempt to divert his young champion\'s mind\r\ninto channels of mercy.  Reginald therefore, for lack of anything else\r\nto do, suggested to him to go on with the reading aloud, a command the\r\nboy obeyed with alacrity, starting of his own accord at the beginning of\r\nthe book.  So the two sat there, and followed their pilgrim through the\r\nperils and triumphs of his way, each acknowledging in his heart the\r\nspell of the wonderful story, and feeling himself a braver man for every\r\nstep he took along with the valiant Christian.\r\n\r\nThe morning went by and noon had come, and still the boy read on, until\r\nheavy footsteps on the stairs below startled them both, and sent a quick\r\nflush into Reginald\'s cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt needed no divination to guess what it meant, and it was almost with a\r\nsigh of relief that he saw the door open and a policeman enter.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and drew himself up as the man approached.\r\n\r\n"Is your name Cruden Reginald?" said the officer.\r\n\r\n"No; it\'s Reginald Cruden."\r\n\r\n"You call yourself Cruden Reginald?"\r\n\r\n"I have done so; yes."\r\n\r\n"Then I must trouble you to come along with me, young gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Reginald, quietly.  "What am I charged with?"\r\n\r\n"Conspiracy to defraud, that\'s what\'s on the warrant.  Are you ready\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite ready.  Where are you going to take me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we shall have to look in at the station on our way, and then go\r\non to the police-court.  Won\'t take long.  Bound to remand you, you\r\nknow, for a week or something like that, and then you\'ll get committed,\r\nand the assizes are on directly after the new year, so three weeks from\r\nnow will see it all over."\r\n\r\nThe man talked in a pleasant, civil way, in a tone as if he quite\r\nsupposed Reginald might be pleased to hear the programme arranged on his\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better go," said Reginald, moving towards the door.\r\n\r\nHis face was very white and determined.  But there was a tell-tale\r\nquiver in his tightly-pressed lips which told that he needed all his\r\ncourage to help him through the ordeal before him.  Till this moment the\r\nthought of having to walk through Liverpool in custody had not entered\r\ninto his calculations, and he recoiled from it with a shiver.\r\n\r\n"I needn\'t trouble you with these," said the policeman, taking a pair of\r\nhandcuffs from his pocket; "not yet, anyhow."\r\n\r\n"Oh no.  I\'ll come quite quietly."\r\n\r\n"All right.  I\'ve my mate below.  You can walk between.  Hulloa!"\r\n\r\nThis last exclamation was addressed to Master Love, who, having\r\nwitnessed thus much of the interview in a state of stupefied\r\nbewilderment, now recovered his presence of mind sufficiently to make a\r\nfurious dash at the burly policeman.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?  Let him be; let my governor go.  He ain\'t done nothink to\r\nyou or nobody.  It\'s me, I tell yer.  I\'ve murdered dozens, do you \'ear?\r\nand robbed the till, and set the Manshing \'Ouse o\' fire, do you \'ear?\r\nYou let \'im go.  It\'s me done it!"\r\n\r\nAnd he accompanied the protest with such a furious kick at the\r\npoliceman\'s leg that that functionary grew very red in the face, and\r\nmaking a grab at the offender, seized him by the collar.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t hurt him, please," said Reginald.  "He doesn\'t mean any harm."\r\n\r\n"Tell you it\'s me," cried the boy, trembling in the grasp of the law,\r\n"me and that there Medlock.  My gov\'nor ain\'t done it."\r\n\r\n"Hush, be quiet, Love," said Reginald.  "It\'ll do no good to make a\r\nnoise.  It can\'t be helped.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nThe boy fairly broke down, and began to blubber piteously.\r\n\r\nReginald, unmanned enough as it was, had not the heart to wait longer,\r\nand walked hurriedly to the door, followed by the policeman.  This\r\nmovement once more raised the faithful Love to a final effort.\r\n\r\n"Let \'im go, do you \'ear?" shouted he, rushing down the stairs after\r\nthem.  "I\'ll do for yer if you don\'t.  Oh, guv\'nor, take me too, can\'t\r\nyer?"\r\n\r\nBut Reginald could only steel his heart for once, and feign not to hear\r\nthe appeal.\r\n\r\nThe other policeman was waiting outside, and between his two custodians\r\nhe walked, sick at heart, and faltering in courage, longing only to get\r\nout of the reach of the curious, critical eyes that turned on him from\r\nevery side, and beyond the sound of that pitiful whimper of the faithful\r\nlittle friend as it followed him step by step to the very door of the\r\npolice-station.\r\n\r\nAt the station Mr Sniff awaited the party with a pleasant smile of\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said he to Reginald, encouragingly; "much better to come\r\nquietly, looks better.  Look here, young fellow," he added, rather more\r\nconfidentially, "the first question you\'ll be asked is whether you\'re\r\nguilty or not.  Take my advice, and make a clean breast of it."\r\n\r\n"I shall say not guilty, which will be the truth."\r\n\r\nMr Sniff, as the reader has been told, had already come to the same\r\nconclusion.  Still, it being the rule of his profession always to assume\r\na man to be guilty till he can prove himself innocent, he felt it was no\r\nbusiness of his to assist the magistrate in coming to the decision by\r\nstating what he _thought_.  All he had to do was to state what he\r\n_knew_, and meanwhile, if the prisoner choose to simplify matters by\r\npleading guilty, well, why shouldn\'t he?\r\n\r\n"Please yourself about that.  Have you made your entries, Jones?  The\r\nvan will be here directly.  See you later on," added he, nodding to\r\nReginald.\r\n\r\nReginald waited there for the van like a man in a dream.  People came in\r\nand out, spoke, laughed, looked about them, even mentioned his name.\r\nBut they all seemed part of some curious pageant, of which he himself\r\nformed not the least unreal portion.  His mind wandered off on a hundred\r\nlittle insignificant topics.  Snatches of the _Pilgrim\'s Progress_ came\r\ninto his mind, half-forgotten airs of music crossed his memory, the\r\nvision of young Gedge as he last saw him fleeted before his eyes.  He\r\ntried in vain to collect his thoughts, but they were hopelessly astray,\r\nleaving him for the time barely conscious, and wholly uninterested in\r\nwhat was taking place around him.\r\n\r\nThe van came at last, a vehicle he had often eyed curiously as it\r\nrumbled past him in the streets.  Little had he ever dreamed of riding\r\none day inside it.\r\n\r\nThe usual knot of loungers waited at the door of the police-court to see\r\nthe van disgorge its freight.  Sometimes they had been rewarded for\r\ntheir patience by the glimpse of a real murderer, or wife-kicker, or\r\nburglar, and sometimes they had had their bit of fun over a "tough\r\ncustomer," who, if he must travel at her Majesty\'s expense, was\r\ndetermined to travel all the way, and insisted on being carried by the\r\narms and legs across the pavement into the tribunal of justice.  There\r\nwas no such fun to be got out of Reginald as he stepped hurriedly from\r\nthe van, and with downcast eyes entered by the prisoners\' door into the\r\ncourt-house.\r\n\r\nA case was already in progress, and he had to wait in a dimly-lit\r\nunderground lobby for his summons.  The constable who had arrested him\r\nwas still beside him, and other groups, mostly of police, filled up the\r\nplace.  But he heeded none, longing--oh! how intensely--to hear his name\r\ncalled and to know the worst.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a bustle near the door, and he knew the case\r\nupstairs was at an end.\r\n\r\n"Six months," some one said.\r\n\r\nSome one else whistled softly.\r\n\r\n"Whew--old Fogey\'s in one of his tantrums, then.  He\'d have only got\r\nthree at Dark Street."\r\n\r\nThen some one called the name "Reginald," and the policeman near him\r\nsaid "Coming."  Then, turning to the prisoner, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Fogey\'s on the bench to-day, and he\'s particular.  Look alive."\r\n\r\nReginald found himself being hurried to the door through a lane of\r\nofficials and others towards the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Your turn next, Grinder," he heard some one say as he passed.  "Ten-\r\nminutes will do this case."\r\n\r\nTo Reginald the stairs seemed interminable.  There was a hum of voices\r\nabove, and a shuffling of feet as of people taking a momentary\r\nrelaxation in the interval of some performance.  Then a loud voice\r\ncried, "Silence--order in the court, sit down, gentlemen," and there\r\nfell an unearthly stillness on the place.\r\n\r\n"To the right," said the policeman, coming beside him, and taking his\r\narm as if to direct him.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of a score of curious faces turned on him, of some one\r\non the bench folding up a newspaper and adjusting his glasses, of a man\r\nat a table throwing aside a quill pen and taking another, of a click of\r\na latch closing behind him, of a row of spikes in front of him.  Then he\r\nfound himself alone.\r\n\r\nWhat followed he scarcely could tell.  He was vaguely aware of some one\r\nwith Mr Sniff\'s voice making a statement in which his (Reginald\'s) own\r\nname occurred, another voice from the bench breaking in every now and\r\nthen, and yet another voice from the table talking too, accompanied by\r\nthe squeaking of a pen across paper.  Then the constable who had\r\narrested him said something, and after the constable some one else.\r\n\r\nThen followed a dialogue in undertone between the bench and the table,\r\nand once more Mr Sniff\'s voice, and at last the voice from the bench, a\r\ngruff, unsympathetic voice, said,--\r\n\r\n"Now, sir, what have you got to say for yourself?"\r\n\r\nThe question roused him.  It was intended for him, and he awoke to the\r\nconsciousness that, after all, he had some interest in what was going\r\non.\r\n\r\nHe raised his head and said,--\r\n\r\n"I\'m not guilty."\r\n\r\n"You reserve your defence, then?"\r\n\r\n"Tell him yes," said the policeman.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then.  I shall remand you for three days.  Bring him up\r\nagain on Friday."\r\n\r\nAnd the magistrate took up his newspaper, the clerk at the table laying\r\ndown his pen; the bustle and shuffling of feet filled the room, and in\r\nanother moment Reginald was down the staircase, and the voice he had\r\nheard before called,--\r\n\r\n"Remand three days.  Now then, Grinder, up you go--"\r\n\r\nIn all his conjectures as to what might befall him, the possibility of\r\nbeing actually sent to prison had never entered Reginald\'s head.  That\r\nhe would be suspected, arrested, taken to the police-station, and\r\nfinally brought before a magistrate, he had foreseen.  That was bad\r\nenough, but he had steeled his resolution to the pitch of going through\r\nwith it, sure that the clearing of his character would follow any\r\ninquiry into the case.\r\n\r\nBut to be lodged for three days as a common felon in a police cell was a\r\nfate he had not once realised, and which, when its full meaning broke\r\nupon him, crushed the spirit out of him.\r\n\r\nHe made no resistance, no protest, no complaint as they hustled him back\r\ninto the van, and from the van to the cell which was to be his dreary\r\nlodging for those three days.  He felt degraded, dishonoured, disgraced,\r\nand as he sat hour after hour brooding over his lot, his mind, already\r\noverwrought, lost its courage and let go its hope.\r\n\r\nSuppose he really had done something to be ashamed of?  Suppose he had\r\nall along had his vague suspicions of the honesty of the Corporation,\r\nand yet had continued to serve them?  Suppose, with the best of\r\nintentions, he had shut his eyes wilfully to what he might and must have\r\nseen?  Suppose, in fact, his negligence had been criminal?  How was he\r\never to hold up his head again and face the world like an honest man,\r\nand say he had defrauded no man?\r\n\r\nAnd then there came up in terrible array that long list of customers to\r\nthe Corporation whom he had lured and enticed by promises he had never\r\ntaken the trouble to inquire into to part with their money.  And the\r\nburden of their loss lay like an incubus on his spirit, till he actually\r\npersuaded himself he was guilty.\r\n\r\nI need not sadden the reader with dwelling on the misery of those three\r\ndays.  Any one almost could have endured them better than Reginald.  He\r\nbegan a letter to Horace, but he tore it up when half-written.  He drew\r\nup a statement of his own defence, but when fact after fact appeared in\r\narray on the paper it seemed more like an indictment than a defence, and\r\nhe tore it up too.\r\n\r\nAt length the weary suspense was over, and once more he found himself in\r\nthe outer air, stepping with almost familiar tread across the pavement\r\ninto the van, and taking his place among the waiters in the dim lobby at\r\nthe foot of the police-court stairs.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he stood once more in the dock none of his former\r\nbewilderment remained to befriend him.  It was all too real this time.\r\nWhen some one spoke of the "prisoner" he knew it meant himself, and when\r\nthey spoke of fraud he knew they referred to something he had done.  Oh,\r\nthat he could see it all in a dream once more, and wake up to find\r\nhimself on the other side!\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr Sniff, you\'ve got something to say?" said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n"Yes, your worship," replied Mr Sniff, not moving to the witness-box,\r\nbut speaking from his seat.  "We don\'t propose to continue this case."\r\n\r\n"What?  It\'s a clear case, isn\'t it?" said the magistrate, with the air\r\nof a man who is being trifled with.\r\n\r\n"No, your worship.  There\'s not evidence enough to ask you to send the\r\nprisoner to trial."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'d better sentence him myself."\r\n\r\n"I think not, your worship.  Our evidence only went to show that the\r\nprisoner was in the employment of the men who started the company.  But\r\nwe have no evidence that he was aware that the concern was fraudulent,\r\nand as he does not appear to have appropriated any of the money, we\r\nadvise dismissing the case.  The real offenders are in custody, and have\r\npractically admitted their guilt."\r\n\r\nThe magistrate looked very ill-tempered and offended.  He did not like\r\nbeing told what he was told, especially by the police, and he had a\r\nrighteous horror of cases being withdrawn from his authority.\r\n\r\nHe held a snappish consultation with his clerk, which by no means tended\r\nto pacify him, for that functionary whispered his opinion that as the\r\ncase had been withdrawn there was nothing for it but for his worship to\r\ndismiss the case.\r\n\r\nSomebody, at any rate, should smart for his injured feelings, and as he\r\ndid not know law enough to abuse Mr Sniff, and had not pretext\r\nsufficient to abuse his clerk, he gathered himself for a castigation of\r\nthe prisoner, which should not only serve as a caution to that youth for\r\nhis future guidance, but should also relieve his own magisterial mind.\r\n\r\n"Now, prisoner," began he, setting his spectacles and leaning forward in\r\nhis seat, "you\'ve heard what the officer has said.  You may consider\r\nyourself fortunate--very fortunate--there is not enough evidence to\r\nconvict you.  Don\'t flatter yourself that a breakdown in the prosecution\r\nclears your character.  In the eyes of the law you may be clear, but\r\nmorally, let me tell you, you are far from being so.  It\'s affectation\r\nto tell me you could live for three months the centre of a system of\r\nfraud and yet have your hands clean.  You must make good your account\r\nbetween your own conscience and the hundreds of helpless, unfortunate\r\npoor men and women you have been the means of depriving of their hard-\r\nearned money.  You have already been kept in prison for three days.  Let\r\nme hope that will be a warning to you not to meddle in future with\r\nfraud, if you wish to pass as an honest man.  If you touch pitch, sir,\r\nyou must expect to be denied.  Return to paths of honesty, young man,\r\nand seek to recover the character you have forfeited, and bear in mind\r\nthe warning you have had, if you wish to avoid a more serious stain in\r\nthe future.  The case is dismissed."\r\n\r\nWith which elegant peroration the magistrate, much relieved in his own\r\nmind, took up his newspaper, and Reginald was hurried once more down\r\nthose steep stairs a free man.\r\n\r\n"Slice of luck for you, young shaver!" said the friendly policeman,\r\nslipping off the handcuffs.\r\n\r\n"Regular one of Sniff\'s little games!" said another standing near; "he\r\nalways lets his little fish go when he\'s landed his big ones!  To my\r\nmind it\'s a risky business.  Never mind."\r\n\r\n"You can go when you like now," said the policeman to Reginald; "and\r\nwhenever we come across a shilling for a drink we\'ll drink your health,\r\nmy lad."\r\n\r\nReginald saw the hint, and handed the policeman one of his last\r\nshillings.  Then, buttoning his coat against the cold winter wind, he\r\nwalked out, a free man, into the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE DARKEST HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN.\r\n\r\nIf the worshipful magistrate flattered himself that the reprimand he had\r\naddressed to Reginald that afternoon would move his hearer to self-\r\nabasement or penitence, he had sadly miscalculated the power of his own\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nEvery word of that "caution" had entered like iron into the boy\'s soul,\r\nand had roused in him every evil passion of which his nature was\r\ncapable.  A single word of sympathy or kindly advice might have won him\r\nheart and soul.  But those stinging, brutal sentences goaded him almost\r\nto madness, and left him desperate.\r\n\r\nWhat was the use of honesty, of principle, of conscientiousness, if they\r\nwere all with one accord to rise against him and degrade him?\r\n\r\nWhat was the use of trying to be better than others when the result was\r\nan infamy which, had he been a little more greedy or a little less\r\nupright, he might have avoided?\r\n\r\nWhat was the use of conscious innocence and unstained honour, when they\r\ncould not save him from a sense of shame of which no convicted felon\r\ncould know the bitterness?\r\n\r\nIt would go out to all the world that Reginald Cruden, the suspected\r\nswindler, had been "let off" for lack of evidence after three days\'\r\nimprisonment.  The victims of the Corporation would read it, and regret\r\nthe failure of justice to overtake the man who had robbed them.  His\r\nfather\'s old county friends would read it, and shake their heads over\r\npoor Cruden\'s prodigal.  The Wilderham fellows would read it, and set\r\nhim down as one more who had gone to the bad.  Young Gedge would read\r\nit, and scorn him for a hypocrite and a humbug.  Durfy would read it,\r\nand chuckle.  His mother and Horace would read it.  Yes, and what would\r\nthey think?  Nothing he could say would convince them or anybody.  They\r\nmight forgive him, but--\r\n\r\nThe thought made his blood boil within him.  He would take forgiveness\r\nfrom no man or woman.  If they chose to believe him guilty, let them;\r\nbut let them keep their forgiveness to themselves.  Rather let them give\r\nthe dog a bad name and hang him.  He did not care!  Would that they\r\ncould!\r\n\r\nSuch was the rush of thought that passed through his mind as he stood\r\nthat bleak winter afternoon in the street, a free man.\r\n\r\nFree! he laughed at the word, and envied the burglar with his six\r\nmonths.  What spirit of malignity had hindered Mr Sniff from letting\r\nhim lose himself in a felon\'s cell rather than turn him out "free" into\r\na world every creature of which was an enemy?\r\n\r\nAre you disgusted with him, reader?  With his poor spirit, his weak\r\npurpose, his blind folly?  Do you say that you, in his shoes, would have\r\ndone better? that you would never have lost courage? that you would have\r\nheld up your head still, and braved the storm?  Alas, alas, that the\r\nReginalds are so many and the heroes of your sort so few!\r\n\r\nAlas for the sensitive natures whom injustice can crush and make cowards\r\nof!  You are not sensitive, thank God, and you do not know what crushing\r\nis.  Pray that you never may; but till you have felt it deal leniently\r\nwith poor Reginald, as he goes recklessly out into the winter gloom\r\nwithout a friend--not even himself.\r\n\r\nIt mattered little to him where he went or what became of him.  It made\r\nno odds how and when he should spend his last shilling.  He was hungry\r\nnow.  Since early that morning nothing had passed his lips.  Why not\r\nspend it now and have done with it?\r\n\r\nSo he turned into a coffee-shop, and ordered coffee and a plate of beef.\r\n\r\n"My last meal," said he to himself, with a bitter smile.\r\n\r\nHis appetite failed him when the food appeared, but he ate and drank out\r\nof sheer bravado.  His enemies--Durfy, and the magistrate, and the\r\nvictims of the Corporation--would rejoice to see him turn with a shudder\r\nfrom his food.  He would devour it to spite them.\r\n\r\n"How much?" said he, when it was done.\r\n\r\n"Ninepence, please," said the rosy-cheeked girl who waited.\r\n\r\nReginald tossed her the shilling.\r\n\r\n"Keep the change for yourself," said he, and walked out of the shop.\r\n\r\nHe was free now with a vengeance!  He might do what he liked, go where\r\nhe liked, starve where he liked.\r\n\r\nHe wandered up and down the streets that winter evening recklessly\r\nindifferent to what became of him.  The shops were gaily lighted and\r\nadorned with Christmas decorations.  Boys and girls, men and women,\r\nthronged them, eager in their purchases and radiant in the prospect of\r\nthe coming festival.  There went a grave father, parading the pavement\r\nwith a football under his arm for the boy at home; and here a lad, with\r\nhis mother\'s arm in his, stood halted before an array of fur cloaks, and\r\nbade her choose the best among them.  Bright-eyed school-girls brushed\r\npast him with their brothers, smiling and talking in holiday glee; and\r\nhere a trio of school-chums, arm-in-arm, bore down upon him, laughing\r\nover some last-term joke.  He watched them all.\r\n\r\nTimes were when his heart would warm and soften within him at the\r\nmemories sights like these inspired; but they were nothing to him now;\r\nor if they were anything, they were part of a universal conspiracy to\r\nmock him.  Let them mock him; what cared he?\r\n\r\nThe night drew on.  One by one the gay lights in the shops went out, and\r\nthe shutters hid the crowded windows.  One by one the passengers\r\ndispersed, some to besiege the railway-stations, some to invade the\r\ntrams, others to walk in cheery parties by the frosty roads; all to go\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nEven the weary shopmen and shop-girls, released from the day\'s labours,\r\nhurried past him homeward, and the sleepy cabman whipped up his horse\r\nfor his last fare before going home, and the tramps and beggars vanished\r\ndown their alleys, and sought every man his home.\r\n\r\nHome!  The word had no meaning to-night for Reginald as he watched the\r\nstreets empty, and found himself a solitary wayfarer in the deserted\r\nthoroughfares.\r\n\r\nThe hum of traffic ceased.  One by one the bedroom lights went out, the\r\nclocks chimed midnight clearly in the frosty air, and still he wandered\r\non.\r\n\r\nHe passed a newspaper-office, where the thunder of machinery and the\r\nglare of the case-room reminded him of his own bitter apprenticeship at\r\nthe _Rocket_.  They might find him a job here if he applied.  Faugh! who\r\nwould take a gaol-bird, a "let-off" swindler, into their employ?\r\n\r\nHe strolled down to the docks.  The great river lay asleep.  The docks\r\nwere, deserted; the dockyards silent.  Only here and there a darting\r\nlight, or the distant throb of an engine, broke the slumber of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nA man came up to him as he stood on the jetty.\r\n\r\n"Now then, sheer off; do you hear?" he said.  "What do you want here?"\r\n\r\n"Mayn\'t I watch the river?" said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"Not here.  We\'ve had enough of your sort watching the river.  Off you\r\ngo," and he laid his hand on the boy\'s collar and marched him off the\r\npier.\r\n\r\nOf course!  Who had not had enough of his sort?  Who would not suspect\r\nhim wherever he went?  Cain went about with a mark on his forehead for\r\nevery one to know him by.  In what respect was he better off, when men\r\nseemed to know by instinct and in the dark that he was a character to\r\nmistrust and suspect?\r\n\r\nThe hours wore on.  Even the printing-office when he passed it again was\r\ngoing to rest.  The compositors one by one were flitting home, and the\r\nengine was dropping asleep.  He stood and watched the men come out, and\r\nwondered if any of them were like himself--whether among them was a\r\nyoung Gedge or a Durfy?\r\n\r\nThen he wandered off back into the heart of the town.  A wretched\r\noutcast woman, with a child in her arms, stood at the street corner and\r\naccosted him.\r\n\r\n"Do, kind gentleman, give me a penny.  The child\'s starving, and we\'re\r\nso cold and hungry."\r\n\r\n"I\'d give you one if I had one," said Reginald; "but I\'m as poor as you\r\nare."\r\n\r\nThe woman sighed, and drew her rags round the infant.\r\n\r\nReginald watched her for a moment, and then, taking off his overcoat,\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"You\'d better put this round you."\r\n\r\nAnd he dropped it at her feet, and hurried away before she could pick up\r\nthe gift, or bless the giver.\r\n\r\nHe gave himself no credit for the deed, and he wanted none.  What did he\r\ncare about a coat? he who had been frozen to the heart already.  Would a\r\ncoat revive his good name, or cover the disgrace of that magisterial\r\ncaution?\r\n\r\nThe clocks struck four, and the long winter night grew bleaker and\r\ndarker.  It was eleven hours since he had taken that last defiant meal,\r\nand Nature began slowly to assert her own with the poor outcast.  He was\r\nfaint and tired out, and the breeze cut him through.  Still the rebel\r\nspirit within him denied that he was in distress.  No food or rest or\r\nshelter for him!  All he craved was leave to lose himself and forget his\r\nown name.\r\n\r\nIs it any use bidding him, as we bade him once before, turn round and\r\nface the evil genius that is pursuing him? or is there nothing for him\r\nnow but to run?  He has run all night, but he is no farther ahead than\r\nwhen he stood at the police-court door.  On the contrary, it is running\r\nhim down fast, and as he staggers forward into the darkest hour of that\r\ncruel night, it treads on his heels and begins to drag him back.\r\n\r\nIs there no home? no voice of a friend? no helping hand to save him from\r\nthat worst of all enemies--his evil self?\r\n\r\nIt was nearly five o\'clock when, without knowing how he got there, he\r\nfound himself on the familiar ground of Shy Street.  In the dim\r\nlamplight he scarcely recognised it at first, but when he did it seemed\r\nlike a final stroke of irony to bring him there, at such a time, in such\r\na mood.  What else could it be meant for but to remind him there was no\r\nescape, no hope of losing himself, no chance of forgetting?\r\n\r\nThat gaunt, empty window of Number 13, with the reflected glare of the\r\nlamp opposite upon it, seemed to leer down on him like a mocking ghost,\r\nclaiming him as its own.  What was the use of keeping up the struggle\r\nany longer?  After all, was there not one way of escape?\r\n\r\nWhat was it crouching at the door of Number 13, half hidden in the\r\nshade?  A dog? a woman? a child?\r\n\r\nHe stood still a moment, with beating heart, straining his eyes through\r\nthe gloom.  Then he crossed.  As he did so the figure sprang to its feet\r\nand rushed to meet him.\r\n\r\n"I knowed it, gov\'nor; I knowed you was a-comin\'," cried a familiar\r\nboy\'s voice.  "It\'s all right now.  It\'s all right, gov\'nor!"\r\n\r\nNever did sweeter music fall on mortal ears than these broken,\r\nbreathless words on the spirit of Reginald.  It was the voice he had\r\nbeen waiting for to save him in his extremity--the voice of love to\r\nremind him he was not forsaken; the voice of trust to remind him some\r\none believed in him still; the voice of hope to remind him all was not\r\nlost yet.  It called him back to himself; it thawed the chill at his\r\nheart, and sent new life into his soul.  It was like a key to liberate\r\nhim from the dungeon of Giant Despair.\r\n\r\n"Why, Love, is that you, my boy?" he cried, seizing the lad\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"It is so, gov\'nor," whimpered the boy, trembling with excitement, and\r\nclinging to his protector\'s hand.  "I knowed you was a-comin\', but I was\r\na\'most feared I wouldn\'t see you too."\r\n\r\n"What made you think I would come?" said Reginald, looking down with\r\ntears in his eyes on the poor wizened upturned face.\r\n\r\n"I knowed you was a-comin\'," repeated the boy, as if he could not say it\r\ntoo often; "and I waited and waited, and there you are.  It\'s all right,\r\ngov\'nor."\r\n\r\n"It _is_ all right, old fellow," said Reginald.  "You don\'t know what\r\nyou\'ve saved me from."\r\n\r\n"Go on," said the boy, recovering his composure in the great content of\r\nhis discovery.  "I ain\'t saved you from nothink.  Leastways unless you\r\nwas a-goin\' to commit soosanside.  If you was, you was a flat to come\r\nthis way.  That there railway-cutting\'s where I\'d go, and then at the\r\ninkwidge they don\'t know if you did it a-purpose or was topped over by\r\nthe train, and they gives you the benefit of the doubt, and says, `Found\r\ndead.\'"\r\n\r\n"We won\'t talk about it," said Reginald, smiling, the first smile that\r\nhad crossed his lips for a week.  "Do you know, young \'un, I\'m hungry;\r\nare you?"\r\n\r\n"Got any browns?" said Love.\r\n\r\n"Not a farthing."\r\n\r\n"More ain\'t I, but I\'ll--" He paused, and a shade of doubt crossed his\r\nface as he went on.  "Say, gov\'nor, think they\'d give us a brown for\r\nthis \'ere _Robinson_?"\r\n\r\nAnd he pulled out his _Robinson Crusoe_ bravely and held it up.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not.  It only cost threepence."\r\n\r\nAnother inward debate took place; then drawing out his beloved\r\n_Pilgrim\'s Progress_, he put the two books together, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Suppose they\'d give us one for them two?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let\'s part with them if we can help," said Reginald.  "Suppose we\r\ntry to earn something?"\r\n\r\nThe boy said nothing, but trudged on beside his protector till they\r\nemerged from Shy Street and stood in one of the broad empty main streets\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nHere Reginald, worn out with hunger and fatigue, and borne up no longer\r\nby the energy of desperation, sank half fainting into a doorstep.\r\n\r\n"I\'m--so tired," he said; "let\'s rest a bit.  I\'ll be all right--in a\r\nminute."\r\n\r\nLove looked at him anxiously for a moment, and then saying, "Stay you\r\nthere, gov\'nor, till I come back," started off to run.\r\n\r\nHow long Reginald remained half-unconscious where the boy left him he\r\ncould not exactly tell; but when he came to himself an early streak of\r\ndawn was lighting the sky, and Love was kneeling beside him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, gov\'nor," said he, holding up a can of hot coffee and a\r\nslice of bread in his hands.  "Chuck these here inside yer; do you\r\n\'ear?"\r\n\r\nReginald put his lips eagerly to the can.  It was nearly sixteen hours\r\nsince he had touched food.  He drained it half empty; then stopping\r\nsuddenly, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Have you had any yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Me?  In corse!  Do you suppose I ain\'t \'ad a pull at it?"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t," said Reginald, eyeing him sharply, and detecting the\r\nwell-meant fraud in his looks.  "Unless you take what\'s left there, I\'ll\r\nthrow it all into the road."\r\n\r\nIn vain Love protested, vowed he loathed coffee, that it made him sick,\r\nthat he preferred prussic acid; Reginald was inexorable, and the boy was\r\nobliged to submit.  In like manner, no wile or device could save him\r\nfrom having to share the slice of bread; nor, when he did put it to his\r\nlips, could any grimace or protest hide the almost ravenous eagerness\r\nwith which at last he devoured it.\r\n\r\n"Now you wait till I take back the can," said Love.  "I\'ll not be a\r\nminute," and he darted off, leaving Reginald strengthened in mind and\r\nbody by the frugal repast.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the boy returned that he noticed he wore no coat.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with it?" he demanded sternly.\r\n\r\n"Me?  What are you talking about?" said the boy, looking guiltily\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t deceive me!" said Reginald.  "Where\'s your coat?"\r\n\r\n"What do I want with coats?  Do you--"\r\n\r\n"Have you sold it for our breakfast?"\r\n\r\n"Go on!  Do you think--"\r\n\r\n"Have you?" repeated Reginald, this time almost angrily.\r\n\r\n"Maybe I \'ave," said the boy; "ain\'t I got a right to?"\r\n\r\n"No, you haven\'t; and you\'ll have to wear mine now."\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded to take it off, when the boy said,--\r\n\r\n"All right.  If you take that off, gov\'nor, I slides--I mean it--so I\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nThere was a look of such wild determination in his pinched face that\r\nReginald gave up the struggle for the present.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll share it between us, at any rate," said he.  "Whatever induced\r\nyou to do such a foolish thing, Love?"\r\n\r\n"Bless you, I ain\'t got no sense," replied the boy cheerily.\r\n\r\nDay broke at last, and Liverpool once more became alive with bustle and\r\ntraffic.  No one noticed the two shivering boys as they wended their way\r\nthrough the streets, trying here and there, but in vain, for work, and\r\nwondering where and when they should find their next meal.  But for\r\nReginald that walk, faint and footsore as he was, was a pleasure-trip\r\ncompared with the night\'s wanderings.\r\n\r\nTowards afternoon Love had the rare good fortune to see a gentleman drop\r\na purse on the pavement.  There was no chance of appropriating it, had\r\nhe been so minded, which, to do him justice, he was not, for the purse\r\nfell in a most public manner in the sight of several onlookers.  But\r\nLove was the first to reach it and hand it back to its owner.\r\n\r\nNow Love\'s old story-books had told him that honesty of this sort is a\r\nvery paying sort of business; and though he hardly expected the\r\nwonderful consequences to follow his own act which always befall the\r\nsuperfluously honest boys in the "penny dreadfuls," he was yet low-\r\nsouled enough to linger sufficiently long in the neighbourhood of the\r\nowner of the purse to give him an opportunity of proving the truth of\r\nthe story-book moral.\r\n\r\nNor was he disappointed; for the good gentleman, happening to have no\r\nless than fifty pounds in gold and notes stored up in this particular\r\npurse, was magnanimous enough to award Love a shilling for his lucky\r\npiece of honesty, a result which made that young gentleman\'s countenance\r\nglow with a grin of the profoundest satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"My eye, gov\'nor," said he, returning radiant with his treasure to\r\nReginald, and thrusting it into his hand; "\'ere, lay \'old.  \'Ere\'s a\r\nslice o\' luck.  Somethink like that there daily bread you was a-tellin\'\r\nme of t\'other day.  No fear, I ain\'t forgot it.  Now, I say sassages.\r\nWhat do you say?"\r\n\r\nReginald said "sausages" too; and the two friends, armed with their\r\nmagic shilling, marched boldly into a cosy coffee-shop where there was a\r\nblazing fire and a snug corner, and called for sausages for two.  And\r\nthey never enjoyed such a meal in all their lives.  How they did make\r\nthose sausages last!  And what life and comfort they got out of that\r\nfire, and what rest out of those cane-bottomed chairs!\r\n\r\nAt the end of it all they had fourpence left, which, after serious\r\nconsultation, it was decided to expend in a bed for the night.\r\n\r\n"If we can get a good sleep," said Reginald, "and pull ourselves\r\ntogether, we\'re bound to get a job of some sort to-morrow.  Do you know\r\nany lodging-house?"\r\n\r\n"Me? don\'t I?  That there time you jacked me up I was a night in a place\r\ndown by the river.  It ain\'t a dainty place, gov\'nor, but it\'s on\'y\r\ntwopence a piece or threepence a couple on us, and that\'ll leave a brown\r\nfor the morning."\r\n\r\n"All right.  Let\'s go there soon, and get a long night."\r\n\r\nLove led the way through several low streets beside the wharves until he\r\ncame to a court in which stood a tumble-down tenement with the legend\r\n"Lodgings" scrawled on a board above the door.  Here they entered, and\r\nLove in a few words bargained with the sour landlady for a night\'s\r\nlodging.  She protested at first at their coming so early, but finally\r\nyielded, on condition they would make the threepence into fourpence.\r\nThey had nothing for it but to yield.\r\n\r\n"Up you go, then," said the woman, pointing to a rickety ladder which\r\nserved the house for a staircase.  "There\'s one there already.  Never\r\nmind him; you take the next."\r\n\r\nReginald turned almost sick as he entered the big, stifling, filthy loft\r\nwhich was to serve him for a night\'s lodging.  About a dozen beds were\r\nranged along the walls on either side, one of which, that in the far\r\ncorner of the room, was, as the woman had said, occupied.  The\r\natmosphere of the place was awful already.  What would it be when a\r\ndozen or possibly two dozen persons slept there?\r\n\r\nReginald\'s first impulse was to retreat and rather spend another night\r\nin the streets than in such a place.  But his weary limbs and aching\r\nbones forbade it.  He must stay where he was now.\r\n\r\nAlready Love was curled up and asleep on the bed next to that where the\r\nother lodger lay; and Reginald, stifling every feeling but his\r\nweariness, flung himself by his side and soon forgot both place and\r\nsurroundings in a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\nHeavy but fitful.  He had scarcely lain an hour when he found himself\r\nsuddenly wide awake.  Love still lay breathing heavily beside him.  The\r\nother lodger turned restlessly from side to side, muttering to himself,\r\nand sometimes moaning like a person in pain.  It must have been these\r\nlatter sounds which awoke Reginald.  He lay for some minutes listening\r\nand watching in the dim candle-light the restless tossing of the bed-\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nPresently the sick man--for it was evident sickness was the cause of his\r\nuneasiness--lifted himself on his elbow with a groan, and said,--\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake--help me!"\r\n\r\nIn a moment Reginald had sprung to his feet, and was beside the\r\nsufferer.\r\n\r\n"Are you ill," he said.  "What is the matter?"\r\n\r\nBut the man, instead of replying, groaned and fell heavily back on the\r\nbed.  And as the dim light of the candle fell upon his upturned face,\r\nReginald, with a cry of horror, recognised the features of Mr Durfy,\r\nalready released by death from the agonies of smallpox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nLOST AND FOUND.\r\n\r\nBooms was not exactly the sort of man to be elated by the mission which\r\nMiss Shuckleford had thrust upon him.  He passed a restless night in\r\nturning the matter over in his mind and wondering how he could break the\r\nnews gently to his friend.\r\n\r\nFor he was fond of Horace, and in his saturnine way felt deeply for him\r\nin his trouble.  And on this account he wished Jemima had chosen any\r\nother confidant to discharge the unpleasant task.\r\n\r\nHe hung about outside Mrs Cruden\'s house for an hour early that\r\nmorning, in the hope of being able to entrap Miss Crisp and get her to\r\ntake the duty off his hands.  But Miss Crisp had been sitting up all\r\nnight with the patient and did not appear.\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the door and asked the servant-girl how Mrs Cruden was.\r\nShe was a little better, but very weak and not able to speak to anybody.\r\n\r\n"Any news from Liverpool?" inquired Booms.  This had become a daily\r\nquestion among those who inquired at Number 6, Dull Street.\r\n\r\n"No, no news," said the girl, with a guilty blush.  She knew the reason\r\nwhy.  Reginald\'s last letter, written just before his arrest, was at\r\nthat moment in her pocket.\r\n\r\n"Has Mr Horace started to the office?"\r\n\r\n"No; he\'s a-going to wait and see the doctor, and he says I was to ask\r\nyou to tell the gentleman so."\r\n\r\n"Can I see him?"\r\n\r\n"No; he\'s asleep just now," said the girl.\r\n\r\nSo Booms had to go down alone to the _Rocket_, as far as ever from\r\ngetting the burden of Jemima\'s secret off his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had a good mind to pass it on to Waterford, and might have done so,\r\nhad not that young gentleman been engaged all the morning on special\r\nduty, which kept him in Mr Granville\'s room.\r\n\r\nBooms grew more and more dispirited and nervous.  Every footstep that\r\ncame to the door made him tremble, for fear it should be the signal for\r\nthe unhappy disclosure.  He tried hard to persuade himself it would be\r\nkinder after all to say nothing about it.  What good could it do now?\r\n\r\nBooms, as the reader knows, had not a very large mind.  But what there\r\nwas of it was honest, and it told him, try how he would, there was no\r\ngetting out of a promise.  So he busied himself with concocting\r\nimaginary phrases and letters, by way of experiment as to the neatest\r\nway of breaking his bad news.\r\n\r\nStill he dreaded his friend\'s arrival more and more; and when at last a\r\nbrisk footstep halted at the door, he started and turned pale like a\r\nguilty thing, and wished Jemima at the bottom of the sea!\r\n\r\nBut the footstep was not Horace\'s.  Whoever the arrival was, he tapped\r\nat the door before entering, and then, without waiting for a reply,\r\nwalked in.\r\n\r\nIt was a youth of about seventeen or eighteen, with a bright honest face\r\nand cheery smile.\r\n\r\n"Is Horace Cruden here?" he inquired eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Booms, in his most doleful accents.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this where he works?"\r\n\r\n"It is indeed."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, is anything wrong?  Is he ill?"\r\n\r\n"No.  _He_ is not ill," said Booms, emphasising the pronoun.\r\n\r\n"Is Reginald ill, then, or their mother?"\r\n\r\nA ray of hope crossed Booms\'s mind.  This stranger was evidently a\r\nfriend of the family.  He called the boys by their Christian names, and\r\nknew their mother.  Would he take charge of the dismal secret?\r\n\r\n"His mother is ill," said he.  "Do you know them?"\r\n\r\n"Rather.  I was Horace\'s chum at Wilderham, you know, and used to spend\r\nmy holidays regularly at Garden Vale.  Is she very ill?"\r\n\r\n"Very," said Booms; "and the worst of it is, Reginald is not at home."\r\n\r\n"Where is he.  Horrors told me he had gone to the country."\r\n\r\nBooms _would_ tell him.  For the visitor called his friend Horrors, a\r\npet name none but his own family were ever known to use.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t know where he is.  But I do," said Booms, with a tragic\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n"Where? where?  What\'s wrong, I say?  Tell me, there\'s a good fellow."\r\n\r\n"He\'s in prison," said Booms, throwing himself back in his chair, and\r\npanting with the effort the disclosure had cost him.\r\n\r\n"In prison! and Horace doesn\'t know it!  What _do_ you mean?  Tell me\r\nall you know."\r\n\r\nBooms did tell him, and very little it was.  All he knew was from\r\nJemima\'s secondhand report, and the magnitude of the news had quite\r\nprevented him from inquiring as to particulars.\r\n\r\n"When did you hear this?" said Harker; for the reader will have guessed\r\nby this time that the visitor was no other than Horace\'s old Wilderham\r\nally.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday."\r\n\r\n"And he doesn\'t know yet?"\r\n\r\n"How could I tell him?  Of course I\'m to get all the blame.  I expected\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s blaming you?" said Harker, whom the news had suddenly brought on\r\nterms of familiarity with his friend\'s friend.  "When will he be here?"\r\n\r\n"Very soon, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"And then you\'ll tell him?"\r\n\r\n"You will, please," said Booms, quite eagerly for him.\r\n\r\n"Somebody must, poor fellow!" said Harker.  "We don\'t know what we may\r\nbe losing by the delay."\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s my fault for not waking him up in the middle of the\r\nnight and telling him," said Booms dismally.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything about it in the papers?" said Harker, taking up a\r\n_Times_.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen nothing."\r\n\r\n"You say it was a day or two ago.  Have you got the _Times_ for the last\r\nfew days?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it\'s there."\r\n\r\nHarker hastily turned over the file, and eagerly searched the police and\r\ncountry intelligence.  In a minute or two he looked up and said,--\r\n\r\n"Had Cruden senior changed his name?"\r\n\r\n"How _do_ I know?" said Booms, with a bewildered look.\r\n\r\n"I mean, had he dropped his surname?  Look here."\r\n\r\nAnd he showed Booms the paragraph which appeared in the London papers\r\nthe morning after Reginald\'s arrest.\r\n\r\n"That looks very much as if it was meant for Cruden," said Harker--"all\r\nexcept the name.  If it is, that was Tuesday he was remanded, and to-day\r\nis the day he is to be brought up again.  Oh, why didn\'t we know this\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I knew I was to blame.  I knew it all along," said Booms, taking\r\nevery expression of regret as a personal castigation.\r\n\r\n"It will be all over before any one can do a thing," said Harker,\r\ngetting up and pacing the room in his agitation.  "Why _doesn\'t_ Horace\r\ncome?"\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to the appeal, Horace at that moment opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Why, Harker, old man!" he exclaimed with delight in his face and voice\r\nas he sprang towards his friend.\r\n\r\n"Horrors, my poor dear boy," said Harker, "don\'t be glad to see me.\r\nI\'ve bad news, and there\'s no time to break it gently.  It\'s about\r\nReginald.  He\'s in trouble--in prison.  I\'ll come with you to Liverpool\r\nthis morning; there is a train in twenty minutes."\r\n\r\nHorace said nothing.  He turned deadly pale and gazed for a moment half\r\nscared, half appealing, at his friend.  Booms remembered something he\r\nhad to do in another room, and went to the door.\r\n\r\n"Do you mind getting a hansom?" said Harker.\r\n\r\nThe words roused Horace from his stupor.\r\n\r\n"Mother," he gasped, "she\'s ill."\r\n\r\n"We shall be home again to-night most likely," said Harker.\r\n\r\n"I must tell Granville," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"Your chief.  Well, be quick, the cab will be here directly."\r\n\r\nHorace went to the inner room and in a minute returned, his face still\r\nwhite but with a burning spot on either cheek.\r\n\r\n"All right?" inquired Harker.\r\n\r\nHorace nodded, and followed him to the door.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour they were at Euston in the booking office.\r\n\r\n"I have no money," said Horace.\r\n\r\n"I have, plenty for us both.  Go and get some papers, especially\r\nLiverpool ones, at the book-stall while I get the tickets."\r\n\r\nIt was a long memorable journey.  The papers were soon exhausted.  They\r\ncontained little or no additional news respecting the obscure suspect in\r\nLiverpool, and beyond that they had no interest for either traveller.\r\n\r\n"We shall get down at three," said Harker; "there\'s a chance of being in\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"In time for what? what can we do?"\r\n\r\n"Try and get another remand, if only for a couple of days.  I can\'t\r\nbelieve it of Reg.  There must be some mistake."\r\n\r\n"Of course there must," said Horace, with a touch of scorn in his voice,\r\n"but how are we to prove it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use trying just now.  All we can do is to get a remand."\r\n\r\nThe train seemed to drag forward with cruel slowness, and the precious\r\nmoments sped by with no less cruel haste.  It was five minutes past\r\nthree when they found themselves on the platform of Liverpool station.\r\n\r\n"It\'s touch and go if we\'re in time, old boy," said Harker, as they took\r\ntheir seats in a hansom and ordered the man to drive hard for the\r\npolice-court; "but you mustn\'t give up hope even if we\'re late.  We\'ll\r\npull poor old Reg through somehow."\r\n\r\nHis cheery words and the brotherly grip on his arm were like life and\r\nhope to Horace.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," he replied.  "What would I have done if you hadn\'t turned up\r\nlike an angel of help, Harker, old man?"\r\n\r\nAs they neared the police-court the cabman pulled up to allow a police\r\nvan to turn in the road.  The two friends shuddered.  It was like an\r\nevil omen to daunt them.\r\n\r\nWas _he_ in that van--so near them, yet so hopelessly beyond their\r\nreach?\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake drive on!" shouted Harker to the cabman.\r\n\r\nIt seemed ages before the lumbering obstruction had completed its\r\nrevolution and drawn to one side sufficiently to allow them to pass.\r\n\r\nIn another minute the cab dashed to the door of the court.\r\n\r\nIt was open, and the knot of idlers on the pavement showed them that\r\nsome case of interest was at that moment going on.\r\n\r\nThey made their way to the policeman who stood on duty.\r\n\r\n"Court\'s full--stand back, please.  Can\'t go in," said that official.\r\n\r\n"What case is it?"\r\n\r\n"Stand back, please--can\'t go in," repeated the stolid functionary.\r\n\r\n"Please tell us--"\r\n\r\n"Stand back there!" once more shouted the sentinel, growing rather more\r\nperemptory.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly no use mincing matters.  At this very moment Reginald\r\nmight be standing defenceless within, with his last chance of liberty\r\nslipping from under his feet.\r\n\r\nHarker drew a shilling from his pocket and slipped it into the hand of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n"Tell us the name of the case, there\'s a good fellow," said he\r\ncoaxingly.\r\n\r\n"Bilcher--wife murder.  Stand back, please--court\'s full."\r\n\r\nBilcher!  Wife murder!  It was for this the crowd had gathered, it was\r\nfor the result of this that that knot of idlers were waiting so\r\npatiently outside.\r\n\r\nBilcher was the hero of this day\'s gathering.  Who was likely to care a\r\nrush about such a lesser light as a secretary charged with a commonplace\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\n"Has the case of Cruden come on yet?" asked Horace anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe policeman answered him with a vacant stare.\r\n\r\n"No," said Harker, "the name would be Reginald, you know.  I say," added\r\nhe to the policeman, "when does Reginald\'s case come on?"\r\n\r\n"Stand back there--Reginald--he was the last but one before this--don\'t\r\ncrowd, please."\r\n\r\n"We\'re too late, then.  What was--what did he get?"\r\n\r\nNow the policeman considered he had answered quite enough for his\r\nshilling.  If he went on, people would think he was an easy fish to\r\ncatch.  So he affected deafness, and looking straight past his eager\r\nquestioners again repeated his stentorian request to the public\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n"Oh, pray tell us what he got," said Harker, in tones of genuine\r\nentreaty; "this is his brother, and we\'ve only just heard of it."\r\n\r\nThe policeman for a moment turned a curious eye on Horace, as if to\r\nconvince himself of the truth of the story.  Then, apparently satisfied,\r\nand weary of the whole business, he said,--\r\n\r\n"Let off.  _Will you_ keep back, please?  Stand back.  Court\'s full."\r\n\r\nLet off.  Horace\'s heart gave a bound of triumph as he heard the words.\r\nOf course he was!  Who could even suspect him of such a thing as fraud?\r\nUnjustly accused he might be, but Reg\'s character was proof against that\r\nany day.\r\n\r\nHarker shared his friend\'s feelings of relief and thankfulness at the\r\ngood news, but his face was still not without anxiety.\r\n\r\n"We had better try to find him," said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course.  He\'ll probably be back at Shy Street."\r\n\r\nBut no one was at Shy Street.  The dingy office was deserted and locked,\r\nand a little street urchin on the doorstep glowered at them as they\r\npeered up the staircase and read the name on the plate.\r\n\r\n"Had we better ask in the shop? they may know," said Horace.\r\n\r\nBut the chemist looked black when Reginald\'s name was mentioned, and\r\nhoped he should never see him again.  He\'d got into trouble and loss\r\nenough with him as it was--a hypocritical young--\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Horace, "you\'re speaking of my brother, and you\'d\r\nbetter be careful.  He\'s no more a hypocrite than you.  He\'s an honest\r\nman, and he\'s been acquitted of the charge brought against him."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you were his brother," said the chemist, rather\r\nsheepishly, "but for all that I don\'t want to see him again, and I don\'t\r\nexpect I shall either.  He won\'t come near here in a hurry, unless I\'m\r\nmistaken."\r\n\r\n"The fellow\'s right, I\'m afraid," said Harker, as they left the shop.\r\n"He\'s had enough of this place, from what you tell me.  It strikes me\r\nthe best thing is to go and inquire at the police-station.  They may\r\nknow something there."\r\n\r\nTo the police-station accordingly they went, and chanced to light on one\r\nno less important than Mr Sniff himself.\r\n\r\n"We are interested in Reginald Cruden, who was before the magistrate to-\r\nday," said Harker.  "In fact, this is his brother, and I am an old\r\nschoolfellow.  We hear the charge against him was dismissed, and we\r\nshould be much obliged if you could tell us where to find him."\r\n\r\nMr Sniff regarded the two boys with interest, and not without a slight\r\ntrace of uneasiness.  He had never really suspected Reginald, but it had\r\nappeared necessary to arrest him on suspicion, not only to satisfy the\r\nvictims of the Corporation, but on the off chance of his knowing rather\r\nmore than he seemed to know about the doings of that virtuous\r\nassociation.  It had been a relief to Mr Sniff to find his first\r\nimpressions as to the lad\'s innocence confirmed, and to be able to\r\nwithdraw the charge against him.  But the manner in which the magistrate\r\nhad dismissed the case had roused even his phlegmatic mind to\r\nindignation, and had set his conscience troubling him a little as to his\r\nown conduct of the affair.  This was why he now felt and looked not\r\nquite happy in the presence of Reginald\'s brother and friend.\r\n\r\n"Afraid I can\'t tell you," said he.  "He left the court as soon as the\r\ncase was over, and of course we\'ve no more to do with him."\r\n\r\n"He is not back at his old office," said Horace, "and I don\'t know of\r\nany other place in Liverpool he would be likely to go to."\r\n\r\n"It struck me, from the looks of him," said Mr Sniff, quite despising\r\nhimself for being so unprofessionally communicative--"it struck me he\r\ndidn\'t very much care where he went.  Very down in the mouth he was."\r\n\r\n"Why, but he was acquitted; his character was cleared.  Whatever should\r\nhe be down in the mouth about?" said Horace.\r\n\r\nMr Sniff smiled pityingly.\r\n\r\n"He was let off with a caution," he said; "that\'s rather a different\r\nthing from having your character cleared, especially when our friend\r\nFogey\'s on the bench.  I was sorry for the lad, so I was."\r\n\r\nThis was a great deal to come from the lips of a cast-iron individual\r\nlike Mr Sniff, and it explained the state of the case forcibly enough\r\nto his two hearers.  Horace knew his brother\'s nature well enough to\r\nimagine the effect upon him of such a reprimand, and his spirits sank\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\n"Who can tell us now where we are to look for him?" said he to Harker.\r\n"Anything like injustice drives him desperate.  He may have gone off, as\r\nthe detective says, not caring where.  And then Liverpool is a fearfully\r\nbig place."\r\n\r\n"We won\'t give it up till we have found him," said Harker; "and if you\r\ncan\'t stay, old man, I will."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t go," said Horace, with a groan.  "Poor Reg!"\r\n\r\n"Well, let us call round at the post-office and see if Waterford has\r\nremembered to telegraph about your mother."\r\n\r\nThey went to the post-office and found a telegram from Miss Crisp: "Good\r\nday.  Better, decidedly.  Knows you are in Liverpool, but nothing more.\r\nAny news?  Do not telegraph unless all right."\r\n\r\n"It\'s pretty evident," said Horace, handing the message to his friend,\r\n"we can\'t telegraph to-day.  I\'ll write to Waterford and get him to tell\r\nthe others.  But what is the next thing to be done?"\r\n\r\n"We can only be patient," said Harker.  "We are bound to come across him\r\nor hear of him in time."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not likely to have gone home?" suggested Horace.\r\n\r\n"How could he with no money?"\r\n\r\n"Or to try to get on an American ship?  We might try that."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, we shall have to try all that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s begin at once," said Horace impatiently, "every minute may\r\nbe of consequence."\r\n\r\nBut for a week they sought in vain--among the busy streets by day and in\r\nthe empty courts by night, among the shipping, in the railway-stations,\r\nin the workhouses, at the printing-offices.\r\n\r\nMr Sniff did them more than one friendly turn, and armed them with the\r\ntalisman of his name to get them admittance where no other key would\r\npass them.  They inquired at public-houses, coffee-houses, lodging-\r\nhouses, but all in vain.  No one had seen a youth answering their\r\ndescription, or if they had it was only for a moment, and he had passed\r\nfrom their sight and memory.\r\n\r\nFalse scents there were in plenty--some which seemed to lead up\r\nhopefully to the very last, and then end in nothing, others too vague\r\neven to attempt to follow.\r\n\r\nOnce they heard that the body of a youth had been found floating in the\r\nMersey--and with terrible forebodings they rushed to the place and\r\ndemanded to see it.  But he was not there.  The dead upturned face they\r\nlooked on was not his, and they turned away, feeling more than ever\r\ndiscouraged in their quest.\r\n\r\nAt length at the end of a week a man who kept an early coffee-stall in\r\none of the main streets told them that a week ago a ragged little urchin\r\nhad come to him with a pitiful tale about a gentleman who was starving,\r\nand had begged for a can of coffee and a slice of bread to take to him,\r\noffering in proof of his good faith his own coat as payment.  It was a\r\nbitterly cold morning, and the man trusted him.  He had never seen the\r\ngentleman, but the boy brought back the empty can in a few minutes.  The\r\ncoffee man had kept the jacket, as it was about the size of a little\r\nchap of his own.  But he had noticed the boy before parting with it take\r\ntwo ragged little books out of its pockets and transfer them to the\r\nbosom of his shirt.  That was all he remembered, and the gentleman might\r\ntake it for what it was worth.\r\n\r\nIt was worth something, for it pointed to the possibility of Reginald\r\nnot being alone in his wanderings.  And putting one thing and another\r\ntogether they somehow connected this little urchin with the boy they saw\r\ncrouching on the doorstep of Number 13, Shy Street the day of their\r\narrival, and with the office-boy whom Mr Sniff described as having been\r\nReginald\'s companion during his last days at the office.\r\n\r\nThey would neither of them believe Reginald was not still in Liverpool,\r\nand cheered by the very feeble light of this discovery they resumed\r\ntheir search with unabated vigour and even greater thoroughness.\r\n\r\nHappily the news from home continued favourable, and, equally important,\r\nthe officials at the _Rocket_ made no demur to Horace\'s prolonged stay.\r\nAs for Harker, his hopefulness and pocket-money vied with one another in\r\nsustaining the seekers and keeping alive within them the certainty of a\r\nreward, sooner or later, for their patience.\r\n\r\nTen days had passed, and no fresh clue.  Once or twice they had heard of\r\nthe pale young gentleman and the little boy, but always vaguely, as a\r\nfleeting vision which had been seen about a fortnight ago.\r\n\r\nOn this day they called in while passing to see Mr Sniff, and were met\r\nby that gentleman with a smile which told them he had some news of\r\nconsequence to impart.\r\n\r\n"I heard to-day," said he, "that a patient--a young man--was removed\r\nvery ill from a low lodging-house near the river--to the smallpox\r\nhospital yesterday.  His name is supposed to be Cruden (a common name in\r\nthis country), but he was too ill to give any account of himself.  It\r\nmay be worth your while following it up."\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour they were at the hospital, and Horace was\r\nkneeling at the bedside of his long-lost brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nLOVE FIGHTS HIS WAY INTO THE BEAUTIFUL PALACE.\r\n\r\nReginald recollected little of what happened on that terrible night when\r\nhe found himself suddenly face to face with his dead enemy.\r\n\r\nHe had a vague impression of calling the landlady and of seeing the body\r\ncarried from the pestiferous room.  But whether he helped to carry it\r\nhimself or not he could not remember.\r\n\r\nWhen he next was conscious of anything the sun was struggling through\r\nthe rafters over his head, as he lay in the bed beside Love, who slept\r\nstill, heavily but uneasily.\r\n\r\nThe other lodgers had all risen and left the place; and when with a\r\nshudder he glanced towards the corner where the sick man last night had\r\ndied, that bed was empty too.\r\n\r\nHe rose silently, without disturbing his companion, and made his way\r\nunsteadily down the ladder in search of the woman.\r\n\r\nShe met him with a scowl.  She had found two five-pound notes in the\r\ndead man\'s pocket, and consequently wanted to hear no more about him.\r\n\r\n"Took to the mortuary, of course," said she, in answer to Reginald\'s\r\nquestion.  "Where else do you expect?"\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me his name, or anything about him?  I knew him once."\r\n\r\nShe looked blacker than ever at this.  It seemed to her guilty\r\nconscience like a covert claim to the dead man\'s belongings, and she\r\nbridled up accordingly.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about him--no more than I know about you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know his name?" said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"No.  Do I know _your_ name?  No!  And I don\'t want to!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be angry," he said.  "No one means any harm to you.  How long has\r\nhe been here?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  A week.  And he was bad when he came.  He never caught\r\nit here."\r\n\r\n"Did any doctor see him?"\r\n\r\n"Doctor! no," snarled the woman.  "Isn\'t it bad enough to have a man\r\nbring smallpox into a place without calling in doctors, to give the\r\nplace a bad name and take a body\'s living from them?  I suppose you\'ll\r\ngo and give me a character now.  I wish I\'d never took you in.  I hated\r\nthe sight of you from the first."\r\n\r\nShe spoke so bitterly, and at the same time so anxiously, that Reginald\r\nfelt half sorry for her.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do you no harm," said he, gently.  "Goodness knows I\'ve done harm\r\nenough in my time."\r\n\r\nThe last words, though muttered to himself, did not escape the quick ear\r\nof the woman, and they pleased her.  She was used to strange characters\r\nin her place, seeking a night\'s shelter before escaping to America, or\r\nwhile hiding from justice.  It was neither her habit nor her business to\r\nanswer questions.  All she asked was to be let alone and paid for her\r\nlodgings.  She knew Reginald had her in a sense at his mercy, for he\r\nknew the disease the man had died of, and a word from him out of doors\r\nwould bring her own pestiferous house about her ears and ruin her.\r\n\r\nBut when he muttered those words to himself she concluded he was a\r\ncriminal of some sort in hiding, and criminals in hiding, as she knew,\r\nwere not the people to go and report the sanitary arrangements of their\r\nlodgings to the police.\r\n\r\nSo she mollified towards him somewhat, and told him she would look after\r\nher affairs if he looked after his, and as he had not had a good night\r\nlast night, well, if no one else wanted the bed to-night he could have\r\nit at half-price; and after that she hoped she would have done with him.\r\n\r\nReginald returned to the foul garret, and found Love still asleep, but\r\ntossing restlessly, and muttering to himself the while.\r\n\r\nHe sat down beside him and waited till he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\nAt first the boy looked round in a bewildered way as though he were\r\nhardly yet awake, but presently his eyes fell on Reginald and his face\r\nlit up.\r\n\r\n"Gov\'nor," he said, with a smile, sitting up.\r\n\r\n"Well, old boy," said Reginald, "what a long sleep you\'ve had.  Are you\r\nrested?"\r\n\r\n"I \'ave \'ad sich dreams, gov\'nor, and--my, ain\'t it cold!"  And he\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\nThe room was stifling.  Scarcely a breath of fresh air penetrated\r\nthrough its battered roof, still less through the tiny unopened window\r\nat the other end.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get some breakfast to make you warm," said Reginald.  "This\r\nhorrible place is enough to make any one feel sick."\r\n\r\nThe boy got slowly out of bed.\r\n\r\n"We \'ave got to earn some browns," he said, "afore we can get any\r\nbreakfast."\r\n\r\nHe shivered still, and sat down on the edge of the bed for a moment.\r\nThen he gathered himself together with an effort and walked to the\r\nladder.  Reginald\'s heart sank within him.  The boy was not well.  His\r\nface was flushed, his walk was uncertain, and his teeth chattered\r\nincessantly.  It might be only the foul atmosphere of the room, or it\r\nmight be something worse.  And as he thought of it he too shivered, but\r\nnot on account of the cold.\r\n\r\nThey descended the ladder, and for a little while the boy seemed revived\r\nby the fresh morning air.  Reginald insisted on his taking their one\r\ncoat, and the boy seemed to lack the energy to contest the matter.  For\r\nan hour they wandered about the wharves, till at last Love stopped short\r\nand said,--\r\n\r\n"Gov\'nor, I don\'t want no breakfast.  I\'ll just go back and--"\r\n\r\nThe sentence ended in a whimper, and but for Reginald\'s arm round him he\r\nwould have fallen.\r\n\r\nReginald knew now that his worst fears were realised.  Love was ill, and\r\nit was only too easy to surmise what his illness was, especially when he\r\ncalled to mind the boy\'s statement that he had been taking shelter in\r\nthe infected lodging-house ten days ago, during his temporary exile from\r\nShy Street.\r\n\r\nHe helped him back tenderly to the place--for other shelter they had\r\nnone--and laid him in his bed.  The boy protested that he was only\r\ntired, that his back and legs ached, and would soon be well.  Reginald,\r\ninexperienced as he was, knew better, or rather worse.\r\n\r\nHe had a battle royal, as he expected, with the landlady on the subject\r\nof his little patient.  At first she would listen to nothing, and\r\nthreatened to turn both out by force.  But Reginald, with an eloquence\r\nwhich only extremities can inspire, reasoned with her, coaxed her,\r\nflattered her, bribed her with promises, and finally got far enough on\r\nthe right side of her to obtain leave for the boy to occupy Durfy\'s bed\r\nuntil some other lodger should want it.  But she must have a shilling\r\ndown, or off they must go.\r\n\r\nIt was a desperate alternative,--to quit his little charge in his\r\ndistress, or to see him turned out to die in the street.  Reginald,\r\nhowever, had little difficulty in making his choice.\r\n\r\n"Are you comfortable?" said he to the boy, leaning over him and soothing\r\nthe coarse pillow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, gov\'nor--all right--that there ache will be gone soon, and see if\r\nI don\'t pick up some browns afore evening."\r\n\r\n"Do you think you can get on if I leave you a bit?  I think I know where\r\nI can earn a little, and I\'ll be back before night, never fear."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'ll find me up and about when you comes," said the boy;\r\n"mayhap the old gal would give me a job sweeping or somethink."\r\n\r\n"You must not think of it," said Reginald, almost sternly.  "Mind, I\r\ntrust you to be quiet till I come.  How I wish I had some food!"\r\n\r\nWith heavy heart he departed, appealing to the woman, for pity\'s sake,\r\nnot to let harm come to the boy in his absence.\r\n\r\nWhere should he go? what should he do?  Half a crown would make him feel\r\nthe richest man in Liverpool, and yet how hard, how cruelly hard, it is\r\nto find a half-crown when you most want it!\r\n\r\nHe forgot all his pride, all his sensitiveness, all his own weariness--\r\neverything but the sick boy, and left no stone unturned to procure even\r\na copper.  He even begged, when nothing else succeeded.\r\n\r\nNobody seemed to want anything done.  There were scores of hungry\r\napplicants at the riverside and dozens outside the printing-office.\r\nThere were no horses that wanted holding, no boxes or bags that wanted\r\ncarrying, no messages or errands that wanted running.  No shop or\r\nfactory window that he saw had a notice of "Boys Wanted" posted in it;\r\nno junior clerk was advertised for in any paper he caught sight of; not\r\neven a scavenger boy was wanted to clean the road.\r\n\r\nAt last he was giving it up in despair, and coming to the conclusion he\r\nmight just as well hasten back to his little charge and share his fate\r\nwith him, when he caught sight of a stout elderly lady standing in a\r\nstate of flurry and trepidation on the kerb of one of the most crowded\r\ncrossings in the city.\r\n\r\nWith the instinct of desperation he rushed towards her, and, lifting his\r\nhat, said,--\r\n\r\n"Can I help you across, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nThe lady started to hear words so polite and in so well-bred a tone,\r\ncoming from a boy of Reginald\'s poor appearance, for he was still\r\nwithout his coat.\r\n\r\nBut she jumped at his offer, and allowed him to pilot her and her\r\nparcels over the dangerous crossing.\r\n\r\n"It may be worth twopence to me," said Reginald to himself as he landed\r\nher safe on the other side.\r\n\r\nHow circumstances change us!  At another time Reginald would have\r\nflushed crimson at the bare idea of being paid for an act of politeness.\r\nNow his heart beat high with hope as he saw the lady\'s hand feel for\r\nher pocket.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a very civil young man," said she, "and--dear me, how ill you\r\nlook."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not ill," said Reginald, with a boldness he himself marvelled at,\r\n"but a little boy I love is--very ill--and I have no money to get him\r\neither food or lodging.  I know you\'ll think I\'m an impostor, ma\'am, but\r\ncould you, for pity\'s sake, give me a shilling?  I couldn\'t pay you\r\nback, but I\'d bless you always."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!" said the lady, "it\'s very sad--just at Christmas-time,\r\ntoo.  Poor little fellow!  Here\'s something for him.  I think you look\r\nhonest, young man; I hope you are, and trust in God."\r\n\r\nAnd to Reginald\'s unbounded delight she slipped two half-crowns into his\r\nhand and walked away.\r\n\r\nHe could only say, "God bless you for it."  It seemed like an angel\'s\r\ngift in his hour of direst need, and with a heart full of comfort he\r\nhastened back to the lodgings, calling on his way at a cookshop and\r\nspending sixpence of his treasure on some bread and meat for his\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nHe was horror-struck to notice the change even a few hours had wrought\r\non the sufferer.  There was no mistaking his ailment now.  Though not\r\ndelirious, he was in a high state of fever, and apparently of pain, for\r\nhe tossed incessantly and moaned to himself.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Reginald revived him.\r\n\r\n"I knowed you was comin\'," said he; "but I don\'t want nothing to eat,\r\ngov\'nor.  On\'y some water; I do want some water."\r\n\r\nReginald flew to get it, and the boy swallowed it with avidity.  Then,\r\nsomewhat revived, he lay back and said, "I \'ave got \'em, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m afraid it\'s smallpox," said Reginald; "but you\'ll soon be\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I will, maybe I won\'t.  Say, gov\'nor, you don\'t ought to stop\r\nhere; you\'ll be cotchin\' \'em too!"\r\n\r\n"No fear of that," said Reginald, "I\'ve been vaccinated.  Besides, who\'d\r\nlook after you?"\r\n\r\n"My! you\'re a good \'un to me!" said the boy.  "Think of that there\r\nMedlock--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let\'s think of anything so unpleasant," said Reginald, seeing\r\nthat even this short talk had excited his patient unduly.  "Let me see\r\nif I can make the bed more comfortable, and then, if you like, I can\r\nread to you.  How would you like that?"\r\n\r\nThe boy beamed his gratitude, and Reginald, after doing his best to\r\nsmooth the wretched bed and make him comfortable, produced the\r\n_Pilgrim\'s Progress_ and settled down to read.\r\n\r\n"That there _Robinson_ ain\'t a bad \'un," said Love, before the reading\r\nbegan; "I read \'im while I was a-waitin\' for you.  But \'e ain\'t so good\r\nas the Christian.  Read about that there pallis ag\'in, gov\'nor."\r\n\r\nAnd Reginald read it--more than once.\r\n\r\nThe evening closed in, the room grew dark, and he shut the book.  The\r\nboy was already asleep, tossing and moaning to himself, sometimes\r\nseeming to wake for a moment, but dropping off again before he could\r\ntell what he wanted or what was wrong with him.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Reginald moistened his parched mouth with water, but as\r\nthe evening wore on the boy became so much worse that he felt, at all\r\nhazards, he must seek help.\r\n\r\n"I _must_ bring a doctor to see him," said he to the landlady; "he\'s so\r\nill."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll bring no doctor--unless you want to see the boy chucked out in\r\nthe road!" said she.  "The idea! just when my lodgers will be coming\r\nhome to bed too!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s only eight o\'clock; no one will come till ten.  There\'ll be plenty\r\nof time."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?  You know as well as I do the child won\'t last above a\r\nday or two in his state.  What\'s the use of making a disturbance for\r\nnothing?" said the woman.\r\n\r\n"He won\'t die--he shall not die!" said Reginald, feeling in his heart\r\nhow foolish the words were.  "At any rate, I must fetch a doctor.  I\r\nmight have fetched one without saying a word to you, but I promised I\r\nwouldn\'t, and now I want you to let me off the promise."\r\n\r\nThe woman fretted and fumed, and wished ill to the day when she had ever\r\nseen either Reginald or Love.  He bore her vituperation patiently, as it\r\nwas his only chance of getting his way.\r\n\r\nPresently she said, "If you\'re bent on it, go to Mr Pilch, round the\r\ncorner; he\'s the only doctor I\'ll let come in my house.  You can have\r\nhim or nobody, that\'s flat!"\r\n\r\nIn two minutes Reginald was battering wildly at Mr Pilch\'s door.  That\r\ngentleman--a small dealer in herbs, who eked out his livelihood by\r\noccasional unauthorised medical practice--happened to be in, and\r\noffered, for two shillings, to come and see the sick boy.  Reginald\r\ntossed down the coin with eager thankfulness, and almost dragged him to\r\nthe bedside of his little charge.\r\n\r\nMr Pilch may have known very little of medicine, but he knew enough to\r\nmake him shake his head as he saw the boy.\r\n\r\n"Regular bad case that.  Smallpox and half a dozen things on the top of\r\nit.  I can\'t do anything."\r\n\r\n"Can you give me no medicine for him, or tell me what food he ought to\r\ntake or what?  Surely there\'s a _chance_ of his getting better?"\r\n\r\nMr Pilch laughed quietly.\r\n\r\n"About as much chance of his pulling through that as of jumping over the\r\nmoon.  The kindest thing you can do is to let him die as soon as he can.\r\nHe may last a day or two.  If you want to feed him, give him anything\r\nhe will take, and that won\'t be much, you\'ll find.  It\'s a bad case,\r\nyoung fellow, and it won\'t do you any good to stop too near him.  No use\r\nmy coming again.  Good-night."\r\n\r\nAnd the brusque but not unkindly little quack trotted away, leaving\r\nReginald in the dark without a gleam of hope to comfort him.\r\n\r\n"Gov\'nor," said the weak little voice from the bed, "that there doctor\r\nsays I are a-goin\' to die, don\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"He says you\'re very ill, old boy, but let\'s hope you\'ll soon be\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Me--no fear.  On\'y I wish it would come soon.  I\'m afeared of gettin\'\r\nfrightened."\r\n\r\nAnd the voice trembled away into a little sob.\r\n\r\nThey lay there side by side that long restless night.  The other\r\nlodgers, rough degraded men and women, crowded into the room, but no one\r\nheeded the little bed in the dark corner, where the big boy lay with his\r\narm round the little uneasy sufferer.  There was little sleep either for\r\npatient or nurse.  Every few minutes the boy begged for water, which\r\nReginald held to his lips, and when after a time the thirst ceased and\r\nonly the pain remained, nothing soothed and tranquillised him so much as\r\nthe repetition time after time of his favourite stories from the\r\nwonderful book, which, happily, Reginald now knew almost by heart.\r\n\r\nSo the night passed.  Before daylight the lodgers one by one rose and\r\nleft the place, and when about half-past seven light struggled once more\r\nin between the rafters these two were alone.\r\n\r\nThe boy seemed a little revived, and sipped some milk which Reginald had\r\ndarted out to procure.\r\n\r\nBut the pain and the fever returned twofold as the day wore on, and even\r\nto Reginald\'s unpractised eye it was evident the boy\'s release was not\r\nfar distant.\r\n\r\n"Gov\'nor," said the boy once, with his mind apparently wandering back\r\nover old days, "what\'s the meaning of `Jesus Christ\'s sake, Amen,\' what\r\ncomes at the end of that there prayer you taught me at the office--is He\r\nthe same one that\'s in the _Pilgrim_ book?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, old boy; would you like to hear about Him?"\r\n\r\n"I would so," said the boy, eagerly.\r\n\r\nAnd that afternoon, as the shadows darkened and the fleeting ray of the\r\nsun crossed the floor of their room, Love lay and heard the old, old\r\nstory told in simple broken words.  He had heard of it before, but till\r\nnow he had never heeded it.  Yet it seemed to him more wonderful even\r\nthan _Robinson Crusoe_ or the _Pilgrim\'s Progress_.  Now and then he\r\nbroke in with some comment or criticism, or even one of his old familiar\r\ntirades against the enemies of his new hero.  The room grew darker, and\r\nstill Reginald went on.  When at last the light had all gone, the boy\'s\r\nhand stole outside the blanket and sought that of his protector, and\r\nheld it till the story came to an end.\r\n\r\nThen he seemed to drop into a fitful sleep, and Reginald, with the hand\r\nstill on his, sat motionless, listening to the hard breathing, and\r\nliving over in thought the days since Heaven in mercy joined his life to\r\nthat of his little friend.\r\n\r\nHow long he sat thus he knew not.  He heard the voices and tread of the\r\nother lodgers in the room; he heard the harsh groan of the bolt on the\r\nouter door downstairs; and he saw the candle die down in its socket.\r\nBut he never moved or let go the boy\'s hand.\r\n\r\nPresently--about one or two in the morning, he thought--the hard\r\nbreathing ceased, and a turn of the head on the pillow told him the\r\nsleeper was awake.\r\n\r\n"Gov\'nor, you there?" whispered the boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, old fellow."\r\n\r\n"It\'s dark; I\'m most afeared."\r\n\r\nReginald lay on the bed beside him, and put an arm round him.\r\n\r\nThe boy became more easy after this, and seemed to settle himself once\r\nmore to sleep.  But the breathing was shorter and more laboured, and the\r\nlittle brow that rested against the watcher\'s cheek grew cold and damp.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour more the feeble flame of life flickered on, every\r\nbreath seeming to Reginald as he lay there motionless, scarcely daring\r\nto breathe himself, like the last.\r\n\r\nThen the boy seemed suddenly to rouse himself and lifted his head.\r\n\r\n"Gov\'nor--that pallis!--I\'m gettin\' in--I hear them calling--come there\r\ntoo, gov\'nor!"\r\n\r\nAnd the head sank back on the pillow, and Reginald, as he turned his\r\nlips to the forehead, knew that the little valiant soul had fought his\r\nway into the beautiful palace at last, and was already hearing the music\r\nof those voices within as they welcomed him to his hero\'s reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME.\r\n\r\nIt is strange how often our fortunes and misfortunes, which we are so\r\napt to suppose depend on our own successes or failures, turn out to have\r\nfallen into hands we least expected, and to have been depending on\r\ntrains of circumstances utterly beyond our range of imagination.\r\n\r\nWho, for instance, would have guessed that a meeting of half a dozen\r\nbusiness men in a first-floor room of a New York office could have any\r\nbearing on the fate of the Cruden family?  Or that an accident to Major\r\nLambert\'s horse while clearing a fence at one of the --shire hunts\r\nshould also affect their prospects in life?\r\n\r\nBut so it was.\r\n\r\nWhile Reginald, tenderly nursed by his old school friend, was slowly\r\nrecovering from his illness in Liverpool, and while Mrs Cruden and\r\nHorace, in their shabby London lodging, were breaking into their last\r\nhundred pounds, and wondering how, even with the boy\'s improved wages\r\nand promise of literary success, they should be able to keep a\r\ncomfortable home for their scattered but shortly to be reunited family--\r\nat this very time a few of the leading creditors of the Wishwash and\r\nLongstop Railway assembled in the old office of that bankrupt\r\nundertaking, and decided to accept an offer from the Grand Roundabout\r\nRailway to buy up their undertaking at half-price, and add its few\r\nhundred miles of line to their own few thousand.\r\n\r\nA very important decision this for the little Dull Street family.  For\r\namong the English creditors of this same Wishwash and Longstop Railway\r\nMr Cruden had been one of the most considerable--so considerable that\r\nthe shares he held in it had amounted to about half his fortune.\r\n\r\nAnd when the division of the proceeds of the sale of the railway came to\r\nbe divided it turned out that Mr Cruden\'s administrators, heirs, and\r\nassigns were entitled to about a third of the value of that gentleman\'s\r\nshares, or in other words, something like a sixth of their old property,\r\nwhich little windfall, after a good deal of wandering about and search\r\nfor an owner, came finally under the notice of Mr Richmond\'s\r\nsuccessors, who in turn passed it over to Mrs Cruden with a very neat\r\nlittle note of congratulation on the good fortune which had made her and\r\nher sons the joint proprietors of a snug little income of from L300 to\r\nL400 a year.\r\n\r\nOf course the sagacious reader will remark on this that it is only\r\nnatural that towards the end of my story something of this sort should\r\nhappen, in order to finish up with the remark that "they lived happily\r\never after."  And his opinion of me will, I fear, be considerably\r\nlowered when he finds that instead of Reginald dying in the smallpox\r\nhospital, and Mrs Cruden and Horace ending their days in the workhouse,\r\nthings looked up a little for them towards the finish, and promised a\r\nrather more comfortable future than one had been led to expect.\r\n\r\nIt is sad, of course, to lose any one\'s good esteem, but as things\r\nreally did look up for the Crudens--as Reginald really did recover, as\r\nMrs Cruden and Horace really did not go to the workhouse, and as the\r\nGrand Roundabout Railway really was spirited enough to buy up the\r\nWishwash and Longstop Railway at half-price, I cannot help saying so,\r\nwhatever the consequences may be.\r\n\r\nBut several weeks before Mr Richmond\'s successors announced this\r\nwindfall to their clients, the accident to Major Lambert\'s horse had\r\nresulted in comfort to the Crudens of another kind, which, if truth must\r\nbe told, they expected quite as little and valued quite as much.\r\n\r\nThat worthy Nimrod, once an acquaintance and neighbour of the Garden\r\nVale family in the days of their prosperity, was never known to miss a\r\nwinter\'s hunting in his own county if he could possibly help it, and\r\nduring the present season had actually come all the way from Malta,\r\nwhere his regiment was stationed, on short leave, for the sake of two or\r\nthree days of his favourite sport in the old country.\r\n\r\nSuch enthusiasm was worthy of a happier fate than that which befell him.\r\nFor on his first ride out his horse came to grief, as we have said,\r\nover a hedge, and left the gallant major somewhat knocked about himself,\r\nwith nothing to do for half a day but to saunter disconsolately up and\r\ndown the country lanes and pay afternoon calls on some of his old\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nAmong others, he knocked at the door of an elderly dowager named Osborn,\r\nwho was very sympathetic with him in his misfortunes, and did her best\r\nto comfort him with afternoon tea and gossip.\r\n\r\nThe latter lasted a good deal longer than the former.  One after another\r\nthe major\'s old friends were mentioned and discussed and talked about as\r\nonly folk can be talked about over afternoon tea.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said the caller, "I hear poor Cruden didn\'t leave much\r\nbehind him after all.  Is Mrs Cruden still at Garden Vale?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said the lady; "it\'s a sad story altogether.  Mr Cruden\r\nleft nothing behind him, and Garden Vale had to be sold, and the family\r\nwent to London, so I was told, in very poor circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Bless me!" said the honest major, "haven\'t you looked them up?  Cruden\r\nwas a good sort of a fellow, you know."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve always intended to try and find out where they are living,\r\nbut really, major, you have no idea how one\'s time gets filled up."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a very good idea," said the major with a groan.  "I have to sail\r\nin a week, and there\'s not much spare time between now and then, I can\r\ntell you.  Still, I\'d like to call and pay my respects to Mrs Cruden if\r\nI knew where she lived."\r\n\r\n"I daresay you could find out.  But I was going to say that only\r\nyesterday I saw something in the paper which will hardly make Mrs\r\nCruden anxious to see any of her old friends at present.  The eldest\r\nson, I fear, has turned out badly."\r\n\r\n"Who? young--what was his name?--Reginald?  Can\'t believe it.  He always\r\nseemed one of the right sort.  A bit of a prig perhaps, but straight\r\nenough.  What has he been up to?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better see for yourself, major," said the lady, extracting a\r\nnewspaper from a heap under the dinner-waggon.  "He seems to have been\r\nmixed up in a rather discreditable affair, as far as I could make out,\r\nbut I didn\'t read the report through."\r\n\r\nThe major took the paper, and read a short report of the proceedings at\r\nthe Liverpool Police-Court.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t read it through, you say," observed he, when he had\r\nfinished; "you saw he was let off?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I\'m afraid--well, it\'s very sad for them all."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is," blurted out the soldier, "especially when none of\r\ntheir old friends seem to care anything about them.  Excuse me, Mrs\r\nOsborn," added he, seeing that the lady coloured.  "I wasn\'t meaning\r\nyou, but myself.  Cruden was on old comrade, who did me more than one\r\ngood turn.  I must certainly take a day in town on my way back and find\r\nthem out.  As for the boy, I don\'t believe he\'s got it in him to be a\r\nblackleg."\r\n\r\nThe major was as good as his word.  He sacrificed a day of his loved\r\npastime to look for his old friend\'s widow in London.\r\n\r\nAfter a good deal of hunting he discovered her address, and presented\r\nhimself, with not a little wonderment at the shabbiness of her quarters,\r\nat Dull Street.\r\n\r\nBarely convalescent, and still in the agony of suspense as to Reginald\'s\r\nfate, Mrs Cruden was able to see no one.  But the major was not thus to\r\nbe baulked of his friendly intentions.  Before he left the house he\r\nwrote a letter, which in due time lay in the widow\'s hands and brought\r\ntears to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Cruden,--I am on my way back to Malta, and sorry not to see\r\nyou.  We all have our troubles, but you seem to have had more than your\r\nshare; and what I should have liked would be to see whether there was\r\nanything an old friend of your husband could do to serve you.  I trust\r\nyou will not resent the liberty I take when I say I have instructed my\r\nagent, whose address is enclosed, to put himself at your disposal in any\r\nemergency when you may need either advice or any other sort of aid.  He\r\nis a good fellow, and understands any service you may require (and\r\nemergencies often do arise) is to be rendered on my account.  As to your\r\neldest son, about whom I read a paragraph in the papers the other day,\r\nnothing will make me believe he is anything but his honest father\'s\r\nhonest son.  My brother-in-law, whom you will remember, is likely\r\nshortly to have an opportunity of introducing a young fellow into an\r\nEast India house in the City.  I may mention this because, should you\r\nthink well to tell Reginald of it, I believe there would not be much\r\ndifficulty in his getting the post.  But you will hear about this from\r\nmy brother-in-law, whom I have asked to write to you.  I don\'t expect to\r\nget leave again, for eighteen months; but I hope then to find you all\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n"Believe me, dear Mrs Cruden,--\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"Thomas Lambert."\r\n\r\nThis simple warm-hearted letter came to Mrs Cruden as the first gleam\r\nof better things on the troubled waters of her life.  Things were just\r\nthen at their worst.  Reginald lost, Horace away in search of him,\r\nherself slowly recovering from a sad illness into a still more sad life,\r\nwith little prospect either of happiness or competency, nothing to look\r\nforward to but a renewal of the old struggles, possibly single-handed.\r\nAt such a time Major Lambert\'s letter came to revive her drooping\r\nspirits and remind her of a Providence that never sleeps less than when\r\nwe are ready to consider ourselves forgotten.\r\n\r\nAll she could do was to write a grateful reply back, and then await news\r\nfrom Horace, trusting meanwhile it would not be necessary to draw on the\r\nmajor\'s offered help.  A few days later Horace was home again, jubilant\r\nat having found his brother, but anxious both as to his immediate\r\nrecovery and the state of mind in which restored health would find him.\r\n\r\n"He told me lots about the past, mother," said he.  "No one can conceive\r\nwhat a terrible three months he has had since he left us, or how\r\nheroically he has borne it.  He doesn\'t think so himself, and is awfully\r\ndepressed about his trial and the way in which the magistrate spoke to\r\nhim--the brute!"\r\n\r\n"Poor boy! he is the very last to bear that sort of thing well."\r\n\r\n"He\'s got a sort of idea he\'s a branded man, and is to be dragged down\r\nall his life by it.  Perhaps when he hears that an old friend like Major\r\nLambert believes in him, he may pick up.  You know, mother, I believe\r\nhis heart is in the grave where that little office-boy of his lies, and\r\nthat he would have been thankful if--well, perhaps not so bad as that--\r\nbut just at present he can\'t speak or even think of the boy without\r\nbreaking down."\r\n\r\n"According to the letter from Major Lambert\'s brother-in-law, the post\r\nthat is offered him is one he will like, I think," said Mrs Cruden.  "I\r\ndo hope he will take it.  To have nothing to do would be the worst thing\r\nthat could happen to him."\r\n\r\n"To say nothing of the necessity of it for you, mother," said Horace;\r\n"for there\'s to be no more copying out manuscripts, mind, even if we all\r\ngo to the workhouse."\r\n\r\nMrs Cruden sighed.  She knew her son was right, but the wolf was at the\r\ndoor, and she shrank from becoming a useless burden on her boys\'\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n"I wonder, Horace," said she, presently, "whether we could possibly find\r\nless expensive quarters than these.  They are--"\r\n\r\n"Hullo, there\'s the postman!" said Horace, who had been looking from the\r\nwindow; "ten to one there\'s a line from Harker."\r\n\r\nAnd he flew down the stairs, just in time to see the servant-girl take a\r\nletter from the box and put it in her pocket.\r\n\r\n"None for us?" said he.\r\n\r\nThe girl, who till this moment was not aware of his presence, turned\r\nround and coloured very violently, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Show me the letter you put into your pocket just now," said Horace, who\r\nhad had experience before now in predicaments of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe girl made no reply, but tried to go back to the kitchen.  Horace,\r\nhowever, stopped her.\r\n\r\n"Be quick!" said he.  "You\'ve a letter for me in your pocket, and if I\r\ndon\'t have it before I count twenty I\'ll give you in charge;" and he\r\nproceeded to count.\r\n\r\nBefore he had reached ten the girl broke out into tears, and took from\r\nher pocket not only the letter in question, but three or four others.\r\n\r\n"There you are; that\'s all of them.  I\'ve done with it!" sobbed she.\r\n\r\nHorace glanced over them in bewilderment.  One was in Reginald\'s\r\nwriting, written three weeks ago; two were from himself to his mother,\r\nwritten last week, and the last was from Harker, written yesterday.\r\n\r\n"Why," exclaimed he, too much taken aback almost to find words, "what\r\ndoes it mean?  How do you come--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll tell you," said the girl; "I don\'t care what they do to me.\r\nI\'d sooner be sent to prison than go on at it.  He told me to do it, and\r\nthreatened me all sorts of things if I didn\'t.  Oh dear! oh dear!"\r\n\r\n"Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr Shuckleford.  He said Mr Reginald was a convict, or\r\nsomething, and if I didn\'t mind every letter that came to the house from\r\nLiverpool I\'d get sent to prison too for abetting him.  I\'m sure I don\'t\r\nwant to abet no one, and I can\'t help if they do lock me up."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say Mr Shuckleford told you to do this?" said--or rather\r\nroared--Horace.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he did; and he had them all before that one," said the girl,\r\npointing to the letter from Reginald.  "But he\'s never been for these,\r\nand I didn\'t dare not to keep them for him.  Please, sir, look over it\r\nthis time."\r\n\r\nHorace was too agitated to heed her tears or entreaties.  He rushed from\r\nthe house with the letters in his hand, and made straight for the\r\nShucklefords\' door.  But, with his hand on the bell, he hesitated.  Mrs\r\nShuckleford and her daughter had been good to his mother; he could not\r\nrelieve his mind to Samuel in their presence.  So he resolved to\r\npostpone that pleasure till he could find the young lawyer alone, and\r\nmeanwhile hurried back to his mother and rejoiced her heart with the\r\ngood news of Reginald contained in Harker\'s letter.\r\n\r\nHow and when Horace and Shuckleford settled accounts no one exactly\r\nknew, but one evening, about a week afterwards, the latter came home\r\nlooking very scared and uncomfortable, and announced that he was getting\r\ntired of London, the air of which did not agree with his constitution.\r\nHe intended to close with an offer he had received some time ago from a\r\nfirm in the country to act as their clerk; and although the sacrifice\r\nwas considerable, still the country air and change of scene he felt\r\nwould do him good.\r\n\r\nSo he went, much lamented by his mother and sister and club.  But of all\r\nhis acquaintances there was only one who knew the exact reason why, just\r\nat that particular time, the country air promised to be so beneficial\r\nfor his constitution.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThree weeks passed, and then one afternoon a cab rolled slowly up to the\r\ndoor of Number 6, Dull Street.  Horace was away at the office, and Mrs\r\nCruden herself was out taking a walk.\r\n\r\nSo the two young men who alighted from the cab found themselves monarchs\r\nof all they surveyed, and proceeded upstairs to the parlour with no one\r\nto ask what their business was.\r\n\r\n"Now, old man," said the sturdier of the two, "I won\'t stay.  I\'ve\r\nbrought you safe home, and you needn\'t pretend you\'ll be sorry to see my\r\nback."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t pretend," said the other, with a smile on his pale face, "but\r\nif you\'re not back very soon, in an hour or two, I shall be very very\r\nsorry."\r\n\r\n"Never fear, I\'ll be back."\r\n\r\nAnd he went.\r\n\r\nThe pale youth sat down, and looked with a strange mixture of sadness\r\nand eagerness round the little room.  He had seen it before, and yet he\r\nseemed hardly to recognise it.  He got up and glanced at a few envelopes\r\nlying on the mantel-piece.  He took into his hands a piece of knitting\r\nthat lay on one of the chairs and examined it.  He turned over the\r\nleaves of a stray book, and read the name on the title-page.  It all\r\nseemed so strange--yet so familiar.  Then he crept silently to the half-\r\nopen door of a little bedroom and peeped in, and his heart beat\r\nstrangely as he recognised a photograph on the dressing-table, and by\r\nits side a letter written in his own handwriting.  From this room he\r\nturned to another still smaller and more roughly furnished.  A walking-\r\nstick stood in the corner that he knew well, and there was a cap on the\r\npeg behind the door, the sight of which sent a thrill through him.\r\n\r\nYet he felt he dared touch nothing--that he scarcely dare let his foot\r\nbe heard as he paced across the room, or venture even to stir the little\r\nfire that was dying out in the grate.\r\n\r\nThe slight flush which the excitement of his first arrival had called up\r\nfaded from his cheeks as the minutes wore on.\r\n\r\nPresently his ears caught a light footfall on the pavement outside, and\r\nhis heart almost stood still as it halted and the bell rang below.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those occasions when a man may live a lifetime in a\r\nminute.  With a mighty rush his thoughts flew back to the last time he\r\nhad heard that step.  What goodness, what hope, what love did it not\r\nbring back to his life!  He had taken it all for granted, and thought so\r\nlittle of it; but now, after months of loveless, cheerless drudgery and\r\ndisappointment, that light step fell with a music which flooded his\r\nwhole soul.\r\n\r\nHe sat almost spell-bound as the street-door closed and the steps\r\nascended the stairs.  The room seemed to swim round him, and to his\r\nbroken nerves it seemed for a moment as though he dreaded rather than\r\nlonged for what was coming.  But as the door opened the spell broke and\r\nall the mists vanished; he was his own self once more--nothing but the\r\nlong-lost boy springing to the arms of the long-lost mother.\r\n\r\n"Mother!"\r\n\r\n"My boy!"\r\n\r\nThat was all they said.  And in those few words Reginald Cruden\'s life\r\nentered on a new era.\r\n\r\nWhen Horace half an hour later came flying on to the scene they still\r\nsat there hand in hand, trying to realise it all, but not succeeding.\r\nHorace, however, helped them back to speech, and far into the night they\r\ntalked.  About ten o\'clock Harker looked in for a moment, and after them\r\nyoung Gedge, unable to wait till the morning.  But they stayed only a\r\nmoment, and scarcely interrupted the little family reunion.\r\n\r\nWhat those three talked about it would be hard for me to say.  What they\r\ndid not talk about in the past, the present, and the future would be\r\nalmost easier to set down.  And when at last Mrs Cruden rose, and in\r\nher old familiar tones said,--\r\n\r\n"It\'s time to go to bed, boys," the boys obeyed, as in the days long\r\nago, and came up to her and kissed her, and then went off like children,\r\nand slept, like those who never knew what care was, all the happy night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTURNING OVER LEAVES, NEW AND OLD.\r\n\r\nA very few words more, reader, and my story is done.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Medlock and Shanklin took place in due time, and among the\r\nwitnesses the most important, but the most reluctant, was Reginald\r\nCruden.  It was like a hateful return to the old life to find himself\r\nface to face with those men, and to have to tell over again the story of\r\ntheir knavery and his own folly.  But he went through with it like a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners, who were far more at their ease than the witness,\r\ntroubled him with no awkward cross-examination, and when presently the\r\njury retired, he retired too, having neither the curiosity nor the\r\nvindictiveness to remain and hear their sentence.\r\n\r\nOn his way out a familiar voice accosted him.\r\n\r\n"Cruden, old man, will you shake hands?  I\'ve been a cad to you, but I\'m\r\nsorry for it now."\r\n\r\nIt was Blandford, looking weak and pale, with one arm still in a sling.\r\n\r\nReginald took his proffered hand eagerly and wrung it.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been bitten over this affair, as you know," continued Blandford,\r\n"and I\'ve paid up for my folly.  I wish I could come out of it all with\r\nas easy a conscience as you do, that\'s all!  Among them all I\'ve lost a\r\ngood deal more than money; but if you and Horrors will take me back in\r\nyour set there\'ll be a chance for me yet.  I\'m going to University\r\nCollege, you know, so I shall be staying in town.  Harker and I will\r\nprobably be lodging together, and it won\'t be my fault if it\'s far away\r\nfrom your quarters."\r\n\r\nAnd arm in arm the old schoolfellows walked, with their backs on the\r\ndark past and their faces turned hopefully to the future.\r\n\r\nHad Reginald remained to hear the end of the trial, he would have found\r\nhimself the object of a demonstration he little counted on.\r\n\r\nThe jury having returned with their expected verdict, and sentence\r\nhaving been passed on the prisoners, the counsel for the prosecution got\r\nup and asked his lordship for leave to make one observation.  He spoke\r\nin the name of the various victims of the sham Corporation when he\r\nstated that his clients desired to express their conviction that the\r\nformer secretary of the Corporation, whose evidence that day had mainly\r\ncontributed to the exposure of the fraud, was himself entirely clear of\r\nany imputation in connection with the conspiracy.\r\n\r\n"I should not mention this, my lord," said the counsel, "had not a\r\ncertain magistrate, in another place, at an earlier stage of this\r\ninquiry, used language--in my humble opinion harsh and unwarranted--\r\ncalculated to cast a slur on that gentleman\'s character, if not to\r\ninterfere seriously with his future prospects.  I merely wish to say, my\r\nlord, that my clients, and those of us who have gone fully into the\r\ncase, and may be expected to know as much about it even as a north-\r\ncountry magistrate, are fully convinced that Mr Cruden comes out of\r\nthis case with an unsullied character, and we feel it our duty publicly\r\nto state our opinion to that effect."\r\n\r\nThe counsel sat down amid signs of approval from the Court, not unmixed\r\nwith amusement at the expense of the north-country magistrate, and the\r\njudge, calling for order, replied, "I make no objection whatever to the\r\nstatement which has just fallen from the lips of the learned counsel,\r\nand as it commends itself entirely to my own judgment in the matter, I\r\nam glad to inform Mr Cruden, if he be still in court, that he will quit\r\nit to-day clear of the slightest imputation on his character unbecoming\r\nan upright but unfortunate gentleman."\r\n\r\nReginald was not in court, but he read every word of it next day with\r\ngrateful and overflowing heart.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThree months have passed.  The winter has given way to spring, and\r\nNumber 3, Dull Street is empty.  Jemima Shuckleford still nurses her\r\nsorrow in secret, and it will be a year or two yet before the happy man\r\nis to turn up who shall reconcile her to life, and disestablish the\r\nimage of Reginald Cruden from her soft heart.  Meanwhile she and her\r\nmother are constant visitors at the little house in Highbury where the\r\nCrudens now live, and as often as they go they find a welcome.  Samuel\r\nwrites home from the country that he is doing great things, and expects\r\nto become Lord Chancellor in a few years.  Meanwhile he too contemplates\r\nmatrimony with a widow and four children, who will probably leave him\r\namong them very little leisure for another experiment in the amateur\r\ndetective business.\r\n\r\nThe Shuckleford ladies were invited, but unfortunately were unable to\r\ngo, to a little quiet house-warming given by the Crudens on the occasion\r\nof their taking possession of the new house.\r\n\r\nBut though they could not go, Miss Crisp could, and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, Mr Booms, in all the magnificence of last year\'s spring\r\ncostume.  And Waterford came too, and young Gedge, as did also the\r\nfaithful Harker, and--with some little trepidation--the now sobered\r\nBlandford.\r\n\r\nThe company had quite enough to talk about without having to fall back\r\non shouting proverbs or musical chairs.  Indeed, there were several\r\nlittle excitements in the wind which came out one by one, and made the\r\nevening a sort of epoch in the lives of most of those present.\r\n\r\nFor instance, young Gedge was there no longer as a common compositor.\r\nHe had lately been made, youth as he was, overseer in the room of Durfy;\r\nand the dignity of his new office filled him with sobriety and good-\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no fault of mine," said he, when Mrs Cruden congratulated him on\r\nhis promotion.  "If Cruden hadn\'t stood by me that time he first came to\r\nthe _Rocket_, I should have gone clean to the dogs.  I mean it.  I was\r\ngoing full tilt that way."\r\n\r\n"But I went off and left you after all," said Reginald.\r\n\r\n"I know you did; and I was sorry at the time you hadn\'t left that cab-\r\nhorse to finish his business the evening you picked me up.  But Horace\r\nhere and Mrs Cruden--"\r\n\r\n"Picked you up again," said Waterford.  "Regular fellow for being picked\r\nup, you are.  All comes of your habit of picking up types.  One of\r\nnature\'s revenges--and the last to pick you up is the _Rocket_.  What an\r\nappetite she\'s got, to be sure!"\r\n\r\n"I should think so from the way she swallows your and Horace\'s\r\nlucubrations every week," says Gedge, laughing.  "Why, I actually know a\r\nfellow who knows a fellow who laughed at one of your jokes."\r\n\r\n"Come, none of your chaff," said Horace, looking not at all displeased.\r\n"You never laughed at a joke, I know, because you never see one."\r\n\r\n"No more I do.  That\'s what I complain of," replied the incorrigible\r\nyoung overseer.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, we shall have our revenge when he has to put our joint\r\nnovel in print," said Waterford.  "Ah, I thought you\'d sit up there, my\r\nboy.  Never mind, you\'ll know about it some day.  The first chapter is\r\nhalf done already."\r\n\r\n"Jolly work that must be," says Harker.  "More fun than higher\r\nmathematics and Locke on the Understanding, eh, Bland?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they would be glad to change places with us before they are\r\nthrough with it, though," observes Blandford.\r\n\r\n"Never knew such a beggar for grinding as Bland is turning out," says\r\nHarker.  "He takes the shine out of me; and I\'m certain he\'ll knock me\r\ninto a cocked hat at the matric.."\r\n\r\n"You forget I\'ve lost time to make up," replies Blandford, gravely; "and\r\nI\'m not going to be content if I don\'t take honours."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t knock yourself up, that\'s all," says Reginald, "especially now\r\ncricket\'s beginning.  We ought to turn out a good eleven with four old\r\nWilderhams to give it a backbone, eh?"\r\n\r\nAnd at the signal the four chums somehow get together in a corner, and\r\nthe talk flies off to the old schooldays, and the battles and triumphs\r\nof the famous Wilderham Close.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Booms and Miss Crisp whisper very confidentially together in\r\nanother corner.  What they talk about no one can guess.  It may be\r\ncollars, or it may be four-roomed cottages, or it may be only the\r\nweather.  Whatever it is, Booms\'s doleful face relaxes presently into a\r\nsolemn smile, and Miss Crisp goes over and sits by Mrs Cruden, who puts\r\nher arm round the blushing girl and kisses her in a very motherly way on\r\nthe forehead.  It is a curious piece of business altogether, and it is\r\njust as well the four young men are too engrossed in football and\r\ncricket to notice it, and that Gedge and Waterford find their whole\r\nattention occupied by the contents of the little bookcase in the corner\r\nto have eyes for anything else.\r\n\r\n"Jolly lot of books you\'ve got," says Waterford, when presently the\r\nlittle groups break up and the big circle forms again.  "I always think\r\nthey are such nice furniture in a room, don\'t you, Mrs Cruden?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," says Mrs Cruden; "especially when they are all old\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"Some of these seem older friends than others," says Waterford, pointing\r\nto a corner where several unbound tattered works break the ranks of\r\ngreen-cloth gilt-lettered volumes.  "Look at this weatherbeaten little\r\nfellow, for instance, a bit of a _Pilgrim\'s Progress_.  That must be a\r\nvery poor relation; surely you don\'t count him in?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I," says Reginald, taking the book in his hands, and speaking in\r\na tone which makes every one look up at him.  "This little book is worth\r\nmore to me than all the rest put together."\r\n\r\nAnd as he bends his head over the precious little relic, and turns its\r\nwell-thumbed pages one by one, he forgets where he is, or who is looking\r\non.  And a tear steals into his eyes as his mind flies far away to a\r\nlittle green grave in the north country over which the soft breezes of\r\nspring play lovingly, and seem to whisper in a voice he knows and loves\r\nto remember--"Come there too, guv\'nor."\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Reginald Cruden, by Talbot Baines Reed\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK REGINALD CRUDEN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 21043.txt or 21043.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/0/4/21043/\r\n\r\nProduced by Nick Hodson of London, England\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
